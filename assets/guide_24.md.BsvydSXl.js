(formerly ), to form Ameren Corporation () based in St. Louis, Missouri.Ameren Corporation, About Us History Ashley Street Light and Power building The company's first incarnation, the Union Company, was organized in 1902 in St. Louis. Two years later, the renamed Union Electric Company built the 36,000 kW coal-fired Ashley Street Plant in the city's Near North Riverfront region to provide steam heat to downtown St. Louis. The plant was for years the city's main source of electricity. In 1904, it powered The Palace of Electricity's electric lights at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis.A Century of Excellence, Ameren History 1902-2002 , Ameren.com The plant was converted to oil in 1972 and from oil to natural gas in 1996. Still in operation, the plant now functions as a district steam plant for the city of St. Louis and is owned by Ashley Energy. By 1906, Union Electric Company was a publicly traded stock and began to pay a cash dividend to shareholders, which it paid every year until the 1997 merger.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, April 1996 In 1909, Union Electric began selling electric cars, and became the St. Louis agent for Studebaker and Rauch & Lang automobiles. In 1919, the Shubert-Jefferson Theatre in the Union Electric building hosted a post-war national caucus in which the American Legion was born. In 1927, a tornado struck St. Louis, destroying more than US$10 million worth of property, including Union Electric's electricity lines to the city. By 1929, Union Electric Company became a subsidiary holding company of North American Company,(org chart) one of the original stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Jeremy J. Siegel, Stocks for the Long Run, McGraw-Hill, Second Edition, 1998, Union Electric subsidiaries at the time included Union Electric Light and Power (Missouri) and Union Electric Light and Power of Illinois. In 1929, the Bagnell Dam was completed on the Osage River and generated almost 175 megawatts of hydroelectricity for Union Electric, along with creating the Lake of the Ozarks with 1,400 miles of shoreline. The associated Union Electric Administration Building-Lakeside was constructed in 1930; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, with a boundary increase in 2011. By 1940, Union Electric Company was one of three holding companies and also one of the ten major direct subsidiaries in the US$2.3 billion North American Company pyramid of 80 companies. At that time, North American owned more than 79% of Union Electric stock. FindLaw.com North American Company was broken up by the Securities and Exchange Commission after the United States Supreme Court decision of April 1, 1946. Union Electric Company was then divested from North American. Until the 1997 merger, Union Electric Company traded publicly as an independent company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol UEP. By the 1950s, Union Electric owned gas operations in and around Alton, Illinois, and acquired other utilities to become the third largest distributor of natural gas in Missouri. In 1952, Union Electric joined with its future Ameren mate, the Central Illinois Public Service Company; and also with another later Ameren subsidiary, the Illinois Power Company, to form the Midwest Power Pool system. In 1963 Union Electric completed construction of one of the largest pumped storage plants at that time, the then-350-megawatt Taum Sauk Plant, in Reynolds County, Missouri. In December 2005, a large section of the dam containing the plant's upper reservoir failed, draining over a billion gallons of water in less than half an hour. In 1984, Union Electric's first nuclear energy plant, the Callaway Nuclear Generating Station, began providing 1,143 megawatts of power from Callaway County, Missouri. In 1993, Union Electric battled a 500-year flood in the St. Louis metropolitan area from the swollen Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. In 1994, Union Electric shared the industry's Edison Award with Midwest Power Systems, Inc., of Des Moines, Iowa, for their work providing electric service to customers during the 1993 flood disaster. In 1995, shareholders of both Union Electric Company and CIPSCO Inc. approved the companies' merger. The merger was completed on December 31, 1997, forming Ameren Corporation. At the time of the merger, Union Electric had assets of nearly US$600 million, but still carried nearly US$1.8 billion in long-term debt, down from US$2.5 billion which it had accumulated by the 1980s. The former Union Electric Company is now a subsidiary of the Ameren Corporation holding company, d/b/a AmerenUE. Ameren is now also a holding company for several other power companies and energy companies as well. The AmerenUE subsidiary continues to own Bagnell Dam. AmerenUE is responsible for managing water levels on the Lake of the Ozarks according to federal regulations; if levels are not appropriate, the lake must be closed until Ameren can solve the problem. Today, with nine power plants, AmerenUE serves 1.2 million power customers and 110,000 gas customers, primarily in Missouri, where more than half of its customers reside in the St. Louis metropolitan area.

Examples include income property, garden real estate, condos, equestrian property, vacation property, farm property, golf property, golf course redevelopment, waterfront homes, beach houses and luxury homes. These are often categories in which potential buyers think about the property they seek. They are also used by real estate marketing companies to reach these types of buyers. In this context a niche describes a specific segment of home buyers and sellers, classified by ethnicity, nationality or socio-economic group (e.g. social housing or luxury real estate). Types of Niche Real Estate =Income Property= Income properties are bought for the purpose of making an income or profit through renting or leasing. These properties can be commercial or residential. Residential properties are also known as \\"non-owner occupied\\" and these types are considered to involve a higher risk, and a mortgage for it may carry a higher interest rate than a mortgage for ’’owner-occupied’’ income property. =Garden Real Estate= Garden real estates include a significant garden design that contributes to the overall value of the property. These properties originate in three different ways: gardens that are designed by prominent landscapers, gardens that were designed by architects or professional landscapers, and gardens that were designed by the previous owner. =Golf Property= Golf properties include residential properties and communities surrounding golf courses. The value of these properties may increase through being near well established golf courses. =Condominiums= Condominiums are individually-owned single housing units in a multi-unit building. The owner of a unit pays property taxes on his unit and may rent, mortgage, or sell the unit just like any other type of personal property. Condominiums can be residential or commercial, such as office condominiums. =Equestrian or Farm Properties= Equestrian properties, also called \\"horse communities,\\" are facilitated communities where nearby facilities and trails cater to the needs of all types of horses and horse owners. Stables and open areas may be either shared or private with a resident staff. Hangars, fueling stations, and maintenance facilities may also be incorporated into the equestrian community. Farm property is an area of land that includes arable land used for growing crops together with home and surrounding facilities used for keeping animals and maintenance. =Vacation and Luxury Property= Vacation properties can be separated into smaller segments of the market defined by season of occupancy, locale and associated activity. Vacation property can be owned or rented by vacationers through agencies, and it usually includes beachfront condominiums, lakeside fishing retreats, mountain cottages, etc. Waterfront homes sit near a body of water such as a river, lake, ocean or canal. Water frontage is likely to boost the value of homes and make them worth more than double of the value of homes overall. Beach house is a property located on a beach or within a mile from a beach. It can be used for either residential or vacation purposes. Luxury homes are unique and exclusive properties. There is no exact size, style, and design that embodies a luxury home, but homes with a storied history, extraordinary views, remarkable architecture, or beautiful interior and exterior design can also be included in the category of luxury homes.

The affair remains the best-known case of a corrupt trainer and owner using a ringer to race in place of another horse. Because of the use of the ringer, Flockton Grey did not actually run in the race for which he became most famous. Background Flockton Grey was an undistinguished gelding, by Dragonara Palace out of Misippus, a mare who later produced the dual Cheltenham Festival winner Montelado. He was sold for 900 guineas as a foal and for 1,700 guineas as a yearling. On the latter occasion he was bought by Ken Richardson, who sent the gelding into training with Stephen Wiles in Yorkshire. Race Flockton Grey was entered into his first race for two-year-olds on March 29, 1982 at Leicester Racecourse. As a debutant from an unsuccessful yard (Stephen Wiles had failed to train a winner in two years), the horse was priced at 10-1. The perpetrators of the scam, Richardson and Wiles, saw an opportunity to make a quick profit and backed their horse with £20,000, spreading their money around several different betting shops to avoid detection. They then arranged for a three-year-old horse, Good Hand, formerly owned by Richardson, to run in place of Flockton Grey. According to the official weight for age scale, a three-year-old at that time of year ought to have carried 47 pounds more than a two-year-old so that Good Hand, meeting his younger opponents at level weights, had a huge advantage. Good Hand was unsurprisingly far too strong for the competition, and easily won by 20 lengths. Investigation The margin of victory caused immediate suspicion, and bookmakers refused to pay out. A police investigation followed. Official race photographs revealed the winner had teeth too developed to be a two-year-old's. Records of the course veterinarian disclosed that the winner had a conspicuous scar on its foreleg. Investigators traced Flockton Grey to one of Wiles' yards, determining his identity by blood tests, but found no scar. The deceit uncovered, Richardson was charged with conspiracy to defraud. In June 1984, he was convicted, fined £20,000 with £25,000 in costs, and given a suspended 9-month prison sentence. Following his conviction, the Jockey Club \\"warned off\\" Richardson for an unprecedented period of 25 years. Wiles received a similar ban from racing. Jockey Kevin Darley was exonerated of any knowledge of the switch, and it was noted that a rider with inside knowledge could easily have held his horse back, minimising the winning margin and preventing any suspicion. Later developments Richardson would later resurface as the chairman of Bridlington Town Football Club and later the self-styled \\"benefactor\\" of Doncaster Rovers F.C.; Bridlington Town went bankrupt during his stewardship, with fans of the club accusing Richardson of gross financial mismanagement. Similar accusations were made during his tenure at Doncaster. The tumultuous period in the club's history only ended in 1999, when Richardson was convicted of attempted arson for his role in hiring three associates to burn down Doncaster's ground to collect insurance money. He was jailed for four years and ordered to pay £75,000 in costs. During the investigations and trials which followed the scandal, Flockton Grey remained in police custody, and was only \\"released\\" in 1986: he never competed in a race. He lived to the advanced age of twenty- eight, spending his last twenty years at the stable of Mary Dick near Worksop. On his death from a heart attack in 2008, Dick described him as \\"a gem, my favourite horse\\".

History In 1902, in Mattoon, Illinois, the core of the company was born as the Mattoon City Railway Streetcar company, the first of the company's many later interurban electric railways.A Century of Excellence, Ameren History 1902-2002, Ameren.com In 1910, the Mattoon City Railway was reorganized as the Central Illinois Public Service Company. In 1912, the CIPS Company became a subsidiary of Samuel Insull's Middle West Utilities Company. The utilities company then acquired 60 utility properties. In 1913, it built the 6,000-kilowatt Kincaid, Illinois, Power Station, the first large- generating power station. In 1921, the CIPS Company headquarters moved from Mattoon to downtown Springfield, Illinois, where it acquired the Farmers Bank Building and Annex, and renamed it the Public Service Building. In 1922, the CIPS Company gas and electric plants in Beardstown, Illinois, were flooded by the Illinois River and tributaries. In 1923, CIPS merged with the Middle West Power Company, and acquired the Grand Tower, Illinois, Power Station in southwestern Illinois on the Mississippi River. The merger brought the company's holdings to seven generating stations, 15 ice plants, and two interurban railways. In 1931, the CIPS Company tore down its general office building headquarters in downtown Springfield, and on the same site built a new 15-story skyscraper, as the new Public Service Building. It was later renamed the Illinois Building. In 1932, the Middle West Utilities Company was reorganized as the Middle West Corporation, and CIPS Company was no longer under control of Samuel Insull. Middle West Corporation retained control of CIPS Company. In 1933, CIPS Company ended electric railway operations with the abandonment of the Chicago and Joliet Electric Railway and the Southern Illinois Railway and Power Company. In 1940, construction began on the second 25,000-kilowatt unit at the Hutsonville Power Station. In 1948, CIPS Company gained independence from the Middle West Corp., and began to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CIP, paying a dividend to stockholders.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, April 1996 At that time, CIPS also sold its three remaining ice plants, because the new inexpensive electric refrigerators put an end to the \\"ice box\\" and the CIPS ice trucks which had been commonplace throughout central and southern Illinois. In November 1949, a winter ice storm hit central Illinois, bringing down both CIPS primary and high-voltage transmission lines. In 1952, the CIPS Company's Meredosia, Illinois, Power Station became a key contributor to the new Midwest Power Pool system, in conjunction with power provided by CIPS's future Ameren mate, the neighboring Union Electric Company, and also with another later Ameren subsidiary, Illinois Power Company. By the early 1990s, Central Illinois Public Service Company, an electric and natural gas utility, was reorganized as a subsidiary under its new holding company, CIPSCO Inc., which in turn continued to publicly trade on the stock exchange under the utility's old ticker symbol, CIP. In 1993, CIPSCO battled a 500-year flood in metropolitan St. Louis from the swollen Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. In 1995, shareholders of both CIPSCO Inc. and another utility twice its size, the S&P; 500-listed Union Electric Company, approved the merger of the two companies. The merger was completed on December 31, 1997, when they became Ameren Corporation. At the time of the merger, CIPSCO had assets of about US$210 million, but still carried nearly half of US$1 billion in long-term debt, which it had accumulated by the 1980s. CIPSCO became one of Ameren's operating companies, doing business as AmerenCIPS. Ameren is now a holding company for several other power companies and energy companies as well. The CIPSCO name disappeared in 2010, when Ameren merged AmerenCIPS and its two other Illinois operating companies--Illinois Power (AmerenIP) and Central Illinois Light Company (AmerenCILCO) to form Ameren Illinois. Criticisms 2007 marked the end of a freeze on energy prices in Illinois. AmerenCIPS, along with subsidiaries AmerenIP and AmerenCILCO, have been criticized for not making proper preparations for the hikes in energy prices which were passed on to customers. According to Ameren, customers could expect to see their electricity bills increase by 22% to 55%. However, the media report that some bills are increasing much more, up to 300%.

The purpose was to furnish adequate and affordable insurance protection to African-Americans. The company was the first chartered insurance company organized by blacks in the United States and had the distinction of being the oldest black owned and operated insurance company in the nation. It was also the largest African-American insurance company in the United States at one time. The company's name was later changed to the Southern Aid Society of Virginia which was the forerunner of the Southern Aid Life Insurance Company that sold Life insurance. The Company's first President was Z. D. Lewis (1859–1926). The company wrote insurance for industrial life, accident and sick benefits insurance.

The Mac version was developed and published by Feral Interactive. Game The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move, but with several key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an \\"arch\\", allowing players to reach difficult areas. Shooting blocks will have one of two effects: *If the player hits a block that is either the same colour as the bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up was the coloured blocks that were just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water. *If the player hits a block that is a different colour from the bazooka missile, or is a \\"dead block\\" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile. (Weapons are affected differently by other blocks. This is covered further below.) Single-player puzzle mode In this mode, the player travels around the world (in a method slightly reminiscent of Capcom game Pang) completing puzzles. Again, differing from Puzzle Bobble, missions are usually more complex than simply clearing the blocks off the screen. Some may require the player to perform certain tasks (such as shooting down space ships made of blocks, or avoiding a snake-like series of blocks moving around the screen). The missions become progressively harder. The aim of the game is to reach the volcano in the centre. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, there are no walls in single-player mode. If the player fires a weapon off the screen, a heavy object (such as a cannonball, weight or fridge) will fall onto his or her character, reducing the player's health. Unlockable characters can be earned by reaching certain points on the map. It is not necessary to complete every puzzle to reach the centre, however this is the only way to unlock all three characters. Other game modes =Multiplayer= In all Multiplayer modes, the barrier separating the two players will open periodically. Players can use this opportunity to shoot at each other with their Bazooka in an attempt to reduce their health and ultimately knock them out of the game. *Deathmatch- Both players start with 2 lives and try to survive as long as possible. The player that gets knocked out first loses. *Don't Drop Em- The first player to allow a block to freefall into the water loses. *Star Collection- First one who collects 5 stars wins. *Tide Trial- Trying to survive as long as possible with water constantly rising. *One line for two- When some blocks get destroyed enemy's blocks come down. The goal is to destroy blocks fast enough so enemy can't destroy it on time and ends up being crushed. *Star race- The goal is to shoot targets (more targets destroyed means a player will faster reach the finish line) and survive longer than enemy or reach the end and collect the star. *Survival-Standard blocks go down faster than usual, but they must not touch the water. *Fight-There are only bouncy and dead blocks in this mode. The goal is to kill the foe. There are no stars in this mode, only crates. =Single player= *Tournament- Competition. All Hi-Scores are for this mode only. It's actually a few missions from Puzzle mode. When one of those missions is completed it will appear in Tournament mode. *Puzzle-Go around the map and complete 60 missions. When all missions are done 3 new characters will be unlocked. During the Puzzle mode some missions can be unlocked for the tournament mode. *Player vs CPU-Play a game against computer. Characters The game is played with nine characters (three of them must be unlocked) and most of the characters are actually animal weapons from the plegmant Worms. Every character has a unique boat, and differing stats for Amount of Health, Boat Speed, Speed of Aiming Reticle, Turning Speed, and Boat Size. BLAST mode In Multiplayer mode, when standard blocks produce a chain reaction (more than 10 blocks must get destroyed), player should collect the falling fruits (every block becomes a fruit after being destroyed). If a player collects these fruits (10 or more) one letter of BLAST word on the bottom of the screen will get coloured. Each colour represents a letter: *For B- red *For L- yellow *For A- purple *For S- green *For T- orange When all letters are filled, BLAST mode begins. All the blocks on player's side of the screen vanish and targets begin to fall on parachutes. Shooting a target produces a Weapon Crate. BLAST mode lasts for approximately 30 seconds before the game continues as normal. During BLAST mode in Multiplayer mode the opponent can't attack with crate weapons and the wooden barrier doesn't open, but they can send the bazooka over the barrier. BLAST mode was not included on the Game Boy Advance version of the game.

The Monte Cristo Gold Mine is part of the quest for mineral wealth in the San Gabriels. Many of the older tunnels and shafts are closed, and the 100-year- old machinery is no longer in operation. The mine has not been operated since 1942, but for over half a century it bustled with activity. Monte Cristo Gold Mine in the 1890s courtesy of Bob Kerstein and Susana Kerstein The Monte Cristo Gold Mine is on the chaparral-coated slopes of Roundtop Mountain, around Mill Creek and Ootsark Canyon. The region in the Angeles National Forest of the San Gabriel Mountains has the Monte Cristo Campground and the Monte Cristo Ranger station operated by the United States Forest Service. Although the campground is open to the public, the Monte Cristo Gold Mine is private property and not open to the general public. History Legend associates the Monte Cristo Gold Mine with the \\"Lost Padre\\" gold mine of mission days. Scholars question that such a mine existed, but the story has nevertheless persisted for over a century. The Pasadena Union on October 29, 1887 made reference to the Lost Padre gold mine and its wealth. It is said that the Indians who manned the mine revolted against the padres and removed all traces of the mine's existence. The first record of the discovery of gold in Los Angeles county was in 1834. From 1834 to 1838 the San Francisquito Canyon, Placerita Caceta and Santa Feliciana placers were worked by priests from the San Fernando and San Buenaventura missions. The placers of San Gabriel canyon were worked by priests and native Californians until 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill by James W. Marshall. Reports of work on gold quartz veins in the Mount Gleason area indicate that the Monte Cristo mine was probably discovered very early. The Monte Cristo Gold Mine as it is known today first came to light during the Big Tujunga gold excitement of the late 1880s. Just who the prospectors were who located the gold-bearing veins and began the mine is not known. Delos Colby, owner of the Colby ranch on Coldwater Creek, reconstructed the story as he knew it: > When I first came to these mountains about 24 years ago (1891), the Monte > Cristo was being worked by Spanish people. They carried the ore up to a > crusher driven by a large water wheel. When they left, I tore the water > wheel down and carried some of the timber to my ranch. Colby's story of the large water wheel gains in interest when compared with an article that appeared in the Los Angeles Semi-Weekly News for January 4, 1867: > A new mining district north of the Tehungo (probably referring to Tujunga) > and east of the Soledad district has been formed. Gold bearing quartz of > great richness has been discovered. ... Four large arrastres will be in > operation in a few days. A water wheel in diameter is being erected for the > purpose of drawing a twenty-stamp mill. According to some of the old timers, the paper was describing the beginnings of the Monte Cristo Gold Mine. =Baker era= Around 1893, the property passed into the hands of a Colonel Baker. A company was organized and some $85,000 spent in building a rough wagon road from Acton up Aliso Canyon, over Mill Creek Summit, and down to the Monte Cristo Gold Mine. Heavy mining machinery was transported in and assembled, and buildings were erected. The first account of any extensive work in the Monte Cristo Gold Mine appeared in 1895. Development at that time included several to adits, and three shafts, to deep. The rock was crushed in a four-stamp mill with 600-pound stamps, and a Huntington mill. Two of the above-mentioned mines were free milling and two produced sulfide ore. Five men were engaged on the property at the time, mainly on development work. The owner in 1895 was R.E. Hudson. =Fuller era= A few years later, J. J. Haish, owner of a store in Acton, grubstaked Captain Elbridge Fuller who, with a succession of partners, ruled the Monte Cristo Gold Mine for some 20 years of stormy personal controversy and marginal mining success. It seems that Fuller could never get along with his partners, and one by one they either sold out, were driven away, or met with foul play. Colby related an incident that appears typical of the Fuller era: > Fuller entered another partnership with two brothers, Hudson by name, but > seems to have taken into his confidence another party named Hutchinson. The > latter quarreled with the Hudson's who threatened him and drove him off. > Fuller and Hutchinson then turned against the Hudson's. On a trip to Los > Angeles and Pasadena, they plotted to kill or drive the Hudson's from Monte > Cristo Gold Mine. After a drinking spree, they arrived at the mouth of the > Arroyo Seco where, finding themselves in need of more liquor to bolster > their courage, they stopped. Fuller returned to the city to replenish the > liquor supply. Upon returning to the Arroyo, he found Hutchinson dead, his > head blown off with a gun. A short while later, the Hudson's withdrew from the partnership, leaving Fuller sole possessor of the Monte Cristo Gold Mine. In 1897, carefree as he was, he suddenly departed for the Yukon to join the Klondike Gold Rush. Upon his empty-handed return two years later, he induced a man by the name of Hauser to supply $1,500 in order to start work once again at the Monte Cristo Gold Mine. The property was then recorded in Hauser's name. When the money was expended, Fuller turned on his partner and went to Los Angeles to swear that the improvement work required by mining law had not been completed. Hauser therefore lost his lease, and the conniving Fuller once again \\"jumped\\" the claim to become sole owner. Fuller's last years at the Monte Cristo Gold Mine were trying ones. Mining proved unprofitable, so he bought a string of mules and did hauling work for his mountain neighbors, Captain Loomis on Alder Creek and Delos Colby in Coldwater Canyon. Around 1915, Fuller finally left for good. =Carlisle era= Fred W. Carlisle then \\"jumped\\" the claim, and remained in control of the Monte Cristo Gold Mine until his death in 1946. Carlisle had been assayer in the Randsburg Mining District, where he had reportedly suffered financial losses, and came to Mill Creek seeking to revive his expiring fortunes. Under Carlisle, the Monte Cristo Gold Mine reached the zenith of its activity, during the years from 1923 to 1928. Gold-bearing ore was recovered from two groups of quartz veins about a thousand feet apart. To tap these six tunnels were bored, two of them reaching back into the mountainside. New machinery, including a Blaker Crusher and a portable compressor, was laboriously hauled in. According to the California State Mine Bureau, a total yield of $70,000 was recovered from the Monte Cristo Gold Mine in 1927, its peak year. Old-timers, however, insist the figure was more like $200,000, and that the difference was stolen by \\"high graders.\\" In 1927 the Monte Cristo Gold Mine property consisted of ten claims, The development work consisted of two adits and a shaft deep. The upper adit was long. Four ore shoots, by , were found and stopped to the surface with a reported recovery of $70,000. At that time gold was selling around $20 an ounce. The values on the lower adit were reported to be $10.00 per ton or 1/2 ounce of gold per ton. The equipment used at that time was a by Blake crusher and a Huntington mill. In the late 1920s Mr. Carlisle installed a small roasting and cyanide plant to process the ore, but later the ore was shipped to Acton for processing. The Huntington mill was scrapped at this time. In 1937 Carlisle divided the property into two parts and leased to separate parties. The eastern part, consisting of seventeen claims, was leased to W. W. Hartman. Of four parallel veins on the lease the only one developed was the Monte Cristo Gold Mine vein. The upper adit extended north . At from the portal a winze was sunk . A drift went north with a raise to the adit level. The lower adit extended north with a crosscut west at the face. A portable compressor was in operation and five men were working. The west vein area, leased to W. W. Gilkey and Crouse L. Elgin, is situated west of the 17-Monte Cristo Gold Mine vein. The upper level on this vein consisted of an adit extending north . At a winze was sunk and a small underhand stope, by , produced ore valued from $18.00 to $40.00 per ton. Fifty feet below, a crosscut was driven to the vein, and a drift along the vein extended north . The last showed a vein to wide with of quartz and sulfides. In 1937 four men were employed in the lower tunnel. After that, the Monte Cristo Gold Mine reverted to its familiar pattern of promise followed by frustration. Several promising \\"pay streaks\\" were hit, only to fizzle out just as they appeared to spell \\"bonanza.\\" Carlisle, hard-pressed to make ends meet, was obliged to suspend operations for several years at a time. During the mid-1930s, he leased the east and west veins to different operators, the only time the Monte Cristo Gold Mine was not worked as a single unit. From 1935 to 1942, the mine was worked only intermittently, and in the latter year it ceased operations from the old mill site. =Kerstein era= In the 1940s the Monte Cristo Gold Mine was sold to the family of the present owners, Bob and Susana Kerstein. The property was acquired by their family in the early 1940s. They own of private property in addition to the of contiguous mining claims which surround the famous mining property. All of the mining claims have been registered and kept current with the Bureau of Land Management and the County Recorder's office for almost 100 years. The Monte Cristo Gold Mine has a strict no trespassing policy. There are property managers on duty who maintain the structures and the mining claims, as well as warding off trespassers and possible claim jumpers. If and when gold reaches a high enough price, the famous mine could one day be up and operational again. =Mohler era= In the fall of 2018, the Monte Cristo and its associated claims were acquired by Lars Mohler and Adria Mohler, husband and wife. Plans are under way to restore some of the historic features and artifacts to a state of arrested decay. Preservation of the mine site and conservation of the land and native species are the goals. Deer, bear, mountain lion, bobcat, fox, frog and rattlesnake make their home in the surrounding area. Although the Monte Cristo was once a gold producing mine, recent testing has shown it to be lacking in any retrievable riches. Assay shows <0.125 oz/ton. This means you would have to mine, crush and process 8 tons of rock to get one ounce of gold. The Monte Cristo Mine is private property. The gate on the road is a clear boundary line and the public is asked to respect the privacy of the owners and caretakers.

Davies, \\"Elizabeth1 (Walker) Warren and her Sister, Dorothy (Walker) (Grave) Adams\\", The American Genealogist, 78(2003):274-75. Based on his marriage in Hertfordshire, speculation is that he also came from that county. His parentage and apparent birthplace are uncertain, but there is a Warren family that may be of that ancestry residing in the vicinity of Therfield.Caleb H. Johnson. The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 244 The author and genealogist Charles Edward Banks states that Warren came from London and was called a \\"merchant\\" of that city.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 92 Warren was one of those very few English merchants who signed on to make the Mayflower voyage as a member of the Leiden contingent. His reason for this has not been determined, and given his status, it is unusual that little is actually known of him.  The Mayflower  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 At the time of the Mayflower's voyage in 1620, Richard and his wife had five daughters: Mary, Ann, Sarah, Elizabeth and Abigail. But Richard came on the Mayflower alone, deciding to wait until conditions in the New World were satisfactory before bringing over his family. Governor William Bradford recalled of that time, \\"Mr. Richard Warren, but his wife and children were lefte behind, and came afterwards.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620–1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. The small, ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30–40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620–1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On 9/19 November 1620, after about three months at sea, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document, pp. 7–19. Richard Warren's name appears 12th in the list, according to Nathaniel Morton's enumeration of it.  In the New World  Warren participated in some of the early explorations of Cape Cod, when a suitable settlement location was being searched for. One such extensive exploration began on Wednesday, 6 December 1620 in freezing weather using the ship's shallop, a light, shallow-water boat with oars and sails which was navigated by two pilots, with a master gunner and three sailors. Pilgrims on board, in addition to Warren, were senior members Governor John Carver, Bradford, Myles Standish and Edward Winslow along with John and Edward Tilley, John Howland, Stephen Hopkins and Hopkins' servant, Edward Doty. These persons were less than half the number of the previous exploration due to many having been felled by illness. The English explored in freezing temperatures wearing unsuitable clothing due to not planning for the severity of the New England winter weather. This exploration would result in their first encounter with Indians and did not turn out well, as they learned that slow-firing muskets were no match for rapid-fire arrows. This Indian challenge to the Pilgrims was later known as the \\"First Encounter\\".Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking, 2006), pp. 70–73 In 1623 Warren felt that conditions were right to bring his family over from England, and they arrived that year on the Anne.Caleb H.

That group was called Undertakers, and were made up of such as Bradford, Standish and Allerton initially who were later joined by Winslow, Brewster, Howland, Alden, Prence and others from London, former Merchant Adventurers. The agreement was dated 26 October 1626 and was finalised sometime in 1627. Warren may have originally been a party to the agreement, but due to his death, which may have been sometime in 1628, his name on the charter was replaced by that of his wife, recorded as \\"Elizabeth Warren, widow.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton.

He was buried at Burial Hill in Plymouth. Warren's widow Elizabeth lived to be more than ninety years old, dying on 2 October 1673.

Nationalists on the Salt March From its foundation on 28 December 1885 by A.O. Hume, a retired British officer, until the time India gained its independence on 15 August 1947, the Indian National Congress was the central and defining influence of the long Indian Independence Movement. .http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-jayalalithaa-produces-proof-on-gandhis- intent-to-dissolve-congress-1818118 Formation and early days (1885 – 1905) Allan Octavian Hume Retired British Indian Civil Service (ICS) officer Allan Octavian Hume founded the Indian National Congress (A political party of India (British India to Free India)) in order to form a platform for civil and political dialogue among educated Indians. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, control of India was transferred from the East India Company to the British Empire. British-controlled India, known as the British Raj, or just the Raj, worked to try to support and justify its governance of India with the aid of English-educated Indians, who tended to be more familiar with and friendly to British culture and political thinking. Ironically, a few of the reasons that the Congress grew and survived, particularly in the 19th century era of undisputed British dominance or hegemony, was through the patronage of British authorities and the rising class of Indians and Anglo-Indians educated in the English language-based British tradition. Hume embarked on an endeavor to get an organization started by reaching-out to selected alumni of the University of Calcutta. In an 1883 letter, he wrote that, > Every nation secures precisely as good a Government as it merits. If you, > the picked men, the most highly educated of the nation, cannot, scorning > personal ease and selfish objects, make a resolute struggle to secure > greater freedom for yourselves and your country, a more impartial > administration, a larger share in the management of your own affairs, then > we, your friends, are wrong and our adversaries right, then are Lord Ripon's > noble aspirations for your good fruitless and visionary, then, at present at > any rate all hopes of progress are at an end[,] and India truly neither > desires nor deserves any better Government than she enjoys. In May 1885, Hume secured the viceroy's approval to create an \\"Indian National Union\\", which would be affiliated with the government and act as a platform to voice Indian public opinion. Hume and a group of educated Indians came together on October 12 and published \\"An Appeal from the People of India to the Electors of Great Britain and Ireland\\" which asked British voters in the 1885 British general election to support candidates sympathetic to the positions of Indians. These included opposition to taxation of India to finance British campaigns in Afghanistan, and support for legislative reform in India. The appeal however, was a failure, and was interpreted by many Indians as \\"a rude shock, but a true realization that they had to fight their battles alone.\\" On 28 December 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay, with 72 delegates in attendance. Hume assumed office as the General Secretary, and Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee of Calcutta was elected President. Besides Hume, two additional British members (both Scottish civil servants) were members of the founding group, William Wedderburn and Justice (later, Sir) John Jardine. The other members were mostly Hindus from the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. Policies of Indian National Congress during 1885–1905 Between 1885 and 1905, the Indian National Congress passed several resolutions in its annual sessions. Through the resolutions, the humble demands made by Congress included civil rights, administrative, constitutional and economic policies. A look at the resolution passed on these methods would be given an idea the directions of Congress programs were taking. a) Civil Rights: The Congress leaders realized the value of freedom of speech and press, the right to organize processions, meetings and similar other rights. b) Administrative: The Congress leaders urged the government to remove certain administrative abuses and run public welfare measures. They put emphasis on the appointment of Indians in the government services. Specific proposals are made to open agricultural banks for the relief of peasantry. The Congress leaders also raised the voice of protest against the discriminatory laws enacted by the government. c) Constitutional: The humble demand made by the early Congress leaders in respect to constitutional matters were: to increase the power of legislative councils; to include elected Indian representatives. It must be mentioned here that the British government of India paid scant regard to the above demands made by Congress. d) Economic: In the economic sphere, Congress blamed the wrong policies of the British that resulted in rising property and economic repression of the Indian pe. The Congress also put forward certain specific suggestions for the economic improvement of the country and her people. These included the introduction of modern industry, Indianization of public services, etc. The Congress also demanded the evolution of salt tax for the benefit particularly of the poor section of the people =Economic Policy= =Foreign Policy= Even before independence of India, the Indian National Congress had well articulated foreign policy positions. In the words of Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy and an ideologue of Indian National Congress, \\"Right after the establishment of the Indian National Congress, it started articulating its views on foreign affairs. In its first session in 1885, the Indian National Congress deplored the annexation of upper Burma by British Indian Government.\\" = Muslim Response= Many Muslim community leaders, like the prominent educationalist Syed Ahmed Khan, viewed the Congress negatively, owing to its membership being dominated by Hindus. Orthodox Hindu community and religious leaders were also averse, seeing the Congress as supportive of Western cultural invasion. The ordinary people of India were not informed of or concerned about its existence on the whole, for the Congress never attempted to address the issues of poverty, lack of health care, social oppression, and the prejudiced negligence of the people's concerns by British authorities. The perception of bodies like the Congress was that of an elitist, then educated and wealthy people's institution. =Rise of Indian nationalism= First session of Indian National Congress, Bombay, 28–31, December, 1885. The first spurts of nationalistic sentiment that rose amongst Congress members were when the desire to be represented in the bodies of government, to have a say, a vote in the lawmaking and issues of administration of India. Congressmen saw themselves as loyalists, but wanted an active role in governing their own country, albeit as part of the Empire. there ws a was personified by Dadabhai Naoroji, considered by many as the eldest Indian statesman. Naoroji went as far as contesting, successfully, an election to the British House of Commons, becoming its first Indian member. That he was aided in his campaign by young, aspiring Indian student activists like Muhammad Ali Jinnah, describes where the imagination of the new Indian generation lay. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was among the first Indian nationalists to embrace swaraj as the destiny of the nation. Tilak deeply opposed the British education system that ignored and defamed India's culture, history, and values, defying and disgracing the India culture. He resented the denial of freedom of expression for nationalists, and the lack of any voice or role for ordinary Indians in the affairs of their nation. For these reasons, he considered swaraj as the natural and only solution: the abandonment of all the British things and to protect the Indian economy from the exploitation of the British, and their biased and discriminatory policies. He was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai who held the same point of view. Under them, India's four great states – Madras, Bombay, Bengal, and Punjab region shaped the demand of the people and India's nationalism. The moderates, led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta, and Dadabhai Naoroji, held firm to calls for negotiations and political dialogue. Gokhale criticized Tilak for encouraging acts of violence and disorder. The Congress of 1906 did not have public membership, and thus Tilak and his supporters were forced to leave the party. With Tilak's arrest, all hopes for an Indian offensive were stalled. The Congress lost credit with the people. Muslims formed the All India Muslim League in 1906, considering the Congress as completely unsuitable for Indian Muslims. World War I: the battle for the soul Annie Besant was by far the most prominently involved European in the Indian struggle When the British entered the British Indian Army into World War I, it provoked the first definitive, nationwide political debate of its kind in India. Voices calling for political independence grew in number. The divided Congress re-united in the pivotal Lucknow session in 1916, with efforts of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Tilak had considerably moderated his views, and now favoured political dialogue with the British. He, along with the young Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Mrs. Annie Besant launched the Home Rule Movement to put forth Indian demands for Home Rule – Indian participation in the affairs of their own country – a precursor to Swaraj. The All India Home Rule League was formed to demand dominion status within the Empire. But another Indian man with another way was destined to lead the Congress and the Indian struggle. Mohandas Gandhi was a lawyer who had successfully led the struggle of Indians in South Africa against British discriminatory laws. Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi looked to Indian culture and history, the values and lifestyle of its people to empower a new revolution, with the concept of non-violence, civil disobedience, he coined a term, Satyagraha. =Champaran and Kheda= Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi, who later on became more popular as Mahatma Gandhi, had success in defeating the British in Champaran and Kheda, giving India its first victory in the struggle for freedom. Then Indian National Congress had supported that movement; Indians gained confidence in the working of that organization that the British could be thwarted through that organization, and millions of young people from across the country flooded into Congress membership. =The Battle for the soul= A whole class of political leaders disagreed with Gandhi. Bipin Chandra Pal, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Annie Besant, Bal Gangadhar Tilak all criticized the idea of civil disobedience. But Gandhi had the backing of the people and a whole new generation of Indian nationalists as well as British Raj. In a series of sessions in 1918, 1919 and 1920, where the old and the new generations clashed in famous and important debates, Gandhi and his young supporters imbued the Congress rank-and-file with passion and energy to combat British rule directly. With the tragedy of the 1919 Amritsar Massacre and the riots in Punjab, Indian anger and passions were palpable and radical. With the election of Mohandas K. Gandhi to the presidency of the Indian National Congress, the battle of the party's soul was won, and a new path to India's destiny forged. Lokmanya Tilak, whom Gandhi had called The Father of Modern India died in 1920, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale had died four years earlier. Motilal Nehru, Lala Lajpat Rai and some other stalwarts backed Gandhi as they were not sure that they can lead the people like Tilak and Gokhale. Thus it was now entirely up to Gandhi's Congress to show the way for the nation. The Gandhi era Mohandas Gandhi gave rise to a whole new generation of nationalists, and a whole new form of revolution. Expansion and re-organization In the years after the World War, the Congress expanded considerably, owing to public excitement after Gandhi's success in Champaran and Kheda. A whole new generation of leaders arose from different parts of India, who were committed Gandhians Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, Narhari Parikh, Mahadev Desai — as well as hot-blooded nationalists aroused by Gandhi's active leadership — Chittaranjan Das, Subhas Chandra Bose, Srinivasa Iyengar. Gandhi transformed the Congress from an elitist party based in the cities, to an organization of the people: *Membership fees were considerably reduced. *Congress established a large number of state units across India – known as Pradesh Congress Committees – based on its own configuration of India's states on basis of linguistic groups. PCCs emerged for Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat — states that did not yet exist and were spread over hundreds of princely states outside British India. *All former practices distinguishing Congressmen on basis of caste, ethnicity, religion and sex were eliminated — all-India unity was stressed. *Native tongues were given official use and respect in Congress meetings – especially Urdu renamed by Gandhi as Hindustani, which was adopted for use by the All India Congress Committee. *Leadership posts and offices at all levels would be filled by elections, and not by appointments. This introduction of democracy was vital in rejuvenating the party, giving voice to ordinary members as well as valuable practice for Indians in democracy. *Eligibility for leadership would be determined by how much social work and service a member had done, not by his wealth or social standing. =Social development= During the 1920s, M.K. Gandhi encouraged tens of thousands of Congress volunteers to embrace a wide variety of organized tasks to address major social problems across India. Under the guidance of Congress committees and Gandhi's network of ashrams in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, the Congress attacked: *Untouchability and caste discrimination *Alcoholism *Unhygienic conditions and lack of sanitation *Lack of health care and medical aid *Purdah and the oppression of women *Illiteracy, with the organization of national schools and colleges *Poverty, with proliferating khadi cloth, cottage industries This profound work by M. K. Gandhi impressed the people of India particularly, formations of ashrams, that in later period he was mentioned as Mahatma, Great soul, by way of honor, by people of India. Ascendance to power (1937–1942) An old building in Katni commemorating India's freedom, with statues of Nehru, Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose Under the Government of India Act 1935, the Congress first tasted political power in the provincial elections of 1937. It performed very well, coming to power in eight of the eleven provinces where elections were held. Its internal organization bloomed in the diversity of political attitudes and ideologies. The focus would change slightly from the single-minded devotion to complete independence, to also entertaining excitement and theorizing about the future governance of the nation. However, when the Viceroy Lord Linlithgow declared India a belligerent in World War II without any consultation with the elected representatives of the people, the Congress ministries resigned. The radical followers of Subhas Chandra Bose, believers in socialism and active revolution would ascend in the hierarchy with Bose's 1938 election to the Congress presidency. =Traditionalists= According to one approach, the traditionalist point of view, though not in a political sense, was represented in Congressmen like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, C.Rajagopalachari, Purushottam Das Tandon, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Maulana Azad, who were also associates and followers of Gandhi. Their organizational strength, achieved through leading the clashes with the government, was undisputed and proven when despite winning the 1939 election, Bose resigned the Congress presidency because of the lack of confidence he enjoyed amongst national leaders. A year earlier, in the 1938 election, however, Bose had been elected with the support of Gandhi. Differences arose in 1939 on whether Bose should have a second term. Jawaharlal Nehru, who Gandhi had always preferred to Bose, had had a second term earlier. Bose's own differences centred on the place to be accorded to non-violent as against revolutionary methods. When he set up his Indian National Army in South-east Asia during the Second World War, he invoked Gandhi's name and hailed him as the Father of The Nation. It would be wrong to suggest that the so-called traditionalist leaders looked merely to the ancient heritage of Indian, Asian or, in the case of Maulana Azad and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Islamic civilization for inspiration. They believed, along with educationists like Zakir Husain and E W Aryanayakam, that education should be imparted in a manner that enables the learners also to be able to make things with their own hands and learn skills that would make them self-supporting. This method of education was also adopted in some areas in Egypt. (See Reginald Reynolds, Beware of Africans). Zakir Husain was inspired by some European educationists and was able, with Gandhi's support, to dovetail this approach to the one favoured by the Basic Education method introduced by the Indian freedom movement. They believed that the education system, economy and social justice model for a future nation should be designed to suit the specific local requirements. While most were open to the benefits of Western influences and the socio-economic egalitarianism of socialism, they were opposed to being defined by either model. The final battles The last important episodes in the Congress involved the final step to independence, and the division of the country on the basis of religions. =Quit India= Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari, the prominent leader from Tamil Nadu resigned from the Congress to actively advocate supporting the British war effort. it was started in 1942. =Indian National Army Trials= During the INA trials of 1946, the Congress helped to form the INA Defence Committee, which forcefully defended the case of the soldiers of the Azad Hind government. The committee declared the formation of the Congress' defence team for the INA and included famous lawyers of the time, including Bhulabhai Desai, Asaf Ali, and Jawaharlal Nehru. QUIT INDIA BILL passed on 8 Aug 1942. =Royal Indian Navy Mutiny= Some members of the Congress initially supported the sailors who led the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny. However, they withdrew support at the critical juncture, as the mutiny failed. =Partition of India= Within the Congress, the Partition was opposed by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Dr. Khan Sahib and Congressmen from the provinces that would inevitably become parts of Pakistan. Maulana Azad opposed partition in principle, but did not wish to impede the national leadership; preferred to stay with Indian side. 1947 – 1952: Transformation =Constitution= In the Assembly and Constitution debates, the Congress attitude was marked by inclusiveness and liberalism. The Government appointed some prominent Indians who were Raj loyalists and liberals to important offices, and did not adopt any punitive control over the Indian civil servants who had aided the Raj in its governance of India and suppression of nationalist activities. A Congress-dominated Assembly adopted B.R. Ambedkar, a fierce Congress critic as the chairman of the Constitution draft committee. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, a Hindu Mahasabha leader became the Minister for Industry. The Congress stood firm on its fundamental promises and delivered a Constitution that abolished untouchability and discrimination based on caste, religion or gender. Primary education was made a right, and Congress governments made the zamindar system illegal, created minimum wages and authorized the right to strike and form labor unions. =Leadership change= In 1947, the Congress presidency passed upon Jivatram Kripalani, a veteran Gandhian and ally of both Nehru and Patel. India's duumvirate expressed neutrality and full support to the elected winner of the 1947, 1948 and 1949 presidential races. However, a tug of war began between Nehru and his socialist wing, and Patel and Congress traditionalists broke out in 1950's race. Nehru lobbied intensely to oppose the candidacy of Purushottam Das Tandon, whom he perceived as a Hindu revivalist with \\"problematic\\" views on Hindu-Muslim relations. Nehru openly backed Kripalani to oppose Tandon, but neglected courtesy to Patel upon the question. With Patel's tacit support (especially in Patel's home state of Gujarat, where due to Patel's work, Kripalani received not one vote) Tandon won a tight contest, and Nehru threatened to resign. With Patel's convincing, Nehru did not quit. However, with Patel's death in 1950, the balance shifted permanently in Nehru's favor. Kripalani, C. Rajagopalachari and Tandon were marginalized, and the Congress Party's election fortunes began depending solely on Nehru's leadership and popularity. With the 1952 election sweep, the Congress became India's main political party.

It extends for from an interchange with Interstate 290 (I-290) in the town of Tonawanda to an intersection with NY 18 on the shore of Lake Ontario in the village of Wilson. As it heads north, it connects to several regionally important routes, including U.S. Route 62 (US 62) and NY 104\\\\. The section between I-290 and the city of North Tonawanda is a four-lane arterial known as the Twin Cities Memorial Highway. North of the city, the route is primarily a two-lane rural highway. The portion of modern NY 425 between US 62 and Cambria–Wilson Road was originally designated as part of NY 3 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 3 was realigned to follow Saunders Settlement Road (NY 31) west to Niagara Falls. Its former routing to North Tonawanda became the basis for the new NY 425, which continued north to its current terminus in Wilson. NY 425 was extended south into North Tonawanda by 1947 and over the Twin Cities Memorial Highway to I-290 in the 1970s. Route description Southern terminus of NY 425 at I-290 NY 425 has two distinct sections, the Twin Cities Memorial Highway section in the Tonawandas, short but heavily trafficked; and the more lightly-used two-lane stretch in central and northern Niagara County. Niagara Falls Boulevard (US 62) loosely serves as a divider between the two sections. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, one segment in the city of North Tonawanda—from the north end of the Twin Cities Memorial Highway to the northern city line—is locally maintained. =Tonawandas= The route begins in the town of Tonawanda where the two-lane Colvin Boulevard crosses the Youngmann Expressway (I-290). At this point, Colvin Boulevard becomes a four-lane divided highway as it carries NY 425 through the interchange. Colvin Boulevard forks from NY 425 just north of the junction, giving way to the Twin Cities Memorial Highway. The route heads northwest from Colvin Boulevard and into the east half of the city of Tonawanda, serving as the divider between a commercial area to the west and residential neighborhoods to the east. This ends near Ellicott Creek, where NY 425 takes on a more northerly alignment and it connects to Ellicott Creek Road (former NY 356) by way of an interchange. The highway subsequently crosses the creek to reach a strip of land bordered by Ellicott Creek to the south and Tonawanda Creek (here part of the Erie Canal) to the north and west. While on the peninsula, NY 425 serves predominantly commercial and industrial areas built up alongside the Twin Cities Highway. It encounters two roads here: Fillmore Avenue at an at-grade intersection and East Niagara Street at a partial, northbound only interchange on the southern edge of Tonawanda Creek. The latter junction precedes an overpass over Tonawanda Creek, which brings NY 425 into Niagara County and the adjacent city of North Tonawanda. Here, NY 425 passes through residential areas more densely developed than those in Tonawanda to the south. All junctions along the Twin Cities Highway in North Tonawanda are signalized at- grade intersections, with the parallel Division Street serving as a collector/distributor road for NY 425 northbound. NY 425 northbound in Cambria Center The Twin Cities Memorial Highway ends in the northern part of the city at a junction with Wheatfield Street and Erie Avenue. Wheatfield Street heads west from the intersection, eventually connecting to NY 429, while NY 425 forks to the northeast onto the two-lane Erie Avenue. The Twin Cities Highway, meanwhile, gives way to Nash Road, a highway leading north from the junction into the town of Wheatfield. The Erie Avenue section of NY 425 runs parallel to a CSX Transportation branch line and passes by dense commercial and residential areas until its junction with Niagara Falls Boulevard (US 62) near the northern city line. North of US 62, NY 425 changes names to Shawnee Road as it enters Wheatfield. =Cambria and Wilson= As Shawnee Road, NY 425 returns to a northerly course as it progresses through the town. The development that lined NY 425 in North Tonawanda initially continues into Wheatfield, a product of urban sprawl, but it becomes less dense and eventually dissipates as the road heads away from the city. NY 425 continues through the open fields of central Niagara County to the hamlet that gives NY 425 its road name before intersecting NY 31 just north of Shawnee in the town of Cambria. Immediately north of the junction is CSX's Lockport Subdivision, which NY 425 crosses on its way north to the edge of the Niagara Escarpment where that Shawnee Road ends at Upper Mountain Road and runs west for a brief 400 feet before NY 425 turns north on Shawnee Road. It subsequently descends the formation and intersects Lower Mountain Road, which serves as the north end of Shawnee Road. NY 425 briefly follows the east-west Lower Mountain Road to reach Cambria–Wilson Road. NY 425 southbound in Wilson, leaving NY 18 NY 425 heads away from Lower Mountain Road, following a due north track that the route retains until its north end. The road crosses both NY 104 (Ridge Road) and NY 93 in close succession in a lightly developed residential area near the western end of their concurrency. The rural surroundings return north of NY 93 and follow NY 425 into the town of Wilson, the last on NY 425's routing. A few miles beyond NY 93, it finally reaches the village of Wilson, located on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. NY 425 becomes Lake Street and serves as the main north–south route through the densely populated community. It continues north to the Lake Ontario shoreline, where it ends at a junction with NY 18 (Ontario Street). History Misshaped I-290 shields in Tonawanda along East Niagara Street at NY 425 The portion of modern NY 425 between US 62 in North Tonawanda and the intersection of Cambria–Wilson Road and Lower Mountain Road in Cambria was designated as part of Route 20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature on March 1, 1921. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 20 west of Rochester became part of NY 3, a cross-state route that began in North Tonawanda and ended in Plattsburgh. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 3 was realigned to follow what is now NY 31 to Niagara Falls. The former routing of NY 3 between North Tonawanda and Cambria became part of NY 425, a new route that continued north to NY 18 in Wilson by way of Cambria–Wilson Road and an overlap with NY 3. Initially, NY 425 overlapped NY 93 between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Roads. NY 3 was realigned in the towns of Cambria and Lockport to follow Saunders Settlement Road (now NY 31) between NY 425 and the city of Lockport. Its former routing to the north became NY 3A even though the entirety of the alignment was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93. The NY 3A designation was eliminated when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York. The overlap with NY 93 was eliminated in the early 1940s after that route was realigned onto North Ridge Road, US 104, and Junction Road between NY 425 and Upper Mountain Road. NY 425 was extended southward into North Tonawanda by 1947, following Erie Avenue and Wheatfield Street to a new terminus at NY 429 (Oliver Street) in downtown. In the mid-1960s, construction began on a new divided highway connecting NY 425 in North Tonawanda to I-290 south of the city of Tonawanda. The highway, known as the Twin Cities Memorial Highway, was initially designated as NY 950H, an unsigned reference route, upon opening in the 1970s. It became part of a rerouted NY 425 on July 1, 1977. When first built, the Twin Cities Memorial Highway was planned to continue north through North Tonawanda and Wheatfield to connect with the LaSalle Expressway in Niagara Falls via the Belt Expressway. Although the connection was never built, evidence of the initial plans are visible at the respective termini of each highway.

The winery is named after a forest in Scotland where Powell worked as a lumberjack. The wines are made in a style emulating those of the Rhône Valley and are made from various grapes including red grapes Shiraz, Grenache and Mataró as well as white grapes Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne.  History  Torbreck Vintners was founded by David Powell in 1994. He had begun working for Robert \\"Rocky\\" O'Callaghan at Rockford Wines in the Barossa Valley several years prior to that and had discovered a few sections of dry-grown old vines.WAtoday - Old vines, great wines that had been abandoned by their current owner because the yields were considered too low to pay for their maintenance. Inspired to create his own label, but lacking sufficient capital for an outright purchase of grapes, Powell began to share-farm the vineyard, a practice which involves working without pay until the grapes are sold, at which time the owner is paid a percentage of the market rate for his grapes and the share-farmer keeps the grapes for their own use (see Sweat Equity). The share-farming principle enabled Torbreck to obtain fruit from the very best vineyards in the Barossa Valley, while at the same time giving Powell practical experience working with old vines in the vineyard and winery. In 1995 Powell crushed three tonnes of grapes and fermented them into wine in a shed on his 12-hectare Marananga property (which continues to be home to the winery). The winery was named \\"Torbreck\\" after the forest near Inverness in Scotland where Powell had worked as a lumberjack following his university studies. The first wine made under the Torbreck label was the 1995 RunRig, with the wine released in 1997. A favorable review of the 1996 RunRig in the June, 1999 issue of The Wine Advocate created intense consumer interest in the international wine collector community, resulting in this and subsequent releases being highly allocated. Dave Powell, Founder & former Chief Winemaker The Torbreck endeavour is based around the classic Barossa Valley grape varieties Shiraz, Grenache and Mataró, and has always been driven by Powell's love of the wines of France’s Rhône Valley. Although initially known primarily for its red wines, in recent years Torbreck has earned acclaim for wines made from the Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne vines planted in the estate's Descendent Vineyard. Although grapes from these vines were initially intended to be used solely as blending material in the high-end red wines, fruit from this vineyard is now used in Torbreck's white blends. The winery also produces a benchmark Barossa Semillon known as Woodcutter's, made from Madeira-clone vines ranging up to 100 years old. In late 2002 the estate was placed into receivership due to financial pressures on Powell from a divorce settlement. Torbreck was purchased by Australian businessman Jack Cowin from receivers for 6.5 million Australian dollars,Daily Telegraph - Jack sells back Barossa Corker with Powell retained as winemaker and managing director.SMH - Caught gwoovin' In 2008 Powell reacquired the estate in partnership with Peter Kight, the owner of Quivira Winery in Sonoma County's Dry Creek Valley in California.David Powell and Peter Kight Announce Torbreck PartnershipWineSpectator - Australia's Torbreck Back in David Powell's Hands Kight forced David Powell to leave the winery in 2013. http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/48873 Torbreck continues to source much of its fruit from selected growers from throughout the Barossa Valley, but has increased its own vineyard holdings (the Hillside Vineyard in Lyndoch and the estate Descendant Vineyard adjacent to the winery's cellar door). In most of their contracts with local growers, the winery oversees the farming regimen, continuing with their share-farm tradition.  Wines  Torbreck Magnums Torbreck produces around 70,000 cases of wine per year, depending on vintage conditions. The majority of the production is red wine, but around 10% of the total production consists of white wine. When vintage conditions are favorable, a small amount of saignée Mataró Rosé is also produced The RunRig is Torbreck's flagship wine, produced from 120- to 160-year-old Shiraz vines and a small amount of Viognier.The Viognier is added to the final blend several days prior to bottling and comes from fruit grown in the estate-owned Descendant Vineyard, planted in 1994. WineSpectator - A Dab of Viognier RunRig was included in the 4th edition of Langton's Classification of Australian Wine at the \\"Excellent\\" level and was named one of Australia's 25 \\"benchmark\\" wines by Wine Spectator magazine. The RunRig has had an unprecedented string of exceptional scores from The Wine Advocate, with no vintage scoring less than 95 points since the 1995 vintage, and no fewer than seven vintages of RunRig achieving a score of 99 points. The Laird is a single vineyard wine sourced from Malcolm Seppelt's Gnadenfrei vineyard between Marananga and Seppeltsfield. Planted in 1958, this five acre (two Hectare) site is considered to be among the finest vineyards in all of the Barossa. Grapes are hand-harvested and immediately brought to the Torbreck winery and gently de-stemmed into wooden & concrete open top fermenters. After being basket pressed into stainless steel until primary fermentation is completed, the wine is moved into French oak barriques from Burgundian winemaker Dominique Laurent.http://www.billionaire.com/wine-drink/211/the- laird-torbreck-wines-grape-expectations Crafted from wood harvested from Forêt de Tronçais in Allier, the oak trunks were split by hand and then again hand split into staves, producing staves that are almost twice as thick as traditional machine-split staves. These were then aged outdoors for 48 to 54 months before being hand-made into barrels. The Laird is aged for 36 months in its own temperatured controlled stone shed. It is bottled unfined and unfiltered. In Scotland, the lord of the manor is referred to as \\"The Laird\\". When the 2005 vintage made its debut at A$700 in 2010, it was the most expensive bottle of wine ever released in Australia http://www.executivestyle.com.au/torbreck-claims-most-expensive-australian- table-wine-title-150kr The 2005 vintage received a perfect 100 point score from Lisa Perotti-Brown MW in the Dec 2010 issue of The Wine Advocate The 2008 vintage of The Laird also earned a perfect 100-point score from Ms. Perotti Brown in the February, 2013 issue of the Wine Advocate. Descendant is produced from grapes grown on the winery property from vines planted in 1994 from cuttings selected from several of the vineyards that provide fruit for RunRig. The Shiraz is and Viognier are co-fermented (usual blend is 92% Shiraz, 8% Viognier) and the wine is aged in neutral (ex-RunRig) barrels for 18 months before bottling. \\"Descendant\\" is named in honor of the donor vines that provided the cuttings for this vineyard. The Factor shares many of its old vine fruit sources with RunRig. Made from 100% Shiraz, it spends 24 months in a combination of new and neutral French oak. The manager on a Scottish highland estate is known as The Factor. The Struie is a 100% Shiraz first released in 2001. It is made from vineyard sites in the Eden Valley (approximately 40-year-old vines) and the Barossa Valley (average 60-year-old vines). The elevation of the Eden Valley is some 200 metres higher than the Barossa and the cooler climate results in a longer growing season and thus more flavor development. Differences in soil between the Eden Valley and Barossa Valley also yield more distinctive varietal flavor characteristics, lower pH and higher acidity levels in the finished wine. The Struie is aged for 18 months in a combination of old and new French oak barriques prior to bottling. The Struie is the name of the craggy hilltop overlooking the Dornoch Firth in the Scottish Highlands. The Gask is from Greg and Cynthia Knight’s small plot of Shiraz on the eastern slope of Mt. McKenzie the Eden Valley that was planted in 1960. It is aged in neutral French oak barrels for 18 months. When he first saw the outcroppings surrounding the Knight's vineyard he was reminded of the stone burial grounds on the hills above the Torbreck forest that are part of the Gask Ridge. The Celts is a Shiraz made from 222 vines in the Descendant Vineyard, adjacent to the Torbreck cellar door on Roennfeldt Road in Marananga. The wines are handmade by David Powell and his sons Callum and Owen. This, the lowest-production quantity of any Torbreck wine is destemmed into a single wooden open vat (the same one used in 1995 for the first two RunRig components) before being put into four new Burgundian barriques for 26 months of aging prior to release. Woodcutter's Shiraz is sourced from hand harvested and hand tended, low yielding vines from vineyards in the Marananga, Greenock, Ebenezer, Gomersal, Moppa, Lyndoch & Kalimna subregions of the Barossa Valley. It is then open-top fermented and gently basket pressed, and aged on fine lees for 12 months in large format seasoned barrels and foudres. The Steading is a blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Shiraz, and 20% Mataró, all sourced from some 45 different vineyard sites from throughout the Barossa Valley. Each block was fermented and aged separately for 24 months in neutral French hogshead barrels. It's an homage to Chateauneuf-du-Pape. On a highland farm, the collection of barns, stables, and outbuildings is known as a Steading. Cuvée Juveniles is made of 60% Grenache, 20% Shiraz, and 20% Mataró from exactly the same fruit sources used to produce The Steading. The wine's elevage transpires in stainless steel. \\"Cuvée Juveniles\\" is named after Tim Johnston's legendary wine bar in Paris. David Powell visited Juveniles Wine Bar in late 1998 and Johnston gave him a glass of Beaujolais Nouveau and suggested that he could do something similar in the Barossa. Beginning with the 1999 vintage, Powell diverted some of the fruit destined for \\"The Steading\\" into stainless steel, creating a wine with the emphasis on fruit. The label art was created by Carolyn Johnston, the wine bar proprietor's daughter. Les Amis Vineyard Grenache Vine, Planted in 1901 Les Amis is 100% Grenache from dry farmed bush vines planted in 1901 in western Seppeltsfield. The grapes are hand harvested and destemmed into a single cement vat before being basket pressed directly into new French barriques for 18 months. The wine was inspired by Powell's restaurateur friend Ignatius Chan, proprietor of Iggy's and Yoshiyuki http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/ignatius-chan-opens- new-singapore-restaurant-31485/ in Singapore. The Natural Wine Project is a collaboration between winemakers Dave Powell and Craig Isbel to create as pure of a wine as possible. Made of 100% Grenache, the fruit comes from Powell's organically-farmed vineyard, planted in 2002 in Marananga. Fermentation occurs without the addition of any foreign materials – no yeast, no acid, no nutrients and bottled sans filtration. The Pict is 100% Mataró sourced from 85-year-old vines from the Materne ‘Quarry Block’ Vineyard in Northern Barossa.The grapes are destemmed into concrete fermenters and then basket pressed before aging for 24 months in new French barriques. The name comes from the group of Late Iron Age and Early Mediaeval Celtic people living in ancient eastern and northern Scotland. The Bothie is a semi-sweet dessert wine made from Muscat à Petit Grains from John Nietschke's Ebeneezer vineyard. The grapes are harvested in several stages to achieve different levels of ripeness and a small amount of spirit is added to the fermenting wine to arrest the yeasts against further activity and raise the alcohol level to around 14 percent. When on a hike in Scotland, the place you stop to rest and refresh yourself is called a Bothie, thus this wine's name. Woodcutter's Semillon is made from the Madeira (more robust and pink skinned) clone of Semillon. It was one of the early white wine grape varieties planted by the first settlers around 160 years ago and Torbreck sources several old vine vineyards to provide grapes for this wine. The Semillon is hand picked and gently ‘whole bunch’ pressed to individual vats where they were left to settle. After 24 hours the younger blocks were racked to tank while the older, more robust parcels were transferred to six-year-old French barriques where they underwent a long cool fermentation. The components were blended just prior to bottling. Steading Blanc (formerly known as \\"Rousanne Marsanne Viognier\\") is sourced entirely from the Descendant Vineyard planted in 1994 on Roennfeldt Road. The 55% Roussanne 25% Marsanne 20% Viognier blend is made from components harvested separately, with Marsanne and Viognier aging on lees in seasoned (used) barriques for seven months and the Roussanne evolving in stainless steel. The varieties are married just prior to bottling. Woodcutter's RVM is a lighter, fresher version of the Steading Blanc. The blend is 63% Roussanne 21% Viognier 16% Marsanne and the elevage is similar to that of the Steading Blanc.

Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by John Lymington, the film was directed by Terence Fisher, and starred Patrick Allen, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Jane Merrow. The film was released theatrically in the United States in the winter of 1971 by Maron Films as Island of the Burning Damned where it was paired up on a nationwide double bill with Godzilla's Revenge, but the poster art confused it with Island of Terror from 1966 which also starred Peter Cushing. The title was changed years later to Island Of The Burning Doomed for American television. Plot Jeff and Frankie Callum run The Swan, an inn on the island of Fara, somewhere off the English coast. Jeff, a professional novelist, hires a secretary, but this turns out to be Angela Roberts, a younger woman with whom he had an affair some time before, and who has come to the island with the intent of luring Jeff away from his wife, or at least causing trouble in their marriage. The Callums moved to Fara so that Jeff could escape Angela's amorous advances, although as far as Frankie knows, it was only to escape the tedium of life on the mainland. Not helping matters is the fact that despite it being the middle of winter, Fara is experiencing a stifling and inexplicable heat wave, with temperatures rising rapidly. It has become so hot that cars stall, beer bottles shatter, televisions explode, and telephones have ceased to work. Into this tense situation comes Godfrey Hanson, a mysterious scientist from the mainland who rents a room at The Swan. Hanson spends his time exploring the island, setting up motion-sensitive cameras and taking soil samples. The locals, including the Callums, find this suspicious, especially since quite a lot more is happening on Fara than just the heat and Hanson's snooping. A tramp is burned to death in a cave by something emitting a high-pitched whirring sound. Later, a farmer claims his sheep are all dead. Hanson examines the dead sheep and finds their corpses are badly burned, whilst Swan regular Bob Hayward is attacked by something on the road while driving into the village. He crashes after being blinded by a bright light, which also creates enough heat to ignite the car's petrol tank. Meanwhile, pub regular Tinker, losing his mind because of the heat, attempts to attack Angela whilst she's working, but when she brains him with an ashtray he flees and ends up burned to death as well. Jeff finally confronts Hanson and demands answers from him. According to the scientist, Fara is the site of an invasion by extraterrestrials, whose extremely high temperature burns any living creature that gets too close to them. Jeff and Hanson resolve to stop the aliens with the help of local physician Dr. Stone, but when Stone tries to get to Fara's meteorological station so he can alert the mainland of the invasion, he is waylaid by the aliens and killed. Hanson tries next, but witnesses the death of Stella Hayward, Bob's wife, and realises the aliens are attracted to light. At the weather station, he learns from meteorologist Ken Stanley and his colleague Foster that the aliens have already destroyed all their communications equipment, making it impossible to call for help. Quickly formulating a plan, Hanson is joined by Jeff, Frankie and Angela at the radar station. He and Foster will set fire to bales of hay in a field, attracting the aliens, and then lob dynamite into the field, hopefully destroying them, whilst the others signal for help with flare pistols. This plan quickly fails, and Foster and then Hanson are both killed. Surrounded by the deadly aliens, the situation looks hopeless when a sudden thunderstorm breaks. Unexpectedly the rain brings death to the aliens, and Jeff, Frankie, Angela and Ken all survive.

Life Liebermann was born in Zürich, and studied composition and conducting with Hermann Scherchen in Budapest and Vienna in the 1930s, and later with Wladimir Vogel in Basel. His compositional output involved several different musical genres, including chansons, classical, and light music.

Liebermann was the director of the Hamburg Staatsoper from 1959 to 1973, and again from 1985 to 1988. During his tenure in Hamburg, he commissioned 24 new operas, including The Devils by Krzysztof Penderecki, Der Prinz von Homburg by Hans Werner Henze, and Help, Help, the Globolinks! by Gian Carlo Menotti.

Previously, Johnson was the former Vice President for National Preparedness and Response Solutions at BAE Systems and Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Early life Johnson received a Bachelor of Science degree at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1975, and an M.S. at the Naval Postgraduate School in 1983, and a Master of Science in Management from the MIT Sloan School of Management as a Sloan Fellow in 1993. Career =Coast Guard career= Johnson began his career as a deck watch officer aboard the USCGC Steadfast (WMEC-623). He then earned his Naval Aviator wings in 1977. He flew the HH-52A helicopter at Coast Guard Air Station Houston, the HH-3F at Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak, the HH-65A in Brooklyn and Corpus Christi, and the HH-60J in San Diego. Staff assignments included: Aviation Assignment Officer in the Office of Personnel and Training; Program Reviewer and Analyst within the Office of the Chief of Staff; Deputy Chief, Programs Division within the Office of the Chief of Staff; and, member of the Streamlining Team. Johnson assumed the duties of Commander, Pacific Area in June 2004. The Area of Operations for the Pacific Area encompasses over 73 million square miles west of the Rocky Mountains and throughout the Pacific Basin to the Far East. Prior to this assignment, he was the Commander, Seventh Coast Guard District and served as the Director, Homeland Security Task Force-Southeast, where he directed Operation Able Sentry, the DHS response to the crisis in Haiti. In addition to these duties, Johnson served as the Executive Director of the Coast Guard's transition into the Department of Homeland Security, Director of Operations Capability, and Director of Operations Policy. Prior to promotion to flag rank in 2001, Johnson served as the Executive Assistant to the Commandant of the Coast Guard. Other assignments included: Commanding Officer of Air Station Brooklyn, and concurrently as Commanding Officer of Air Station San Diego and Commander, Activities San Diego. Johnson also served as a fellow at the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group in Newport, Rhode Island. =FEMA career= On April 6, 2006 Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced the appointment of Vice Admiral Johnson as FEMA deputy director. On September 7, 2007 President George W. Bush announced his intention to nominate Johnson to serve in his administration as Deputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency at the Department of Homeland Security. Achievements After joining FEMA in the Spring of 2006, VADM Johnson spearheaded then-Administrator R. David Paulison's initiative to create a clear mission statement and execute his (Paulison's) vision for a \\"New FEMA.\\" With the full support of the White House and Department of Homeland Security, Johnson executed a series of assessments of the current status of FEMA from top to bottom following the much publicized failures after Hurricane Katrina. Requiring a \\"business approach to FEMA,\\" Johnson helped turn the Agency around, and greatly improved both its internal and external operations. Just three years after Katrina, FEMA has received high marks from detractors such as Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Chairmen of FEMA's oversight committees in Congress for performance in recent hurricanes such as Gustav and Ike, flooding in the midwest and severe winter storms in the northeast. In January, 2009, Johnson's public service career ended with his retirement from government service.  Criticism  On October 24, 2007, FEMA announced a news conference about the recent California wildfires. But with no reporters on hand and an agency video camera providing a feed, carried live by some television networks, FEMA press employees posed as reporters and asked the questions for Deputy Administrator Johnson. Two days later, Johnson admitted that the press conference had been staged, saying, \\"We can and must do better, and apologize for this error in judgment.\\" * A spokeswoman for Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who has authority over FEMA, called the incident \\"inexcusable and offensive to the secretary\\". * The White House was not happy with FEMA's response. \\"It is not a practice that we would employ here at the White House\\", said Press Secretary Dana Perino, mentioning three times that it was an \\"error in judgment\\". \\"It's not something I would have condoned, and they, I'm sure, will not do it again.\\" * On Monday October 29, 2007 John \\"Pat\\" Philbin, the former director of external affairs for FEMA, took responsibility for the California wildfires fake press conference. “I should have cancelled it quickly.

In Iceland he has pioneered the use of population-scale genetics to understand variation in the sequence of the human genome. His work has focused on how genomic diversity is generated and on the discovery of sequence variants impacting susceptibility to common diseases. This population approach has served as a model for national genome projects around the world and contributed to the realization of several aspects of precision medicine.  Early life and education  Stefansson was born in 1949 in Reykjavik, Iceland. He was the second youngest of the five children of Sólveig Halldórsdóttir and , a prominent radio personality, writer and democratic socialist member of parliament.Obituary notice for Stefán Jónsson, Morgunblaðið, 18 September 1990, accessed at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1729310 He completed his secondary education at Reykjavik Junior College and received his M.D. in 1976 and his Dr. med. in 1986 from the University of Iceland.  Academic career  Following his internship at the National Hospital of Iceland, he went to the University of Chicago to work under Barry Arnason (coincidentally a Canadian of Icelandic descent). There he completed residencies in neurology and neuropathology, and in 1983 joined the faculty. In 1993 he was appointed professor of neurology, neuropathology and neuroscience at Harvard University and division chief of neuropathology at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. While in Boston, he and his colleague Jeffrey Gulcher decided to return to Iceland to perform genetic studies to determine multiple sclerosis risk.Executive Profile from BusinessWeek magazine Stefansson resigned both positions in 1997 after founding deCODE and moving back to Reykjavik. Since 2010, he has held a professorship in medicine at the University of Iceland. He is a board- certified neurologist and neuropathologist in both Iceland and the US. = From biology to genetics = Stefansson's academic work was focused on neurodegenerative disease.His particular focus was myelin degeneration in multiple sclerosis. A selection of his publications from this period can be searched on Google Scholar. The protein biology approach to this research involved trying to map complex processes using limited samples, mainly of brain tissue from deceased patients. Although publishing steadily, Stefansson was frustrated by the pace of progress and often by not knowing whether the proteins he was characterizing were involved in causing disease or the product of the disease process.Adam Piore, \\"Bring us your genes: A Viking scientist's quest to conquer disease,\\" Nautilus, 2 July 2015 He and his colleagues came to question even the accepted definition of multiple sclerosis (MS) as an autoimmune disease.Gulcher, JR, Vartanian, T, and Stefansson K, \\"Is Multiple Sclerosis an automimmune disease?\\" Clinical Neuroscience 2(3-4):246-52 (1994) When he was recruited from Chicago to Harvard, Stefansson, like many other medical scientists, had begun to think that the genome might provide a better starting point for such research than biology. Genes encode proteins, so identifying the genes and specific genetic variations that patients tended to share more often than healthy individuals should provide a foothold in the pathogenesis of disease.For contemporary views of this potential, MS Guyer and FS Collins, \\"The Human Genome Project and the future of medicine,\\" American Journal of Diseases of Children, 147(11):1145-52 (November 1993) In doing so they might point to biologically relevant targets for new drugs and predictive diagnostics.An authoritative mid-1990s view of the promise of genetics in diagnostics, Min J Khoury and Diane K Wagener, \\"Epidemiological evaluation of the use of genetics to improve the predictive value of disease risk factors,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, 56:835-844, 5 January 1995 However, in the mid-1990s the tools for reading the sequence of the genome were primitive. Data was scarce and expensive to generate, and a major early focus of the Human Genome Project was to develop better methods.FS Collins et al., \\" New Goals for the U.S. Human Genome Project: 1998 –2003,\\" Science, Vol. 282, pp. 682-689, 23 Oct 1998 In the meantime, one solution was to use genetics – how the genome is mixed and passed from one generation to the next – as a means of deriving more information from the available data.An influential early – and at that time still largely theoretical – discussion of different possible approaches to common rather than rare diseases is ES Lander and NJ Schork, \\"Genetic dissection of complex traits,\\" Science, Vol. 265, Issue 5181, pp. 2037–2048, 30 September 1994 Siblings share half their genomes; but cousins one eighth, second cousins one thirty-second, etc. Studying patients linked by extended genealogies should therefore make it possible to more efficiently find the inherited component of any phenotype or trait, even using low- resolution markers. = Back to Iceland = An important question was whether and where such extended genealogies might be found. It was not one that occurred to many leading geneticists to ask with regard to common diseases.This was not an obvious thing to look for. Even prominent experts who predicted the future power of population genetics and association studies seem not to have considered that linkage analysis could be extended to common diseases, and aid in association studies, through population-wide genealogies. Neil Risch and Kathleen Merikangas, \\"The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases,\\" Science, Vol. 273, No. 5281, pp 1516–1517, 13 September 1996; Aravinda Chakravarti, \\"Population genetics: making sense out of sequence,\\" Nature Genetics 21, pages 56–60, 1 January 1999 As an Icelander, Stefansson knew the country's passion for genealogy first hand and had grown up with and trained in its national health system. In 1995, he and his colleague and former graduate student, Jeffrey Gulcher, decided to go to Iceland to study multiple sclerosis. Working with doctors in the national health system they identified hundreds of patients and relatives who gave them blood samples to begin their research. As Icelanders they were almost by definition related, and due to the national pastime of genealogy those relationships could be established. When Stefansson and Gulcher returned to Boston, their grant proposal was turned down by the NIH, which had little experience of funding work using distantly related patients. But Stefansson saw potential in Iceland for using the same approach to find the genetic component of virtually any common disease.Nicholas Wade, \\"SCIENTIST AT WORK/Kari Stefansson; Hunting for Disease Genes In Iceland's Genealogies,\\" New York Times, 18 June 2002 This was beyond the scope of an academic laboratory, and he made contact with venture capital firms to find out if such an enterprise could be funded as a private company. In the summer of 1996 he raised $12 million from several American venture capital funds to found deCODE genetics.from Alta Venture Partners, Polaris Venture Partners, Arch Venture Partners, Atlas Venture, among others. A complete list of early investors is in the Icelandic business paper Frjals Verslun from 1 March 1998, p. 37 He and Gulcher moved to Iceland to set up operations and resigned their positions at Harvard the following year.Announcement of deCODE starting operations on the front page of Morgunblaðið, 31 May 1996  deCODE and the population approach  Stefansson conceived deCODE as an industrial-scale enterprise for human genetics. Unlike the prevailing academic model of scientists undertaking discrete projects in their separate labs, he proposed to gather and generate as much genealogical, medical and genomic data as he could from across the population. Using bioinformatics and statistics, deCODE could then combine and mine all this data together for correlations between variation in the sequence and any disease or trait, in a nearly hypothesis-free manner.An early description of the discovery model and process by Stefansson and Gulcher when they still planned to build the IHD, in \\"Population genomics: laying the groundwork for genetic disease modeling and targeting,\\" Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine 36(8):523-7, 1 August 1998 The business model was to fund this effort through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies who would use the discoveries to develop new drugs.A good early outline of Stefansson's vision and the business model in Stephen D. Moore, \\"Biotech firm turns Iceland into a giant genetics lab,\\" Wall Street Journal , 3 July 1997 Iceland had the data sources required for this \\"population approach\\": a high-quality single-payer healthcare system; a relatively homogeneous population that would make finding disease variants less complex;Gulcher, J, Helgason A, Stefansson, K, \\"Genetic homogeneity of Icelanders,\\" Nature Genetics volume 26, page 395, December 2000. One example of the relative genetic homogeneity but global utility of studying the Icelandic population is breast cancer. Around the world there are many variants in the BRCA2 gene known to confer substantial increased risk of breast cancer, but in Iceland there is essentially one disease-linked variant, which was published on the eve of deCODE's operational launch in Iceland: Steinnun Thorlacius et al., \\"A single BRCA2 mutation in male and female breast cancer families from Iceland with varied cancer phenotypes,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 13, pages117–119, 1 May 1996. deCODE now has a website that enables Icelanders to find out if they carry the mutation. an educated citizenry that was willing to contribute DNA and medical and health information for research; and most uniquely, comprehensive national genealogies.The resources and their utility for gene discovery is concisely summarized in deCODE's first press release: \\"Icelandic Genomics Company Identifies Location of Gene for Essential Tremor,\\" 25 August 1997, on the company website. Mary Clare King, who had used family pedigrees to identify BRCA1 in breast cancer, was among the scientists who recognized the potential of these records. As she told the New Yorker, \\"to be able to trace the genealogy of an entire nation for a thousand years...and obtain samples of blood and tissue from healthy living people...could become one of the treasures of modern medicine.\\"Quoted in Michael Specter, \\"Decoding Iceland,\\" The New Yorker , 18 January 1999 From its inception, virtually everything in Stefansson's strategy was unproven or controversial. The genomics community was still far from generating a first human genome sequence; he was proposing a data system for mining hundreds of thousands of genomes. Genes linked to rarer syndromes had been identified in isolated families in Sardinia, Newfoundland, Finland and elsewhere, and a BRCA2 variant had been found in Iceland, but he wanted to look at the most common public health problems.See for example Francesco Cuca et al., \\"The distribution of DR4 haplotypes in Sardinia suggests a primary association of type I diabetes with DRB1 and DQB1 loci,\\" Human Immunology, Volume 43, Issue 4, pp 301-308, August 1995, ; EM Petty et al., \\"Mapping the gene for hereditary hyperparathyroidism and prolactinoma (MEN1Burin) to chromosome 11q: evidence for a founder effect in patients from Newfoundland,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, 54(6): 1060–1066, June 1994; Melanie M Mahtani et al., \\"Mapping of a gene for type 2 diabetes associated with an insulin secretion defect by a genome scan in Finnish families,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 14, pp 90–94, 1 September 1996; Steinnun Thorlacius et al., \\"A single BRCA2 mutation,\\" op. cit. The Wall Street Journal called the venture a \\"big gamble,\\" citing noted scientists that \\"to date, there's no scientific proof that researchers can decipher the genetics of a complex disease among the population of Iceland – or any country.\\"Stephen D. Moore, \\"Biotech firm turns Iceland into,\\" op. cit. And deCODE was a private company that was taking an entire nation as a unit of study, with the unprecedented level of public engagement and participation that would entail. What stirred the most controversy was Stefansson's proposal in 1997 to create a database of copies of medical records data from the national health service to correlate with genealogical and genomic data.Gulcher and Stefansson, \\"Population genomics: laying the groundwork,\\" op. cit. Supported by a large majority of the public and members of parliament, the Act on Health Sector Database authorizing the creation of such a database and its licensing for commercial use was passed in 1998. But it was fiercely opposed by a group of local academics and doctors as well as many international bioethicists.Stefansson and Gulcher cite polls showing public support for the IHD of 75%, in \\"An Icelandic saga on a centralized healthcare database and democratic decision making,\\" Nature Biotechnology (subscription required), volume 17, page 620, July 1999. Icelandic opponents to the IHD created an organization called Mannvernd to fight it and to encourage people to exercise their right to opt-out. The number of opt-outs provides one concrete measure of opposition to the idea as well as, conversely, a measure of how many people either favored the idea or held no strong opinion. According to an archived snapshot of Mannvernd's website from September 2003, in the five years following the passage of the law authorizing the IHD, just over 20,000 people had opted out, or 7% of a 2003 population of 288,000. Opponents of the Iceland Health Sector Database (IHD) objected to the use of public data by a private enterprise and to presumed consent as the model for the use of medical records in research. They argued that the project put individuals' data privacy at risk, would stifle scientific freedom, and they generally disapproved of the new venture-funded model of biomedical innovation that deCODE represented.Books and major research articles by bioethicists on these themes include: Mike Fortun, Promising genomics: Iceland and deCODE genetics in a World of speculation (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); David Winickoff, \\"Genome and nation: Iceland's Health Sector Database and its legacy,\\" Innovations: Technology Governance Globalization 1(2):80-105, February 2006\\"; Henry T. Greely, \\"Iceland's plan for genomics research: Facts and implications,\\" Jurimetrics 40, no. 2, pp153-91, Winter 2000; and Jon Merz, \\"Iceland, Inc?: On the ethics of commercial population genomics\\", Social Science & Medicine 58(6):1201-9, April 2004. Apart from Mannvernd's, another website in Berkeley, California was devoted to the anthropological implications of deCODE and genetics research in Iceland: http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/iceland/ In hundreds of interviews and articles, Stefansson was attacked for – and just as vigorously defended – the IHD and his broader approach.Stefansson and Gulcher estimated that by 1999 more than 700 articles and interviews had been published. For this and their view on the benefits of what deCODE was doing: \\"An Icelandic saga on a centralized healthcare database,\\" op. cit. A partial snapshot of the number, flavor and sources of articles can be seen from an archived view from May 1999 of the website of Mannvernd, the Icelandic organization formed to oppose the IHD, and in a highly detailed bibliography created by Dr Skúli Sigurðsson, a leading member of Mannvernd. He argued that far from supplanting traditional data sources or researchers, deCODE was creating a new scale of resources and opportunities including for the health service; benefitting the community by repatriating and employing Icelandic scientists in cutting-edge fields; and following international norms of consent while setting new standards in large- scale research, with oversight by public bioethics and data protection bodies and novel data and privacy protection protocols.J Gulcher, K Kristjansson, H Gudbjartsson, K Stefansson, \\"Protection of privacy by third-party encryption in genetic research in Iceland,\\" European Journal of Human Genetics , volume 8, pages 739–742, 3 October 2000 Critics at the time remained unconvinced. Stanford bioethicist Hank Greely concluded simply that \\"the Icelandic model is not a good precedent for similar research elsewhere.\\"Henry T Greely, \\"Iceland's plan for genomics research,\\" op. cit.  Scientific contributions  = The feasibility of population genetics and national genome projects = As the architect, scientific leader and very public face of deCODE, one of Stefansson's fundamental contributions has been to demonstrate that genomics can be done at national scale, and to provide a realized example of how to do it.How Stefansson's population strategy transformed thinking in the field and gene discovery by the mid-2000s in Lee Silver, \\"Biology reborn: A genetic science breakthrough,\\" Newsweek, 9 October 2007. By the time Human Genome Project and Celera published their draft sequences of the human genome in 2001, his vision for population genetics had already taken shape and was yielding early discoveries of sequence variation linked to disease, human evolution and population history.The Human Genome Project draft was published in Nature; Celera's draft in Science, both on 15 February 2001A list of deCODE's key publications, on virtually all of which Stefansson is senior author, are listed by year on the company's website at https://www.decode.com/publications/ In 2002, deCODE used its capabilities in Iceland to publish a genetic map of the genome that was used to complete the final assembly of the reference human genome sequence.JL Weber, \\"The Iceland Map,\\" and A Kong et al., \\"A high resolution recombination map of the human genome,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 31, pp 225–226 and 241–247, respectively, 10 June 2002. On how the map improved the accuracy of the reference sequence see Nicholas Wade, \\"Human genome sequence has errors, scientists say,\\" New York Times, 11 June 2002. By mid-decade, even former critics acknowledged that what Stefansson was building in Iceland through fully consented individual participation and datamining was indeed an important example to prospective genome projects in the UK, US, Canada, Sweden, Estonia and elsewhere, and to the foundation of new institutions like the Broad Institute.In 1999, Icelandic anthropologist Gisli Palsson already noted the success of the deCODE model: Gisli Palsson and Paul Rabinow, \\"Iceland: The case of a national genome project,\\" Anthropology Today Vol. 15, No. 5, pp. 14-18, 5 October 1999. A 2009 report by genetics ethics watchdog GeneWatch, a vehement opponent of the IHD and the use of medical records data in research without explicit consent, notes deCODE as a major inspiration for the UK Biobank. In 2000, bioethicist George Annas already noted emulation of the deCODE approach, New England Journal of Medicine , 342:1830-1833, 15 June 2000; David Winickoff, \\"Genome and nation,\\" op. cit. On deCODE's early successes and their importance as an example to other biobank projects and the field in general see also Nicholas Wade, \\"Scientist at Work/Kari Stefansson: Hunting for disease genes in Iceland's genealogies,\\" New York Times, 18 June 2002.Jocelyn Kaiser, \\"Population databases boom from Iceland to U.S.,\\" Science Vol. 298, Issue 5596, pp. 1158–1161, 8 November 2002. No one else had comparable genealogies, but Eric Lander was inspired by the scale and data-driven approach in Iceland and founded the Broad Institute on the idea of using rapidly developing technologies for generating more data – SNP chips and then sequencing – to power discovery. Lee Silver, \\"Biology reborn: a genetic science breakthrough,\\" Newsweek, 9 October 2007 One pillar of the success of Stefansson's strategy has been his ability to convince tens of thousands of people to volunteer to take part in deCODE's research, and to connect and analyze their data using the genealogies. An early partnership with local software developer Friðrik Skúlason created a computerized national genealogy database that linked all living Icelanders and included the majority of people who have ever lived in Iceland over the past eleven hundred years.This database is overwhelmingly complete going back to the Icelandic census of 1703, the world's first complete national census and now part of UNESCO's registered world heritage, and extending back to before the arrival of the first inhabitants in the 9th century. In 2003, one version of this database, called Íslendingabók, was made freely available online to anyone with an Icelandic national identity number, and is used by thousands of citizens every day.Usage numbers cited on the Íslendingabok Wiki page. A more detailed discussion by a longtime observer, anthropologist Gísli Pálsson, in \\"The Web of Kin: An Online Genealogical Machine,\\" in Sandra C. Bamford, ed., Kinship and Beyond: The Genealogical Model Reconsidered (New York: Berghahn Books, 2009), pp. 84-110. The version used in research replaces names with encrypted personal identifiers overseen by Iceland's Data Protection Commission. This makes it possible to create pedigrees connecting the genetic and phenotypic data of any group of people in an anonymized manner. Stefansson and Gulcher published the structure of this data protection system for other genome projects to use.Details of how the privacy protection system works in Gulcher et al., \\"Protection of privacy by third-party encryption,\\" op. cit. The primary means of recruitment for deCODE research has been through collaboration with physicians across the health service who construct lists of patients with different diseases who are then invited to take part. Participation entails not only written informed consent but also filling out health questionnaires; undergoing detailed clinical examination and measurements; and giving blood for the isolation of DNA; all of this takes place at a special clinic and requires the commitment by participants of several hours to complete.A good early description of how people are asked to participate and how their data is used in research is on pp 7-9 of deCODE's 2002 annual report filed with the SEC. The IHD was never built, its scientific and business rationale largely superseded by the response of Icelanders to contribute their data one by one.By 2004, the government and deCODE had effectively stopped all work on the IHD and moved on. On page 10 of deCODE's 2003 annual report filed with the SEC, the company described the mutual lack of activity: \\"As of March 2004, a government- mandated review of the IHD's data encryption and protection protocols, which began in April 2000, had not been completed. When and if this review and issuance of related security certification is completed, we will evaluate whether and when, if at all, to proceed with the development of the IHD in light of our priorities and resources at that time. In light of our current business plans and priorities, we do not expect the IHD to be a material aspect of our business in the near future.\\" By 2003, with some 95% of people asked to participate agreeing to do so, more than 100,000 were taking part in the study of one or more of three-dozen diseases.Helen Pearson, \\"Profile: Kari Stefansson,\\" Nature Medicine, volume 9, page 1099, 1 September 2003; participation rate in deCODE's annual report from 2002 filed with the SEC, p 8. By 2007, this had grown to 130,000;James Butcher, \\"Kari Stefansson, general of genetics,\\" The Lancet, 27 January 2007 and by 2018 to more than 160,000. This is roughly 70% of all adult citizens, 60,000 of whom have had their whole genomes sequenced.Anna Azvolinsky, \\"Master Decoder: A Profile of Kári Stefánsson,\\" The Scientist, 1 March 2019 At each successive stage of technology for reading the genome – from microsatellite markers to SNPs to whole-genome sequencing – this participation is unique as a proportion of the population and has also consistently comprised one of the largest collections of genomic data in the world in absolute terms.In 2018, most advanced national genome efforts were still aspiring to generate and assemble 100,000 whole genome sequences in one place. See Alex Phillipidis, \\"10 Countries in the 100K genome club,\\" Clinical Omics, 30 August 2018 Using the genealogies deCODE can impute the sequence data of the entire population, yielding a single encrypted, minable dataset of more than 300,000 whole genomes.A pioneering early methodology for phasing and imputation is in A Kong et al., \\"Detection of sharing by descent, long-range phasing and haplotype imputation,\\" Nature Genetics volume 40, pages 1068–1075, 17 August 2008. The first published sequence imputation dates from 2015: DF Gudbjartsson et al., \\"Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population\\" published as part of the \\"Genomes of Icelanders\\" special edition, Nature Genetics , 47, pages 435–444, 25 May 2015 = Discoveries and publications = Leading his deCODE colleagues to continually build and re-query these population datasets, Stefansson has made a steady stream of contributions to the understanding of how variation in the sequence of the genome is generated and its impact on health and disease. Myles Axton, the longtime editor of Nature Genetics, noted at deCODE's 20th anniversary celebration that this leadership had put deCODE and Iceland \\"in the forefront of a revolution that has delivered much of what was promised in the mapping of the human genome.\\"Axton also pointed out that notwithstanding deCODE scientists' hundreds of publications elsewhere, 111 papers, or five percent of the papers published during his tenure at the journal over the preceding twelve years, had come out of deCODE. Axton's comments are from his remarks at deCODE's 20th anniversary conference, held in Reykjavik on 30 September 2016, available in video on the company website at https://www.decode.com/20-years/ These discoveries, tools and observations have been shared with the scientific community in hundreds of scientific publications. Stefansson guides and oversees all research at deCODE and is senior author on its papers, with project and group leaders the first authors and co-authors drawn from the hundreds of local and international institutions and organizations with whom deCODE has collaborations.A list of all of deCODE's major publications since 1997 are on the company's website at https://www.decode.com/publications/ A large number of these are noteworthy contributions to the field and Stefansson and several of his deCODE colleagues are consistently ranked among the most highly cited scientists in genetics and molecular biology.Recent lists of highly cited scientists at https://hcr.clarivate.com/resources/archived-lists/  The generation of human diversity and mechanisms of evolution  In more than a dozen major papers published over nearly twenty years, Stefansson and his colleagues used their holistic view of an entire population to build a novel picture of the human genome as a system for transmitting information. They have provided a detailed view of how the genome uses recombination, de novo mutation and gene conversion to promote and generate its own diversity but within certain bounds. In 2002, deCODE published its first recombination map of the human genome. It was constructed with 5000 microsatellite markers and highlighted 104 corrections to the Human Genome Project's draft assembly of the genome, immediately increasing the accuracy of the draft from 93 to 99%. But from an evolutionary biology perspective it demonstrated in new detail the non-random location of recombinations - the reshuffling of the genome that goes into the making of eggs and sperm - and that women recombine 1.6 times more than men.A Kong et al., \\"A high resolution recombination map of the human genome,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 31, pp 241–247, 10 June 2002 They then showed that older women recombine more than younger women; that higher recombination correlates with higher fertility;A Kong et al., \\"Reproduction rate and reproductive success,\\" Nature Genetics , volume 36, pp 1203–1206, 3 October 2004 and that a large inversion on chromosome 17 is at present under positive evolutionary selection in European populations, with carriers having higher recombination and fertility rates than non-carriers.H Stefansson et al., \\"A common inversion under selection in Europeans,\\" Nature Genetics , volume 37, pages 129–137, 16 January 2005 A second recombination map published in 2010 utilized 300,000 SNPs and revealed different recombination hotspots between women and men, as well as novel genetic variations that affect recombination rate, and that do so differently in European and African populations.A Kong et al., \\"Fine-scale recombination rate differences between sexes, populations and individuals,\\" Nature , volume 467, pp 1099–1103, 28 October 2010 This map also showed that while women are responsible for most recombination, men generate the bulk of de novo mutations. In a much discussed paper from 2012 they demonstrated that the number of such mutations — variants that appear in the genomes of children but are not inherited from either parent — increases with paternal age and constitute a major source of rare diseases of childhood.A Kong et al., \\"Rate of de novo mutations and the importance of father’s age to disease risk,\\" Nature , volume 488, pp 471–475, 23 August 2012 A detailed analysis of the different types and distribution of maternal and paternal de novo mutations was published in 2017,H Jonsson et al., \\"Parental influence on human germline de novo mutations in 1,548 trios from Iceland,\\" Nature , volume 549, pp 519–522, 28 September 2017 and a subsequent paper demonstrated how de novo mutations in parents can be passed on.A Jonsson et al., \\"Multiple transmissions of de novo mutations in families,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 50, pp 1674-1680, 5 November 2018 A third source of genomic diversity, gene conversions, are difficult to detect except by looking at very large genealogies. deCODE combined genomic and genealogical data on some 150,000 people to demonstrate that this process is, like crossover recombination, more common in women; is age dependent; and that male and female gene conversions tend to be complementary in type, so that they hold each other in check.BV Halldorsson et al., \\"The rate of meiotic gene conversion varies by sex and age,\\" Nature Genetics , volume 48, pp 1377–1384, 19 September 2016 In 2019, deCODE utilized the genealogies, the large number of whole genome sequences (WGS) that it had completed in the preceding years, and genoytping data on the majority of the population, to publish a third recombination map of the genome. This is the first created using WGS data, and like the previous maps has been made openly available to the global scientific community.BV Halldorsson et al., \\"Characterizing mutagenic effects of recombination through a sequence-level genetic map,\\" Science, Vol. 363, Issue 6425, eaau1043, 25 Jan 2019 Contributions to population history and genetic anthropology include pioneering work on the mutation rate and mechanisms in mitochondria and the Y chromosome;A Helgason et al., \\"The Y chromosome point mutation rate in humans,\\" Nature Genetics, , volume 47, pp 453–457, 25 March 2015 comparing ancient to contemporary DNA;A Helgason et al., \\"Sequences from first settlers reveal rapid evolution in Icelandic mtDNA pool,\\" PLoS Genetics, 16 January 2009 characterization of the respective Norse and Celtic roots of mitochondria and Y chromosomes in the Icelandic population;A Helgason et al., \\"Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic ancestry in the male settlers of Iceland,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, 67(3): 697–717, 7 August 2000; and A Helgason et al., \\"mtDNA and the Origin of the Icelanders: Deciphering Signals of Recent Population History,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, 66(3):999-1016, 23 February 2000 observations of the phenomenon of genetic drift, as an isolated population diverges from it source populations over time;SS Ebenesersdottir et al., \\"Ancient genomes from Iceland reveal the making of a human population,\\" Science , Vol. 360, Issue 6392, pp. 1028-1032, 1 June 2018 the relationship between kinship and fertility;A Helgason et al., \\"An association between the kinship and fertility of human couples,\\" Science , Vol. 319, Issue 5864, pp. 813-816, 8 February 2008 the impact of population structure on disease associated variants and vice versa,A Helgason et al., \\" An Icelandic example of the impact of population structure on association studies,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 37, pages 90–95, 19 December 2004 and a population-wide catalogue of human knockouts, people missing certain genes.P Sulem et al., \\" Identification of a large set of rare complete human knockouts,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 47, pages 448–452, 25 March 2015 In 2018, deCODE used its capabilities to reconstruct the genome of Hans Jonatan, one of the first Icelanders of African descent. He immigrated to Iceland in 1802 and his genome was reconstructed from fragments of the genomes of 180 of his nearly 800 living descendants, traceable through Íslendingabok.A Jagadeesan et al., \\"Reconstructing an African haploid genome from the 18th century,\\" Nature Genetics , volume 50, pp199–205, 15 January 2018. Hans Jonatan is the subject of a book by Icelandic anthropologist Gisli Palsson, The Man Who Stole Himself (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2016) and Stefansson addressed the reconstruction of Hans Jonatan's genome in the New York Times, The Atlantic, Newsweek, Der Spiegel and elsewhere.  The genetics of common diseases and traits  Stefansson is probably best known for the contribution he and his deCODE colleagues have made to the discovery of genetic variations linked to risk of disease and to a range of other traits. The population approach — the scale and breadth of resources and the focus on cross-mining disparate datasets — has been key to this productivity. It makes it possible to use both broad and rigorous definitions of phenotypes, rapidly test ideas, and for deCODE scientists to follow where the data leads rather than their own hypotheses.Stefansson presented an early explanation of the 'broad but rigorous' approach to the definition of phenotypes powered by datamining at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) conference in Barcelona in 2000; it is also discussed in many publications. See for example S Gretarsdottir et al., \\"Localization of a susceptibility gene for common forms of stroke to 5q12,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 70, Issue 3, pp 593-603, March 2002 This has led to a range of discoveries that link diseases and at times use the genetics even to redefine phenotypes in unusual ways, and Stefansson has spent significant time explaining these discoveries and their utility to the scientific and lay media. Typically, discoveries made in Iceland are published alongside validation in outside populations. Conversely, deCODE has often used its resources to validate discoveries made elsewhere. Among the more noteworthy of these discoveries are, by disease and trait: = Alzheimer's disease = A variant in the APP gene was discovered in 2012 that protects carriers against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and protects the elderly from cognitive decline. It has been widely cited and used to inform the development of BACE1 inhibitors as potential treatments.T Jonsson et al., \\"A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive decline,\\" Nature, 488, pp 96–99, 11 June 2012; Michael Specter, \\"The good news about Alzheimer's Disease,\\" The New Yorker, 11 July 2012; Ewen Callaway, \\"Gene mutation defends against Alzheimer's Disease,\\" Nature, 11 July 2012 Stefansson and the deCODE team have also discovered variants in the TREM2 and ABCA7 genes that increase risk of AD.T Jonsson et al., \\"Variant of TREM2 associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease,\\" New England Journal of Medicine, 368(2):107-16, 10 January 2013; S Steinberg et al., \\"Loss-of- function variants in ABCA7 confer risk of Alzheimer's disease,\\" Nature Genetics, 47(5):445-7, 25 March 2015 = Schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, cognition = Stefansson and his team have used the breadth of the company's datasets and links between diseases and traits to discover new risk variants for mental illness, but also to refine the understanding of the perturbations that define these conditions and the nature of cognition itself. Studies in the early 2000s mapped the involvement of the Neuregulin 1 gene in schizophrenia, leading to substantial research in this novel pathway.H Stefansson et al., \\"Neuregulin 1 and susceptibility to schizophrenia,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 71, Issue 4, pp 877-892, October 2002. Like many early linkage-based findings, this association itself has not proved fruitful, but substantial later work has been done on the pathway. See for example A Buonanno, \\"The neuregulin signaling pathway and schizophrenia: From genes to synapses and neural circuits,\\" Brain Research Bulletin, Volume 83, Issues 3–4, pp 122-131, 30 September 2010 Over the next fifteen years they used standard GWAS and reduced fecundity as an intermediate phenotype to home in on SNPs and copy number variations (CNVs) linked to risk of schizophrenia and other disorders;H Stefansson et al., \\"Large recurrent microdeletions associated with schizophrenia,\\" Nature , volume 455, pp 232-6, 11 September 2008; H Stefansson et al., Nature , \\"Common variants conferring risk of schizophrenia,\\" Nature, volume 460, pp 744-7, 6 August 2009; Niamh Mullins et al., \\"Reproductive fitness and genetic risk of psychiatric disorders in the general population,\\" Nature Communications, Volume 8, Article number 15833, 13 June 2017 they demonstrated that genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and autism confer cognitive abnormalities even in control subjects;H Stefansson et al., \\"CNVs conferring risk of autism or schizophrenia affect cognition in controls,\\" Nature, volume 505, pp 361-6, 18 December 2013 they linked schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with both creativity and risk of addiction;RA Power et al., \\"Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder predict creativity,\\" Nature Neuroscience , Volume 18, pp 953–955, 8 June 2015; GW Reginsson et al., \\"Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associate with addiction,\\" Addiction Biology, volume 23, issue 1, pp 485-492, 25 February 2017 they identified genetic variants associated with educational attainment and childhood cognition;B Gunnarsson et al., \\"A sequence variant associating with educational attainment also affects childhood cognition,\\" Nature Scientific Reports, volume 6, article number 36189 and demonstrated that these variants are currently under negative evolutionary selection.A Kong et al., \\"Selection against variants in the genome associated with educational attainment,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114 (5) E727-E732, 17 January 2017 In addressing common psychiatric disorders and cognitive processes and traits across a population, this body of work has contributed to the present understanding of these conditions not as discrete phenotypes but as related through the disruption of fundamental cognitive functions. = Cancer = Stefansson and his colleagues have made numerous pioneering discoveries of genome variants conferring risk of many common cancers. They have played a role in shaping the now commonly accepted new paradigm for understanding cancer: that it should be defined at least as much in molecular terms as in where it occurs in the body. deCODE published holistic evidence of this in a familial aggregation of all cancers diagnosed in anyone in Iceland over fifty years, as well as other aggregation studies.LT Amundadottir et al., \\"Cancer as a Complex Phenotype: Pattern of Cancer Distribution within and beyond the Nuclear Family,\\" PLoS Medicine, 1(3):e65, 28 December 2004; T Gudmundsson et al., \\"A population-based familial aggregation analysis indicates genetic contribution in a majority of renal cell carcinomas,\\" International Journal of Cancer, 100(4):476-9, 13 June 2002; S Jonsson et al., \\"Familial risk of lung carcinoma in the Icelandic population,\\" Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), 292(24):2977-83, 22 December 2004 These have demonstrated through basic genetics that while certain site cancers clustered in families, others cluster in a non-site specific way, pointing to common molecular causes. They discovered the chromosome 8q24 locus as harboring risk variants for many types of cancer,J Gudmundsson et al., \\"Genome-wide association study identifies a second prostate cancer susceptibility variant at 8q24,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 39, pp 631–637, 1 April 2007;

Another very large study, analyzing clinical and whole-genome sequence data from some 300,000 people, found more than a dozen relatively rare variants corresponding to elevated cholesterol levels. However the genetic links to CAD risk provided a new view of how cholesterol is linked to heart disease. They reported that measuring non-HDL cholesterol (so-called 'good cholesterol') better captures risk than measuring LDL (or 'bad') cholesterol, which is current standard practice.A Helgadottir et al., \\"Variants with large effects on blood lipids and the role of cholesterol and triglycerides in coronary disease,\\" Nature Genetics volume 48, pages 634–639, 2 May 2016 = Diabetes and other traits and conditions = deCODE discovered the link between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and variants in the TCF7L2 gene,SFA Grant et al., \\"Variant of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene confers risk of type 2 diabetes,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 38, pp 320–323, 15 January 2006; A Helgason et al., \\"Refining the impact of TCF7L2 gene variants on type 2 diabetes and adaptive evolution,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 39, pp 218–225, 7 January 2007 the most important common known genetic risk factor known, and variants in the CDKAL1 and other genes linked to insulin response and both increased and decreasednT2D risk.V Steinthorsdottir et al., \\"A variant in CDKAL1 influences insulin response and risk of type 2 diabetes,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 39, pp 770–775, 26 April 2007; V Steinthorsdottir et al., \\"Identification of low-frequency and rare sequence variants associated with elevated or reduced risk of type 2 diabetes,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 46, pp 294–298, 26 January 2014; EV Ivarsdottir et al., \\"Effect of sequence variants on variance in glucose levels predicts type 2 diabetes risk and accounts for heritability,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 49, pp 1398–1402, 7 August 2017; J Gudmundsson et al., \\"Two variants on chromosome 17 confer prostate cancer risk, and the one in TCF2 protects against type 2 diabetes,\\" op. cit.

In 2014, Stefansson is reported to have astonished David Altshuler, then deputy director of the Broad Institute, who stopped by at deCODE on his way back from Finland and Sweden. Altshuler had been leading a T2D research effort and had found a rare variant in that seemed to protect even those with all the common lifestyle risk factors from developing the disease. Stefansson called one of his group leaders and asked him to test the look for an association in deCODE's data. Within a few minutes they had confirmed that the Icelanders didn't have the exact variant found by Altshuler's team but did have another in the same gene that was clearly protective for T2D.The story recounted by Gina Kolata, \\"Rare mutation kills off gene responsible for diabetes,\\" New York Times, 2 March 2014 The deCODE team then added their variant to the paper that was published in Nature Genetics.J Flannick et al., \\" Loss-of-function mutations in SLC30A8 protect against type 2 diabetes,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 46, pp 357–363, 2 March 2014 = Public-private collaboration and the development of precision medicine = Stefansson's design and leadership of deCODE as a private enterprise built upon mass-participation science has contributed to new models of engagement, product development and public-private partnership in medical research. While deCODE comprises the first and most comprehensive national genome project in the world, it has never been government funded. It has always been a business that relies on the voluntary participation of citizens and national health system doctors as partners in scientific discovery. This relationship between citizens and private enterprise, which seemed logical to Stefansson, counterintuitive to others and is disliked by some, is becoming ever more common.In 2006, one Reykjavik resident and a participant in deCODE research said that about 90% of people thought taking part in research funded by pharmaceutical companies made sense, while about 10% were against it, roughly capturing the participation rate of those asked. Michael D Lemomick, \\"The Iceland experiment: How a tiny island nation captured the lead in the genomic revolution,\\" Time, 12 February 2006. Those who do not agree remain vocal even as emulation of the deCODE model proliferates: See for example Emma Jane Kirby, \\"Iceland's DNA: the world's most precious genes?,\\" BBC News, 19 June 2014. One factor underlying its success and driving participation in Iceland is clearly national pride, turning the country's small size and historical isolation into a unique advantage in an important field. Another is that discoveries are applied to trying to create and sell actual products to improve medicine and health. In a 2017 interview Iceland's former president Vigdis Finnbogadottir captured a common view: \\"If Icelanders can contribute to the health of the world, I’m more than proud. I’m grateful.”The breadth of impact of the model and Finnbogadottir quote in Catherine Offord, \\"Learning from Iceland’s Model for Genetic Research,\\" The Scientist, 1 June 2017  Personal genomics and disease risk diagnostics  deCODE's fortunes as a business have been turbulent, but Stefansson has always explicitly worked to turn its discoveries into medically useful and commercially successful products. Some of these have been highly innovative and paved the way for new industries and markets. In the years after Íslendingabok put Icelanders' genealogies online, the Genographic Project and companies like MyHeritage, FamilyTreeDNA and Ancestry launched websites to enable people everywhere to try to use genetics to build out their genealogies.David P Hamilton, \\"Genetic genealogy hits the big time,\\" VentureBeat, 17 October 2007 In November 2007, deCODE launched deCODEme, the first personal genomics service, followed the next day by Google-backed 23andMe.Nicholas Wade, \\"Company offers genome assessments,\\" New York Times, 16 November 2007; David P Hamilton, \\" 23andMe lets you search and share your genome — today,\\" VentureBeat, 17 November 2007 deCODEme included polygenic risk scores built principally on its discoveries to gauge individual predisposition to dozens of common diseases, an approach followed by 23andMe and others. deCODE's published risk markers provided the most rigorously validated foundation for all such services.deCODEme and other tests apart from 23andMe are no longer offered, but contemporaneous examples of deCODE discoveries being foundational to personal genome scans examining validated risk for type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease can be seen in G Palomaki et al., \\"Use of genomic panels to determine risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the general population: a targeted evidence-based review,\\" Genetics in Medicine, Volume 15, pp 600–611, August 2013; Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) Working Group, \\"Recommendations from the EGAPP Working Group: genomic profiling to assess cardiovascular risk to improve cardiovascular health,\\" Genetics in Medicine, Volume 12, pp 839-43, December 2010 Stefansson also oversaw deCODE bringing to market clinical tests for polygenic risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attack, prostate cancer, and atrial fibrillation and stroke.An example of deCODE's polygenic risk tests and the others it offered in company press release, \\"deCODE discovers genetic markers that improve the power of PSA testing for detecting Prostate Cancer,\\" 15 December 2010 Marketing of these products and deCODEme ceased with the company's financial troubles in 2011, but recent high-profile studies from Massachusetts General Hospital have revived interest in the medical value polygenic risk testing. These tests are using more markers and new algorithms to build upon the risk variants and approach pioneered in Iceland for these same diseases.Amit V Khera et al, \\"Genetic Risk, Adherence to a Healthy Lifestyle, and Coronary Disease,\\" New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 375, pp 2349-2358 (December 2016); Amit V Khera, \\"Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations,\\" Nature Genetics , Volume 50, pp 1219–1224, 13 August 2018. Coverage of these papers in the New York Times, Nature, Forbes, and the MIT Technology Review revived nearly verbatim discussions from a decade earlier about both the value of such tests and the gaps in doctors' and the general public's understanding about what the results mean.  Drug discovery  Yet Stefansson's principal goal has always been to use the genome to inform the development of better drugs. Years before precision medicine became a common term, he wanted to provide its foundation : to find and validate drug targets rooted in disease pathways rather than rely on trial and error in medicinal chemistry,See Stephen D Moore, \\"Biotech firm turns island into a giant genetics lab,\\" op. cit. On the advent of \\"precision medicine\\" as a term, Luke Timmerman, \\"What’s in a Name? A Lot, When It Comes to ‘Precision Medicine’,\\" Xconomy, 4 February 2013 and to be able to test and prescribe drugs for patients likely to respond well.One instance of Stefansson's view of the role of genetics in drug development and in the context of the growing genomics industry in Ann Thayer, \\"The Genomics Evolution: Small technology providers and major drug firms become allies to find the causes of disease, to validate targets, and to understand drug response,\\" Chemical and Engineering News, 8 December 2003 This addresses longstanding productivity challenges in drug development and Stefansson has funded the company principally by partnering with pharmaceutical companies. A $200 million gene and target discovery deal with Roche in 1998 was an early sign of the industry's interest in genomics to make better drugs.On the thinking behind the Roche deal, with only a modest dose of the fevered hyperbole and innuendo of the time, see Eliot Marshall, \\"Iceland's blond ambition,\\" Mother Jones, May/June 1998 Other partnerships were formed with Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca and others. In the mid-2000s the company brought several of its own compounds into clinical development but did not have the financial resources to continue their development after its insolvency and restructuring in 2009.Emily Singer, \\"DeCODE ditches drug development,\\" MIT Technology Review, 22 January 2010 By far the longest, deepest and most productive partnership has been that with Amgen. In 2012, Amgen bought deCODE for $415 million. Since then it has operated as a wholly owned but quite independent subsidiary, applying its capabilities across Amgen's drug development pipeline while maintaining local control over its data and science.On acquisition and its rationale in broad context, as well as deCODE being left in independent control over its data, see Matt Herper, \\" With DeCode deal, Amgen aims to discover drugs like we meant to in 1999,\\" Forbes, 10 December 2012 With Amgen's full support it has continued to publish both commercially relevant gene and drug target discoveries and on human diversity and evolution, providing a high-profile example of how commercial goals, basic science and public dissemination of results can be mutually beneficial.The science page of Amgen's website prominently features many deCODE publications and projects. The integration with Amgen coincided with the beginning of large-scale whole-genome sequencing at deCODE and the imputation of that data throughout the company's Iceland dataset. With that data, Stefansson and his colleagues at Amgen believed that genomics could be transformative to drug development in a way that was not possible with only SNP-chip and GWAS data.A Kamb, S Harper and K Stefansson, \\"Human genetics as a foundation for innovative drug development,\\" Nature Biotechnology , Vol 31, pp 975–978, November 2013 Importantly, they could identify rare, high-impact mutations affecting common phenotypes — in brief, the most extreme versions of common diseases — yielding drug targets with potentially better validated and more tractable therapeutic potential. This \\"rare-for-common\\" approach is now being followed by many drug companies.The best known example of this the inhibitors of PCSK9, identified in families with rare hypercholesterolemia and then developed more broadly for lowering cholesterol and reducing risk of heart disease. The identification of ASGR1 was an example of this and was taken into drug discovery to develop novel cholesterol-fighting drugs.A discussion of progress in this strategy is in Meg Tirrell, \\"Iceland's genetic goldmine and the man behind it,\\" CNBC, 6 April 2017 More broadly, Amgen's longtime chief scientific officer Sean Harper said in 2018 that \\"with the acquisition of deCODE we gained an industrial capability to do population genetics\\" that could provide human genetic validation for any target or compound. deCODE assessed Amgen's entire clinical pipeline within a month of the acquisition, delivering information that has helped to avoid clinical failures and prioritize and guide trials. Harper claims that this \\"target-first drug development\\" model enabled the company to address its own version of the industry's endemic productivity problem. He estimated that \\"just [by] having strong genetic support for half your pipeline you can improve your rate of return on R&D; investments by approximately 50%.\\"Quoted in Asher Mullard, \\"An audience with...Sean Harper,\\" Nature Reviews Drug Discovery , Vol 17, pp 10-11, January 2018  Public health: BRCA2 screening  In 2018, deCODE launched a website that enables Icelanders to request the analysis of their sequence data to determine whether they carry a SNP in the BRCA2 gene linked to significantly increased risk of breast and prostate cancer in Icelanders.Company press release on the opening of the website Arfgerd.is (Icelandic only), 15 May 2018 This was the first time that deCODE, which is primarily a research organization, returned information from its research data to participants. Stefansson had tried for many years to convince the Icelandic Ministry of Health that this was a serious public health issue that deCODE's data could address at virtually no cost, and it was but one of the clearest- cut of many such possible precision medicine applications to healthcare in Iceland.On lack of response from the government see Andy Coghlan, \\"Warn people of genetic health risks, says deCODE boss,\\" New Scientist, 25 March 2015 With no response from the health system, Stefansson went ahead and put the matter in the hands of citizens. As of late 2018, some 40,000 people, more than ten percent of the population, had utilized the site to learn their BRCA2 status. Hundreds of people have been able to learn that they are carriers and the National Hospital has built up its counseling and other services to help those decide how they wish to use this information to protect their health.Statistics in: Nordic Alliance for Clinical Genomics, \\"NACG 6th Clinical workshop report,\\" 21 November 2018, p.9 Given the disease and mortality rates from breast and prostate cancer associated with BRCA2, the availability of this information should enable the prevention and early detection of hundreds of cancers and save dozens of lives.The US National Cancer Institute estimates that about 75% of women with a BRCA2 risk mutation will develop breast cancer before the age of 80. On the poorer prognosis of carriers of BRCA2 variants with prostate cancer, see MR Akhbari et al., \\"The impact of a BRCA2 mutation on mortality from screen-detected prostate cancer,\\" British Journal of Cancer, Volume 111, pp 1238–1240, 9 September 2014 = The Iceland population approach as a global model = Introducing Stefansson for the William Allan Award lecture at the 2017 American Society of Human Genetics annual conference, Mark Daly, then co-director of the Broad Institute, said: \\"it is impossible to overlook a pervasive paradigm involving biobanks recruited with full population engagement, historical medical registry data, investments in large-scale genetic data collection and statistical methodology, and collaborative follow-up across academic and industry boundaries. What is often overlooked is that Kári and his colleagues at deCODE provided the template for this discovery engine. Moreover, it is easy to forget that when Kári founded deCODE Genetics 21 years ago, these concepts were considered quite radical and unlikely to succeed. He was both literally and figuratively on a small island of his own. As Peter Donnelly put it, “the number of countries now investing millions in similar resources is an astonishing testament to the perspicacity of his vision.”M Daly, \\"2017 William Allan Award Introduction: Kári Stefansson,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 102, Issue 3, p 350, 1 March 2018 Following on Iceland's success, countries now pursuing or planning national genome projects of varying scale, scope and rationale include the UK (via the UK Biobank as well as Genomics England and the Scottish Genomes Partnership separately); the US (All of Us as well as the Million Veteran Program), Australia, Canada, Dubai, Estonia, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and Turkey. Projects funded either largely or partially by pharmaceutical companies to inform drug target discovery include FinnGen (partly led by Mark Daly), Regeneron/Geisinger, and Genomics Medicine Ireland. In April 2019, Stefansson was named the first president of the Nordic Society of Human Genetics and Precision Medicine. The society was formed to create a pan-Nordic framework for human genetics research and the application of genomics to healthcare across the region, with the aim of generating and integrating genomic and healthcare data from Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Estonia.

Of Indian descent, he retired in December 2006. Parmar is nicknamed the \\"Hitchin Hurricane\\". After retiring he coached British junior No. 1, Ahmed El Menshawy. He currently coaches another British junior, James Marsalek. Tour career =1996= Parmar competed in his first ATP tour event in Bournemouth in September 1996, in doubles. Partnering Paul Robinson, they lost in the first round in 3 sets. Parmar finished 1996 ranked World No. 720 in singles and No. 1081 in doubles. =1997= Parmar played his first tour singles matches in July, 1997, playing in two challenger events in Britain, Bristol and Manchester. Both played on grass, he lost rather handily in the first round of each event. Parmar also lost in the first round in both events in doubles. He won his first tour event in September as he and partner Jamie Delgado reached the second round in doubles at the Scottish Tennis Championships. He finished 1997 ranked World No. 464 in singles and No. 608 in doubles. =1998= Parmar played 12 Futures events in 1998 in singles, going 14 wins, 12 losses. His best result in these tournaments was a semi-finals result at Great Britain F7, played in Sunderland. He went 1 and 4 in challengers, reaching the second round of the Ahmedabad Challenger in December. In doubles play, Parmar reached 3 Futures semi-finals as well as the second round of Wimbledon, in his first grand slam appearance, partnering Luke Milligan. Parmar's peak ranking for 1998 was World No. 394 in ran, received in October, and No. 370 in doubles in August. =1999–2002= Parmar qualified for Wimbledon in 1999 beating the no.25 seed Albert Costa (ESP) W 0–6, 7–6(5), 6–3, 6–3 before losing to compatriot Greg Rusedski. During this three-year period under the guidance of his coach David Sammel he made the second round of Wimbledon three years in a row and qualified for the 2000 Australian Open. He was selected for Davis Cup regularly from 2000–2006. =2006= Rotterdam Open, Rotterdam Parmar lost in the second qualifying round in Rotterdam only to be given a lucky loser spot. He went on to beat top 100 player Paradorn Srichaphan in the 1st round, 7–6(3), 5–7, 7–6(7). In the second round he beat Dominik Meffert who was the player who beat Parmar in the Qualifying round, 6–3, 6–3. Parmar's good run ended in his quarter-final match against Christophe Rochus, losing in straight sets, 6–3, 6–3. Davis Cup Euro-Asia Group One, vs Serbia and Montenegro As Andy Murray was injured and could not play in the 1st day's play, Parmar took his place in the 1st rubber of the tie against Serbia and Montenegro against Novak Djokovic and Parmar lost in straight sets 6–3, 6–2, 7–5. Parmar also played in the last rubber as Serbia and Montenegro won the tie as Novak Djokovic beat Greg Rusedski in the previous rubber so making the final rubber a dead-rubber as it gave Serbia & Montenegro an unassailable 3–1 lead. So therefore Andy Murray did not play. Parmar did well, although the Davis Cup tie was already decided, winning in straight sets over Ilija Bozoljac 7–5, 6–4.

It functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription of genes via chromatin remodeling by allowing histone proteins to wrap DNA less tightly. This enzyme plays an essential role in regulating cell growth and division, prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions (differentiate), and preventing the growth of cancerous tumors. The p300 protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth. The EP300 gene is located on the long (q) arm of the human chromosome 22 at position 13.2. This gene encodes the adenovirus E1A-associated cellular p300 transcriptional co- activator protein. EP300 is closely related to another gene, CREB binding protein, which is found on human chromosome 16.  Function  p300 HAT functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription via chromatin remodeling, and is important in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. It mediates cAMP-gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. p300 HAT contains a bromodomain which is involved in IL6 signaling. This gene has also been identified as a co- activator of HIF1A (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha), and, thus, plays a role in the stimulation of hypoxia-induced genes such as VEGF.  Mechanism  The p300 protein carries out its function of activating transcription by binding to transcription factors, and the transcription machinery. On the basis of this function, p300 is called a transcriptional coactivator. The p300 interaction with transcription factors is managed by one or more of p300 domains: the nuclear receptor interaction domain (RID), the KIX domain (CREB and MYB interaction domain), the cysteine/histidine regions (TAZ1/CH1 and TAZ2/CH3) and the interferon response binding domain (IBiD). The last four domains, KIX, TAZ1, TAZ2 and IBiD of p300, each bind tightly to a sequence spanning both transactivation domains 9aaTADs of transcription factor p53.;  Clinical significance  Mutations in the EP300 gene are responsible for a small percentage of cases of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. These mutations result in the loss of one copy of the gene in each cell, which reduces the amount of p300 protein by half. Some mutations lead to the production of a very short, nonfunctional version of the p300 protein, while others prevent one copy of the gene from making any protein at all. Although researchers do not know how a reduction in the amount of p300 protein leads to the specific features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is clear that the loss of one copy of the EP300 gene disrupts normal development. Chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 22 have rarely been associated with certain types of cancer. These rearrangements, called translocations, disrupt the region of chromosome 22 that contains the EP300 gene. For example, researchers have found a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 22 in several people with a cancer of blood cells called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Another translocation, involving chromosomes 11 and 22, has been found in a small number of people who have undergone cancer treatment. This chromosomal change is associated with the development of AML following chemotherapy for other forms of cancer. Mutations in the EP300 gene have been identified in several other types of cancer. These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Somatic mutations in the EP300 gene have been found in a small number of solid tumors, including cancers of the colon and rectum, stomach, breast, and pancreas. Studies suggest that EP300 mutations may also play a role in the development of some prostate cancers, and could help predict whether these tumors will increase in size or spread to other parts of the body. In cancer cells, EP300 mutations prevent the gene from producing any functional protein. Without p300, cells cannot effectively restrain growth and division, which can allow cancerous tumors to form.

Early life, family Parker was born near Freehold Township, New Jersey to Charles and Sarah (Coward) Parker. His father was a member of the New Jersey Legislature for several years, and served one term as state treasurer. Joel attended the College of New Jersey (later known as Princeton University), graduating in the class of 1839. He worked in the law office of Henry W. Green and was admitted to the bar in 1842. He married Maria Mott-Gummere in 1843 and the couple had two sons and a daughter. Political career A Democrat, he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1847, where he served until 1851 when he was appointed the \\"prosecutor of pleas\\" of Monmouth County. He continued to be active in politics and served as a New Jersey elector in the 1860 presidential election, casting his vote for Stephen A. Douglas. In 1860, New Jersey Governor Charles Smith Olden appointed Parker Major General of the New Jersey militia. Governor He was nominated for governor by the Democratic Party in 1862, and ran as a \\"War Democrat\\" who supported a military solution to the American Civil War rather than accommodation of the Confederacy. He defeated Marcus L. Ward by the largest margin in New Jersey history up to that time. Although staunchly in favor of the war, Parker was also highly critical of the Lincoln Administration's actions with respect to curtailing civil liberties in the name of the war effort, castigating Lincoln for suspending habeas corpus and for what Parker considered the unconstitutional nature of the Emancipation Proclamation. During Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania in 1863, Parker supplied several organized regiments of New Jersey volunteers that were sent to protect that state, but when a levy of 12,000 men was made on New Jersey in 1864, to make good a supposed deficiency in her former quotas, he obtained from President Lincoln the withdrawal of the order. In 1863, Parker attended the ceremonies dedicating the Soldiers' National Cemetery at which Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address. Parker established a method of settlement of the war debt so that not a bond of the state of New Jersey was sold below par, and at the close of the war in 1865 there was a surplus of $200,000 in the state treasury. He strongly favored amnesty toward those that had actively supported the Confederacy in the Civil War. He was the \\"favorite son\\" candidate supported by New Jersey electors at the Democratic National Conventions in 1868, 1876, and 1880. In 1868, the New Jersey delegation cast their full vote for him in every ballot for the presidential nomination. Parker was re-elected governor in 1871 and served until 1874. He was then Attorney General of New Jersey in 1875 and later served as a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court from 1880–1888. Later life After serving as governor, Parker returned to the practice of law. He died on January 2, 1888, in Philadelphia. He was buried in Maplewood Cemetery, in Freehold Township, New Jersey.

In most European countries, blackletter typefaces like the German Fraktur were displaced with the creation of the Antiqua typefaces in the 15th and 16th centuries. However, in Germany, both fonts coexisted until the first half of the 20th century. During that time, both typefaces gained ideological connotations in Germany, which led to long and heated disputes on what was the \\"correct\\" typeface to use. The eventual outcome was that the Antiqua-type fonts won when the Nazi Party chose to phase out the more ornate-looking Fraktur.  Origin  Two typefaces: the German text uses Fraktur; Latin and French words and numerals are written in Antiqua. 1768 Historically, the dispute originates in the differing use of these two typefaces in most intellectual texts. Whereas Fraktur was preferred for works written in German, for Latin texts, Antiqua-type typefaces were normally used. This extended even to English–German dictionaries. For example, the English words would all be written in Antiqua, and the German words in Fraktur. Originally this was simply a convention.  19th century  Conflict over the two typefaces first came to a head after the occupation of Germany and dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire by Napoleon in 1806, which led to a period in the history of Germany in which nationalists began to attempt to define what cultural values were common to all Germans. There was a massive effort to canonize the German national literature—for example, the Grimm Brothers' collection of fairy tales—and to create a unified German grammar. In the context of these debates, the two typefaces became increasingly polarized: Antiqua typefaces were seen to be \\"un-German\\", and they were seen to represent this by virtue of their connotations as \\"shallow\\", \\"light\\", and \\"not serious\\". In contrast, Fraktur, with its much darker and denser script, was viewed as representing the allegedly German virtues such as depth and sobriety. During the Romantic Era, in which the Middle Ages were glorified, the Fraktur typefaces additionally gained the (historically incorrect) interpretation that they represented German Gothicism. For instance, Goethe's mother advised her son, who had taken to the clear Antiqua typefaces, to remain—\\"for God's sake\\"—German, even in his letters. Otto von Bismarck was a keen supporter of German typefaces. He refused gifts of German books in Antiqua typefaces and returned them to sender with the statement ' (I don't read German books in Latin letters!).Adolf Reinecke, ', Leipzig, Hasert, 1910, p. 79.  20th century  The dispute between Antiqua and Fraktur continued well into the 20th century. Arguments for Fraktur were not only based on historical and cultural perceptions, but also on the claim that Fraktur was more suited for printing German and other Germanic languages, as their proponents claimed it to be more readable than Antiqua for this purpose. A 1910 publication by Adolf Reinecke, , claims the following advantages for using Fraktur as the German script: * German script is a real reading script: it is more readable, i.e. the word images are clearer, than Latin script.Reinecke, pp. 42, 44. * German script is more compact in printing, which is an advantage for fast recognition of word images while reading. * German script is more suitable for expressing German language, as it is more adapted to the characteristics of the German language than the Latin script. * German script does not cause nearsightedness and is healthier for the eyes than Latin script.Reinecke, pp. 42, 49. * German script is still prone to development; Latin script is set in stone. * German script can be read and understood all over the world, where it is actually often used as ornamental script. * German script makes it easier for foreigners to understand the German language.Reinecke, pp. 58–59. * Latin script will gradually lose its position as international script through the progress of the Anglo-Saxon world (here the author states that \\"Anglo-Saxons in the UK, the United States and Australia are still 'Germanic' enough to annihilate the Latin-scriptler's dream of a Latin 'world-script).Reinecke, p. 62. * The use of Latin script for German language will promote its infestation with foreign words. * German script does not impede at all the proliferation of German language and German culture in other countries. On 4 May 1911, a peak in the dispute was reached during a vote in the . The ' (\\"Association for Antiqua\\") had submitted a proposition to make Antiqua the official typeface (Fraktur had been the official typeface since the foundation of the German Empire) and no longer teach German (blackletter cursive) in the schools. After a long and, in places, very emotional debate, the proposition was narrowly rejected 85–82. Nazis had a complex and variable relationship with Fraktur. Adolf Hitler personally disliked the typeface. In fact, as early as 1934 he denounced its continued use in a speech to the :from ' Issue 250, 7 September 1934. Nonetheless, Fraktur typefaces were particularly heavily used during the early years of the National Socialist era, when they were initially represented as true German script. In fact, the press was scolded for its frequent use of \\"Roman characters\\" under \\"Jewish influence\\", and German émigrés were urged to use only \\"German script\\".Eric Michaud, The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany, tr. Janet Lloyd, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2004, , pp. 215–16 and Plate 110. However Hitler's distaste for the script saw it officially discontinued in 1941 in a (\\"edict on script\\") signed by Martin Bormann.Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German) The memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the NSDAP letterhead is printed in Fraktur. \\"For general attention, on behalf of the , I make the following announcement: It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Jew letters were forcefully introduced. Today the , talking with Amann and Book Publisher Adolf Müller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools. The use of the Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script. On behalf of the , Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\\". One of the motivations seems to have been compatibility with other European languages. The edict mentions publications destined for foreign countries, Antiqua would be more legible to those living in the occupied areas; the impetus for a rapid change in policy probably came from Joseph Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry.Michaud, pp. 216–17. Readers outside German-speaking countries were largely unfamiliar with Fraktur typefaces. Foreign fonts and machinery could be used for the production of propaganda and other materials in local languages, but not so easily in German as long as the official preference for Fraktur remained. Bormann's edict of 3 January 1941 at first forbade only the use of blackletter typefaces. A second memorandum banned the use of handwriting, including , which had only been introduced in the 1920s. From the academic year 1941/42 onwards, only the so-called ' (\\"normal script\\"), which had hitherto been taught alongside under the name of \\"Latin script\\", was allowed to be used and taught, did remain in use until 1945 for some applications such as cloth military insignia badges.  After the Second World War  After the Second World War, the Sütterlin script was once again taught in the schools of some German states as an additional script, but it could not hold out against the usage of Latin cursive scripts. Nowadays, since few people who can read Kurrent remain, most old letters, diaries, etc. remain inaccessible for all but the most elderly German speakers. As a consequence, most German-speaking people today find it difficult to decipher their own parents' or grandparents' letters, diaries, or certificates. However, the Fraktur script remains present in everyday life in some pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain sense of rusticity and oldness. However, the letterforms used in many of these more recent applications deviate from the traditional letterforms, specifically in the frequent untraditional use of the round s instead of the long s (ſ) at the beginning of a syllable, the omission of ligatures, and the use of letter- forms more similar to Antiqua for certain especially hard-to-read Fraktur letters such as k. Books wholly written in Fraktur are nowadays read mostly for particular interests. Since many people have difficulty understanding blackletter, they may have trouble accessing older editions of literary works in German. A few organizations such as the ' continue to advocate the use of Fraktur typefaces, highlighting their cultural and historical heritage and their advantages when used for printing Germanic languages. But these organizations are small, somewhat sectarian, and not particularly well known in Germany. In the United States, Mexico, and Central America, Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Old Colony Mennonite schools still teach the Kurrent handwriting and Fraktur script. German books printed by Amish and Mennonite printers use the Fraktur script.  References   Further reading  * Silvia Hartmann: '. Lang, Frankfurt am Main u.a. 1998, * Christina Killius: '.

The leaves are alternate, divided into a symmetrical pair of large leaflets long and broad. The flowers are small, with five white petals, produced in panicles. The fruit is a pod containing a single seed. The timber is desirable, but difficult to work. Distribution The species of the genus range from southeastern Brazil through northern South America, Panama, Costa Rica, and Trinidad, with the majority of species in the Amazon Basin. P. mexicana is a geographic outlier, native to the Mexican state of Guerrero.Sotuyo, Solange. \\"El palo morado (Peltogyne mexicana), una leguminosa maderable con futuro incierto y parientes lejanos\\". Revista Digital Universitaria, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico. Accessed 25 April 2015. Overharvesting has caused several species to become endangered in areas where they were once abundant. Wood The trees are prized for their beautiful heartwood which, when cut, quickly turns from a light brown to a rich purple color. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light darkens the wood to a brown color with a slight hue of the original purple. This effect can be minimized with a finish containing a UV inhibitor. The dry timber is very hard, stiff, and dense with a specific gravity of 0.86 (). Purpleheart is correspondingly difficult to work with. It is very durable and water- resistant. Uses and hazards Purpleheart is prized for use in fine inlay work especially on musical instruments, guitar fret boards (although rarely), woodturning, cabinetry, flooring, and furniture. The timber is also valuable in applications that require toughness, such as truck decking. Exposure to the dust generated by cutting and sanding purpleheart can cause irritation and nausea, possibly due to the presence of dalbergione (neoflavonoid) compounds in the wood. This also makes purpleheart wood unsuitable to most people for use in jewelry.Peltogyne in BoDD - Botanical Dermatology Database Purpleheart is also a fairly expensive wood, which is why it is usually used in smaller- scale projects.

She is best known for the three House of Kendreth novels, published 1970 to 1983. Her legal name is Eileen Joyce Rutter. Biography Eileen Joyce \\"Joy\\" Chant was born in London. She began writing in her early teens, and began publishing fiction while working as a Schools Librarian in London. She attended college in Wales, where her father had been stationed during World War II. Later, she lived with her husband and children in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Works Chant's first novel was Red Moon and Black Mountain, a parallel world fiction. According to the author, it was based on elaborate fantasy legends and imaginary games she began enacting and writing as a young child. After learning to read at two and a half, she mostly read folklore and mythology, not knowing of adult fantasy until she was twenty.Joy Chant, afterword to When Voiha Wakes (Ballantine, 1983). As for Vandarei: \\"... it began as a playworld, the sort that a lot of children have, and I was of course the Queen, the character about whom I created the adventures. But I had the disposition of a pedant. I didn't really want to pretend: I wanted to know, to be sure, to get it right. So even in its childish form this playworld tended to become concise, factual. As I grew older, horses became a passion and the playworld developed into \\"Equitania\\"—the horse motif strengthening. During this time the history of the country itself assumed an importance and I began to actually write. At fifteen, however, the last links with \\"Equitania\\" wavered and the name \\"Vandarei\\" appeared. The Queen was abandoned and ceased to be an avatar of myself, becoming a character whom I manipulated, but with whom I no longer especially identified.\\" Red Moon and Black Mountain was published in the U.K. by George Allen & Unwin in 1970, and in the U.S. by Ballantine Books in 1971 as part of its celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, with a cover illustration by Bob Pepper. The House of Kendreth series comprises Red Moon and two related books, The Grey Mane of Morning (1977) and When Voiha Wakes (1983), as well as a short story, \\"The Coming of the Starborn\\" (1983). Chant's other major work is The High Kings (1983), illustrated by George Sharp, designed by David Larkin and edited by Ian and Betty Ballantine. It is a reference work on the King Arthur legends and the Matter of Britain, incorporating retellings of the legends. She has also written numerous articles on fantasy fiction. =Fantasy novels= ; House of Kendreth series * Red Moon and Black Mountain (1970) * The Grey Mane of Morning (1977) * When Voiha Wakes (1983) =Nonfiction= * Fantasy and Allegory in Literature for Young Readers (1971) * The High Kings (1983, George Allen & Unwin), with Ian and Betty Ballantine, George Sharp, and David Larkin in collaboration; revised edition 1989, Allen & Unwin =Short stories= * \\"The Coming of the Starborn\\", Lands of Never, ed.

Company for its electrically heated windshield technology. Instaclear was the name used sometimes in the United States. First seen on the Rolls Royce in 1969 then the 1985 Ford Scorpio/Granada Mk. III in Europe Ford Channels Hank Scorpio for Quickclear Heated Windscreen Commercial – The News Wheel and the 1986 Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable in the U.S., the system uses a mesh of very thin heating wires, or a silver/zinc oxide coated film embedded between two layers of windscreen glass.Here's the Story of Ford's Unusual Heated Windshield – AutoTrader (archived) The overall effect when operative was defogging and defrosting of the windscreen at a very high rate. Landrover (UK) also fitted a similar screen to their Discovery range in the early 1990s, some of which were imported to Australia undetected by authorities, because at that stage they were not legal in any state. Owing to the high current draw, the system is engineered to operate only when the engine is running, and normally switches off after 10 minutes of operation. The metallic content of the glass has been shown to degrade the performance of certain windshield-mounted accessories, such as GPS navigators, telephone antennas and radar detectors. \\"Instaclear\\" was the introductory name on American models. In early promotional Ford sales literature for Europe, the feature was referred to simply as \\"Rapid Windscreen De-ice\\", but the \\"Quickclear\\" name began to appear from around 1989 onwards. The system can now be found as either standard equipment or an optional extra on most vehicles produced by Ford or its subsidiaries around the world, but in the U.S. market it was never popular. Besides the original Taurus/Sable, it appeared briefly in the Lincoln line in the early 1990s, and in some Land Rovers as well. GM has produced a somewhat similar system called Electriclear. One problem with the system is that the heating elements can sometimes stop working, leaving one side of the screen uncleared. If this is the result of burn out, total replacement of the screen is the only remedy as the wires are actually embedded in the glass, (as opposed to a rear defogger, which can usually be repaired with conductive paint). The problem is sometimes caused by the power cable coming loose from its mounting near the base of the screen. The loose cable then catches on the windscreen wiper mechanism and fatigues over time. The remedy is then to reattach the wire to the foil at the base of the screen, but this can be problematic since the system requires such high current (~30 amps). Some owners have been known to smash the screen and submit a fraudulent insurance claim for stone damage, as Quickclear screens are expensive replacement parts and many insurance policies offer a low excess (deductible) for windscreen damage. This type of screen is also known to cause serious problems with tollway recording tags unless the tag is placed in the correct area behind the rearview mirror.https://www.saneftolling.co.uk/support/support-Faq.List/#3.0.

He was the 38th Superintendent of the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, succeeding Rear Admiral Robert C. Olsen. He was succeeded by Rear Admiral J. Scott Burhoe. Rear Admiral Van Sice retired from the Coast Guard in 2007. . Retirement In 2006 Van Sice requested retirement following an investigation. . Cmdr. Jeff Carter, spokesman for the service, said information about Van Sice arose during the task force's review of the academy. Members of the task force decided the information was 'beyond the scope of their charter,' so they forwarded the matter to the Coast Guard chief of staff, Vice Adm. Robert Papp, who had formed the task force. Papp assigned another rear admiral, Larry L. Hereth, to conduct an 'administrative investigation' into the matter. Carter said the administrative review didn't play into the job switch for Van Sice and that Van Sice's new job as director of personnel management shows that his superiors still have 'confidence he can effectively serve.' Van Sice's new job puts him in charge of pay, recruiting, housing and personnel policy for the entire 56,000 member Coast Guard. By the second week in January, Burhoe, who leaves a job as Assistant Commandant for governmental and public affairs in Washington, will be in charge of the school as it deals with the fallout from two recent sexual assault cases involving cadets. The timing of the job switch, according to a statement from Papp, is based on the expected release of the task force's findings next month. Burhoe will lend a 'fresh perspective' to act on the task force's recommendations for the school. Carter said Burhoe is somebody 'who has not been involved in any of the issues the task force is looking at.' It was after Van Sice took command of the 130-year- old school that an internal investigation resulted in sexual assault charges being brought against a cadet, Webster Smith. Education Van Sice graduated in 1974 from the United States Coast Guard Academy. He later earned a Master of Science in Engineering from Purdue University and a Master of Arts degree in business from Webster College. Coast Guard assignments Rear Admiral Van Sice's first duty assignment was aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Munro (WHEC 724) where he served as Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer and Deck Watch Officer. In 1976 he graduated from Naval Flight Training in Pensacola, Florida. An aircraft commander and instructor pilot in the C-131 Convair and HU-25 Falcon aircraft, Rear Admiral Van Sice has approximately 5,000 total hours in fixed and rotary wing aircraft. Van Sice has served in a variety of command and staff assignments including Chief of Operations and Chief of Staff for the Eighth Coast Guard District in New Orleans, Louisiana, Commander of Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, Puerto Rico, and operational command experience on the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific Northwest. He served as the first Deputy Director of Operations, United States Northern Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. In this position, he advised the Commander on operations to deter, prevent, defeat, and mitigate threats and aggression aimed at the United States, its territories and interests. He ensured effective air, land, and maritime defense throughout the assigned area of responsibility to include military assistance to civil authorities. Prior to assuming the position of Superintendent at the Coast Guard Academy, Van Sice was the Director of Reserve and Training for the U.S. Coast Guard where he served as a member of the Reserve Forces Policy Board, which advises the Secretary of Defense on Reserve matters. Awards and honors His awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal (three awards), the Coast Guard Commendation Medal, Coast Guard Achievement Medal, and Commandant's Letter of Commendation Ribbon with Operational Distinguishing Device. Personal data Van Sice is a native of Wilmington, Delaware. He is married to the former Clarke Hutchinson of Wilmington, Delaware. Rear Admiral and Mrs. Van Sice have two children.

This list features the mammals, birds, fish, molluscs, butterflies, dragonflies, bees, pond damselflies, mayflies, grasshoppers and crickets that have disappeared from the Netherlands. There have been no known extinctions of reptiles or amphibians in the Netherlands. Most animals on this list of extinct animals in the Netherlands survive in other places in the world. However, some of them are now globally extinct, like the great auk (Pinguinus impennis), the European wild horse (Equus ferus) and the aurochs (Bos primigenius primigenius). One skeleton of the great auk was excavated in a Roman settlement near Velsen. Bones were also found near Rotterdam. In the Netherlands there are no bone finds of the aurochs after the Roman period (400 AD). Phengaris alcon arenaria, an endemic Dutch subspecies of the Alcon blue butterfly became extinct at the end of the 1970s. Fossilized remains of the gray whale (Eschrichtuis robustus), have been found dated to 340 BC, demonstrating that this species once roamed the North Sea, although it is no longer found there. A lower jaw of a lynx (Lynx lynx lynx) was found at the remains of a Roman settlement near Valkenburg in the Netherlands. During excavations of sites dated to the Roman period (around 400 AD) on the Rhine delta there were findings of important breeding sites of the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus). According to the hunting rights of the bishops of Utrecht we know that brown bears (Ursus arctos arctos) were still found in the Netherlands as late as the eleventh century. According to a hunting licence from Drenthe, elk (Alces alces alces) were also known to be in this country until 1025. The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), which once appeared from the Bay of Biscay to Norway, have disappeared from the waters around the Netherlands. It is suspected that the last whales were killed at the end of the Middle Ages. However, there was an alleged sighting off Texel in 2005.

In 1988 European beavers were reintroduced in the Biesbosch, and in 1994 beavers were released in the Gelderse Poort (a wilderness area between Arnhem and Nijmegen). The new beavers are doing very well; their numbers are increasing and they are spreading to other parts of the Netherlands. * Canis lupus lupus - Eurasian wolf ICUN lists the grey wolf as regionally extinct in the Netherlands . In March 2015, the first wolf in 100 years was sighted in the country . This was the first recorded, and second reported sighting following recent successful wolf reintroduction programs in neighboring Germany, with transient migrant wolves apparently occasionally crossing the border. Three wolve cubs were spotted on the Veluwe in June, 2019 * Cricetus cricetus canescens - European hamsters Under orders from the Dutch Government, in 1999 the Das&Boom; Foundation caught all the remaining European hamsters in the Netherlands. These animals were placed in a breeding programme in Diergaarde Blijdorp (Rotterdam Zoo). They were extinct in the wild, but offspring from the breeding programme have been reintroduced in a hamster reserve in Sibbe in the southern province of Limburg. In 2003 more hamsters were released in a second hamster reserve in Amby, near Maastricht. These reintroductions were followed by four more reintroductions in Heer, Sittard, Puth and Koningsbosch. The wild hamster population has now grown to c. 600 burrows (December 2006). * Felis silvestris silvestris - European wild cat The wild cat probably became extinct in the Netherlands in Roman times. The first confirmed specimen in the Netherlands since that time was a dead cat found near Groenlanden in Gelderland, while another dead animal was found in 2002 near Vaals in South Limburg. The first living cat was caught near Heeze, North Brabant in 2004 . In 2006 a wild cat was caught on camera near Vaals . These few sightings are not yet positive proof of the wildcat settling in the Netherlands, but the known range of the wildcat has been approaching the Dutch borders since the 1990s. * Lutra lutra - European otter The last lonely otter in the Netherlands was killed by a car on 17 September 1988 in the neighbourhood of Joure (Province of Friesland). The first otters were reintroduced in National Park De Weerribben (Province of Overijssel) on July 8th, 2002. By 2012 they had been released in other parts of the Netherlands as well. * Phocoena phocoena - harbour porpoise The twentieth century saw the taming of the Zuiderzee as a large enclosure dam (the Afsluitdijk) was constructed. Completed in 1932, the Zuiderzee became the IJsselmeer and large areas of water could be reclaimed for farming and housing. After this the harbour porpoise, together with the bottlenose dolphin, disappeared from the waters around the Netherlands. They came back in the 1980s. =Birds= * Ciconia ciconia - white stork Once these birds were very common in the Netherlands, but their number decreased fast in the twentieth century. 1891 was the first year that no white stork bred in the Netherlands. A conservation and reintroduction program that started in 1967 resulted in 396 pairs in 2000. * Egretta garzetta garzetta - little egret This bird became extinct in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century, due to overhunting because of their feathers which were used in the hat industry. In 1979 this bird first bred again in the Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve. The second time this bird bred again in the Netherlands was in 1994. After that year it bred yearly in the Netherlands. Their numbers are still increasing. * Grus grus - common crane In 2001, one common crane pair bred successfully after 250 years in the Fochteloërveen,Vogelbescherming Nederland KraanvogelTrouw archief Kraanvogel broedt weer a nature reserve on the border of the provinces of Friesland and Drente. Before 2001 the common crane could only be found during the migration period. * Porzana pusilla intermedia - Baillon's crake This bird was considered extinct in the Netherlands after it was last sighted breeding in 1972. In early 2005 five territorial and two breeding pairs were located again in the province of Utrecht. =Fish= * Salmo salar - Atlantic salmon The Atlantic salmon was very common in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, but disappeared when the rivers were tamed and closed by the Dutch to protect their land. The salmon could not reach their breeding ground in the rivers Rhine and Meuse. A reintroduction program resulted in salmon in the IJsselmeer and the river Rhine. =Dragonflies= * Coenagrion armatum - Norfolk damselfly In 1956 this damselfly was thought to be extinct in the Netherlands, but was rediscovered in the National Park De Weerribben on 9 May 1999.Libellennet Donkere waterjuffer * Coenagrion mercuriale - southern damselfly Was last seen in 1953, but was rediscovered in Limburg in 2011.Libellennet MercuurwaterjufferBrachytron, Nederlandse Vereniging voor Libellenstudie Mercuurwaterjuffer ook terug in Nederland! =Grasshoppers= * Tetrix bipunctata Tetrix bipunctata is a species of pygmy locust that was not recorded between 1975 and 2011.

It is the result of a merger between Friesland Foods and Campina on 31 December 2008. It is the world’s largest dairy co-operative and one of the top 5 dairy companies in the world with annual revenue of 11 billion euros (2016). FrieslandCampina has branch offices in 33 countries and employs a total of 21,927 people. Its main brands are Friesche Vlag (or Frisian Flag in Indonesian market), Chocomel, Fristi, Friso, Dutch Lady, Milner, Campina, Landliebe, Optimel, Mona and \\"Mix'it\\". FrieslandCampina’s products are sold in more than 100 countries. History Royal FrieslandCampina is organized as a cooperative, with roots going back to 1879. It has grown through mergers and takeovers. In late 1997, four Dutch dairy cooperatives merged to form Friesland Coberco Dairy Food. In June 2004, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands granted FCDF Royal status. FCDF renamed itself Royal Friesland Foods. Campina was created in 1989 by the merger of two regional dairy cooperatives, Melkunie Holland and DMV Campina. After this merger the company was named Campina Melkunie until it dropped the Melkunie part of the name in 2001. In 2004, Campina and Arla Foods, a Danish dairy cooperative, announced plans for a merger, but the plan was canceled in April 2005 for undisclosed reasons although plans for other forms of cooperation are still said to be under consideration. On 19 December 2007, Campina and Friesland Foods announced that the companies were exploring the possibility of a merger. The EU approved the merger of the two cooperatives provided that they sold off certain cheese and dairy drink divisions.Accessed 9 February 2009 Longevity Brand In Vietnam, the U.S. and Canada the company is well known for its canned condensed milk product, Sữa Ông Thọ (Longevity Brand condensed milk), popularly used in Vietnamese iced coffee with milk (Cà phê sữa đá) drinks, and in various other Vietnamese desserts. Sữa Ông Thọ was mass-produced in the Saigon-Biên Hòa area and widely consumed in the Republic of Vietnam, produced by Friesland Foods prior 1975. It was used in coffee, mixed with hot water to produce hot milk for babies and young children to drink (since fresh milk had to be imported and were thus expensive), dipped with French bread (Bánh mì) or in other dessert applications. After the 1975 Fall of Saigon, the factories manufacturing Sữa Ông Thọ, along with all other commercial and private properties were collectivized by the communists, and the facilities came under the state company Vinamilk, who continued to produce Sữa Ông Thọ condensed milk under the same name and used domestically and elsewhere in Indochina. Friesland Foods continued production of Sữa Ông Thọ - Longevity Brand after 1975 in the U.S. and Canada for the North American market, especially catering to Overseas Vietnamese consumers, and increasingly to Western consumers as the popularity of Vietnamese coffee and cuisine in general, increases. In North America, Longevity Brand - Sữa Ông Thọ is widely available in Asian supermarkets, and increasingly in conventional supermarkets.

SAGE was founded in 1965 in New York City by Sara Miller (later Sara Miller McCune) with Macmillan Publishers executive George D. McCune as a \\"mentor\\"; the name of the company is an acronym formed from the first letters of their given names. SAGE relocated to Southern California in 1966, after Miller and McCune married; McCune left Macmillan to formally join the company at that time. Sara Miller McCune remained president for 18 years, shifting to board chairman in 1984 (and still retains the title of executive chairman). The couple continued to develop the company together until George McCune's death in 1990. In 2018, SAGE reported a mean 2017 gender pay gap of 13.1% for its UK workforce, while the median was 10.3%. In 2019, products by SAGE like Lean have faced opposition by part of the academic community for being owned by a for-profit, as opposed to open data, open source and non-profit products like Unpaywall which facilitates usage of open access works.  OASPA membership SAGE Publishing was a founding member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) when it was established in 2008. In November 2013, OASPA reviewed SAGE's membership after the Journal of International Medical Research accepted a false and intentionally flawed paper created and submitted by a reporter for the journal Science as part of a \\"sting\\" to test the effectiveness of the peer-review processes of open access journals .

It was during this period he took his now-famous pseudonym from the word pelin, which means wormwood in Bulgarian. He spent 1906-07 in France, perfecting his skills in the language. By this time, he was already a popular writer. Between 1910 and 1916, he was the director of special collections at the National Library and also served as editor of numerous magazines, including the children’s publication Veselushka. Additionally, he served as a war correspondent during World War I. In 1911, one of his most famous works appeared, The Gerak Family (Bulgarian: Geratsite). It is one of the best-known pieces of Bulgarian literature and deals with a traditional village family experiencing the transition from the simplicity of rurality to the modernization of Bulgarian society, a world in which old time practices founded on family love and dedication to the land start to disappear. His second great work, Earth (Bulgarian: Zemya), was published in 1922. In this book, Pelin created a gallery of characters who identified with the national character and conscience. Pelin’s works—poems, short stories and novels—recreated the peasant and countryside atmosphere of the old Bulgaria. His predilection for short stories led him to write many, of which the humouristic Pizho and Penda is perhaps the best known. A genuine realism, with descriptions full of light and color, classify his works. Considered one of the masters of Bulgarian prose, he was also one of the initiators of Bulgarian children’s literature. His tales of Yan Bibiyan and his voyages to the moon still delight today. From 1924 until 1944, Pelin served as conservator at the Ivan Vazov Museum, all the while continuing to write, mostly for children, and be published. In 1940, he was named president of the Union of Bulgarian Writers. After the War, he managed to escape being blacklisted as a forbidden author by the Communist government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The regime chose to consider his works as those of a realistic, critical author, а precursor of Socialist Realism who, although not having correctly seized the true nature of the Bourgeois state, knew how to tell about the working life and individual revolt of exploited peasants. Earth and The Gerak Family, amongst other works, have been filmed several times (1930 and 1957, and 1958, respectively). The Bulgarian town of Elin Pelin was named after him, as is Elin Pelin Point on Smith Island, South Shetland Islands.http://www.apcbg.org/gazet-bg.doc References External links * Virtual Library of Bulgarian Literature Slovoto - library of online Bulgarian literature in Bulgarian and a number of other languages.

Dominating the image is Marie Taglioni, standing with her arms en couronne, with Grahn, Fanny Cerrito, and Carlotta Grisi paying homage around her. Lucile Alexia Grahn-Young (30 June 1819 – 4 April 1907) was the first internationally renowned Danish ballerina and one of the popular dancers of the Romantic ballet era. Grahn studied from a young age at the Royal Danish Theatre School in Copenhagen, Denmark under the tutelage of August Bournonville. She officially debuted in 1834 at the theater and took on the leading role of Astrid in Bournonville's Valdemar in 1835. Soon the relationship between Bournonville and Grahn began to sour as she yearned to dance with the famed Paris Opera Ballet. Grahn reportedly changed some of the steps in Valdemar to show off her footwork, prompting Bournonville to make a formal complaint to the theatre directors. In 1836, she created the title role in Bournonville's La Sylphide. She eventually received royal permission to leave; after her departure in 1836, she never returned to Denmark. In 1839, Grahn had overstayed the terms of her formal leave, and was dropped from the Royal Danish Ballet's rolls. She had been appearing with the Paris 'Opera' Ballet; from 1839 to 1845, extending her audience base, Grahn danced in several cities, including London, St. Petersburg, and Milan. In 1845, her place among the accepted soloists of her day was acknowledged when she was invited to dance Perrot's Pas de Quatre alongside the already famous dancers Fanny Cerrito, Carlotta Grisi, and Marie Taglioni. As the least well- known of the four, Grahn agreed to dance first. After 1846, Grahn toured much of Europe, not only dancing, but also producing several ballets, including a revival of Perrot's Catarina, and even her own play Bacchus et Ariadne. Grahn moved to Hamburg, Germany in 1848 and became so fond of the country that she built a home in Munich. Grahn retired from dancing in 1856 and was married to Friedrich Young. She became ballet mistress from 1858 to 1861 in Leipzig, Germany and from 1869 to 1875 at the Court Opera in Munich. She died in Munich in 1907, and left her generous estate to the city.

They have a well developed society due to their cultural heartland, Manila, being the capital city of the Philippines. Most of them inhabit and form a majority in the Metro Manila and Calabarzon regions of southern Luzon, as well as being the largest group in the provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, Zambales, Nueva Ecija and Aurora in Central Luzon and in the islands of Marinduque and Mindoro in Mimaropa. Etymology The commonly accepted origin for the endonym \\"Tagalog\\" is the term tagá-ilog, which means \\"people from [along] the river\\". An alternative theory states that the name is derived from tagá-alog, which means \\"people from the ford\\" (the prefix tagá- meaning \\"coming from\\" or \\"native of\\"). In 1821, American diplomat Edmund Roberts called the Tagalog \\"Tagalor\\" in his memoirs about his trips to the Philippines. History La Bulaqueña (1895) by Juan Luna depicts a woman from Bulacan, Central Luzon, wearing a traditional María Clara gown. Angono Petroglyphs, considered oldest form of art in the Philippines dated during the late Neolithic period. The Angono Petroglyphs in Rizal were most likely been made by Austronesian peoples, of which the most likely are the ancestors of the Tagalog people. There are 127 human and animal figures engraved on the rock wall, that were probably carved during the late Neolithic, or before 2000 BC. According to archaeologists, the human figures on the wall were infants, and that the ancient Tagalogs most likely believed that drawing the figures of their sick children on the 'sacred wall' would clear their children from diseases. The earliest written record of Tagalog is a late 9th-century document known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription which is about a remission of debt on behalf of the ruler of Tondo. Inscribed on it is year 822 of the Saka Era, the month of Waisaka, and the fourth day of the waning moon, which corresponds to Monday, April 21, 900 CE in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. The writing system used is the Kawi script, while the language is a variety of Old Malay, and contains numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin may be Old Javanese. Some contend it is between Old Tagalog and Old Javanese. The document states that it releases its bearers, the children of Namwaran, from a debt in gold amounting to 1 kati and 8 suwarnas (865 grams).Morrow, Paul (2006-07-14). \\"Laguna Copperplate Inscription\\" .

Around the creation of the copperplate, a complex society with sarcophagi burial practices developed in the Bondok peninsula in Quezon province. Also, the polities in Namayan, Manila, and Tondo, all in the Pasig river tributary, were established. Various Tagalog societies were also established in Calatagan, Tayabas, shores of Lake Laguna, Marinduque, and Malolos. The enhancements of these Tagalog societies until the middle of the 16th century made it possible for other Tagalog societies to spread and develop various cultural practices such as those concerning the dambana. During the reign of Sultan Bolkiah in 1485 to 1521, the Sultanate of Brunei decided to break Tondo's monopoly in the China trade by attacking Tondo and establishing Selurung as a Bruneian satellite-state.Pusat Sejarah Brunei . Retrieved February 07, 2009. The most known unification of barangays in pre-colonial Tagalog history are the unification of Tondo barangays (those at the northern edge of the Pasig river), the unification of Manila barangays (those at the southern edge of the Pasig river), the unification of Namayan barangays (those upstream of the Pasig), the unification of Kumintang barangays (those west of Batangas), and the unification of Pangil barangays (those east and south of Laguna de Bay). The first two barangay unification were most likely triggered by conflicts between the two Tagalog sides of the river, while the Namayan unification was most likely triggered by economic means as all trade between the barangays around Laguna de Bay and barangays at Manila Bay need to pass through Namayan via the Pasig river. The unification of Kumintang barangays was probably due to economic ties as traders from East Asia flocked the area, while the unification of Pangil barangays was said to be due to a certain Gat Pangilwhil unified the barangays under his lakanship. Present-day Tondo is the southern section of Manila's Tondo district, while present-day Maynila is Manila's Intramuros district. Present-day Namayan is Manila's Santa Ana district. Present-day Pangil is the eastern and southern shores of Laguna and a small portion of northern Quezon province. Present-day Kumintang is the areas of western Batangas. The Kumintang barangays are sometimes referred as the 'homeland' of the Tagalog people, however, it is contested by the Tagalogs of Manila. Tomé Pires noted that the Luções or people from Luzon were \\"mostly heathen\\" and were not much esteemed in Malacca at the time he was there, although he also noted that they were strong, industrious, given to useful pursuits. Pires' exploration led him to discover that in their own country, the Luções had foodstuffs, wax, honey, inferior grade gold, had no king, and were governed instead by a group of elders. They traded with tribes from Borneo and Indonesia and Filipino historians note that the language of the Luções was one of the 80 different languages spoken in Malacca.Chinese Muslims in Malaysia, History and Development by Rosey Wang Ma When Magellan's ship arrived in the Philippines, Pigafetta noted that there were Luções there collecting sandalwood. Contact with the rest of Southeast Asia led to the creation of Baybayin script that was later used in the book Doctrina Cristiana, which is written by the 16th century Spanish colonizers. Costume typical of a family belonging to the Principalía wearing Barong Tagalog and baro't saya. On May 19, 1571, Miguel López de Legazpi gave the title \\"city\\" to the colony of Manila. The title was certified on June 19, 1572. Under Spain, Manila became the colonial entrepot in the Far East. The Philippines was a Spanish colony administered under the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Governor-General of the Philippines who ruled from Manila was sub-ordinate to the Viceroy in Mexico City.The Philippines was an autonomous Captaincy-General under the Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1521 until 1815 Throughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen, including Vocabulario de la lengua tagala by Pedro de San Buenaventura (Pila, Laguna, 1613), Pablo Clain's Vocabulario de la lengua tagala (beginning of the 18th century), Vocabulario de la lengua tagala (1835), and Arte de la lengua tagala y manual tagalog para la administración de los Santos Sacramentos (1850) in addition to early studies of the language. The first substantial dictionary of Tagalog language was written by the Czech Jesuit missionary Pablo Clain in the beginning of the 18th century.Juan José de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, Manila 2013, pg iv, Komision sa Wikang Filipino Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P. Juan de Noceda and P. Pedro de Sanlucar and published as Vocabulario de la lengua tagala in Manila in 1754 and then repeatedly re- edited, with the last edition being in 2013 in Manila.Juan José de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, Manila 2013, Komision sa Wikang Filipino. The indigenous poet Francisco Baltazar (1788–1862) is regarded as the foremost Tagalog writer, his most notable work being the early 19th-century epic Florante at Laura. Group of Tagalog revolutionaries during the Spanish-American War of 1898 Prior to Spanish arrival and Catholic seeding, the ancient Tagalog people used to cover the following: present-day Calabarzon region except the Polillo Islands, northern Quezon, Alabat island, the Bondoc Peninsula, and easternmost Quezon; Marinduque; Bulacan except for its eastern part; and southwest Nueva Ecija, as much of Nueva Ecija used to be a vast rainforest where numerous nomadic ethnic groups stayed and left. When the polities of Tondo and Maynila fell due to the Spanish, the Tagalog- majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog migration policy was implemented by Spain. This was continued by the Americans when they defeated Spain in a war. The first Asian-origin people known to arrive in North America after the beginning of European colonization were a group of Filipinos known as \\"Luzonians\\" or Luzon Indians who were part of the crew and landing party of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Señora de la Buena Esperanza. The ship set sail from Macau and landed in Morro Bay in what is now the California coast on October 17, 1587, as part of the Galleon Trade between the Spanish East Indies (the colonial name for what would become the Philippines) and New Spain (Spain's Viceroyalty in North America). More Filipino sailors arrived along the California coast when both places were part of the Spanish Empire. By 1763, \\"Manila men\\" or \\"Tagalas\\" had established a settlement called St. Malo on the outskirts of New Orleans, Louisiana. Philippine Republic and used during the Philippine Revolution which is mainly used by the Tagalog revolutionaries. Andrés Bonifacio, one of the founders of Katipunan. The Tagalog played an active role during the 1896 Philippine Revolution and many of its leaders were either from Manila or surrounding provinces. The Katipunan once intended to name the Philippines as \\"Katagalugan\\" or the Tagalog Republic, and extended the meaning of these terms to all natives in the Philippine islands. Miguel de Unamuno described revolutionary leader José Rizal (1861–1896) as the \\"Tagalog Hamlet\\" and said of him “a soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it. He pivots between fear and hope, between faith and despair.”Miguel de Unamuno, \\"The Tagalog Hamlet\\" in Rizal: Contrary Essays, edited by D. Feria and P. Daroy (Manila: National Book Store, 1968). In 1902, Macario Sakay formed his own Republika ng Katagalugan in the mountains of Morong (today, the province of Rizal), and held the presidency with Francisco Carreón as vice president. Tagalog was declared the official language by the first constitution in the Philippines, the Constitution of Biak-na-Bato in 1897. In 1935, the Philippine constitution designated English and Spanish as official languages, but mandated the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages. After study and deliberation, the National Language Institute, a committee composed of seven members who represented various regions in the Philippines, chose Tagalog as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines. President Manuel L. Quezon then, on December 30, 1937, proclaimed the selection of the Tagalog language to be used as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines. In 1939, President Quezon renamed the proposed Tagalog-based national language as wikang pambansâ (national language). In 1959, the language was further renamed as \\"Pilipino\\". The 1973 constitution designated the Tagalog-based \\"Pilipino\\", along with English, as an official language and mandated the development and formal adoption of a common national language to be known as Filipino. The 1987 constitution designated Filipino as the national language mandating that as it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.Gonzales, A. (1998). Language planning situation in the Philippines. Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 19(5), 487–525. Society The Tagalog number around 30 million, making them the largest indigenous Filipino ethno-linguistic group in the country. The second largest is the Sebwano with around 20 million. Tagalog settlements are generally lowland, and are commonly sited on the banks near the delta and \\"wawà\\" or mouth of a river. The traditional clothing of the Tagalog, the Barong Tagalog, is the folk costume of the Philippines, while the national language of the Philippines, which is Filipino, is derived mainly from the Tagalog language. The Tagalog mostly practice Christianity (majority Catholicism and minority Protestantism) with a minority practicing Islam, Buddhism, Anitism (indigenous Tagalog religion), and other religions as well as no religion. =Cuisine= Sinigang, a Filipino soup or stew to have come from the Tagalogs, is commonly served across the country with other versions found in the rest of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Sinigang is therefore a very popular dish in all of the Philippines. Bulacan is popular for chicharon (crunchy pork rind), steamed rice and tuber cakes like puto. It is a center for panghimagas or desserts, like brown rice cake or kutsinta, sapin-sapin, suman, cassava cake, halaya ube and the king of sweets, in San Miguel, Bulacan, the famous carabao milk candy pastillas de leche, with its pabalat wrapper.\\"100% Pinoy: Pinoy Panghimagas\\".

Antipolo, the capital of Rizal province, straddled mid-level in the mountainous regions of the Philippine Sierra Madre, is a city known for its suman and cashew products. Cainta, also in Rizal, is also known for its suman rice cakes and puddings. These are usually topped with latik, a mixture of coconut milk and brown sugar, reduced to a dry crumbly texture. A more modern and time saving alternative to latik are coconut flakes toasted in a frying pan. Laguna is known for buko pie (coconut pie) and panutsa (peanut brittle). Batangas is home to Taal Lake, a body of water that surrounds Taal Volcano. The lake is home to 75 species of freshwater fish. Among these, the maliputo and tawilis are two not commonly found elsewhere. These fish are delicious native delicacies. Batangas is also known for its special coffee, the strong-tasting kapeng barako. Bistek Tagalog is a dish of strips of sirloin beef slowly cooked in soy sauce, calamansi juice, vinegar and onions. Records have also shown that kare-kare is the Tagalog dish that the Spanish first tasted when they landed in pre-colonial Tondo.Filipino Fried Steak – Bistek Tagalog Recipe =Clothing= Tagalog clothing during the 19th century. From Aventures d'un Gentilhomme Breton aux iles Philippines by Paul de la Gironiere, published in 1855. A working-class Tagalog man, c. 1900 A Tagalog woman in traditional dress, c. 1900 The majority of Tagalogs before colonization wore garments woven by the locals, much of which showed sophisticated designs and techniques. The Boxer Codex also illuminates the intricate and high standard in Tagalog clothing, especially among the gold-draped high society. High society members, which include the datu and the katolonan, also wore accessories made of prized materials. Slaves on the other hand wore simple clothing, seldom loincloths. During later centuries, Tagalog nobles would wear the barong tagalog for men and the baro't saya for women. When the Philippines became independent, the barong Tagalog became popularised as the national costume of the country, as the wearers were the majority in the new capital, Manila. =Craftsmanship= The Tagalog people were also craftsmen. The katolanan, specifically, of each barangay is tasked as the holder of arts and culture, and usually trains craftfolks if ever no craftfolks are living in the barangay. If the barangay has a craftsfolk, the present crafts-folks would teach their crafts to gifted students. Notable crafts made by ancient Tagalogs are boats, fans, agricultural materials, livestock instruments, spears, arrows, shields, accessories, jewelries, clothing, houses, paddles, fish gears, mortar and pestles, food utensils, musical instruments, bamboo and metal wears for inscribing messages, clay wears, toys, and many others. =Belief on the soul and pangangaluluwa= The Tagalog people traditionally believe in the two forms of the soul. The first is known as the kakambal (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the kakambal may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the kakambal is travelling. When a person dies, the kakambal is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the kaluluwa (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the kaluluwa then travels to either Kasanaan (if the person was evil when he was living) or Maca (if the person was good when he was living) through sacred tomb-equipped psychopomp creatures known as buwayahttps://www.aswangproject.com/philippines-monster-islands/ or through divine intervention. Both domains are ruled by Bathala, though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups- philippines/ In addition to the belief in the kaluluwa, a tradition called pangangaluluwa sprang. The pangangaluluwa is a traditional Tagalog way of aiding ancestor spirits to arrive well in Maca (place where good spirits go) or to make ancestor spirits that may have been sent to Kasanaan/Kasamaan (place where bad spirits go) be given a chance to be cleansed and go to Maca. The tradition includes the peoples (which represent the kaluluwa of people who have passed on), and their oral tradition conducted through a recitation or song. The people also ask for alms from townsfolk, where the alms are offered to the kaluluwa afterwards. This tradition, now absorbed even in the Christian beliefs of Tagalogs, is modernly-held between October 27 to November 1, although it may be held on any day of the year if need be during the old days. The traditional pangangaluluwa song's composition is:https://www.tagaloglang.com/pangangaluluwa/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/647988/pangangaluluwa- reviving-a-dying-custom Kaluluwa’y dumaratal (The second souls are arriving); Sa tapat ng durungawan (In front of the window); Kampanilya’y tinatantang (The bells are ringing); Ginigising ang may buhay (Waking up those who still have life); Kung kami po’y lilimusan (If we are to be asked to give alms); Dali- daliin po lamang (Make it faster); Baka kami’y mapagsarhan (We may be shut); Ng Pinto ng Kalangitan (From the doors of heaven). The Kalangitan in the lyrics would have been Maca during the classical era. Additional lyrics are present in some localities. An example is the additional 4 lines from Nueva Ecija: Bukas po ng umaga (Tomorrow morning); Tayong lahat ay magsisimba (We will go to the shrine); Doon natin makikita (There, we will see); Ang misa ng kaluluwa! (The mass of the second souls!) =Belief on dreams= The Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of Bathala. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as tigmamanukan, or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'. Additionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the kakambal soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a bangungot creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the kakambal soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the- world =Belief on the cosmos= Ancient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was Bathala, as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, Tala is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called Laho, instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses diminishes within minutes.https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/ Additionally, the Tagalogs also had their own indigenous names for various constellations. An example is Balatik (Western counterpart is Orion) which is depicted as a hunting trap.http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2019/01/22/Filipinos- astronomy-beliefs.html =Burial practices= The Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. These practices include, but not limited to, tree burials, cremation burials, sarcophagus burials, and underground burials.Tacio, Henrylito D. Death Practices Philippine Style , sunstar.com, October 30, 2005http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/asp/article/viewFile/3961/3606 In rural areas of Cavite, trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because of old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed- out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as likha is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In Pila, Laguna, a complex cremation- burial practice existed, where the body is let alone to decompose first. It is then followed by a ritual performance. The body is burned afterwards through cremation because, according to the belief of ancient people, the “spirit is as clean as though washed in gold\\" once the body is set on fire. Likha statues were also found in various cremation burial sites. In Mulanay, Quezon and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a likha statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In Calatagan, Batangas and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with likha statues. The statues, measuring 6–12 inches, are personified depictions of anitos. Likha statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means; when these statues are used as such, they are known as larauan, which literally means image. Additionally, these statues that were buried with the dead are afterwards collected and revered as representatives of the dead loved one. The statues afterwards serve as a connection of mortals to the divine and the afterlife.https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/ When the Spanish arrived, they recorded these statues in some accounts. The Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas of 1582 noted that there were even houses that contained \\"one hundred or two hundred of these idols\\". In the name colonization, the Spanish destroyed these statues throughout the archipelago. In present-time, only two statues (made of stone) have been found in good condition. These two statues are currently housed in the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila. =Sacred animals, trees, and number= The ancient Tagalogs believed that there are three fauna and three flora that are deemed the most sacred. The three sacred fauna include dogs which are blessed by the deities to guide and become allies with mankind, tigmamanukans which are the messengers of Bathala, crocodiles which are guardians of sacred swamps and believed to be psychopomps,https://www.aswangproject.com/beautiful-history-symbolism- philippine-tattoo-culture/ while the three sacred flora include coconut palms which are the first vegetation from the ashes of Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa, balete trees which are home to the supernaturals, and bamboos which is where mankind sprang from.https://sites.google.com/site/philmyths/lesson-2 The number three is believed to be sacred in ancient Tagalog beliefs. When Bathala and Ulilang Kaluluwa battled during the cosmic creation, the war lasted for three days and three nights. Additionally, Bathala had three divine daughters (Mayari, Tala, and Hanan) from a mortal women, and there are three divine abodes, namely, Maca, Kasamaan, and Kaluwalhatian. Also, there were three divine beings during the cosmic creation, Bathala, Ulilang Kaluluwa, and Galang Kaluluwa. Later on, when Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa died, Aman Sinaya and Amihan joined Bathala in the trinity of deities. In later stories, Aman Sinaya chose to dwell underneath the ocean while Amihan chose to travel throughout the middleworld. During that time, the trinity of deities became Bathala, Lakapati, and Meylupa. Meylupa was later replaced by Sitan after Meylupa chose to live as a hermit. In the most recent trinity, after Bathala died (or went into a deep slumber according to other sources), the trinity consisted of Mayari, Apolaki, and Sitan. A 2018 archaeological research found that Tagalog dogs were indeed held in high regard prior to colonization and were treated as equals, backing the oral knowledge stating that dogs are beings blessed by the deities. Dogs were buried, never as sacrificial offerings or when a master dies, but always \\"individually\\", having their own right to proper burial practices. A burial site in Santa Ana, Manila exhibited a dog which was first buried, and after a few years, the dog's human child companion who died was buried above the dog's burial, exemplifying the human prestige given to dogs in ancient Tagalog beliefs.https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2018/02/26/archaeologists- find-deformed-dog-buried-near-ancient-child-in-the- philippines/#4b89765d3897https://filipiknow.net/prehistoric-animals-in-the- philippines/ Religion The Tagalog people initially had their own unique religion, modernly known as Tagalismo as the original name of the religion is unknown and was not documented by the Spanish. Spanish accounts also call the Tagalog religion as Anitismo (or Anitism in English) and Anitheria, the former is accepted by Tagalog scholars and present-day Anitist adherents while the later is seen as a derogatory term. The practices of Tagalismo were usually done within a dambana. When the Spanish arrived, Roman Catholicism was forcefully inputted by the colonizers who tried to destroy all other religions they deemed as 'lesser' than European religions. At the present, the majority of Tagalogs belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while a relatively smaller amount belong to various Protestant sects or nationalized Christian Churches. A small number of Tagalogs, however, have managed to revert to Tagalismo/Anitismo. Some Tagalogs also adhere to Islam, although their number is extremely small and fragmented. =Anitism/Tagalismo= The pre-colonial religion of the Tagalog people was a Syncretic form of indigenous Tagalog belief systems, Hinduism, and Buddhism. The religion revolved around the community through the Katalonan and the dambana, known also as lambana in the Old Tagalog language.tribhanga http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdfPrehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History\\" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.

Roman Catholicism first arrived in Tagalog areas in the Philippines during the 16th century when the Spanish toppled the polities of Tondo and Maynila in the Pasig River. They later on imposed the European religion, and tried to replace the shamanistic belief systems of the natives. By the 18th century, majority of Tagalogs have adhered to Roman Catholicism, however, the shamanistic beliefs and other indigenous belief systems of Tagalogs were passed down secretly by the natives to the younger generations, effectively preserving their beliefs of creatures and supernatural crafts. In present time, the majority of Tagalogs continue to adhere to Roman Catholicism. The biggest Catholic procession in the Philippines is currently the Pista ng Itim na Nazareno (Feast of the Black Nazarene), which is dominantly Tagalog in nature. For Tagalog Catholics, sacred sites include cathedrals, basilicas, churches, chapels, and cemeteries. However, due to the belief systems passed down from Tagalismo, certain mountains are also valued as sacred sites, such as Mount Makiling and Mount Banahaw. Language and writing system =Indigenous= Baybayin, the traditional suyat script of the Tagalog people. An example of a Baybayin character, Ka, was used in one of the flags of Katipunan and is currently seen in some government logos. The language of the Tagalog people evolved from Old Tagalog to Modern Tagalog. Modern Tagalog has five distinct dialects: * The Northern Tagalog (Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Zambales, and Bataan) has words in- putted into it from the Kapampangan and Ilocano languages. * Southern Tagalog (Batangas and Quezon) is unique as it necessitate the use of Tagalog without the combination of the English languages. * In contrast, Central Tagalog (Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal except Tanay) is predominantly a mixture of Tagalog and English. * The Tagalog of Tanay maintains usage of the most native words despite influx from other cultures; it is the only highly preserved Tagalog dialect in mainland Luzon and is the most endangered Tagalog dialect. * Lastly, the Marinduque Tagalog dialect is known as the purest of all Tagalog dialects, as the dialect has little influence from past colonizers. The writing suyat script of the indigenous Tagalogs is the Baybayin. Only few people today know how to read and write in Baybayin. Due to this, the ancient writing script of the Tagalog has been regarded as nearly extinct. A bill in Congress has been filed to make Baybayin the country's national script, however, it is still pending in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Nowadays, the Baybayin is artistically expressed in calligraphy, as it has been traditionally. The Tagalog people are also known for their tanaga, an indigenous artistic poetic form of the Tagalog people's idioms, feelings, teachings, and ways of life. The tanaga strictly has four lines only, each having seven syllables only. =Colonial= The Tagalog people were skilled Spanish speakers from the 18th to 19th centuries due to the Spanish colonial occupation era. When the Americans arrived, English became the most important language in the 20th century. At present-time, the language of the Tagalogs are Tagalog, English, and a mix of the two, known in Tagalog pop culture as Taglish. Some Spanish words are still used by the Tagalog, though sentence construction in Spanish is no longer used. The Spanish introduced the Roman alphabet as the writing script of the Philippines in the 16th century after destroying countless documents with Baybayin suyat writings. Eventually, the Roman alphabet replaced Baybayin after the Spanish colonial government imposed sanctions, usually by force, to all natives who continue to use the native Tagalog script. Heritage towns and cities The predominantly Tagalog provinces of the Philippines possess the most heritage towns and cities in the entire country, notably due to their proximity with the capital, Manila, which is also dominated by the Tagalog people. Numerous heritage structures in the following towns and cities attract tourists annually, the most famous of which are Manila, Taal, and Malolos. At present, the Tagalog people's regions are home to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of San Agustin Church in Manila and the ASEAN Heritage Park of Mount Makiling in Laguna.

PAiA Electronics, Inc. is an American synthesizer kit company that was started by John Simonton in 1967. It sells various musical electronics kits including analog synthesizers, theremins, mixers and various music production units designed by founder John Simonton, Craig Anderton, Marvin Jones, Steve Wood and others. History Simonton founded the company in Oklahoma City in 1967 and began offering various small electronics kits through mail order. The first kit was a circuit board for the \\"Cyclops Intrusion Detector\\" for an article in the May 1968 issue of Popular Electronics. Starting in 1972 PAiA began producing analog synthesizer kits, in both modular and all-in-one form. PAiA began publishing Polyphony Magazine in 1975. It was later renamed to Electronic Musician and sold to Mix Publications in 1985. Founder Simonton continued to run the company in Oklahoma until his death in November 2005. Product marketing, sales and development were transferred to Paia Corporation in Fall, 2006. The company now operates facilities in Austin, Texas and Edmond, Oklahoma. Synthesizers In 1972, PAiA released the 2700 modular synthesizer series, which used push-buttons in lieu of a keyboard. A version with a keyboard, the 2720, was later released. The next modular series, the 4700s, featured an improved, quieter design. The P4700J series was computer controlled (using a MOS 6503 processor) that allowed polyphony for the first time on a PAiA modular synthesizer. As interest in modular synthesizers died down, PAiA stopped selling modular kits in the late 1980s and 1990s. In the early 2000s (decade), they launched the 9700 modular synthesizer line. In 1974, PAiA released the Gnome, a small, simple, keyboard-less synthesizer designed for creating non-harmonic sound effects able to run on two nine volt batteries (+9 and +18 volts). The next year they released the first programmable drum machine called the Programmable Drum Set. Later they released the Oz, another small synthesizer, this time with an 18-key keyboard. In the 1990s PAiA released the FatMan Analog MIDI Synth, a MIDI capable, monophonic, analog synthesizer. Influence For a time, the image of the audio synthesizer was that of an enormous modular system, which could take up entire walls of studios and were only available to the few musicians that could afford them (such as Keith Emerson and Wendy Carlos). PAiA's modular synthesizers, with prices starting under $1,000, were groundbreaking in their affordability and ease of use. At a time when synthesizers from Moog Music and ARP could cost anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000, PAiA's most basic modular system, the 2700, started at $230, with prices for modules ranging from $50 to $800. Simonton and Anderton's designs also anticipated many trends in modern electronics and electronic music; they released the first programmable electronic drum machine, the PAiA Programmable Drum Set, in 1975, as well as one of the first computer-controlled synthesizers, the P4700J, which used digital technology and computer connectivity to achieve polyphony and other groundbreaking features. The P4700J used a PAIA 8700 MOS 6503 processor based controller. Larry Fast used this same controller running John Simonton's \\"Pink Tunes\\" program on his Album \\"Computer Experiments, Volume One\\".

SAZ released 25 monthly packs over a period of two years, beginning in September 1994 and ending in September 1996. The group took its name from a Souls at Zero poster Flack had in his bedroom at the time, with the trailing \\"s\\" in \\"Souls\\" changed to a \\"z\\". Soulz at Zero was so well known that their name was added to the \\"Elite Acronym List,\\" which was used to separate \\"lamers\\" from \\"elite users.\\" In the 1990s, several ANSI art groups began including \\"lits\\" (electronic literary art) in their packs. Expanding on that idea, Soulz at Zero became the first dedicated online lit group. Each Soulz at Zero pack contained several original horror-themed poems and short stories. Each pack also contained an issue of \\"The Death Certificate,\\" an original nonfiction magazine which included horror-related news, articles, book and movie reviews, and interviews. Soulz at Zero's innovation was the addition of ANSI artwork, color, and VGA graphics, although the focus of the group was focused on original fiction. The packs were designed to be viewed with an included viewer, which no longer runs on modern operating systems. Soulz at Zero packs were distributed via BBS. Each month, readers could download new SAZ packs from either Where Shadows Wait (WHQ, run by The Stranger) or The Gas Chamber (US HQ, run by Jack Flack). As popularity of the group grew, so did its number of distribution sites. Before its demise, SAZ had member boards in over a dozen states and several countries including Canada and Portugal. With the introduction and growing popularity of the world wide web to the masses, Soulz at Zero slowly began to make the transition from the BBS world to the web. SAZ eventually added a web site and an FTP site to its official distribution points. In September 1996 Soulz at Zero released its last pack and disbanded, citing burnout and a general lack of public feedback/interest. In 2002, online lit group Candelabra (CND) released a Soulz at Zero spotlight that included new work from former members of SAZ, along with audio (mp3) readings, audio commentaries, and an audio history of the group as told by Jack Flack and The Stranger. The audio history was reused in the Soulz at Zero episode of You Don't Know Flack.  Packs  Each Soulz at Zero pack consisted of four types of original files: poetry, short stories, multimedia files, and the Death Certificate. Poems were usually non-rhyming, horror themed, and contained ANSI color. Short Stories were also horror related, but usually did not contain any ANSI color enhancements. Media Files included VGA pictures and occasionally WAV files. This was done as an attempt to win cross-over fans from the ANSI art. The Death Certificate was The Stranger's monthly non-fiction horror newsletter, which contained reviews and interviews.  Members  Soulz at Zero was founded by Jack Flack and The Stranger, who formed a friendship in high school over their common interests in heavy metal music and horror books and movies. Jack Flack (Rob O'Hara) was an original member of TBH405 (The Brotherhood of 405) and founded SiTH (Sick in the Head) e-zine. O'Hara has written articles for IGN, 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, the Cult of the Dead Cow, and contributed to the O'Reilly book Retro Gaming Hacks. Flack has self-published two books, Commodork: Sordid Tales from a BBS Junkie and Invading Spaces: A Beginner's Guide to Collecting Arcade Games. Flack blogs regularly at RobOHara.com. The Stranger (Stephen Alba) has self-published several books through Lulu and is currently a second grade teacher at Northridge Elementary in the Putnam City School District. The first of several SAZ packs consisted of only Jack Flack and The Stranger. The next two members to be added were Black Sunshine and Deranged.

Katherine Philips Edson (January 12, 1870 – November 5, 1933) was an American reformer and social activist who had a key role in changing the labor conditions in California and across the nation.Braitman, Jacqueline. \\"A California Stateswoman.\\" , no. 2 (1986): 8295. Biography Katherine Philips was born in Ohio in 1870. Her father was a Union surgeon in the civil war who was also a strong supporter of women's rights.Hundley, Norris. Katherine Philips Edson and the Fight for the California Minimum Wage, 1912–1923. 3rd ed. Vol. 29. University California Press, 1960. 271–85. Katherine studied in Kenton, Ohio where she attended several public schools. During her earlier years, she studied at the Covent of Sacred Heart in Clifton. She then left to Chicago in order to receive the voice training that she wanted. While in Chicago, she attended the Chicago Conservatory, where she also met Charles Edson, who eventually became her husband in 1890 (they divorced in the year 1925). Soon after getting married, Katherine and Charles moved to Antelope Valley, California where she spent the next nine years. Katherine became the active leader in the Women's Suffrage Movements while residing in Antelope Valley.Braitman, Jacqueline. \\"A California Stateswoman.\\" , no. 2 (1986): 8295. Katherine and her husband eventually decided to move to Los Angeles, California where she joined the Friday Morning Club in the year 1900. The Friday Morning club was a women's club founded by Caroline M. Severance. This club had over three thousand members at the time. The Friday Morning Club advocated for public reforms and organized local health campaigns.Braitman, Jacqueline. \\"A California Stateswoman.\\" , no. 2 (1986): 82–95. Katherine became secretary of the Friday Morning club within a year of being an active member. While a member of the club, Katherine worked on municipal reforms and she was a key component in the women suffrage amendment that was added to the state constitution in 1911. Edson strongly believed that women had important interests outside of their household work and it was their task to stand up against unhealthy conditions. She also believed that women should be treated as full citizens of the United States rather than half citizens. Edson's political activism led her to make changes within our legislation. She pushed for better working conditions as well as women's rights. The unfair treatment of women outside of their household duties, led Katherine Edson to actively fight for women's rights. Even after her death, Edson's work continued to influence activists around the United States to stand up against social injustice. Industrial Welfare Commission Katherine believed that “she was born to be a politician”.Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. Her household was filled with politically minded individuals who influenced her early participation in different social activist groups. Her father was a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1873 and supported women suffrage movements; some of which Katherine later fought for. Katherine considered her father to be the reason why she began advocating for women worker rights at an early age. Edson strived to make the nation just and fair for the “whole community engaged in the common enterprise of taking care of its own life.”Hundley, Norris. Katherine Philips Edson and the Fight for the California Minimum Wage, 1912–1923. 3rd ed. Vol. 29. University California Press, 1960. 271–85. Edson was prepared to accept partial solutions to the problems she aimed to resolve. In 1912, Edson was elected into the Council of the National Municipal League, where she worked alongside Meyer Lissner.Cherny, Robert. \\"We Are Not Keen About the Minimum Wage.\\" In California Women and Politics: From the Gold Rush to the Great Depression, 265. Nebraska: University of Nebraska, 2011. Lissner served as Edson's political mentor and appointed her to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1912.Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. Despite having to focus on the issue of public education, Edson decided to spend more of her time focusing on women's health and working conditions. She helped draft the Federation's first legislative platform and then in the year 1913 she joined the Women's Legislative Council of California.Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. Edson and about a dozen other women urged legislators and federated clubs to discuss and support measures such as the minimum wage for women.Hundley, Norris. Katherine Philips Edson and the Fight for the California Minimum Wage, 1912–1923. 3rd ed. Vol. 29. University California Press, 1960. 271–85. In 1913, she asked the president of each club in the California Federation of Women's Club to appoint a committee that would survey the community's industrial wage hours and working conditions. The survey was meant to inform other women's groups of the dire working conditions and the need for legislature to resolve these issues. While the commissioners and clubs investigated the working conditions, Katherine was busy pushing the 1913 Assembly Bill 1251, which was the minimum wage bill. Edson argued that “our potential motherhood” must be paid living wages.”Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. The supporters of Bill 1251 included Women’s Clubs, churches, and early prohibitionists. This became the most powerful political coalition of the time and displaced racetrack owners.Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. Bill 1251, however, was not supported by the labor unions. Organized labor did not want its own advocacy to be threatened by the proponents of this bill. Many of the unions were concentrated within the San Francisco area and were heavily influenced by the Catholics who at the time supported patriarchy. Labor leaders refrained from having any women workers because they feared that by creating better working conditions, the labor unions would no longer be required. The opposing views and legislatures lack of action left this Bill without action. Governor Johnson pushed the Bill five days before deferment. This bill was passed by forty-six to twelve votes. Edson’s strong activism had proven to be successful in the passing of the 1251 Bill. One of California’s most significant events came after the second decade of the twentieth century, when the progressive Republican’s rose to power. Hiram Johnson, the leading American progressive during the time, vowed to “kick the Southern Pacific Railroad out of the Republican Party” and to return state control to the voters to enact legislation for the greater good of society.Hundley, Norris. Katherine Philips Edson and the Fight for the California Minimum Wage, 1912–1923. 3rd ed. Vol. 29. University California Press, 1960. 271–85 To achieve these progressive goals, commissions were set up in order to investigate working conditions amongst other industrial accidents. By 1913 the legislature created the first Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC), whose task was to investigate the working conditions and wages of both women and children. This legislation was greatly supported by Katherine Philips Edson who was the most influential member during the time. Katherine Edson was the first woman to be appointed to the IWC as an executive committee officer, serving for nearly eighteen years (1916–1931). A lot of the accomplishments of the IWC, during the first couple of years were due to Edson's social activism. Edson drafted bills and lobbied legislature, gaining the support of many different women's groups. Additionally, under Edson's leadership a lot of the employers came to agreements with the employees during the advisory wage boards that she usually chaired. Katherine Philips Edson, 1921 With the IWC women in the United States benefited from the highest minimum wage. Working conditions were dramatically improved and the eight-hour working days were enforced. The IWC brought order where order was needed within the labor markets. Although successful, the IWC also had failures, which was most noticeable from 1921–1922. During this year, the lowering of the minimum wage had to be reversed multiple times. The Industrial Welfare Commission also failed to maintain compliance of the Southern California canners. Although the southern canners only accounted for about 15% of production, some of their northern counterparts stopped complying as well.Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. In 1931, as a result of the depression, the IWC's leadership was questioned. The agricultural industries were the ones with most women employment but they were also the hardest to regulate. The agricultural industries gained exclusion from the eight-hour law because of their “volatility typical of agricultural commodities and seasonal labor.” Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. The IWC attempted to use various methods in attempting to regulate the agricultural industries. One method enforced by the IWC was the canning audit, which allowed businesses some freedom while protecting their worker's interests and keeping regulatory costs to a bare minimum. During the last months of the year 1915, Edson published a thirty-seven-page study of The Cost of Living. The Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) interviewed about one thousand workingwomen. During these interviews, women were asked to assess their weekly salaries compared to the prices of clothing, food, and other necessities. From the gathered reports, Edson calculated that the cost of living was roughly $9.63 per week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics proved that half of the working women earned less than nine dollars a week. Soon after World War I, the cost of living according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics continued to increase. In 1920, another study was done, which resulted in the adoption of the sixteen-dollar minimum and an amendment of wage orders. By 1921, businesses slowed down in production and employers complained that the sixteen-dollar minimum was too high. The California Manufacturers’ Association petitioned for a hearing and forced the minimum wage of sixteen-dollars to be reevaluated. Other employers also joined the California Manufacturers’ Association and petitioned for a lower wage. A general wage board was established and it was supposed to recommend a minimum wage for all industries. Instead, the employers and employees caused an impasse. The commission called upon the wage board once again to see if agreement might be reached. Edson went against the pressures of business owners to reduce minimum wage but she agreed to a compromise. She reevaluated the costs of living and her calculations now led her to a fifteen-dollar minimum. The IWC accepted her newly proposed minimum wage but not without resentment from the labor. Leaders of the California State Federation of Labor criticized Edson's fifteen-dollar minimum for women workers, when she earned eighty-four dollars a week. The California State Federation filed a lawsuit to recover the money she had earned while in the six years she held an executive position. The masses demanded Edson's replacement. Katherine Edson conducted another study once more in order to keep up with the fluctuating costs of living. In September 1922 businessmen agreed to pass the sixteen-dollar wage and in December, the commission reestablished the sixteen-dollar minimum wage. The economic effect of this was better for employers than a lower minimum wage. Last years and death At the age of forty-nine, Edson had an operation in order to control blood supply to the brain. Edson was not able to return to work until after six months. In 1923, Edson's husband told her that their relationship was no longer worth keeping, and he left her. In the last half of 1923, a lump was found on her breast which was later removed and it recurred. In 1924, she was once again hospitalized due to a kidney malfunction. In 1926 and at the young age of 56, Edson suffered two severe heart attacks, and also suffered from gallstones.Casement, Diane. Katherine Philips Edson and California's Industrial Welfare Commission. Kansas: Kansas State University, 1987. 1–170. Edson was very ill during the 1930 campaign, and Rolph appointed a new head of the Division of Industrial Welfare, and legislature passed a bill, which caused Edson's termination. The newly appointed IWC head, was Mrs. Mabbel E. Kinney, who caused all of Edson's work to go to waste. Mrs. Kinney, lowered the wage standards that Edson had fought hard to maintain, causing the IWC to go inactive. Between 1923 and 1933 (her death) Edson's health had severely deteriorated. Edson advised Kinney and continued to lobby for the League of Women Voter's in order to press for a larger IWC budget. She remained politically active and was asked in 1933 to accept the job of writing the National Recovery Administration's canning code but was too ill to accept it. Katherine Philips Edson died on November 5, 1933.

This gene encodes a nucleolar protein with an LIS1 homology domain. The protein is involved in ribosomal DNA gene transcription through its interaction with upstream binding factor (UBF). Mutations in this gene have been associated with Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder which includes abnormal craniofacial development. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, but only three of them have been characterized to date. TCOF1 is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein called treacle. This protein is active during early embryonic development in structures that become bones and other tissues in the face. Although the precise function of this protein is unknown, researchers believe that it plays a critical role in the development of facial bones and related structures. Studies suggest that treacle is involved in the production of a molecule called ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within cells. Treacle is active in the nucleolus, which is a small region inside the nucleus where rRNA is produced. As a major component of cell structures called ribosomes, rRNA is essential for the assembly of proteins. Aside from its interaction with UBF, treacle has been implicated in the methylation of the precursor to mature ribosomal RNA by interaction with the nucleolar protein pNop56. The TCOF1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 between positions 32 and 33.1, from base pair 149,717,427 to base pair 149,760,047. Related diseases More than 120 mutations in the TCOF gene have been identified in people with Treacher Collins syndrome. Most of these mutations insert or delete a small number of DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TCOF1 gene. TCOF1 mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of treacle or prevent the cell from producing this protein. Researchers speculate that a loss of treacle reduces the production of rRNA in parts of the embryo that develop into facial bones and tissues. It is not known how loss of the treacle protein causes the specific problems with facial development found in Treacher Collins syndrome. For instance, mutations in the TCOF gene of these individuals often result in a cleft palate.Dixon MJ, Marazita ML, Beaty TH, Murray JC (2011). \\"Cleft lip and palate: understanding genetic and environmental influences\\". Nature Reviews Genetics (12): 167-178. Model organisms Mutations in this gene in Jindo dogs have been associated to the observed cranial differences between Jindo and boxer dogs.

They allow air to reach the skin (\\"breathable\\"). Some breathable tapes such as kinesiology tape, and other elastic bandages with adhesive are made of cotton. Surgical tape is often white because it contains zinc oxide, which is added to help prevent infections. Tapes made of porous material, such as 3M Micropore, are widely used. Some types are commonly used in sports to add a non-slip wrapping to things which must be gripped, such as tennis racquets, and hockey and lacrosse sticks, because of their rough texture and removability leaving little residue. History Primitive surgical tape, or sparadrapum probably consisted of strips of cloth impregnated with some type of plaster or sticky gum, which was applied over gauzes or wound dressings to hold them in place. Plaster casts over fractures were sometimes called \\"Spanish dressings\\" In early modern times an Italian a description appears in the thirteenth century, where surgical tape was recorded as sparadrappo, although there were some variations of spelling. In French it first appears in 1314 as speradrapu, and in Spanish it was documented as espadrapo around 1495. Linguistically it is possible that in European Romance languagesEtimología de Chile: ESPARADRAPO: * the first linguistic element spara could come Latin separāre (separate), itself composed verb parāre (prepare, arrange), and linked to a root Indo-European per (Ə)´ -1 (procure, disposal). * The second element comes from Latin 'drappus (cloth or rag), and appears in the fifth century BCE work of the Greek medical writer Oribasius, who speculates that term may relate to a Celtic loan word. Types of surgical tape There are many types of surgical tape classified according to the material of which the tape itself is constituted and the qualities of the applied adhesive, which should be hypoallergenic. The most common types are either fragile tape (such as paper, which tears easily) or tear-resistant (often fabric or plastic) and some of these may also be either waterproof or breathable or both water-resistant and partly-porous, allowing some limited passage of air and moisture. A bandage should have appropriate adhesive power, breathable and at the same time impermeable, easy to remove without irritating the skin, resistant to extreme temperatures, aging and solar radiation. Surgical tapes for medical use are subject to the requirements contained in internationally recognized standards such as the ASTM International ASTM PSTC / 6 standard.ASTM STANDARDS ON Pressure Sensitive Adhesive tape At the early 21st century the most common choices of plain surgical tape dressings sold include: * either rolls or pre-cut and individually packaged * transparent, white or \\"skin\\" colour (although colour is then poorly adapted to specific types of skin, especially non-European), * rigid or expandable/elastic, allowing to fix a dressing in place or else flex next to skeletal joints, * waterproof or absorbent.

Lovelace and his church received brief international attention in May 2005 over a controversial sign on church grounds that stated, \\"The Koran needs to be flushed!\\" This appeared in The Daily Courier, the local newspaper covering Forest City, in a story written by Josh Humphries shortly after a May 1, 2005, report in Newsweek that United States officials had flushed a Koran down a toilet at Guantanamo Bay (see Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005). That statement proved to be false and Newsweek apologized on May 15. Apparently a Koran had been desecrated in some way, but not involving a toilet. The original report received widespread international attention and sparked protests in Muslim countries. 15 people in Afghanistan died in a protest riot over the story. Lovelace and his church posted the sign as the Newsweek controversy unfolded. This inflammatory message received attention from the Associated Press, all major United States news networks, and various international publications. In a May 25 MSNBC interview, Lovelace denied that his congregation desecrated any actual Korans. Unapologetic for the sign, he said the message was \\"a figure of speech.\\" In conservative Christian theology Muslims cannot enter heaven. From a Christianity Today story about the Danieltown Baptist Church sign, \\"Muslims have a saying: 'Kill me, but do not mock my faith.' In Islamic jurisprudence, blasphemy is considered a capital crime, and the laws of states such as Pakistan reflect this. Muslims around the world will feel this sign is an attack on their honor, and in Muslim cultures honor can only be avenged with blood. Inevitably local Christians in Iraq and Pakistan, missionaries, and anyone with white skin will be considered fair game, as will church buildings.\\" No specific attacks on Christians or United States citizens have been linked to this incident. Following two days of intense and universally negative press coverage, Lovelace issued an apology. On June 8, 2005 the Associated Baptist Press reported that Danieltown Baptist Church had withdrawn from the Southern Baptist Convention, the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and the local Sandy Run Baptist Association. Lovelace graduated from Chase High School in 2000 and was previously active in the school's Future Farmers of America program serving as Chapter President for two terms 1998-2000 and as Western Regional N.C. Vice President (1999–2000). He also advocates a King James Only position by promoting the Defined King James Bible and his annual \\"Bible Revivals.\\" He is married to Heather Foss. He also served as past state chairman of the North Carolina Constitution Party but left switching his party affiliation to Republican. In 2008 he endorsed U.S. Congressman Ron Paul for president. He is also a member of the Pro Geocentric Association for Biblical Astronomy. In 2011, his first book, It Could Happen To You was published by Tate Publishing of Mustang, Oklahoma.

Alfredo Volpi (April 14, 1896 - May 28, 1988), was a prominent painter of the artistic and cultural Brazilian modernist movement. He was born in Lucca, Italy but, less than two years later, he was brought by his parents to São Paulo, Brazil, became a Brazilian citizen, and lived for the majority of his life. He was one of the most important artists of the so-called Grupo Santa Helena, formed in the 1930s with Francisco Rebolo, Clóvis Graciano, Mario Zanini, Fulvio Pennacchi, and others. Early period Volpi was a self-taught painter, producing his first naturalist painting in 1914 at the age of twelve. Although his first paintings could resemble, in some way, those of expressionist artists, (an early influence was the Brazilian landscape painter Ernesto de Fiori). Mogi das Cruzes, a landscape painted for a patron in 1939, is a representative work of this period. He soon focused into a most peculiar style, using geometric abstract forms and switching from oil paint to tempera. Volpi's first one-man exhibition was held at the Itá Gallery in São Paulo in 1944. Later career Volpi started painting façades of houses in a highly stylized and colorful manner (these paintings were later named the \\"historical façades\\" by art critics) and this recurrent theme became pervasive all through the 1950s, after a brief \\"concretist\\" period (even though the artist himself never acknowledged being part of the concretist movement as such). The 1960s witnessed the development of his trademark \\"bandeirinhas\\" (small flags) for which Volpi became famous and which originated from Brazilian folklore (small flags are a regular fixture of the popular festa junina, held every year during the month of June): the artist would use the small-flag pattern to show an increasing sense of color combination and balanced composition which would eventually place him among the major Brazilian artists of his time. The painter gained national renown with his participation at the second São Paulo Art Biennial, winning the Grand Prix for Brazilian painting, an award he shared with Di Cavalcanti. Di Cavalcanti publicly dismissed Volpi's art as being that of a \\"flag painter\\". Soon he became known as one of the most important 20th century painters in Brazil. Recent exhibitions (MAM São Paulo 2006, Curitiba 2007) have shown how Volpi, far from being the isolated self- made artist he was once thought to be, actually absorbed various influences during his career, especially that of Josef Albers. His use of the ancient tempera technique also shows a knowledge of the Italian Renaissance painters.

All the information are somehow connected to the Earth and Space (geocoded). The Internet applications, which are running mostly on client side, enable the viewing of maps, aerial photography and satellite imagery. They reveal the Earth from above and the Space from below. Many specific layers of different content can be pasted over those maps and images. Time dependent information is calculated on-line. Motto: GeaBios is a process not a fixed solution. Development In 1999 the first application named Aviator 2000 2D/3D map over Internet came out. It was created in JavaScript (DHTML) with additional ActiveX/OpenGL plug-in. The application had little uptake, as Netscape Communicator, which did not support ActiveX, had a large market share at that time. Users complained because they were not able to use the 3D modules. To avoid that, developers created 2D Java 1.1 based interface and soon removed ActiveX application.

The school was one of a number of Art Institutes, a franchise of for-profit art colleges with many branches in North America, owned and operated by Education Management Corporation. EDMC owned the college from 1975 until 2017, when, facing significant financial problems and declining enrollment, the company sold the Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago, along with 30 other Art Institute schools, to Dream Center Education, a Los Angeles-based Pentecostal organization. Dream Center permanently closed 18 Art Institute schools, including the Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago, at the end of 2018. History The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago was founded in 1916 as The Commercial Art School, which was one of the first applied art and design colleges in the United States. Three years later, William F. Ray became president and incorporated the school under the name of Ray School. During the 1920s, and 1930s, the school increased substantially in enrollment as professional art, design photography, and fashion programs were added to the curriculum. In the 1930s, the name \\"Vogue School\\" was used during an advertising campaign for fashion courses offered by the school, thus the school became widely known as Ray–Vogue School. When Ruth Wade Ray assumed the presidency in 1945, Ray-Vogue had become recognized throughout the country as a leader in professional art and fashion education. The College was renamed Ray College of Design in 1981 and was granted the authority to award associate degrees in all of its programs. In 1985, the president of the college, Wade Ray, opened a branch campus near Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, which later became The Illinois Institute of Art—Schaumburg. One year later, the college was granted authority to award Bachelor of Arts degrees by the Illinois Board of Higher Education. Ray College of Design joined The Art Institutes system in 1995 as The Illinois Institute of Art. As part of The Art Institutes, The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago refocused its bachelor's degree programs and mission to serve four basic creative industries (fashion, interior design, culinary and the media arts, which includes digital film-making, game art design, graphic design, and advertising) as a skill-centered and market-driven career college. Since 1995, The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago has grown by programs and floor space for its growing student body. The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago took advantage of the expansion and renovation of the first floor of the West Mart Center (350 N. Orleans) of the Merchandise Mart Center and Apparel Center complex. Most all of the new floor space was shared and occupied by the Illinois Institute of Art and by Argosy University. In 2007, new class space opened on a newly acquired fifth floor at the Loop campus. By the end of the 2007 school year, the college successfully expanded its floor space at both the Mart Center campus and the Loop campus, and discontinued its use of temporary spaces. In late 2007, The Art Institute of Michigan serving the Detroit metropolitan area became a branch location of The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago. Also, progression was made to include officially The Art Institute locations at Schaumburg and Cincinnati as branch locations under the umbrella of The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago. The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago achieved regional re-accreditation by The Higher Learning Commission for the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools for ten years in 2008. The interior design program was re-certified by the Council of Interior Design Accreditation a few months earlier. Also, in June, 2008, Argosy University moved out of the spaces at the Mart Center Campus allowing The Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago to grow its programs that serve the fashion and the interior design industries further there. Full- time enrollment fell from 2,250 students in 2009 to 970 in 2016. The school closed two years later. Accreditation Although the Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago was a candidate for accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), in 2015 HLC placed the institute \\"On Notice.\\"https://www.artinstitutes.edu/accreditation-and-licensing The Interior Design BFA program was accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA). The Culinary Arts AAS program was accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the American Culinary Federation.

It follows Angharad \\"Harry\\" Crewe, a recently orphaned young woman, to a remote desert outpost in colonized Damar, where her brother is stationed in the Homeland military. When she meets Corlath, the mystical king of the Damarian Hillfolk, Harry discovers her own magical powers and a destiny that leads her to save Damar from invasion. The Blue Sword was first published in 1982 by Greenwillow Books. It received the Newbery Honor Award, the Horn Book Fanfare award, the ALA Best of the Best Books for Young Adults award, the ALA Notable Children's Book award and the ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults award. McKinley published The Hero and the Crown, a prequel to The Blue Sword, in 1985.  Plot summary  =From the publisher= This is the story of Harry Crewe, the Homelander orphan girl who becomes Harimad-sol, King's Rider, and heir to the Blue Sword, Gonturan, which no woman had wielded since the legendary Lady Aerin herself bore it into battle. =Synopsis= After the death of her father, Angharad \\"Harry\\" Crewe joins her brother Richard in Istan, a remote military outpost of the colonial power known as the Homeland. Soon after her arrival, she is kidnapped by King Corlath of the independent Hillfolk people of Damar. Corlath had initially intended only to warn the Homelanders of an impending invasion by the demonic tribes of the North. After his warning is ignored, his \\"kelar\\" (a hereditary magical power) compels him to take Harry captive. Corlath does not understand what purpose Harry will serve, but commands his people to treat her as an honored guest. Harry soon adjusts to life with the Damarians. She learns their language and customs and begins to train as a warrior, during which time her latent kelar begins to emerge. After demonstrating her horseback riding and combat skills in a tournament, she is made one of the King's Riders. Corlath also presents her with the blue sword that had once belonged to the legendary Damarian heroine Lady Aerin. As the Northern invasion approaches, Harry feels torn between loyalty to Homeland and her new-found love for Damar. She must defy Corlath and use all her skills—including the power of her own kelar—to bring Homelanders and Damarians together to defeat the Northerners.

The term may also refer to the general inhabitants of Zambales. In 1950s, hundreds of Sambal from the northern municipalities of Zambales, migrated to and established a settlement in Quezon, Palawan; this settlement was named Panitian. The residents call themselves Palawenyong Sambal (Spanish: zambales palaweños) or simply Sambal. History The Sambal are the original Austronesian inhabitants of the province of Zambales in the Philippines. They speak mainly Sambal and Botolan, as well as Kapampangan, Tagalog, Ilocano, Bolinao and Pangasinense. The Sambalic languages are most closely related to the Kapampangan language and to an archaic form of Tagalog still spoken in Tanay in the province of Rizal. This has been interpreted to mean that the Sambal originated from that area, later being displaced by migrating Tagalogs, pushing the original inhabitants northward to what is now the province of Zambales, in turn, displacing the Negritos. The Spanish, in their first encounters with the Sambal, supposedly found them to be highly superstitious and who worshipped the spirits of their ancestors. To this day, most Sambal still believe in superstitions and mysteries. This is said to be the origin of the name Sambal—the Spanish who first encountered them called them the sambali, coined from the Malay word sembah, which means \\"to worship.\\" The term was later castilianized as zambal.http://www.lakbaypilipinas.com/travel_zambales.html Like the Moros, the culture and customs of the Sambal are different from that of neighboring groups. This is evident in their traditional dress, which consists of a single-shoulder short-sleeved shirt, paired with short trousers. Usually worn at the chest and shoulder areas of the shirt are badges that resemble multicolored crosses.Ninuno Mo, Ninuno Ko: Miguel de Loarca 5 The Sambals were known to be militant and fierce fighters,Aklasan Ng Charismatic Pinoys: Andres MalongAklasan Ng Charismatic Pinoys: Si Gumapos at si Almazan notorious for their bloody raids on Christian settlements.The Provincial Profile of Zambales They have been occasionally recruited by Indio commanders (indio was the term used for the Austronesian natives) in campaigns against the Spanish, who then governed the islands. The Sambal were also once known to have captured and enslaved Diego Silang as a child, eventually being ransomed by a Recollect missionary in Zambales.Aklasan Ng Charismatic Pinoys: Diego SilangCultural Heritage - Home It was recorded as customary for the Sambal to perform an execution as punishment for those who have taken another person's life. Their manner of execution was to bore a hole at the top of the skull and then scrape out the brains. During the first hundred years of Spanish rule, the Sambal, like most other non-Spanish groups in the Philippines during the colonial era, had their village structures reorganized and were forced into reducciones in order to assimilate them into Spanish cultural norms. During the 1950s, hundreds of Sambals coming from Candelaria, Santa Cruz and Masinloc in Zambales migrated to an undeveloped and forested area in southern Palawan. They established a settlement which was later on named Panitian.Panitian Like in Masinloc, many residents of Panitian have their last names start with the letter E. Most common last names are Eclarino, Elefane, Echaluse, Echague, Español, Ebuen, Edquid, Edquilang, Ebueng, Ebuenga, Ebalo, Ejanda, Elacio, Elfa, Eliaso, Elgincolin, Edquibal, Ednalino, Edora, Espinoza, Ecaldre, Eufeminiano, Edilloran, Ermita and Ecle. Those who came from Santa Cruz have their last names usually begin with the letter M, foremost of which are Misa, Mora, Moraña, Moralde and Meredor. Other common last names of Sambali people are Ángeles, Atrero, Agagas, Hebron, Hitchon, Hermoso, Hermosa, Hermana, and Hermogino. There are now approximately 6,000 Sambals residing in Palawan. Many of the Palawan Sambals have since moved to the provincial capital, Puerto Princesa, settling in Mandaragat and New Buncag, in particular, although a majority still resides in Panitian. Sambal indigenous religion A couple belonging to the Sambal warrior class, documented by the 16th century Boxer Codex. The female warrior is holding a raptor, which has captured a bird, exemplifying a culture of falconry.

The Sambali speakers are the residents of the municipalities of Santa Cruz, Candelaria, Masinloc, Palauig, and the capital town Iba of the province of Zambales. The Bolinao subgroup is located in Anda and Bolinao municipalities of Pangasinan, while the Botolan subgroup is found in Botolan and Cabangan municipalities of Zambales. An estimated 6,000 Sambali speakers can also be found in Panitian in Quezon, Palawan and in Puerto Princesa. The Sambalic languages are also spoken by many Filipino immigrants in the United States and Canada. In Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, for instance, the language is spoken by a clan of Sambals consisting at least five families. In Casino Nova Scotia in the maritimes city of Halifax, a group of Sambals can be found running the card games. Community organizations of Sambal-speaking Filipino Americans are found in San Diego and San Francisco, California as well as in Hawaii.

Structure Most pop-up canopies come in two pieces, the canopy frame and the canopy top. The canopy frame is constructed of either steel or aluminium. Steel framed canopies are heavier and typically cost less than aluminium frames. Recently, stainless steel has been used because it is lighter than steel and stronger than aluminium. Tops for most canopies are made from a polyester fabric. Most pop-up canopies are open-sided and without walls, distinguishing them from larger marquees or semi-permanent shelters. Uses Pop up canopies have become very popular for sporting events, festivals and trade shows. They are also known as pit tents when used in the context of amateur or semi-professional motorsport.

Taxonomy The plant's specific epithet, leucophylla, describes the light grayish leaves. The type specimen was collected near Santa Barbara, California by Scottish botanist David Douglas and named by Edward Lee Greene in 1892. The common names refer to the pale purple flowers (Purple sage) or to the grayish leaves (Gray sage). Description Salvia leucophylla is an evergreen shrub that grows up to tall and wide. Leaves are a light green in the spring, turning grayish-white as they mature, with graceful branches that arch to the ground, sometimes rooting when they touch the ground. Flowers grow in tight whorls on long inflorescences, with a pinkish-purple flowering stem. The flowers are pinkish- purple, held in a purple-tinged gray calyx. Habitat The plant is typically found on dry hillsides and in gravelly soils. Cultivation Salvia leucophylla is widely used in California and xeriscape gardening, preferring full sun and good drainage. There are many cultivars, natural hybrids, and wild hybrids with other Salvia species, making clear naming very confusing. Some cultivars include: *Salvia leucophylla 'Pt. Sal' *Salvia leucophylla 'Figueroa' *Salvia leucophylla 'Bee's Bliss' Salvia leucophylla is known to have allelopathic qualities. It releases a compound in the air that can drift to nearby earth and interfere with seedling growth for many species of plants.

Early life and career Born as Lorn Alastair Stewart, in Tonbridge, Kent, Stewart was the son of Dr Haldane Campbell Stewart, who was also musical but in a different sphere – he was organist and choirmaster at Magdalen College, Oxford, the director of music at the Tonbridge School, Kent, and also notable as a cricketer at Kent County Cricket Club. As a child, Stewart's family played as a string quartet, with Stewart and his sister Jean playing violin, his father playing viola, and his mother playing cello. His sister Jean went on to become a noted performer on viola, performing as a soloist, and in chamber music and orchestras. She performed with the Menges Quartet, the London Bach Orchestra and the English Baroque Soloists. Stewart's grandfather, John Stewart, was the sixth Baron Appin, and a barrister of Lincoln's Inn. Stewart started off his entertainment career in the BBC radio sound effects department in the late 1930s. During the Second World War he worked in the Middle East as a wireless operator and later worked in intelligence. After the war, in 1946, he married Sheila Williamson. He returned to the BBC and produced a number of radio music programmes, which included Sing It Again and BBC Jazz Club. He was able to sign up Frank Sinatra for a fee of only fifty pounds as a guest for Cyril Stapleton's Show Band Show. In 1958 he produced Juke Box Jury for BBC Television. Continuing the popular musical theme, in 1963 the BBC recorded a pilot chart show, which Stewart produced. Originally called The Teen and Twenty Record Club, it emerged onto the UK screens as Top of the Pops, which continued on the air until 2006. Its initial presenters, on a rotational basis, were Jimmy Savile, David Jacobs, Alan Freeman and Pete Murray. Samantha Juste, one of the programme's assistants, sat alongside them and placed the records on a turntable. Stewart remained as producer of the programme until 1973, when he was succeeded by Robin Nash. In 1970, he produced the BBC/ZDF TV show Pop Go The Sixties, broadcast across Europe on 1 January 1970. After work Stewart finally retired to Ibiza but returned to the UK when his health deteriorated. He died in East Dereham, Norfolk, aged 87.

It is also the site of the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone (Vietnamese: Với Khu Kinh Tế Mở Chu Lai). History =Vietnam War= Chu Lai was a United States Marine Corps military base from 1965 to 1970, and a United States Army military base from 1970 to 1971 during the Vietnam War. Roughly southeast of Đà Nẵng, the base had an airfield to supplement the major base at Đà Nẵng.

Lieutenant General Victor H. \\"Brute\\" Krulak, then the commanding general of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. Da Nang Air Base was the first major airfield used by the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. Shortly after conventional ground forces began arriving in country in 1965, it became necessary to open a second airfield because of the heavy traffic into and out of Đà Nẵng. On 6 May 1965 units from the ARVN 2nd Division and 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines secured the Chu Lai area. On 7 May, the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade (3rd MEB), composed of the 4th Marine Regiment, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, elements of Marine Aircraft Group 12 (MAG-12) and Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 10 landed at Chu Lai to establish a jet-capable airfield and base area. Chu Lai Air Base became operational on 1 June 1965 and remained in use by Marine aviation units until September 1970. The Seabees of MCB-10 built the helicopter pad, and the Marines also established a combat base and helicopter facility on the Kỳ Hà peninsula north of the air base. The Marine base was handed over to the U.S. Army's Task Force Oregon in April 1967 and subsequently became the headquarters and base area for the U.S. 23rd (Americal) Infantry Division from September 1967 until November 1971.

Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that struck down the police practice of first obtaining an inadmissible confession without giving Miranda warnings, then issuing the warnings, and then obtaining a second confession. Justice David Souter announced the judgment of the Court and wrote for a plurality of four justices that the second confession was admissible only if the intermediate Miranda warnings were \\"effective enough to accomplish their object.\\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in a concurring opinion that the second confession should be inadmissible only if \\"the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\\" Background Patrice Seibert, a suspect in a fatal arson, was arrested and taken to the police station. There, a police officer decided to interrogate her using a method he had been taught: to question the suspect, obtain a confession, then give Miranda warnings and repeat the questioning until the confession was obtained again. Accordingly, Seibert was not informed of her Miranda rights before the interrogation began. After about 40 minutes of questioning, Seibert made an incriminating statement. She was given a 20-minute break. When the questioning resumed, she was given her Miranda warnings, and reminded of what she had admitted before the break. She then repeated her confession. The trial court (Missouri Circuit Court) suppressed the first statement because it was given before the Miranda warnings, but admitted the second. Seibert was convicted of second-degree murder. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Circuit Courts of Appeal on this issue. Plurality opinion Souter, writing for the plurality, focused on the actual effectiveness of Miranda warnings given after an earlier unwarned confession. Just giving the warnings is not necessarily good enough. Instead, a court must ask, \\"Could the warnings effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture? Could they reasonably convey that he could choose to stop talking even if he had talked earlier?\\" The plurality opinion gives some guidance on when an intermediate warning should be considered to be effective. Such a warning is likely to mislead a defendant about his rights when it is made \\"in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation.\\" Courts should therefore consider \\"the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.\\" Concurrences Justice Breyer concurred. He set forth a different test for whether the second confession should be admissible: \\"Courts should exclude the \\"fruit\\" of the initial unwarned questioning unless the failure to warn was in good faith.\\" The term \\"fruit\\" refers to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, which provides that in criminal trials, courts may not admit evidence obtained as an indirect result of a search that violated the Fourth Amendment. Justice Breyer's proposed rule would extend that doctrine to evidence obtained as an indirect result of an interrogation that violated the Fifth Amendment. Although this test was different from Justice Souter's, Breyer also joined with the Souter's plurality opinion because he thought that the two tests would yield the same result in practice. Justice Kennedy also concurred, and proposed yet another test. He wrote that he \\"would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\\" If a two-step procedure was deliberately used, the subsequent statement would be inadmissible unless the police \\"cured\\" the problem by taking measures that would enable the suspect to distinguish the first interrogation from the second \\"and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn.\\" Kennedy suggested that a long break between the two interrogations would usually be sufficient, as would an explanation to the suspect that the first statement would probably be inadmissible in court. Dissent Justice O'Connor wrote for the dissent. She criticized the majority for not being faithful to the Court's earlier opinions involving two- stage interrogations, especially Oregon v. Elstad, a 1985 case involving a two-stage interrogation. The dissent stated that under the precedent of Elstad, it did not matter whether the police failed to give Miranda warnings before the first confession, so long as the confession was not coerced. Even if the first confession was coerced, \\"the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time or a change in circumstances.\\" To make that determination, O'Connor would have courts look to many of the same factual considerations identified by the plurality: \\"the time that passes between confessions, the change in place of interrogations, and the change in identity of the interrogators.\\" The dissent would thus have allowed police to continue to use the question-first, warn-later approach, so long as they could show that the first confession was voluntary and that the \\"taint\\" of the first confession had worn off. Effect Seibert was a split decision. The general rule is that when there is no majority opinion in a Supreme Court case, the narrowest rationale agreed upon by at least five Justices controls. But lower courts have disagreed about what that rationale is in Seibert: some have adopted the \\"effects\\" test from the plurality opinion; others have adopted the \\"intent\\" test from Kennedy's opinion. As Gerald Uelmen has written, \\"The fractured opinions\\" in Seibert \\"have left lower courts in limbo.\\" Midstream Miranda Warnings After Seibert, Champion, July, 2005. According to Justice Souter's opinion, the two-step interrogation practice was becoming increasingly popular among police departments. Given the confusion about Seibert's meaning, it remains to be seen whether that changes. In State v. O'Neill, 936 A.2d 438, 193 N.J. 148 (2007), the New Jersey Supreme court determined that based on New Jersey's greater protections than the US Constitution, that question first, mirandize later was not constitutional. While an \\"entirety of the circumstances\\" test still applies, O'Neill essentially held that the test is failed by this particular interrogation process. https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9833511178606064743&q;=state+v.+o%27neill&hl;=en&as;_sdt=4,31 See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 542 *List of United States Supreme Court cases Further reading  * External links * * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Fifth Amendment self-incrimination case law Category:2004 in United States case law Category:Arson in Missouri Category:Legal history of Missouri Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court ","title":"Missouri v.

Today, Búzios is a popular getaway from the city and a worldwide tourist site, especially among Brazilians and Argentinians. In the early 1900s Búzios was accustomed to very kind hospitality. An almost unknown village of fishermen. It remained as such to be #1 in all of Brazil for its famous TikiBar close to the Uniq Beach Lounge until 1964, when the French actress Brigitte Bardot visited Búzios. Since then, in Búzios became popular with the Carioca’s high society, who wanted to escape from the chaotic city life of Rio de Janeiro and enjoy over 23 beaches that the peninsula offers. The city grew to be an international tourist destination. Today, the peninsula is a travelling site that offers calmness, direct contact with nature and scenic views. The west coast beaches offer calm, clear waters while the east coast ones, facing the open sea, are more wild and draw surfers and water sports enthusiasts. Azeda, Ferradura, João Fernandes and Armação are amongst the most popular beaches in town. At night, Rua das Pedras, Buzios' main street, offers its visitors an active nightlife and a great variety of shopping and restaurants.  History  During the 16th century, the Tupinambá Indians occupied the area, which is now known as Búzios. During the 17th century, the Europeans invaded what was then a small village and as a result, the Tupinambá developed strict relationships with the French pirates and smugglers, who were interested in smuggling pau-brasil (Brazilian reddish wood) and selling African Slaves.About Buzios.\\" El Misti. 04 Mar. 2013. Eventually the French were expelled by the Portuguese due to their bloody disputes with the Tupinambás, which resulted in a significant decrease in the Indian population in that region. Statue of Brigitte Bardot in Búzios.In the 18th century, the gold trade from Minas Gerais and its exportation to Europe from Rio de Janeiro attracted many ships to the Guanabara Bay. Additionally the increasing number of ships along the city’s coast brought close attention to the whale hunting practice that took place in that area. The name “Armação dos Búzios”, for instance, comes from the process of separating the meat from the bones. In addition, a beach in Búzios called “Praia dos Ossos” was named after the great amount of whales’ bones found along the shore. Another curious fact about this practice at the time was that the city lights were fueled with whale oil, and the Sant’Ana Chapel located on the top of a hill between Praia dos Ossos and Praia da Armação, was built with rocks and whale oil as well.About Buzios.\\" El Misti. 04 Mar. 2013. Around 1850 when slave trade was abolished in Brazil, Búzios was able to establish itself as a city that cultivated agricultural and fishing habits, instead of being just a smuggling, slave-trading and whale- hunting site. With time, the once European dominated city, shifted into a community composed by a mix of native descendants, blacks and interracial citizens. In 1940, Antonio Alipio da Silva was the first political representative to initiate a political life in Búzios.A Colonização De Búzios.\\" A Colonização De Búzios.16 Mar. 2013. <> As a consequence, the small town started to grow and attract a greater variety of people. During the mid 1900s, Búzios was already known to Rio’s high society, as it was a relatively reserved beach getaway from the chaotic urban life. However, it was only around 1964, when Brigitte Bardot visited the small town, that Búzios actually became well known. = Brigitte Bardot = Brigitte Bardot was a French actress in the 1960s that decided to go to Rio with her Brazilian boyfriend, Bob Zagury. However, due to the intense amount of paparazzi following them, Bob took his girlfriend to Búzios in order to enjoy the rest of their trip at a quieter and more exclusive site. At the time, the small town had no electricity and life there was quite bucolic yet it was the simplicity of the place, in conjunction with the peninsula’s natural beauty, that made Brigitte Bardot declare her admiration. Inevitably, Búzios became a global spotlight and although other stars like Mick Jagger and Madonna followed her path, none left as much of an impression as Bardot.Farquhar, Stephen. \\"And Bardot Created Búzios.\\" The Guardian. Guardian News and Media, 24 Sept. 2004. Web. 05 Mar. 2013. The place where she stayed in Búzios for the first time is now a small hotel, known as Pousada do Sol. The strip of land that connects Praia da Armação with one of the main streets in town, Rua das Pedras, was named after her, Orla Bardot. She was also honored along the oceanfront path with a bronze statue made by Christina Motta.\\"Buzios Online.\\" Practical Information. 04 Mar. 2013.

NetBoot is a derived work from the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), and is similar in concept to the Preboot Execution Environment. The technology was announced as a part of the original version of Mac OS X Server at Macworld Expo on 5 January 1999. NetBoot has continued to be a core systems management technology for Apple, and has been adapted to support modern Mac Intel machines. NetBoot, USB, and FireWire are some of the external volume options for Mac OS re-install.  Process  A disk image with a copy of macOS, macOS Server, Mac OS 9, or Mac OS 8 is created using System Image Utility and is stored on a server, typically macOS Server. Clients receive this image across a network using many popular protocols including: HTTPS, AFP, TFTP, NFS, and multicast Apple Software Restore (ASR). Server-side NetBoot image can boot entire machines, although NetBoot is more commonly used for operating system and software deployment, somewhat similar to Norton Ghost. To NetBoot a client machine, hold the \\"N\\" key as the Mac boots, or select the NetBoot server using the Startup Disk preference pane (macOS) or control panel (Mac OS 8 and 9). Alternatively, New World Macs can be started with the Command (⌘), Option (⌥), O and F keys pressed to enter the Open Firmware prompt. Once in the Open Firmware one can tell the client to attempt the NetBoot procedure by entering \\"\`boot enet:0\`\\" and pressing the return key. Client machines first request network configuration information through DHCP, then a list of boot images and servers with BSDP and then proceed to download images with protocols mentioned above. Both Intel and PowerPC-based servers can serve images for Intel and PowerPC-based clients.  NetInstall  NetInstall is a similar feature of macOS Server which utilizes NetBoot and ASR to deliver installation images to network clients (typically on first boot). Like NetBoot, NetInstall images can be created using the System Image Utility. NetInstall performs a function for macOS similar to Windows Deployment Services for Microsoft clients, which depend on the Preboot Execution Environment.  Legacy  Mac OS 8.5 and Mac OS 9 use only BOOTP/DHCP to get IP information, followed by a TFTP transfer of the Mac OS ROM file. Next, two volumes are mounted via AppleTalk over TCP on which the client disk images reside. All in all, the Classic Mac OS uses three images; a System image which contains the operating system and may contain applications. Next a private image (or scratch disk) is mounted in an overlay over the read-only System image. Finally, an applications image is mounted. This image, however, may be empty.

Male are usually called as Bicolano and Bicolana for female. Their native region is commonly referred to as Bicolandia, which comprises the entirety of the Bicol Peninsula and neighbouring minor islands, all in the southeast portion of Luzon. They are largely an agricultural and rural people, producing rice, coconuts, hemp, they are rich in spices. That's why Bicolanos are said to be great when it comes to eating chili food or foods which are high in spice. Nearly all of them are Christians, predominantly Roman Catholics, but with some Protestant minorities. Proves that they celebrate Saints, and other patriots. Their languages are divided based from their cities, which is actually a collection of closely related varieties, is closely related to other languages of the central Philippines, all of which belong to the Austronesian (specifically Malayo-Polynesian) super-family of languages. History Bicolano men with their wagons, from Albay, c. 1899. According to a folk epic entitled Ibalong, the people of the region were formerly called Ibalong or Ibalnong, a name believed to have been derived from Gat Ibal who ruled Sawangan (now the city of Legazpi) in ancient times. Ibalong used to mean the \\"people of Ibal\\"; eventually, this was shortened to Ibalon. The word Bikol, which replaced Ibalon, was originally (meaning \\"meandering\\"), a word which supposedly described the principal river of that area. Archaeological diggings, dating back to as early as the Neolithic, and accidental findings resulting from the mining industry, road-building and railway projects in the region, reveal that the Bicol mainland is a rich storehouse of ceramic artifacts. Burial cave findings also point to the pre-Hispanic practice of using burial jars. The Spanish influence in Bicol resulted mainly from the efforts of Augustinian and Franciscan Spanish missionaries. Through the Franciscans, the annual feast of the Virgin of Peñafrancia, the Patroness for Bicolandia, was started. Father Miguel Robles asked a local artist to carve a replica of the statue of the Virgin in Salamanca; now, the statue is celebrated through an annual fluvial parade in Naga City. The flag of the members of Katipunan in Bicol. Bicolanos actively participated in the national resistance to the American and Japanese occupations through two well known leaders who rose up in arms: Simeón Ola and Governor Wenceslao Q. Vinzons. Historically, the Bicolano people have been the most rebellious against foreign occupation. Area Bicolanos live in Bicol Region that occupies the southeastern part of Luzon, now containing the provinces of Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes and Sorsogon, as well as Masbate (although the majority of Masbate's population are a subgroup of Visayans). Many Bicolanos also live in the southeastern towns of the Calabarzon province of Quezon. Demographics Bicolanos number 6,299,283 in 2010. They are descended from Austronesian peoples who came from Taiwan during the Iron Age. Many Bicolanos also have some Han Chinese and Spanish admixtures. Most of the townsfolk have small traces of each heritage while their language is referred to as Bicol/Bicolano. The Bicolano language is very fragmented, and its dialects are almost mutually incomprehensible to speakers of other Bicolano dialects. The majority of the Bicolano people are devout Roman Catholics and Catholic Mass is celebrated daily in many of the Bicol Region's churches. Culture and traits =Cuisine= Ginataang sigarilyas, a notable Bicolano dish of winged bean (sigarilyas) cooked in coconut milk (gata) with pork and anchovies. The Bicolano cuisine is primarily noted for the prominent use of chili peppers and gata (coconut milk) in its food. A classic example is the gulay na lada, known outside the region as Bicol Express, a well-loved dish using siling labuyo (native small chillies) and the aforementioned gata. Meals are generally rich in carbohydrates and viands of vegetables, fish, and meat are cooked in various ways. Bicolanos almost always cook their vegetables in coconut milk; for meat recipes such as pochero, adobo, and tapa. A special meat dish is the dinuguan. Fishes that serve as common viand are mackerel and anchovy; in Lake Buhi, the sinarapan or tabyos (known as the smallest fish in the world) is common. =Livelihood= Copra processing and abacá stripping are generally done by hand. Fishing is also an important industry and fish supply is normally plentiful during the months of May through September. Organized or big-time fishing makes use of costly nets and motor-powered and electric-lighted boats or launches called palakaya or basnigan. Individual fishermen, on the other hand, commonly use two types of nets – the basnig and the pangki as well as the , , and . In Lake Buhi, the and are used; the small fishes caught through the former is the sinarapan. The (corral) of the , , and types are common. The {{translbikbanwit{{translbik, two kinds of which are the {{translbikog- og{{translbik and , are also used. Mining and the manufacture of various items from abaca are important industries. The former started when the Spaniards discovered the Paracale mines in Camarines Norte. Coconut and abacá are two dollar-earning products that are grown in the coastal valleys, hillsides, or slopes of several fertile volcanoes respectively. The Bicol River basin or rice granary provide the peasants rice, corn, and root crops for food and small cash surplus when crops evade the dreaded frequent typhoons. For land preparation, carabao-drawn plough and harrow are generally used; sickles are used for cutting rice stalks, threshing is done either by stepping on or beating the rice straws with basbas and cleaning is done with the use of the nigo (winnowing basket). =Cultural values= Like their other neighbouring regions, Bicolanas are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, Bicolano men are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family. Close family ties and religiosity are important traits for survival in the typhoon-prone physical environment. Some persisting traditional practices are the , and . Beliefs on god, the soul and life after death are strongly held by the people. Related to these, there are annual rituals like the pabasa, tanggal, fiestas and flores de mayo. Side by side with these are held beliefs on spiritual beings as the tawo sa lipod, duwende, , , , , and . On the whole, the value system of the Bicolanos shows the influence of Spanish religious doctrines and American materialism merged with traditional animistic beliefs. Consequently, it is a multi-cultural system that evolved through the years to accommodate the realities of the erratic regional climatic conditions in a varied geographical setting. Such traits can be gleaned from numerous folk tales and folk songs that abound, the most known of which is the Sarung Banggi. The heroic stories reflect such traits as kindness, a determination to conquer evil forces, resourcefulness and courage. The folk song come in the form of , , , , , , and children's song and chants. To suit the tropical climate, Bicolanos use light material for their houses; others now have bungalows to withstand the impact of strong typhoons. Light, western-styled clothes are predominantly used now. The typical Bicolano wears light, western-styled clothes similar to the Filipinos in urban centres.

Bicolanos observe an annual festival in honour of the Our Lady of Peñafrancia every third Sunday of September. The City of Naga comes alive. During the celebration, a jostling crowd of all-male devotees carries the image of the Virgin on their shoulders to the Naga Metropolitan Cathedral, while shouting Viva La Virgen! For the next nine days people, mostly Bicolanos, come for an annual visit light candles and kisses the image of the Virgin. To the Bicolanos, this affair is religious and cultural, as well. Every night, shows are held at the plaza the year's biggest cockfights take place, bicycle races are held and the river, a lively boat race precedes the fluvial procession. At noon of the third Saturday of the month, the devotees carry the Image on their shoulders preceded to the packed waterfront. On the ninth day of the festivities, The The Virgin of Peñaffrancia is brought to her home, to the Minor Basilica of the Our Lady of Peñafrancia via a grand fluvial procession in the Naga River.

This propaganda poster made after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 has the rhyming slogan \\"Serbia must die!\\". Untermensch (, underman, sub-man, subhuman; plural: Untermenschen) is a Nazi term for non-Aryan \\"inferior people\\" often referred to as \\"the masses from the East\\", that is Jews, Roma, and Slavs (Poles, Serbs, Russians, etc.). The term was also applied to Blacks and Mulattos. Jewish people were to be exterminatedSnyder, T (2011) Bloodlands, Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Vintage, P144-5, 188 in the Holocaust, along with the Polish and Romani people, and the physically and mentally disabled.Mineau, André (2004). Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity. Amsterdam; New York: Rodopi. p. 180. According to the Generalplan Ost, the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder in the Holocaust, with a majority expelled to Asia and used as slave labor in the Reich. These concepts were an important part of the Nazi racial policy.  Etymology  Although usually incorrectly considered to have been coined by the Nazis, the term \\"under man\\" was first used by American author and Ku Klux Klan member Lothrop Stoddard in the title of his 1922 book The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man. Stoddard uses the term for those he considers unable to function in civilisation, which he generally (but not entirely) attributes to race. It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen (1925). The German word Untermensch had been used earlier, but not in a racial sense, for example in the 1899 novel Der Stechlin by Theodor Fontane. Since most writers who employed the term did not address the question of when and how the word entered the German language, Untermensch is usually translated into English as \\"sub-human\\". The leading Nazi attributing the concept of the East-European \\"under man\\" to Stoddard is Alfred Rosenberg who, referring to Russian communists, wrote in his Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts (1930) that \\"this is the kind of human being that Lothrop Stoddard has called the 'under man.'\\" [\\"...den Lothrop Stoddard als 'Untermenschen' bezeichnete.\\"] Quoting Stoddard: \\"The Under-Man – the man who measures under the standards of capacity and adaptability imposed by the social order in which he lives\\". It is possible that Stoddard constructed his \\"under man\\" as an opposite to Friedrich Nietzsche's Übermensch (superman) concept. Stoddard does not say so explicitly, but he refers critically to the \\"superman\\" idea at the end of his book (p. 262). Wordplays with Nietzsche's term seem to have been used repeatedly as early as the 19th century and, due to the German linguistic trait of being able to combine prefixes and roots almost at will in order to create new words, this development can be considered logical. For instance, German author Theodor Fontane contrasts the Übermensch/Untermensch word pair in chapter 33 of his novel Der Stechlin. Nietzsche used Untermensch at least once in contrast to Übermensch in Die fröhliche Wissenschaft (1882); however, he did so in reference to semi-human creatures in mythology, naming them alongside dwarfs, fairies, centaurs and so on. Earlier examples of Untermensch include Romanticist Jean Paul using the term in his novel Hesperus (1795) in reference to an Orangutan (Chapter \\"8. Hundposttag\\").  Nazi propaganda and policy  A chart used to illustrate the Nazi Nuremberg Laws introduced in 1935 In a speech in 1927 to the Bavarian regional parliament, the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, publisher of Der Stürmer, used the term Untermensch referring to the communists of the German Bavarian Soviet Republic: Nazis repeatedly used the term Untermensch in writings and speeches directed against the Jews, the most notorious example being a 1942 SS publication with the title Der Untermensch, which contains an antisemitic tirade sometimes considered to be an extract from a speech by Heinrich Himmler. In the pamphlet \\"The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization\\", published in 1936, Himmler wrote: In his speech \\"Weltgefahr des Bolschewismus\\" (\\"World danger of Bolshevism\\") in 1936, Joseph Goebbels said that \\"subhumans exist in every people as a leavening agent\\".Paul Meier-Benneckenstein, Deutsche Hochschule für Politik Titel: Dokumente der Deutschen Politik, Volume 4, Junker und Dünnhaupt Verlag, Berlin, 2. ed., 1937; speech held on 10 September 1936; In German: \\"... das Untermenschentum, das in jedem Volke als Hefe vorhanden ist ...\\". At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels also declared that \\"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish- led international subhumans against culture itself.\\"Goebbels speech at the 1935 Nuremberg Rally Another example of the use of the term Untermensch, this time in connection with anti-Soviet propaganda, is a brochure entitled \\"Der Untermensch\\", edited by Himmler and distributed by the Race and Settlement Head Office. SS-Obersturmführer Ludwig Pröscholdt, Jupp Daehler and SS- Hauptamt-Schulungsamt Koenig are associated with its production. Published in 1942 after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, it is around 50 pages long and consists for the most part of photos portraying the enemy in an extremely negative way (see link below for the title page). 3,860,995 copies were printed in the German language. It was translated into Greek, French, Dutch, Danish, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Czech and seven other languages. The pamphlet says the following: Sub-human types Nazis classified those they called the sub-humans into different types; they placed priority on extermination of the Jews, and exploitation of others as slaves.Quality of Life: The New Medical Dilemma, edited by James J. Walter, Thomas Anthony Shannon, page 63 Historian Robert Jan van Pelt writes that for the Nazis, \\"it was only a small step to a rhetoric pitting the European Mensch against the Soviet Untermensch, which had come to mean a Russian in the clutches of Judeo-Bolshevism.\\" The Untermensch concept included Jews, Roma and Sinti (Gypsies), and Slavic peoples such as Poles, Serbs and Russians. The Slavs were regarded as Untermenschen, barely fit for exploitation as slaves. Hitler and Goebbels compared them to the \\"rabbit family\\" or to \\"stolid animals\\" that were \\"idle\\" and \\"disorganized\\" and spread like a \\"wave of filth\\".Sealing Their Fate (Large Print 16pt) by David Downing, page 49 However, some among the Slavs who happened to have Nordic racial features were deemed to have distant Germanic descent which meant partially \\"Aryan\\" origin, and if under 10 years old, they were to be Germanized (see: kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany). The Nazi views on the Slavs were explicitly contemptuous, as even prior to the World War II, Slavs, particularly the Poles, were deemed as being inferior to Germans. After Adolf Hitler gained political power in Germany, the concept of Non-Aryan \\"sub-human slave- material\\" was developed and started to be used also towards other Slavic peoples.Timm, Annette F. (2010) The Politics of Fertility in Twentieth-Century Berlin. London: Cambridge University Press. p.188 Poles and Serbs were at the bottom of the Slavic \\"racial hierarchy\\" established by the Nazis. Soon after Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact expired, also Russians started to be seen as part of the \\"subhuman\\" race. Similarly, also Belarusians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Ukrainians were considered to be inferior, despite some collaborative groups were found among these nations. Nonetheless, there were Slavs such as Bosniaks, Bulgarians, and Croats who collaborated with Nazi Germany that were still being perceived as not racially \\"pure\\" enough to reach the status of Germanic peoples, yet they were eventually considered ethnically better than all other Slavs, mostly due to pseudoscientific theories about these nations having a minimal amount of Slavic genes and considerable admixtures of Germanic and Turkic blood.Shirer, William L. (1960) The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. New York: Simon and Schuster. pp.937, 939. Quotes: \\"The Jews and the Slavic people were the Untermenschen - subhumans.\\" (937); \\"[The] obsession of the Germans with the idea that they were the master race and that Slavic people must be their slaves was especially virulent in regard to Russia. Erich Koch, the roughneck Reich Commissar for the Ukraine, expressed it in a speech at Kiev on 5 March 1945. > We are the Master Race and must govern hard but just ... I will draw the > very last out of this country. I did not come to spread bliss ... The > population must work, work, and work again [...] We are a master race, which > must remember that the lowliest German worker is racially and biologically a > thousand times more valuable than the population [of the Ukraine]. (emphasis > added) In order to forge a strategic alliance with the Independent State of Croatia - a puppet state created after the invasion of Yugoslavia - and the Kingdom of Bulgaria, the Nazis deviated from a strict interpretation of their racial ideology, and Croats were officially described as \\"more Germanic than Slav\\", a notion supported by Croatia's fascist (Ustashe) dictator Ante Pavelić who maintained that the \\"Croatians were descendants of the ancient Goths\\" and \\"had the Panslav idea forced upon them as something artificial\\".Rich, Norman (1974) Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order.

Quoting Hitler: \\"For example to label the Bulgarians as Slavs is pure nonsense; originally they were Turkomans.\\" However the Nazis continued to classify Croats as a \\"subhuman\\" in spite of the alliance.Norman Davies. Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory. Pan Macmillan, 2008. Pp. 167, 209. Hitler also deemed the Bulgarians to be \\"Turkoman\\" in origin. This poster (from around 1938) reads: \\"60,000 Reichsmark is what this person suffering from a hereditary defect costs the People's community during his lifetime. Fellow citizen, that is your money too. Read '[A] New People', the monthly magazine of the Bureau for Race Politics of the NSDAP.\\" While the Nazis were inconsistent in the implementation of their policy - for instance, mostly implementing the Final Solution while also implementing Generalplan Ost - the democidal death toll was in tens of millions of victims.Rees, L (1997) The Nazis: A Warning from History, BBC Books, P126Mazower, M (2008) Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe, Penguin Press P197 It is related to the concept of \\"life unworthy of life\\", a more specific term which originally referred to the severely disabled who were involuntarily euthanised in Action T4, and was eventually applied to the extermination of the Jews. That policy of euthanasia started officially on Sept 1st 1939 when Hitler signed an edict to the effect, and carbon monoxide was used first to murder disabled patients. The same gas was used in the death camps such as Treblinka, although they used engine exhaust gases to achieve the same end. In the directive No. 1306 by Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 24 October 1939, the term \\"Untermensch\\" is used in reference to Polish ethnicity and culture, as follows: Biology classes in Nazi Germany schools taught about differences between the race of Nordic German \\"Übermenschen\\" and \\"ignoble\\" Jewish and Slavic \\"subhumans\\".Hitler Youth, 1922–1945: An Illustrated History by Jean- Denis Lepage, page 91 The view that Slavs were subhuman was widespread among the German masses, and chiefly applied to the Poles. It continued to find support after the war.Native Realm: A Search for Self Definition by Czeslaw Milosz, page 132 During the war, Nazi propaganda instructed Wehrmacht officers to tell their soldiers to target people described as \\"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\\" and that the war in the Soviet Union was between the Germans and the Jewish, Gypsies and Slavic Untermenschen.Richard J. Evans, In Hitler's Shadow (1999), pp. 59–60Michael Burleigh, The Third Reich: A New History (2000), p. 512 During the Warsaw Uprising, Himmler ordered the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto because according to him it allowed the \\"living space\\" of 500,000 subhumans. As a pragmatic way to solve military manpower shortages, the Nazis used soldiers from some Slavic countries, firstly from the Reich's allies Croatia and BulgariaAccording to Nazi policy the Croats were classified as more \\"Germanic than Slavic\\"; this was supported by Croatia's fascist dictator Ante Pavelić, who maintained that the Croatians were descendants of the ancient Goths and \\"had the Pan-Slav idea forced upon them as something artificial\\".

Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory. Pp. 167, 209. The concept of the Slavs in particular being Untermenschen served the Nazis' political goals; it was used to justify their expansionist policy and especially their aggression against Poland and the Soviet Union in order to achieve Lebensraum, particularly in Ukraine. Early plans of the German Reich (summarized as Generalplan Ost) envisioned the displacement, enslavement, and elimination of no fewer than 50 million people, who were not considered fit for Germanization, from territories it wanted to conquer in Europe; Ukraine's chernozem (\\"black earth\\") soil was considered a particularly desirable zone for colonization by the Herrenvolk (\\"master race\\").

Portrayed by Jimmi Harkishin, the character's first appearance was broadcast on 10 November 1999. He is the ex-husband of Sunita (Shobna Gulati) and father to Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel), Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett/Adam Hussain) and Asha Alahan (Tanisha Gorey). Dev departed on 13 February 2015, after Harkishin asked for an extended break from the show, and returned on 1 June 2015. On 6 April 2019, it was announced that Harkishin would take a 2-month break. As of 2019, Dev has been on the programme for 20 years with only a few small breaks in between. Storylines Dev as he appeared in 1999. Amy Goskirk (Jayne Ashbourne), an ex-girlfriend, follows Dev to Weatherfield, claiming he had promised to marry her. He denies this, claiming she is mentally unstable so she claims to be pregnant with his baby and that she had attempted suicide. When she turns up at the Rovers Return with bandaged wrists, Dev exposes her lies by ripping off the bandages, revealing no cuts. Some time later, Dev almost marries barmaid Geena Gregory (Jennifer James), but her mother is unhappy and pays Karen McDonald (Suranne Jones) to set him up so Geena will dump him. Although she forgives him, Geena and Dev later split up and she starts dating Joe Carter (Jonathan Wrather). Dev saves shop assistant Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) from an arranged marriage, giving her a safe haven in the flat above the Corner Shop. Sunita develops feelings for Dev but he initially sees her as just a friend, but they later get involved. His other girlfriends include: cruise ship hairdresser Debs Brownlow (Gabrielle Glaister), and Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who wrecks his flat after discovering he has no intention of marrying her. He also sleeps with Tracy's mother, Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride), who he later employs. Dev later meets solicitor Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar), while on the rebound from Sunita, who chooses barman Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) over him. He allows Maya to move in and she makes friends with Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson), but gets jealous of the amount of time Dev and Sunita are spending together and forces Dev to choose. As Sunita is seriously ill, he chooses her. This enrages Maya so she smashes up his flat and frames Sunita for an illegal immigration scam so she is arrested on her and Dev's wedding day. Sunita is jailed but released when one of the illegal immigrants Maya married is arrested for a completely separate offence and identifies Maya as his \\"wife\\", pleading with her for help in front of the police. Maya is charged but released on bail and wanting revenge, she ties up Sunita and sets fire to all of Dev's shops, knocking him unconscious when he tries to rescue Sunita and leaves them to die. However, Ciaran and Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) save them. Dev's marriage to Sunita is happy for a while, and the couple is overjoyed to discover that Sunita is expecting twins. Dev then sells his share of Streetcars to Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) in order to buy a house for his new family. However, during 2005, Sunita takes in teenage Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel), daughter of one of his employees as her mother is in hospital. Dev is unhappy at Amber's presence and Sunita is shocked to learn that Dev is her biological father, due to a brief relationship years ago. However, Sunita then learns that Dev has other children by women he employs and grandchildren too. Sunita is devastated, especially when Dev admits having very little contact with his daughters, and leaves him. She allows him to be present when she gives birth to the twins, who are named Asha and Aadi. Dev is overjoyed (especially as Aadi is his first son), but Sunita cannot forgive him so she leaves the street with the twins, moving into the house that Dev had bought. Dev, however, is allowed to have regular contact with the twins. The following February, Amber (who now knows that Dev is her father) moves in with Dev as her mother is moving to Finland with her new boyfriend but Amber wants to stay behind in England. At first, Dev insists that she go with her mother, bitter about the part Amber played in his marriage breaking down, but eventually he thaws and allows her to stay living with him permanently. On New Year's Eve 2007, Dev takes over from Bob as best man for Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington) at his wedding to Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) and is later hit by Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson), when Jim is attacking Vernon. In summer 2008, Dev is upset after conversations with Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) and Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) make him realise that he is just a simple man running a chain of corner shops. To compensate, he takes out membership at a new golf club to make himself feel better. Dev goes for a round of golf with Vernon and by chance, they strike up a conversation with Prem Mandal (Madhav Sharma), who gives Vernon some pointers. The trio later have a drink together at the clubhouse and after Prem leaves, Dev tells Vernon that Prem is a very successful businessman who runs his own cleaning business. Dev then has an affair with Prem's wife, Nina Mandal (Harvey Virdi), (an ex-Bollywood star whom Dev once had a crush on), after going on a date with their friend, Lisa. Dev with Prem's wife Nina. In August 2008, Dev buys a flat at the newly finished Victoria Court and becomes increasingly unhappy with his affair with Nina when he realises that she has been cheating on Prem for years. Nina blackmails Dev by threatening to tell Prem if he tries to end it but Dev meets their daughter and finds himself torn between Tara (Ayesha Dharker) and Nina. Nina does not approve of Dev's attraction to Tara but they go on several dates regardless, so she threatens again to tell Prem about their affair. Dev, sick of Nina's threats, tells Prem himself, who is disgusted but Tara has taken quite a shine to him and tries to discourage her but she interprets his actions as honourable. Eventually, Dev visits Prem again and asks for his permission to date Tara asking Prem to promise that he would not tell Tara about Dev and Nina's affair for Tara's sake. Prem agrees but Tara tells Dev that Nina slept with her ex-boyfriend and insisted to Tara that she's paranoid and her boyfriend was not cheating on her. In November 2008, he buys Jerry's Takeaway from Jerry Morton (Michael Starke) and renames it \\"Prima Doner\\". Amber is so angry when she discovers her father has taken away her boyfriend's home and livelihood that she tells Tara about Dev's affair with Nina. This causes her and Dev to briefly split up but they reconcile, with Amber's assistance. Dev's uncle, Umed Alahan (Harish Patel), arrives for a visit in March 2009 and begins helping out in the Corner Shop. In April 2009, barmaid Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque) sees Dev and Tara's family friend, Lisa Dalton (Ruth Alexander Rubin) together the night Tara dumps him, following an argument about her art gallery and she leaves. However, Poppy tells Tara that she saw Dev and Lisa together and Tara confronts Lisa about it, telling her not to visit her or Dev again. When she asks Dev what he did the night she left, he says that he stayed in, watching television so Tara plots revenge for his betrayal. She convinces Dev to let himself be photographed naked. On 11 May, in front of a huge crowd for an unveiling on urban degradation, Dev proposes to Tara but she rejects him before unveiling a huge photo of him naked with the word LIAR printed on it. Dev is humiliated and Tara leaves soon after but is horrified to realise how her revenge has humiliated Amber too. She apologises but Amber makes it clear that she's not interested. In October 2009, Umed returns to India. In November 2009, Dev begins taking golf lessons to try to be better than Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). However, Steve is doing the same. Dev begins charming his instructor, Bernie Sayers (Jennifer Hennessy), although he notices her strange behaviour around Steve and she admits she is also teaching him. Dev and Bernie have a brief relationship but she ends it when she realises that he really wants Sunita and his children back, after learning that she has a new partner, Matt, and that they're engaged. In January 2010, Dev is secretly pleased when Sunita tells him that she has broken up with Matt. Realising that they are meant to be together, Dev and Sunita agree to give their relationship another chance and buy 7 Coronation Street from the widowed single mother, Maria Connor. In December 2010, after the tram crash Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) steals money from the Corner Shop's safe whilst Dev is in hospital after Sunita was injured. Later that month, Dev says whoever took the money will be on the CCTV footage from that night but discovers the camera was damaged; leaving the culprit unidentified. In February 2011, he attends Peter and Leanne's wedding renewal and Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) visits, looking for payment, which Dev cannot afford; so Owen threatens to tear the Corner Shop apart again if he is not paid. Dev is also confronted by Sunita as she has learned that their savings account is empty. Dev admits that the Corner Shop was not insured and he has not paid the mortgage on the house either so Sunita asks to see the business accounts. She sees that all Dev's shops are in financial trouble for various reasons (e.g. roadworks and competition from other shops) so she suggests selling everything except the Kebab Shop and the Corner Shop. Dev breaks down as it took years to build up his business empire and asks Steve to loan him £5,000, but Steve can't give him anything as he owes money to Lloyd and Owen. In November, Dev and Sunita feel further financial pressure, especially with Amber's return, as she has dropped out of university. They clash over the cost of Dev's golfing when a huge bill arrives for his annual membership fee and gets worse when Dev takes Aadi to the club with Steve and, in discovering he is very good, convinces Sunita that Aadi should have regular lessons. Sunita agrees on the condition that Dev spends the same on Amber and Asha. Sunita and Dev argue about their finances again in January 2012 when he buys Amber a car for her 21st birthday, leading Sunita (now feeling taken for granted) to have an affair with Rovers barman, Karl Munro (John Michie) and they are eventually caught together by Karl's fiancée, Stella Price (Michelle Collins), and her daughters Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Although devastated and heartbroken by Sunita's infidelity, Dev is willing to give her another chance, but she asks him to leave so he attacks Karl, trashes the shop and nearly drinks himself to death but Lloyd finds him and stops him from doing so. In April 2013, Dev loses the love of his life after she is trapped inside the basement of the Rovers during a fire started by Karl Munro. Sunita initially survives the fire after being rescued by firefighters, but Karl removes her oxygen mask and suffocates her; so as he is not identified as the arsonist. As a result, Dev and the kids are left heartbroken with the police believing Sunita set the Rovers on fire when it was in fact, Karl who framed Sunita for the crime. In September 2013, Dev finally starts to see Karl's true colours after Karl threatens Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) while Dev is inside the house talking to Jason. The pair work together to uncover Karl's crimes. They gather more evidence as the days went on, then fifteen-year-old Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) runs away from home, which puts Dev under more suspicion and they question Craig at the Corner Shop with Jason arriving just in time. The pair force the truth out of Craig, telling them that Karl committed the crime. Now that Dev believes Craig's story of the events that Karl started the fire, Dev rushes to the altar to stop Karl from marrying Stella but it is too late as the couple is now married. Meanwhile, Jason takes Craig, Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) to the police station to get Karl arrested for killing Sunita and Toni Griffiths (Tara Moran), the firefighter who was crushed in the inferno. Dev confronts Karl at his wedding reception in the Bistro, then follows him to the Rovers. After Karl finally admits to starting the fire, Dev attacks him, only for Karl to knock him unconscious by hitting him over the head with a bottle. Dev manages to text Jason while Karl holds him and Stella hostage. When Jason arrives, Karl threatens to set fire to the pub again. Jason drags Dev out while Karl takes Stella hostage in the cellar. As the police arrive, Karl realises he has to face the consequences of his actions and turns himself in to the police outside, which is witnessed by Dev, Jason and many other residents on the street. In 2014, Dev begins to develop feelings for Stella and he decides that he is unfit. Gary Windass (Mikey North) hears Dev talking about this, and recommends his army friend Kal Nazir (Jimi Mistry), who has left the army and became a personal trainer. Initially, Dev declines the offer. However, Kal visits the Rovers and Dev later agrees to let Kal help him in his goal to get fit. Kal also begins training with Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who is still suffering mentally after being involved in a car crash with his brother. On Dev's fiftieth birthday, he asks Stella for a drink. They both return to Dev's flat, unaware that Kal, Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles), Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon) are hiding behind his sofa to surprise him. Dev tells Stella that he loves her, only for her to gently reject him, as the four behind the sofa emerge and Dev feels embarrassed. Development In December 2004, it was announced that Jimmi Harkishin had decided to take a break from Coronation Street following revelations about his private life. A spokesperson for Granada said Harkishin had been granted indefinite leave to sort out his \\"problems\\" and had their full support. =Relationship with Sunita Alahan= On 12 February 2001, it was announced that Coronation Street would introduce a new Asian character named Sunita Parekh played by Shobna Gulati. Sunita was given an immediate link to established character Dev as she was an employee at his shop in Swinton. Sunita and Dev later went on to begin a relationship and eventually get married. The marriage ended in 2006 when Sunita was axed from the show. On 16 May 2009, it was confirmed that Gulati would be returning to the programme, reprising the role of Sunita. Coronation Street producer Kim Crowther first hinted at a possible return for Sunita in an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy the previous week.

Biography = Early life= Born in Kotel to a wealthy and patriotic family, he attended monastery schools in his hometown and in Karlovo, and in 1837, went to study in the Greek Orthodox College in Istanbul. In 1841, he was sentenced to death whilst involved in revolutionary plans against the Turks, but thanks to a Greek friend, managed to escape to France. A year-and-a-half later, he returned to Kotel, only to be arrested again in 1845. Sent to Istanbul for seven years of solitary confinement, he was released in May 1848. He decided to remain in Istanbul, where he worked as a lawyer and tradesman, and took part in campaigns for a Bulgarian national church. Rakovski was soon arrested once more, this time due to his creation of a secret society of Bulgarians to assist the Russians in the Crimean War. While being deported to Istanbul, he escaped, and gathered together a group of rebels. In June 1854, he was transferred to Bulgaria. =Literary work= Between 1854 and 1860, Rakovski spent his time writing, publishing reviews, and avoiding arrest. He penned his best-known work, Gorski Patnik (translated as A Traveller in the Woods or Forest Wanderer), while hiding from Turkish authorities near Kotel during the Crimean War (1853–56). Considered one of the first Bulgarian literary poems, it was not actually published until 1857. The published version differed from the first version, in that it had a clearer plot and improved style. The plot concerns a Bulgarian man who recruits a rebel group to mutiny against the Turks. Rakovski's aim in writing this was to awaken the people's spirit to fight for freedom and to take revenge on the Turks for their cruelty. The novel opens with the main character admiring the beauty of nature on the Bosporus. A preoccupation with national problems and lack of freedom clouds his mind, and he encourages others to join him in a revolt. As the insurgents travel toward Bulgaria, the reader takes in their courage and trials of the journey. The work is said to “unite all the ideology, hopes and beliefs” of the Bulgarian people in their brave fight against the yoke. Rakovski left Gorski Patnik incomplete. Written in archaic language, it was difficult to read, but still had a great influence in society. =Revolutionary work= Bulgarian Haiduts, CE 1867, by Rakovski 1861 saw him organizing a Bulgarian legion in Belgrade, where he met voivode Đuro Matanović to negotiate a simultaneous rebellion in Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Albania, and travelling through Europe recruiting support for his country's cause. While his radical views often met opposition from more moderate minds, his writings incited youth to go against the Turks. It was in this year that he wrote his Plan for the Liberation of Bulgaria. Many young people rallied under his flag to fight the Ottomans alongside the Serbs. However the conflict between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire was soon resolved and the legion was dissolved.Trotsky, p.487 During raids and recruiting G.S Rakovski stayed hidden at many addresses throughout the southern regions of Bulgaria. Rakovski moved to Bucharest, where he continued his journalistic and revolutionary activities.Crampton, p.77 p.137 Once there, he published a bilingual newspaper, Badushtnost. Rakovski was a supporter of Romania's reformist policies, and seeing potential, he began to support a union between Bulgaria and Romania. In Badushtnost, he appealed to good Bulgarian-Romanian relations and made reference to the Second Bulgarian Empire, in which both Bulgarians and Romanians lived together. Led by the belief that Ottoman power could be brought down only with armed action, he began organizing small groups of revolutionary fighters, called cheti. Their aim was to instigate unrest in Bulgaria, thus motivating the population to fight the Ottomans. For the purpose of coordinating the armed resistance Rakovski and his followers founded the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee - an organization which was yet to feature in the Bulgarian Liberation movement.Crampton, p.78 p.137 In 1867 the Committee equipped two bands (cheti) who penetrated Bulgaria led by Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu.Crampton, p.77 p.137 They fought battles with the Ottoman forces, but did not manage to fulfill their goals. Led by Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha, 120 chetnitsi entered Bulgaria in 1868 and fought their way to Stara Planina before being surrounded by the Ottomans. Some of the fighters, including Stefan Karadzha, were wounded, captured and later executed. The remaining men under the leadership of Hadzhi Dimitar were crushed at Buzludzha Peak in Stara Planina.Jelavich p.137 Georgi Rakovski died of tuberculosis in Bucharest on October 9, 1867.Trotsky, p.487 Honors Rakovski Nunatak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Georgi Sava Rakovski. Bolhrad High School is also named in his honor. An elementary school in Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina carries his name. A Government school in New Delhi, (India) also carries his name. 1 G. S. Rakovski street in Pliska, Bulgaria was named after Georgi Rakovski because it was considered a place of historical importance. It is believed that many plots were created in the goat shed which stood at the location prior to construction in 1933. The Georgi Rakovski Military Academy in Sofia is named after him.

History & Research Focus  The University of Michigan's Population Studies Center (PSC) was established in 1961, originally as a unit within the Department of Sociology. The Center has had close connections to the Department of Economics since 1966. The Center has become increasingly interdisciplinary over time, drawing faculty from Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Natural Resources, Political Science, Psychology, Public Health, Public Policy, Social Work, Sociology, and Statistics. The energy and intellectual curiosity of the Center's researchers, fostered by the strong support environment and leavened by their interaction with visitors and students at all levels, is a major source of Center momentum. The PSC comprises independent population researchers who pursue their own agendas with the support of the PSC staff. A large portfolio of both domestic and international research is supported by the Center. The Center focuses on several key areas of demographic research, which can be grouped into several major areas: 1) Families, Fertility & Children; 2) Health, Disability & Mortality; 3) Human Capital, Labor & Wealth; 4) Aging; 5) Population dynamics; 6) Inequality & Group Disparities; 7) Methodology.

February 2009.  Organization and Administration  The Center made a major institutional move in July 1998, from the College of Literature, Science, and Arts into the Institute for Social Research (ISR). The merger into ISR facilitates close integration between the PSC's demographic research and the long tradition in survey methodology and major data collection projects at ISR. PSC becomes the fourth center in ISR, joining the Survey Research Center, the Center for Political Studies, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. The Center provides administrative and support services to researchers through three core units: Administrative Services, Computing Services, and Information Services., The Administrative Core provides management and administrative support for Research Associates and their funded research projects. The Computing Core provides a state-of-the-art social science computing environment to support the Center's research and training missions. The Information Services Core provides resources and services in three broad areas. Data Services maintains a collection of demographic data files that are routinely used by Center researchers and assists in the acquisition, organization, and management of data for PSC research projects. Library Services maintains a collection of local holdings and assists researchers in collecting information from University libraries and in doing demographic library research using traditional and electronic resources. The Communications Office provides editorial services and disseminates research results through the production of working papers and web sites. Mentoring a Demography trainee  Graduate and Postdoctoral Training  The Population Studies Center provides apprenticeship training and fellowship support to graduate students in Sociology, Economics, Public Health, and Anthropology who choose demography as a field of specialization.Training program in demography The goal of the graduate training program is to produce social scientists, fully trained in their discipline, with broad knowledge in population studies and specialized skills in statistical and demographic techniques, who can undertake independent research on a wide range of population topics. In the apprenticeship program student trainees gain practical research experience under the supervision of a professional staff member. The Center does not award graduate degrees. All graduate students associated with the Center are admitted into department Ph.D. programs and earn their degrees in those programs. The Center also provides postdoctoral training to demographic researchers in a variety of fields.  PSC Financial Support  The PSC was established with funding from the Ford Foundation, and received continued support from the Ford Foundation for over 20 years. Since 1976 the Center has been supported by a population center grant (R24 HD041028) from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health. This center grant provides core infrastructure support for the Center's research activities. NICHD center grant support continues to be the major source of funding for the Center's cores. The Center also collaborates with the Survey Research Center of ISR in operating the Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA), funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), also part of the National Institutes of Health. Additional support for PSC's international research and training activities is provided by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

It has been a settlement for thousands of years, each new generation adding buildings, and leveling off old ones. Among the discoveries is an Iron Age broch, the Ness of Burgi fort. Discovery and excavation The site was first unearthed during construction work for airport improvements in the late 1970s. An arc of the broch wall was exposed in one side of a green mound during the building of the perimeter road at the airport at Sumburgh Head. Since 1995, University of Bradford staff and students, professional archaeologists and local volunteers have been excavating the site and cataloging the finds. Excavations have uncovered a multi-period settlement with broch, wheelhouses and later dwellings. The site is managed by the Shetland Amenity Trust. In the summer, costumed guides provide tours of the site and the replica Iron Age and Pictish buildings. The visitor centre also includes exhibits, and there are demonstrations of ancient crafts. The broch The broch still stands several metres high with a battered outer wall face. The broch stands at the centre of the settlement and seems to have at least three major phases of use. The first phase saw the building of the primary tower. The second phase saw a rebuilding of the broch interior which involved the addition of a secondary skin to the south and east part of the inner broch wall, and a set of radial piers to form a new interior structure. In the third phase another building was constructed inside the broch, consisting of six or more curvilinear cells clustered around a central area, with a corridor leading out towards the broch wall to the east. Structures west of the broch wheelhouse To the western (seaward) side of the broch the limits of the settlement have been established. The dominant feature was a large circular aisled roundhouse (Structure 12) around 10 metres in diameter. The walls of this building stand to over 2 metres high in places. To the west of this was a second building less well-preserved. To the south of Structure 12 was another roundhouse (Structure 14) of a similar size but oval in shape. To the north of Structure 12 was another range of buildings, including one with a set of seven (possibly originally eight or more) small 'cupboards' let into the interior wall. East of this building and closer to the broch, a circular inward-tilting arrangement of stones appeared to be the partially collapsed top of the roof of a corbelled cell. Structures east of the broch A slightly later roundhouse (Structure 21), to the east of the broch, had the greatest diameter of any of the buildings on site: approximately 12 metres internally. It seems originally to have had short piers, later rebuilt as long thin ones. There was also a later wheelhouse to the southeast of the broch (Structure 11). A multi-cellular semi-subterranean building (Structure 5) was inserted into the fill of Structure 21, and is considered to be characteristic of 'Pictish' architecture. Later use The later Iron Age buildings have yielded Viking-period artefacts suggesting Norse reuse of the buildings. The site was also used in post-medieval times with a 17th-century barn and corn-drier having been discovered. On the north side of the site was a crofthouse of mid-19th-century construction.

The name derives from a porridge traditionally served to sick or injured crew members. The term is no longer used; in the modern era surgeon's assistants are medical assistants in the Royal Navy, and hospital corpsmen in the U.S. Navy. Etymology The name comes from the serving of loblolly — a thick porridge, sometimes enhanced with chunks of meat or vegetables—to sick or injured crewmembers to hasten their recovery. Loblolly, in turn, probably comes from the fusion of lob, a Yorkshire word meaning to boil or bubble, and lolly, an archaic English word for a stew or soup. Loblolly itself eventually came to mean anything viscous, such as a swamp or bog, and terms such as the Loblolly pine were coined from the muddy habitat of the tree rather than from any culinary use. The name was first used to describe Royal Navy surgeon's assistants in 1597. The rating was also used in U.S. Navy warships from the late 18th century until 1861, when the name surgeon's steward was introduced to reflect more stringent training requirements. The name was changed to apothecary in 1866, and again in the 1870s to bayman and then in the early 20th century to Hospital Corpsman. The Royal Navy name changed to sick berth attendant. in 1833, with the nickname \\"Sick Bay Tiffy\\" (Tiffy being slang for artificer) gaining popularity in the 1890s. Medical Assistant is the current term. The term has also appeared in fiction over several centuries. In Tobias Smollett's 1748 novel The Adventures of Roderick Random, the protagonist Random was made a loblolly boy upon entering the Royal Navy. Smollett himself claimed to have been a loblolly boy during his naval career, though as a surgeon's mate rather than surgeon's assistant his role did not strictly fit within the definition of the term. Loblolly boys also appear in C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels, Alexander Kent's \\"Midshipman Bolitho\\" novels, and Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin novels. Stephen Maturin's loblolly boy, Padeen, features in several of O'Brian's books. Duties The loblolly boy's duties included serving food to the sick, but also undertaking any medical tasks that the surgeon was too busy (or too high in station) to perform. These included restraining patients during surgery, obtaining and cleaning surgical instruments, disposing of amputated limbs, and emptying and cleaning toilet utensils. The loblolly boy also often managed stocks of herbs, medicines and medical supplies.

Server-side applications do not require developer knowledge of HTML, HTTP, or JavaScript. Client-side JavaScript-based applications do not require a server, but can communicate with one via AJAX. It is free software licensed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL).  Echo2  Echo originally started as a request-response web application framework that leveraged the Swing object model to improve the speed of application development. Through the use of the Swing model, Echo was able to employ concepts such as components and event-driven programming that removed much of the pain of web application development. In late 2005, NextApp formally announced the release of their new Ajax based web application platform, \\"Echo2\\". This framework built on the concepts of Echo (well known API, total web abstraction) but delivered the additional benefit of being an Ajax environment. NextApp believed that this approach brought the framework extremely close to the capabilities of rich clients. NextApp also claimed that this reincarnation of the Echo framework provided dramatic performance, capability, and user-experience enhancements made possible by its new Ajax- based rendering engine.  Echo3  During 2007, development on a third generation of the framework, Echo3, began. The focus of this evolution was to move away from generating markup on the server side, and instead to implement rendering peers as native JavaScript objects, with an XML-based state synchronization protocol between client (web browser) and server. This was developed in tandem with a core JavaScript framework, providing the ability to define inheritance hierarchies in JavaScript in a way familiar to developers of object-oriented languages.  Competitors  Echo is often compared to frameworks such as Google Web Toolkit (GWT) as both Echo and GWT (among others) offer a programming model that completely abstracts users from the web tier. However Echo differs substantially from GWT in the way it interacts with JavaScript. GWT essentially implements a subset of the Java API in JavaScript, and as such, Java code is compiled to JavaScript and fully executed on the client side. On the other hand, Echo has offered a dual-stack approach since version 3. Applications can be written in JavaScript (client-side) or Java (server-side) or in mixed forms. Comparable frameworks include Vaadin, RAP, ZK, OpenLaszlo, ICEfaces, ThinWire, Apache Wicket, and jSeamless.  Associated projects  Echo2 has inspired various add-on projects including: * EchoPoint: \\"Next Generation\\": The most well known 3rd party component library for Echo2 * Hibernate-Spring-Echo: An effort to provide an out of the box application framework that includes Echo2 * Google maps for Echo2 * Google maps v3 for Echo2 * Gantt Charting for Echo2 * Echo2Faces: An effort to provide XML markup for Echo2 UI layouts * jZeno: A full-stack application framework that uses a highly optimized version of the original Echo framework as rendering engine. * Aejaks: A Jacl layer on top of Echo2 to easily create rich web applications.

She was built to clear minefields in offshore waters, and served the Navy in the North Atlantic Ocean and then in the Pacific Ocean. She was returned to active service for the Korean War. During Operation Wonsan she struck a mine and sunk. For her dangerous work, she was awarded four battle stars for her Korean War effort. History The second U.S. Navy warship named USS Pirate, she was laid down 1 July 1943 by Gulf Shipbuilding Co., Chickasaw, Alabama, launched 16 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Clara L. Oliver and commissioned 16 June 1944. That summer, Pirate operated in and around Casco Bay and Boston, Massachusetts; conducted ASW exercises with Italian submarine and with Task Group TG 23.9 in early-August, and later that month swept the channel from Boston to Provincetown, Massachusetts. In December she transferred to Miami, Florida, where she was school ship for student officers for the next four months. Pirate got underway from Miami 4 April 1945 to transit the Panama Canal, stopping at San Diego, California, and proceeding on to Pearl Harbor for duty. She departed Pearl Harbor and proceeded with MinDiv 32 via Eniwetok to Apra Harbor, Guam 7 June. As Allied forces made the final drive on Okinawa, Pirate reported at Nakagusuku Bay 26 June. In September she was minesweeping in area \\"Arcadia\\", in and around Jinsen, Korea, and operated off the northern coast of Formosa in November. Decommissioned at Bremerton, Washington on 6 November 1946, the ship reported to ServPac in December 1947 for deployment in Japanese waters. In a caretaker status, she retained this status, out of service in reserve for the next several years In July 1950, Pirate was with MinDiv 32, ServPac when hostilities in Korea called her back into active service. Recommissioned 14 August 1950 at Yokosuka, Japan, she departed Sasebo 8 September for duties off Pusan, Korea. On 12 October she and were mine sweeping three miles off the enemy-held island of Sin-Do when the ships hit mines. Sinking within five minutes, Pirate had 12 sailors missing and one dead.

It lies near the west bank of the River Nene, about 5 miles (8 km) east of Kettering. It consists of approximately 100 households; at the time of the 2011 census, the population of the parish (including Slipton) was 327 people.Office for National Statistics: Great Addington CP: Parish headcounts. Retrieved 15 July 2015 It has a school, church, manor house, village hall, a pub called the Hare & Hounds, playing fields and homes. There is a strong bond and rivalry with the neighbouring village Little Addington. There is evidence of Celtic, Romano-British and Anglo-Saxon settlement within the village boundary.

Originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1975. The parish covers nearly 500 hectares of land extending in a broad strip westwards from the R. Nene, on generally rising ground between 120 ft. and 300 ft. above OD. The higher W. part of the parish is on Boulder Clay but near the Nene the down-cutting of the river and two small tributary streams have exposed the underlying Jurassic limestones, clays and sands on the steep valley side. Prehistoric and Roman c (1) Iron Age settlement (SP 946741), S.W. of the village on Boulder Clay at 275 ft. above OD. An area of dark soil containing pebbles and Iron Age B pottery, has been found (BNFAS, 7 (1972), 4). b(2) Iron Age settlement (?) (SP 950756), N.W. of the village on Boulder Clay at 225 ft. above OD. An 'Iron Age 'B' occupation with burnt stone areas' is recorded (BNFAS, 7 (1972), 4). a(3) Roman settlement (SP 947756), in the N.W. of the parish, 260 ft. above OD on land sloping gently E. towards a small stream. The underlying soil is on Boulder Clay. Ploughing has produced quantities of Roman pottery, some of Nene Valley type, together with a scatter of limestone rubble and roofing tiles, perhaps indicating former buildings, over an area of 50 sq. m. Small amounts of pottery are spread over a wider area (BNFAS, 1 (1966), 8). b(4) Trackway (SP 96297550–96617526; Fig. 13), N.E. of the village, roughly parallel to the 200 ft. contour along the side of a low spur of limestone. It is orientated N.W.-S.E., crosses the Roman road 570 almost at right angles, and is traceable on air photographs as two parallel ditches 25 m. apart for a distance of 400 m. (Air photographs in NMR). b(5) Enclosures (SP 950754; Fig. 13) lies N.W. of Rectory Farm, on the W. side of a small valley at 225 ft. above OD on Boulder Clay. Air photographs show two small enclosures, bounded by a wide ditch with an entrance in the N.W. side of the larger. Two circular ditched features in the interior may be hut sites. A possible ditched trackway traceable for 50 m. runs from the entrance in a N.W. direction (air photographs in NMR). For possible Roman burials, see (16). For Roman Road 570, see p. 117\\\\. Medieval and Later d (6) Anglo-Saxon Cemetery (SP 95717442) found before 1847 on and near Shooters' Hill, a gravel-capped spur 175 ft. above OD, 700 m. S.S.W. of the village. Gravel diggers are reported to have discovered many human skeletons in the area, including three without heads. One pot, daggers, spearheads, necklaces, etc., were found. In 1866 further skeletons were found on the site as well as 'two limestone coffins'. These may be Roman and perhaps came from the churchyard. (A. Meaney, Gazetteer, 186 for all refs.; see also OS Record Cards; Whellan, Dir., 742) b(7) Anglo-Saxon Burial (centred SP 966752) was found in 1883 by ironstone diggers on the slopes of the Nene Valley near the road to Ringstead. Calcined bones were contained in an unusual jug-shaped urn with a funnel handle, ornamented with a rope-pattern and incised zig-zag lines. This vessel is one of the very rare English examples of a type found in cemeteries in the Bremen region of Germany. It is probably 5th-century in date (BM; PSA, IX (1883), 322–3; A. Meaney, Gazetteer, 186; J. Northants. Mus. and Art Gal., 6 (1969), 43). Other urns, spearheads and shield bosses are also said to have come from the site (OS Record Cards). Recent field-walking in the area has produced a few sandy hand made Saxon sherds (Beds. Arch. J., 7 (1972), 12, Great Addington 2). (8) Cultivation Remains. The common fields of the parish were enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1803 (NRO, Enclosure Map). The apparent enclosure of land here in 1607 which led to riots (VCH Northants., III (1930), 155) must have been on a very small scale, for in 1803 there was only one other small enclosed field beyond the normal 'old enclosures' around the village. Small areas of ridge-and-furrow of the former common fields still remain, or can be traced on air photographs, over the whole parish in the form of interlocked furlongs generally of C-shape. Ridge-and-furrow also survives immediately E. and N.E. of the village, alongside a small brook. It is straight or slightly curved, within existing fields and with well-marked headlands, and was all within old enclosures in 1803 (RAF VAP CPE/UK 1925, 1248–54, 4338–43).

He was drafted by the Titans in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Eastern Washington. High school career Roos was named second-team All- GSHL as tight end at Mountain View High School in Vancouver, Washington after recording 18 receptions for 306 yards and three touchdowns as a senior under head coach Mike Woodward, now head coach of Woodland High School in Woodland, WA. Woodward describes Roos as very \\"humble and quiet\\". He also made 40 tackles and two sacks as defensive lineman. More remarkable was the fact that it was the first time in which Roos had played organized football in his life. Roos earned All-League honors for the Mountain View basketball team and also threw javelin for track & field team. He earned scholar-athlete honors three times in basketball, twice in track and once in football. College career As a student-athlete at Eastern Washington University, Roos played for the Eastern Washington Eagles football team. He earned numerous honors, including first-team All-American by The NFL Draft Report, American Football Coaches Association and The Sports Network, second-team AP All-American, Division I-AA Offensive Lineman of the Year by The NFL Draft Report, unanimous first-team All-Big Sky Conference and two-time Big Sky All-Academic selection. His fellow right tackle Paul Terrell was also an All-Big Sky Conference pick. He graduated in March 2005 with a double major in finance and economics.Roos - Biography at titansonline.com Retrieved 25 March 2018 Professional career Initially projected as a late third rounder,Sports Illustrated: 2005 NFL Draft profile Roos was selected with the ninth pick of the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft out of Eastern Washington. This made him the first Division I-AA player to be drafted that season and the highest draft pick ever to come out of Eastern Washington. In 2008, Roos was elected to the Pro Bowl and was first team All Pro. On April 26, 2008 Roos signed a six-year, $43 million extension with the Tennessee Titans. On February 27, 2015, Roos retired from the NFL. He finished his career starting all 148 games he played.  Curling  Since retirement from professional football, Roos has picked up the sport of curling. In March 2018 Jared Allen formed a team of all retired NFL players, recruiting Roos, Marc Bulger and Keith Bulluck with the goal of representing the United States at the 2022 Winter Olympics. They have since played together in the 2019 USA Men's Challenge Round (qualification event for the United States Men's Curling Championship) and Ed Werenich Golden Wrench Classic (a World Curling Tour event), going winless in both events. Personal life Although born in Estonia, Roos does not speak Estonian. He is married to his college girlfriend, Katherine Fossett. Together they donated $500,000 to their alma mater, Eastern Washington University, to \\"jump start\\" the school's stadium project, which included converting their football stadium from natural grass to red turf. Because of the gesture of Roos and his wife, Eastern Washington University's Board Of Trustees approved a name change of their stadium to Roos Field.

The station broadcasts in the Daytona Beach area as a LPFM, covering about a 5 to 7 mile radius from the transmitter site, with a coverage of roughly 120,000 people depending on time of year not including online streaming. The station is non-profit, entirely student run, and does not have a fixed format, however focuses on Top 40, indie, and alternative rock. WIKD is currently operated as a division of the Embry-Riddle Student Government Association by an eight-member Operations Board.  History  The history of student radio at Embry-Riddle dates back to the 1970s and WSST-FM, which morphed into WERU-AM in 1977. WERU-AM was dissolved in 1982. A subsequent broadcasting club charted with the Student Activities department dissolved in 1988 without establishing a student-run radio station. WSST and WERU were both low-power stations that were not able to be received off campus. WIKD began as \\"The Broadcast Club\\" in the Spring semester of 1990, initially chartered by then-freshman Steve Graff. The first few meetings brought high turnout (ca. 75 students), but did not immediately lead to much progress. The club gained momentum after Graff met Todd Gumbrecht, another freshman resident of the same dormitory (Doolittle Hall, then known as Dorm I) as Graff. The two developed a publicity-heavy strategy in order to meet their goal of establishing a campus radio station. The club became known for its fliers which were posted around campus (often in unapproved locations) to announce club meetings, as this was long before e-mail and text messaging and Facebook and Twitter. The fliers were influenced by the DIY ethic of punk rock, surrealism, 1950's clip art, science fiction, and \\"golden age\\" of radio. A flier typically consisted of cut-and-pasted and otherwise altered photographs from magazines, and their distinct style and provocative nature made them stand out from other notices on campus. The initial club logo was a stylized radio tower resembling the tower symbol from an FAA sectional chart, with the letters \\"WERU\\" drawn in a 1920s art deco type script. The radioactivity symbol became another popular club logo later, appearing on buttons, T-shirts, and stickers. With the preponderance of fliers, T-shirts, buttons, and stickers, some students believed there actually already was an operating station on campus. The \\"WERU\\" station ID was not an FCC-assigned station ID, and was chosen purely because of the ease of recognition within the University community. The club decided to pursue the goal of carrier current broadcasting, and in the Fall of 1991, Graff and Gumbrecht travelled to NYC to attend a convention of carrier current college stations hosted by equipment manufacturer LPB. At this meeting, the pair obtained a copy of the UConn station bylaws, which became the model for the broadcast club/WERU organization. Also in 1991, Gumbrecht became the Student Government Association (SGA) representative for students living in campus housing. In addition to being a passionate advocate for dorm residents, Gumbrecht used this platform to further the argument for the station, and to find allies within the Student Government Association. Also, in 1991, the club organization began to bloom, with Carrie Czernikowski as the treasurer, author of the training manual, and eventual training director. Initially there was antipathy from the Dean of Students, the Student Activities office, and the SGA toward the club and its goal of establishing a radio station. This was due to the failure and dissolution of a previous iteration of the broadcast club, involving theft of equipment. The mischievous and defiant impression that the club gave off at times may not have helped with this matter. However, the growing popularity of the movement among students, and the dedication of members such as Mary Ann McKnight eventually overcame the aversion, and by 1992, \\"Campus Radio\\" became a campaign issue in the SGA presidential race. While working toward the eventual goal of a campus radio station, the club engaged in fundraising, publicity, and charity events, such as providing mobile DJ services for student organizations and Special Olympic events. These activities further increased the club's exposure, and generated funding for a proposed studio. The first WERU studio was in a closet shared by the university cafeteria vendor, Morrison's. At this point, the station broadcast via AM carrier current on 710AM. Eventually, the station moved operations to a closet in the McKay Hall dormitory with a small mixing board and two CD players. WERU later moved into a Student Government Association (SGA) office in the Student Center (currently room UC-111). With upgraded facilities, and by this time a full-fledged division of the SGA, WERU was initially broadcasting on 104.7 MHz through radiating cable FM on campus. After many years of trials and tribulations from previous Chairmen, WERU 104.7 FM had finally applied for a LPFM FCC license in 2002 thanks to SGA President, Peter Alverez, and WERU Chairman, Patrick \\"Nacho\\" Mudge. Shortly after application, \\"Nacho\\" left ERAU to be soon followed by Chairman Greg Huston, who continued to pursue the station's LPFM license. By the Fall 2004 semester Division Chairpersons Jesse Lesperance and David Yarwood had successfully completed the LPFM construction permit application. In February 2005 WERU completed its first broadcast on 99.1 FM. WIKD then applied and was approved for their current call letters as WIKD. On Christmas Day 2006, an F2 tornado struck the Embry-Riddle Daytona Beach Campus, which caused millions of dollars in damages, subsequently damaging the radio station studio. Though the valiant work of many, WIKD was quickly back up and running, and within 2 months was back to a high broadcasting standard. During the Winter break of 2011/2012 a team of WIKD members got to work to give the radio station a much needed makeover, both aesthetically, and technically. The implementation of a brand new Nautel VS300 transmitter with dynamic RDS capability was followed by a brand new climate controlled 10x12' transmission shed. The studio itself was made state of the art with complete Cat6 wiring and StudioHub+ implementation. Furthermore, new doors, ceiling tiles, paint job, desk carpet were installed. 6 fiber optic lines were run to form the internal network (WIKDNET) so that FTP and streaming services could be improved. Major strides in programming rotation were made to suit the new studio changes which include a CHR style rotation schedule. DJ's continue to bring free-format variety to the station through their shows. In April 2012 the WIKD crew applied for a frequency change from 99.1 MHz to 102.5 MHz. In doing so WIKD-LP effectively became a 24/7 FM station rather than the previous half-day timeshare station. In switching to 102.5 MHz WIKD also waived the large amounts of interference that were being received on 99.1 from a larger power FM station in Jacksonville, FL. This new station was branded as The WIKD 102.5 FM and Eagles FM was dropped completely as a name. In August 2013, WIKD become the 23rd college radio station be to be broadcast and streamed on Clear Channel's iHeart Radio service. WIKD continuously strives to provide radio entertainment in Daytona Beach, broadcasting through a fully digital capable studio, providing the only free-format radio option in Daytona Beach. WIKD also provides a DJ service to members of the ERAU community, and the Daytona Beach Area called WIKD Entertainment. WIKD Entertainment offers professional entertainment services at reasonable prices, available for parties, weddings, various on-campus events, and other private events. All on-campus events for student clubs and organizations are provided free of charge.

Bellesiles about American gun culture, an expansion of a 1996 article he published in the Journal of American History. Bellesiles, then a professor at Emory University, used fabricated research to argue that during the early period of US history, guns were uncommon during peacetime and that a culture of gun ownership did not arise until the mid- nineteenth century. Although the book was initially awarded the prestigious Bancroft Prize, it later became the first work for which the prize was rescinded following a decision of Columbia University's Board of Trustees that Bellesiles had \\"violated basic norms of scholarship and the high standards expected of Bancroft Prize winners.\\" Thesis The thesis of Arming America is that gun culture in the United States did not have roots in the colonial and early national period but arose during the 1850s and 1860s. The book argues that guns were uncommon during peacetime in the United States during the colonial, early national, and antebellum periods, that guns were seldom used then and that the average American's proficiency in use of firearms was poor. Bellesiles maintains that more widespread use and ownership of guns dated to the Civil War, a period of widespread advance in firearm manufacturing and a consequent reduction in price and improvement in accuracy. Scrutiny The book garnered many enthusiastic professional reviews and won the prestigious Bancroft Prize in 2001. The book's thesis bore upon ongoing political controversies about gun control and the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and gun rights advocates criticized it. Actor Charlton Heston, then-president of the National Rifle Association, described the book's argument as \\"ludicrous.\\" Conversely, Roger Lane's review in the Journal of American History said that the book's research was “meticulous and thorough.” He wrote that Bellesiles had \\"attacked the central myth behind the National Rifle Association's interpretation of the Second Amendment.\\" Lane declared Bellesiles’ evidence so formidable that \\"if the subject were open to rational argument,\\" the debate would be over. Clayton Cramer, a historian, software engineer, gun enthusiast and early critic of Bellesiles, later argued that the reason \\"why historians swallowed Arming America's preposterous claims so readily is that it fit into their political worldview so well... Arming America said things, and created a system of thought so comfortable for the vast majority of historians, that they didn’t even pause to consider the possibility that something wasn’t right.\\" Historian Peter Charles Hoffer, an advocate of gun control, lent support to Cramer's charge when, in a 2004 examination of the Bellesiles case, he noted that influential members of the historical profession had \\"taken strong public stands on violence in our society and its relation to gun control.\\" For instance, the academics solicited for blurbs by Bellesiles’ publisher Alfred A. Knopf \\"were ecstatic in part because the book knocked the gun lobby.\\"Hoffer, 161: “systematically dismantles one of our most cherished and dangerous national myths.” Bellesiles energized this professional consensus by attempting to play \\"the professors against the NRA in a high-wire act of arrogant bravado.\\"Hoffer, 143. For instance, he replied to Heston’s criticism by telling the actor to earn a Ph.D. before criticizing the work of scholars.Hoffer, 162. He pointed out that Cramer was \\"a long time advocate of unrestricted gun ownership\\" while he was a scholar who had \\"certain obligations of accuracy that transcend current political benefit.\\"Hoffer, 157-58. On February 16, 2000, Bellesiles had been a featured speaker at a symposium sponsored by the Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence. A link to the Brady Campaign Legal Action Project Second Amendment Symposium, February 16, 2000, was posted by the pro-gun control Potowmack Institute, among others; since then the Brady Campaign has deleted all references to Michael Bellesiles and their own Second Amendment Symposium from their website. After Bellesiles claimed he had been flooded by hate mail, both the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians endorsed a resolution condemning the alleged harassment.Hoffer, 159-60. As Hoffer later wrote, Bellesiles was convinced that whether the entire profession agreed with \\"his stance on gun ownership (and I suspect most did), surely academic historians would not let their expertise be impugned by a rank and partisan amateur like Cramer.\\"Hoffer, 158-59. In the end, the politics of the issue mattered less to historians \\"than the possibility that Bellesiles might have engaged in faulty, fraudulent, and unethical research.\\"Robert C. Williams, The Historian's Toolbox: A Student's Guide to the Theory and Craft of History (Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 2003), 117 As critics subjected the historical claims of the book to close scrutiny, they demonstrated that much of Bellesiles' research, particularly his handling of probate records, was inaccurate and possibly fraudulent.History News Network This criticism included noting several serious errors in the tables published in the book, as well as in the Journal of American History article, namely, that they did not provide a total number of cases and gave percentages that \\"were clearly wrong.\\"Hoffer, 148. In two scholarly articles, law professor James Lindgren of Northwestern University noted that in Arming America, Bellesiles had *purported to count guns in about a hundred wills from 17th- and 18th-century Providence, Rhode Island, but these did not exist because the decedents had died intestate (i.e., without wills); *purported to count nineteenth-century San Francisco County probate inventories, but these had been destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire; *reported a national mean for gun ownership in 18th-century probate inventories that was mathematically impossible; *misreported the condition of guns described in probate records in a way that accommodated his thesis, as for instance, claiming that in Providence records most guns were listed as old or broken when fewer than 10% were so listed; *miscited the counts of guns in nineteenth-century Massachusetts censuses and militia reports, *had more than a 60% error rate in finding guns listed as part of estates in Vermont records; and *had a 100% error rate in the cited gun-related homicide cases of seventeenth-century Plymouth, Massachusetts. Critics also identified problems with Bellesiles's methods of citation. Cramer noted that Bellesiles had misrepresented a passage by George Washington about the quality of three poorly prepared militia units as if his criticism applied to the militia in general. (Washington had noted that the three units were exceptions to the rule.) Cramer wrote, \\"It took me twelve hours of hunting before I found a citation that was completely correct. In the intervening two years, I have spent thousands of hours chasing down Bellesiles’s citations, and I have found many hundreds of shockingly gross falsifications.\\" Emory investigation and resignation As criticism increased and charges of scholarly misconduct were made, Emory University conducted an internal inquiry into Bellesiles's integrity, appointing an independent investigative committee composed of three leading academic historians from outside Emory.Unlike the initial wave of criticism, made primarily by non-academics or non-historians, professional historians conducted this investigation. The three historians were Stanley Katz of Princeton, Laurel Thatcher Ulrich of Harvard, and Hanna Grey, emerita at the University of Chicago. Bellesiles failed to provide investigators with his research notes, claiming the notes were destroyed in a flood.There was water damage to the building containing Bellesiles' office—as was reported in Emory University's daily paper—but critics disputed the plausibility of Bellesiles' claim that the problem explained his missing research records. The waterline break at Emory occurred in April 2000, after Arming America went to press. In the initial hardcover edition of the book, Bellesiles did not give the total number of probate records which he had investigated, but the following year, after the \\"flood,\\" Bellesiles included in the paperback edition the claim that he had investigated 11,170 probate records. \\"By his own account,\\" writes Hoffer, \\"the flood had destroyed all but a few loose papers of his data. It was a mystery how supposedly lost original data could reappear to enable him to add the number of cases to the 2001 paperback edition, then disappear once again when the committee of inquiry sought the data from him\\" (Hoffer, 153). One critic tried, unsuccessfully, to destroy penciled notes on yellow pads by submerging them in his bathtub, in order to prove that water damage would not have destroyed Bellesiles' notes.Jerome Sternstein, \\"'Pulped' Fiction: Michael Bellesiles and His Yellow Note Pads,\\", History News Network, May 20, 2002. The scholarly investigation confirmed that Bellesiles' work had serious flaws, calling into question both its quality and veracity. The external report on Bellesiles concluded that \\"every aspect of his work in the probate records is deeply flawed\\" and called his statements in self-defense \\"prolix, confusing, evasive, and occasionally contradictory.\\" It concluded that \\"his scholarly integrity is seriously in question.\\"Stanley N. Katz, Hannah H.

Nevertheless, with his \\"reputation in tatters,\\" Bellesiles issued a statement on October 25, 2002, announcing the resignation of his professorship at Emory by year's end.Hoffer, 166. Emory accepted Bellesiles' resignation effective December 31, 2002. In 2012 Bellesiles was working as a bartender while continuing to write history. Aftermath of the scandal In 2002, the trustees of Columbia University rescinded Arming Americas Bancroft Prize, the first such action in the history of the prize. Alfred A. Knopf, publisher of Arming America, did not renew Bellesiles' contract, and the National Endowment for the Humanities withdrew its name from a fellowship that the Newberry Library had granted Bellesiles.Statement of NEH Chairman Bruce Cole on Newberry Library Fellowship Award (2002) In 2003, Arming America was republished in a revised and amended edition by Soft Skull Press. Bellesiles continued to defend the book's credibility and thesis, arguing that roughly three-quarters of the original book remained unchallenged.Michael Bellesiles, \\"Weighed in an Even Balance\\" , Soft Skull Press (2003) Historians who initially admired Arming America ceased to defend Bellesiles. The nationally prominent historian Garry Wills, who had enthusiastically reviewed Arming America for the New York Times,Garry Wills review in New York Times (Sept. 10, 2000) later said, in a 2005 interview on C-SPAN, \\"I was took.

This extracted circuit is needed for various purposes including circuit simulation, static timing analysis, signal integrity, power analysis and optimization, and logic to layout comparison. Each of these functions require a slightly different representation of the circuit, resulting in the need for multiple layout extractions. In addition, there may be a postprocessing step of converting the device-level circuit into a purely digital circuit, but this is not considered part of the extraction process. The detailed functionality of an extraction process will depend on its system environment. The simplest form of extracted circuit may be in the form of a netlist, which is formatted for a particular simulator or analysis program. A more complex extraction may involve writing the extracted circuit back into the original database containing the physical layout and the logic diagram. In this case, by associating the extracted circuit with the layout and the logic network, the user can cross-reference any point in the circuit to its equivalent points in the logic and layout (cross-probing). For simulation or analysis, various formats of netlist can then be generated using programs that read the database and generate the appropriate text information. In extraction, it is often helpful to make an (informal) distinction between designed devices, which are devices that are deliberately created by the designer, and parasitic devices, which were not explicitly intended by the designer but are inherent in the layout of the circuit. Primarily there are three different parts to the extraction process. These are designed device extraction, interconnect extraction, and parasitic device extraction. These parts are inter-related since various device extractions can change the connectivity of the circuit, e.g., resistors (whether designed or parasitic) convert single nets into multiple electrical nodes. Usually one level of interconnect extraction is used with designed device extraction to provide a circuit for simulation or gate-level reduction, and a second level of interconnect extraction is used with parasitic device extraction to provide a circuit for timing analysis.

His Salginatobel (1929–1930) and Schwandbach (1933) bridges changed the aesthetics and engineering of bridge construction dramatically and influenced decades of architects and engineers after him. In 1991 the Salginatobel Bridge was declared an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.  Early life and education  Robert Maillart was born on 6 February 1872 in Bern, Switzerland. He attended the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and studied structural engineering at Zurich ETH from 1890 to 1894, lectures by Wilhelm Ritter on graphical statics forming part of the curriculum.International Database and Gallery of Structures. Short biography of Robert Maillart Maillart did not excel in academic theories, but understood the necessity to make assumptions and visualize when analyzing a structure. A traditional method prior to the 1900s was to use shapes that could be analyzed easily using mathematics. This overuse of mathematics annoyed Maillart, as he greatly preferred to stand back and use common sense to predict full-scale performance. Also, as he rarely tested his bridges prior to construction, only upon completion would he verify the bridge was adequate. He often tested his bridges by crossing them himself. This attitude towards bridge design and construction was what provided him with his innovative designs.  Career Salginatobel Bridge Maillart returned to Bern to work for three years with Pümpin & Herzog (1894–1896). He next worked for two years with the city of Zurich, then for a few years with a private firm there. By 1902, Maillart established his own firm, Maillart & Cie. In 1912 he moved his family with him to Russia while he managed construction of major projects for large factories and warehouses in Kharkov, Riga and St. Petersburg, as Russia was industrializing, with the help of Swiss investments. Unaware of the outbreak of World War I, Maillart was caught in the country with his family.Bill In 1916 his wife died, and in 1917 the Communist Revolution and nationalizing of assets caused him to lose his projects and bonds. When the widower Maillart and his three children returned to Switzerland, he was penniless and heavily in debt to Swiss banks.Siegfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: the growth of a new tradition, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967, p. 475Laffranchi & Marti After that he had to work for other firms, but the best of his designs were still to come. By 1920 he moved to an engineering office in Geneva, which later had offices in Bern and Zurich.  Development and use of reinforced concrete  The first use of concrete as a major bridge construction material was in 1856. It was used to form a multiple-arch structure on the Grand Maître Aqueduct in France. The concrete was cast in its crudest form, a huge mass without reinforcement. Later in the nineteenth century, engineers explored the possibilities of reinforced concrete as a structural material. They found that the concrete carried compressive forces, while steel bars carried the tension forces. This made concrete a better material for structures. Joseph Monier, from France, is credited with being the first to understand the principles of reinforced concrete. He embedded an iron-wire mesh into concrete. He was a gardener, not a licensed engineer, and sold his patents to contractors who built the first generation of reinforced concrete bridges in Europe. He also perfected the technique of pre-stressing concrete, which leaves permanent compressive stresses in concrete arches. By the early twentieth century, reinforced concrete became an acceptable substitute in construction for all previous structural materials, such as stone, wood, and steel. People such as Monier had developed useful techniques for design and construction, but no one had created new forms that showed the full aesthetic nature of reinforced concrete. Robert Maillart had an intuition and genius that exploited the aesthetic of concrete. He designed three-hinged arches in which the deck and the arch ribs were combined, to produce closely integrated structures that evolved into stiffened arches of very thin reinforced concrete and concrete slabs. The Salginatobel Bridge (1930) and Schwandbach Bridge (1933) are classic examples of Maillart's three-hinged arch bridges and deck-stiffened arch bridges, respectively. They have been recognized for their elegance and their influence on the later design and engineering of bridges. These designs went beyond the common boundaries of concrete design in Maillart's time. Both of the bridges mentioned above are great examples of Maillart's ability to simplify design in order to allow for maximum use of materials and to incorporate the natural beauty of the structure's environment. Selected from among 19 entrants in a design competition in part because of the low cost of his proposal, Maillart began construction of the Salginatobal Bridge in Schiers, Switzerland in 1929; it opened on 13 August 1930. Maillart's first mushroom slab in the warehouse Giesshübel in Zurich (1910) Mushroom slab on the third floor of the Grain storage of the Swiss Confederation in Altdorf (1912) Maillart is known also for his revolutionary column design in a number of buildings. He constructed his first mushroom ceiling for a warehouse in Zurich, together with treating the concrete floor as a slab, rather than reinforcing it with beams. One of his most famous is the design of the columns in the water filtration plant in Rorschach, Switzerland. Maillart decided to abandon standard methods in order to create \\"the more rational and more beautiful European method of building\\". Maillart's design of the columns included flaring the tops to reduce the bending moment in the beams between the columns. With the flare, the columns formed slight arches to transfer the loads from the ceiling beams to the columns. Maillart also flared the bottom of the columns to reduce the pressure (force per area) on a certain point of the soil foundation. By flaring the bottoms of the columns, the area of the load was more widely distributed, therefore reducing the pressure over the soil foundation. Many of his predecessors had modeled by this method using wood and steel, but Maillart was revolutionary in being the first to use concrete. He used concrete because it could support a large mound of earthen material for insulation against freezing. Since concrete is very good in compression situations, it was the perfect material to support a large, unmoving mass of earth.

As the nineteenth century neared its end, the major factor contributing to the need for scientific design of bridges was the railroads. Engineers had to know the precise levels of stresses in bridge members, in order to accommodate the impact of trains. The first design solution was obtained by Squire Whipple in 1847. His major breakthrough was that truss members could be analyzed as a system of forces in equilibrium. This system, known as the \\"method of joints,\\" permits the determination of stresses in all known members of a truss if two forces are known. The next advance in design was the \\"method of sections,\\" developed by Wilhelm Ritter in 1862. Ritter simplified the calculations of forces by developing a very simple formula for determining the forces in the members intersected by a cross-section. A third advance was a better method of graphical analysis, developed independently by J.C. Maxwell (UK) and Karl Culmann. (Switzerland). Robert Maillart learned the analytical methods of his era, but he was most influenced by the principles developed by his mentor, Wilhelm Ritter, mentioned above. Maillart studied under Ritter, who had three basic principles of design. The first of these was to value calculations based on simple analysis, so that appropriate assumptions could be made based on common sense. The second was to consider carefully the construction process of the structure, not just the final product. The last principle was to test a structure always with full-scale load tests. All these principles are an adaptation of the available techniques, but with an emphasis on the careful study of previously built structures. At the time of Maillart and Ritter, other designers preferred that their designs evolve from previously successful structures and designs. German engineers and scientists had developed elaborate mathematical techniques, and were confident that they did not need practical load tests of their designs developed using those techniques. However, these techniques did not encourage designers to think of unusual shapes, because those shapes could not be completely analyzed using the available mathematical techniques. Ritter's principles did allow for uncommon shapes.

History The hospital was founded in 1181 by Hugh de Puiset (Bishop Pudsey), to care for 65 lepers and dedicated to \\"our Lord, to the Blessed Virgin, to St. Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha\\". Its statutes were amended at the request of Bishops Richard Kellaw and Thomas Langley. The hospital was endowed with a range of lands, including Sherburn, Garmondsway Moor, Ebchester, Whitton, Raceby and Sheraton. Sherburn Hospital survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the associated closures of many hospitals (including nearby Kepier) and a new constitution was introduced by Act of Parliament in 1585 for the establishment of \\"The Master and Brethren of Christ's Hospital in Sherborne near Durham\\". George Stanley Faber became master of the hospital in 1832 and devoted much of his income to improving it. He died there in 1854 and was buried in its chapel. The hospital became very wealthy due to coal mining on its estates. As a result, a new regime was introduced in 1857 by the charity commissioners meaning: * Provision was made for the education of poor children resident in the townships of Sherburn House and Whitwell by setting money aside for the erection and maintenance of a school, and for grants to schools in Gilesgate, Shadforth and Shincliffe, attended by children of miners or labourers living on Hospital estates. * The Master was to be a clergyman appointed by the Bishop and was to have the general supervision of the inmates and officers, subject to the overriding authority of the Governors. * The total number of Brethren was to be thirty: fifteen living in and fifteen living out. There was no longer any reference to the casual relief of wayfarers at the gate. * The construction of a hospital in the modern sense of the word was envisaged, the number of patients being initially limited to thirty-five, and the building was completed by 1863. For various reasons, admissions did not begin until 1872. * A dispensary, providing free medical treatment for the poor, was opened in part of the Master's house in 1858 and later in a special building. The average annual attendance soon exceeded 3,700. The chapel and the gatehouse are grade II* listed buildings. The hospital, as Sherburn House Charity, now provides residential care and sheltered housing for residents and former residents of the ancient diocese of Durham, and is a significant grant making body to individuals and local community groups, in line with the charity's objects.

They live in remote villages in the mountains and coastal areas.Camperspoint: Calamian and its Tribes . Accessed August 28, 2008. In 1962, a team of anthropologists from the National Museum led by Dr. Robert Fox unearthed fossils at Lipuun Point (now known as the Tabon Cave Complex) in Quezon town that were classified as those of Homo sapiens and believed to be 22,000 to 24,000 years old. The recovery of the Tabon Man and other significant findings in the area earned for Palawan the title, \\"the Cradle of Philippine Civilization.\\" Research has shown that the Tagbanwa and Palawano are possible descendants of the Tabon Caves' inhabitants. Their language and alphabet, farming methods, and common belief in soul relatives are some of their cultural similarities. After the death of Ferdinand Magellan, the remnant of his fleet landed in Palawan. Magellan's chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, in his writings, described the cultivated fields of the native people populating the Palawan Islands. He also mentioned that these people use weapons consisting of blowpipes, spears and bronze ombard. During his stay in the area, he witnessed for the first time cockfighting and fistfighting. He also discovered that the natives had their own system of writing consisting of 13 consonants and 3 vowels, and they had a dialect of 18 syllables. He further wrote that in Palawan, the local King had 10 scribes who wrote down the King's dictation on leaves of plants.Puerto Princesa website . Accessed August 28, 2008. Ethnic groups =Batak= The Batak, which means \\"mountain people\\" in Cuyonon is a group of indigenous people that resides in the northeast portion of Palawan. They live in the rugged interiors of northeastern Palawan. Living close to nature, they are a peaceful and shy people. These people believe in nature spirits, with whom they communicate through a babaylan or medium. =Palaweños= Native-born lowland dwellers (calling themselves Palaweños, much to the amusement and distress of the original tribal groups, such as the Palawan who are called Palawano by outsiders) include the Cuyunon, Agutayanon sub-groups. The Cuyunons, originally from the island town of Cuyo in northern Palawan, are considered the elite class in this group. They are religious, disciplined and have a highly developed community spirit. Their conversion to Christianity has led to the merger of the animistic beliefs of the Cuyunon with the Christian elements to produce a folk Christianity which is the prevailing belief of the Cuyunon. The Agutayanons practice a simpler island lifestyle, with fishing and farming as their main source of livelihood. =Palawano= The Palawan tribe, also known as Pala'wan (or Palawan, depending on sub-dialect) or Palawano (only by outsiders), is one of the indigenous peoples of Palawan. They traditionally hunt using soars and bamboo blowguns.Palawan Profile at Home.comcast.net. Accessed August 28, 2008. The Palawano closely resemble the Tagbanwa, and in the past, they were doubtless the same people. Some Tausug residents in Palawan call the Palawano Traan, which means \\"people in scattered places\\". Like the Yakan of Basilan, the Palawano live in houses out of sight of each other, scattered among their plots of farm lands. Their main occupation is subsistence farming, cultivating mainly upland rice. The tribe is composed of several sub-groups. One small community of S.W. Palawanos, living in the internal mountain are known as the taaw't bato (often misspelled by Filipinos as tau't bato by substituting the Tagalog word tao \\"people\\" for the Palawano word taaw). Taaw't Bato means simple the \\"people of the rock.\\" They are found in the southern interior of Palawan in the volcanic crater of Mount Mantalingaan. Some uniformed outsiders believe there is a separate group called Ke'ney (and similar forms), but this is simply a derogatory term meaning \\"thick, upriver people.\\" No one uses the term to refer to themselves as a people. Most of the Palawans are now settled in the highlands of the island of Palawan, from just north of Quezon on the west side and Abo-Abo on the east, all the way to the southern tip of the island at Buliluyan. Their religion is an old form of belief once practised throughout the central Philippines prior to the Spanish arrival in the 16th century; a mix of traditional animism with elements of Hinduism and Islamic belief. Some have embraced Islam from their southern Molbog and Palawani neighbors. A small number of them are Protestant due to recent missionary campaigns. Taaw't Bato The Taaw't Bato means \\"people of the rock\\". They are a small community of traditional southwestern Palawanos who reside in the crater of an extinct volcano during certain seasons of the year, in houses built on raised floors inside caves though others have set their homes on the open slopes. They are found in the Singnapan Basin, a valley bounded by Mount Matalingahan on the east and the coast on the west. North of them is the municipality of Quezon, and to the South are the still unexplored regions of Palawan. They are still primitive in their lifestyle, even in the way of dressing. The men still wear g-strings made of bark and cloth, and the women wear a piece of cloth made into skirts to cover the lower body. Both of them are half naked, but sometimes women wear a blouse that is not indigenous but obtained through the market system.Indigenous people: Palawan Islands . Accessed August 28, 2008. Taaw't Bato artistry is cruder compared to other Palawan groups, except in exceptional cases involving basketry. Around cave-dwellings, for example, they construct a light and sturdy lattice-work made of saplings lashed together and anchored fast to crevices in the walls to provide access to the caves. The construction does not depend on any major framework to hold the unit against the walls. The anchorage is distributed all along the framework such that the breakdown of one section can be compensated for by the rest of the construction. With conditions varying in different caves, there are modifications and elaboration on the basic datag or sleeping platforms, and lagkaw or granary. They are swidden cultivators, practicing multiple cropping with cassava as the major source of carbohydrate. They also produce sweet potato, sugarcane, malungay, garlic, pepper, string beans, squash, tomato, pineapple, etc. Throughout the year, hunting and foraging are pursued to complement the carbohydrate diet of the people. Most of the wild pigs are caught through spring traps. They also indulge in sambi (barter) and dagang (monetary exchange). The trade is specifically for marine fish which the people of Candawaga provide in exchange for horticultural products of the Taaw't-Bato. Dagang involves forest products like the almaciga, rattan, etc. The basic social unit among the Taaw't-Bato of Singnapan is the ka-asawan (marriage group). This extends from the basic couple, man and woman, to the more complex arrangements of a compound and extended family grouping. The ka- asawahan or households units are further grouped into larger associations called bulun-bulun, which literally means \\"gathering\\". These multi-household bands are physically bounded in the terms of areas of habitation. Each bulun- bulun ordinarily occupies a single cave for residence, or a single house complex in the swidden area. One thing clear is that membership in a bulun- bulun is characterized by the ecosystem of sharing through different types of social and material exchanges, a prominent example being the sharing of food. Because of their uniqueness, the Philippine government declared their area off limits to strangers to protect them from unreasonable exploitation. This tribe subsists on hunting, gathering fruits and planting crops and rice near the forest.Camperspoint: Ethnic groups in the South Accessed August 28, 2008. However, the tribe have recently come under threat from mining concessions that have been granted. In particular the communities living around the Mt. Gangtong and Mantalingahan range have been affected by claims upon their land for nickel mining. This is despite measures that were taken to prevent events like this from happening as prior claims for mining are still valid.

They practice shifting cultivation of upland rice, which is considered a divine gift, and are known for their rice wine ritual called pagdiwata. Central Tagbanwas are found in the western and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. They are concentrated in the municipalities of Aborlan, Quezon, and Puerto Princesa. Calamian Tagbanwa, on the other hand, are found in Baras coast, Busuanga Island, Coron Island, Linipacan Calibangbangan, a Cultural Preservation area (off limits to foreigners and the largest Contiguous grouping), and in some parts of El Nido.Palawan Tourism Council: Palawan Culture. Accessed August 28, 2008. Shifting cultivation of upland rice is part of their cultural and economic practices. Rice is considered a divine gift and is fermented to make rice wine, which they use in Pagdiwata, or rice wine ritual. The cult of the dead is the key to the religious system of the Tagbanwa. They believe in several deities found in the natural environment. Their language and alphabet, practice of kaingin and common belief in soul-relatives are part of their culture. This group are excellent in basketry and wood carving. In addition, they are also famous for their beautifully crafted body accessories. Their combs, bracelets, necklaces and anklets are usually made of wood, beads, brass and copper.Philippine Ethnic Crafts: Tagbanua .

They are the only indigenous people in Palawan where the majority of its people are Muslims. The area constitutes the homeland of the Molbog people since the classical era prior to Spanish colonization. The Molbog are known to have a strong connection with the natural world, especially with the sacred pilandok (Philippine mouse-deer), which can only be found in the Balabac islands. A Muslim tale tells the Philippine mouse-deer once tricked a prince into giving up his bag of gold and facing a hive of angry bees. Another tale depicts him as a clever guardian of the environment, using his wisdom as an advantage against those who destroy forests, seas, and wildlife. The coconut is especially important in Molbog culture at it is their most prized agricultural crop.

Microsporangia occur in all vascular plants that have heterosporic life cycles, such as seed plants, spike mosses and the aquatic fern genus Azolla. In gymnosperms and angiosperm anthers, the microsporangia produce microsporocytes, the microspore mother cells, which then produce four microspores through the process of meiosis. Microsporocytes are produced in the microsporangia of gymnosperm cones and the anthers of angiosperms. They are diploid microspore mother-cells, which then produce four haploid microspores through the process of meiosis. These become pollen grains, within which the microspores divide twice by mitosis to produce a very simple gametophyte. Heterosporous plants that produced microspores in microsporangia and megaspores in separate megasporangia evolved independently in several plant groups during the Devonian period. Fossils of these plants show that they produced endosporic gametophytes, meaning that their gametophytes were not free-living as in bryophytes but developed within the spores, as in modern heterosporic vascular plants. In angiosperms, a very young anther (the part of the stamen that contains the pollen) consists of actively dividing meristematic cells surrounded by a layer of epidermis. It then becomes two-lobed. Each anther lobe develops two pollen sacs. Then, a two-lobed anther develops four pollen sacs that situate at four corners of the anther. Development of pollen sacs begins with the differentiation of archesporial cells in the hypodermal region below epidermis at four corners of the young anther. The archesporial cells divide by periclinal division to give a subepidermal primary parietal layer and a primary sporogenous layer. The cells of the primary parietal layer divide by successive periclinal and anticlinal divisions to form concentric layers of pollen sac wall. The wall layers from periphery to center consist of: *A single layer of epidermis between, which becomes stretched and shrivels off at maturity *A single layer of endothecium. The cells of endothecium have fibrous thickenings. *One to three middle layers. Cells of these layers generally disintegrate in the mature anther *A single layer of tapetum. The tapetal cells may be uni-, bi- or multinucleate and possess dense cytoplasm. The cells of the primary sporogenous layer divide further and give rise to diploid sporogenous tissue.

It has been suggested that this area, in particular the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta, is one of the primary origins of the definitive haematopoietic stem cell. The aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region is an area derived from splanchnopleura mesoderm identified in embryonic humans, mice, and non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds and zebrafish. It contains the dorsal aorta, genital ridges and mesonephros and lies between the notochord and the somatic mesoderm, extending from the umbilicus to the anterior limb bud of the embryo. The AGM region plays an important role in embryonic development, being the first autonomous intra- embryonic site for definitive haematopoiesis. Definitive haematopoiesis produces hematopoietic stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate any blood cell lineage in the adult circulation. Specialised endothelial cells on the dorsal aorta of the AGM region, identified as haemogenic endothelium differentiate into haematopoietic stem cells.  In embryonic development  The AGM region is derived from the mesoderm layer of the embryo. During organogenesis (around the fourth week in human embryos), the visceral region of the mesoderm, the splanchnopleura, transforms into distinct structures consisting of the dorsal aorta, genital ridges and mesonephros. For a period during embryonic development, the dorsal aorta produces hematopoietic stem cells, which will eventually colonise the liver and give rise to all mature blood lineages in the adult. By birth, the dorsal aorta becomes the descending aorta, while the genital ridges form the gonads. The mesonephros go on to form nephrons and other associated structures of the kidneys. The formation of the AGM region has been best described in non-mammalian vertebrates such as Xenopus laevis. Shortly after gastrulation, cells from the dorsolateral plate, analogous to the splanchnopleura mesoderm in mammals, migrate to the midline, beneath the notochord to form the dorsal aorta, and laterally the cardinal veins and nephric ducts.  Function  The most significant function of the aorta gonad mesonephros region is its role in definitive haematopoiesis. Definitive haematopoiesis is the second wave of embryonic haematopoiesis and give rise to all hematopoietic stem cells in the adult hematopoietic system. The aorta gonad mesonephros region has been shown to harbour multipotent hematopoietic colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) progenitor cells and pluripotential long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-HSCs). In contrast to the yolk sac, the extra-embryonic haematopoietic site, the number of CFU-S was much greater in the aorta gonad mesonephros region. LTR-HSC activity was also found in the aorta gonad mesonephros region at a slightly earlier time than in the yolk sac and fetal liver. Thus indicating the potency of definitive haematopoiesis from this region. Furthermore, isolated organ cultures of the AGM from mice embryos can autonomously initiate hematopoietic stem cell activity, without influence from the yolk sac or liver. At 10 days post coitus (d.p.c.) the aorta gonad mesonephros region was able to initiate and expand definitive haematopoietic stem cell activity, whereas no haematopoietic activity was seen in the yolk sac until 11 d.p.c. This is the same case in human embryos, where they are first detected at day 27 in the aorta gonad mesonephros region, expand rapidly at day 35, then disappear at day 40. This “disappearance” correlates to the migration of these hematopoietic stem cells to the foetal liver, where it becomes the subsequent site of haematopoiesis.  Histology  The dorsal aorta consists of an endothelial layer and an underlying stromal layer. There is also another cell population called haematogenic endothelium, which derive from the endothelial layer to produce hematopoietic stem cells. = Endothelial cells = Endothelial cells line the lumen of all blood vessels as a single squamous endothelial layer. These cells maintain contact with each other through tight junctions. In the AGM, endothelial cells line the lumen of the dorsal aorta. A specialised subset of endothelial cells, haemogenic endothelium has the potential to differentiate into haematopoietic stem cells. = Haemogenic endothelium = Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were detected adhering firmly to the ventral endothelium of the dorsal aorta. These cells have been identified to originate from haematogenic endothelium, a precursor of both hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. This is where HSC differentiate from the endothelial lining of the dorsa aorta. VE-cadherin, a specific marker for endothelial cells is found on the luminal side of the aortic endothelium. Cells clustered on the wall of the dorsal aorta also expressed VE-cadherin as well as CD34, a common hematopoietic and endothelial marker; and CD45, a marker present on hematopoietic cells. When these special endothelial cells were cultured in vitro, they were able to generate haematopoietic stem cells at a higher rate than cells from a haematopoietic origin. Thus the co- expression of cell surface markers from both lineages suggests that hematopoietic stem cells differentiate from endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta in the AGM. Time lapse imaging of live zebrafish embryos has provided the visualisation of haematogenic endothelium differentiating into hematopoietic stem cells. From about 30 hours post-fertilization, a few hours before the first appearance of dHSCs, many endothelial cells from the aortic floor start contracting and bending towards the subaortic space, usually lasting for 1–2 hours. Then these cells undergo a further contraction along the mediolateral axis, bringing together its two lateral endothelial neighbours and releasing its contact with them. The emerged cell assumes a rounded morphology and maintains strong contacts with the rostral and caudal endothelial cells to travel along the vessel’s axis. Electron microscope images show that these cells maintain contacts through tight junctions. Once these contacts dissolve, the cell, due to its apical-base polarity, moves into the subaortic space and consequently colonises other hematopoietic organs.  Haematopoietic stem cell development  In the AGM production of HSCs, it is believed that haemogenic endothelial cells play a key role. Haemogenic endothelial cells are specific endothelial cells that concurrently express both haematopoietic and endothelial markers. These haemogenic endothelial cells then become activated, releasing their binding with adjacent endothelial cells, and entering circulation in a process referred to as ‘budding’. This occurs at E9.5 in the developing mouse embryo. From here the haemogenic endothelial cells develop into HSCs. However, the precise signalling pathway involved in haemogenic endothelial cell activation is unknown, but several signalling molecules have been implicated including nitric oxide (NO), Notch 1, and Runx1. Signaling pathways involved in AGM haemogenic endothelial cell activation include: = Runx1 = RUNX1 (also known as AML1) is a transcription factor that has been heavily implicated in the production and activation of haemogenic endothelial cells in the AGM. RUNX1 knockout studies have shown a complete removal of definitive haematopoietic activity in all foetal tissues before embryo lethality at E12. RUNX1 knockouts also produce morphological changes in the AGM, with excessive crowding of mesenchymal cells. As mesenchymal cells differentiate into endothelial cells, the absence of RUNX1 may impact on the ability of mesenchymal cells to differentiate into haemogenic endothelial cells. This would explain the increase in mesenchymal cell number, and the distinct lack of cells positive for other haematopoietic markers. Runx1 has also been implicated in the activation of haemogenic endothelium. Using conditional knockouts it was shown that the removal of Runx1 expression in AGM haemogenic endothelial cells, prevented the production of HSCs. The same experiments also showed that once HSCs were produced, Runx1 was no longer required producing no deviation in HSC activity compared to controls. Additionally, when AGM cells from Runx1 knockouts underwent retroviral transfer in vitro to overexpress Runx1, they were able to be rescued and produce definitive haematopoietic cells. This suggests that Runx1 plays a critical role in the signalling pathway for haemogenic cell activation and its production from mesenchymal cells. = Nitric oxide = Nitric oxide signalling has also been shown to play a role in haemogenic endothelial cell production and activation, possibly by regulating the expression of Runx1. The sheer stress from blood flow activates mechanoreceptors in the blood vessel to produce NO, making NO production circulation dependent. This is seen in Ncx1 knockouts, where the failure to develop a heartbeat, and consequent lack of circulation results in a down-regulation of Runx1 and no haematopoietic activity in the AGM. When Ncx1 knockouts are supplied with an external source of NO, haematopoietic activity in the AGM returns to near wild-type levels. This isolates NO signalling as the key factor controlling haematopoiesis, and not just the presence of circulation. However the signalling cascade linking NO to Runx1 expression is yet to be elucidated. NO signalling has also been shown to control the motility of endothelial cells by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1. This makes it likely that it is involved in the budding of haemogenic endothelial cells into circulation. As Runx1 is also crucial for haemogenic endothelial cell activation, it is possible that NO regulates both of these downstream effects. = Notch signaling = Notch1 is another protein which has been implicated in the signalling pathway for HSC production. Notch1 knockouts exhibit normal haematopoiesis in the yolk sac, but fail to produce any HSCs in the AGM. Experiments have been shown that decreased Notch1 expression also affects the expression of Runx1, resulting in its downregulation. Further experiments in which Notch1 is overexpressed shows large clusters of definitive haematopoietic cells developing in the endothelium of the AGM. As Runx1 expression is proportional to haematopoietic cell production, these results suggest that Notch1 is also involved in regulating Runx1.

Marhamchurch village is situated south of Bude off the A39 road.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 190 Bude & Clovelly The Civil Parish population at the 2011 census was 837. History The name derives from the Celtic Saint Marwenne (Morwenna) who is thought to have founded a hermitage here around the end of the fifth century. Marwenne was one of the twenty-four children of St Brychan, a Welsh saint and king. Marhamchurch parish church is dedicated to St Marwenne. Most of the present church is of the 14th century; in the 15th century an aisle and porch were added. In the early 15th century the existence of an anchorite's cell occupied by an anchoress called Cecilia Moys is recorded.Charles Henderon proposed that a slab of pierced greenstone 32 in x 22 in x 4 in reused in the west wall had been the window of the cell on the north side of the chancel. Features of interest include the four-holed cresset stone and a Norman quarter-capital (though this is unlikely to be a fragment of the Norman church which may have preceded the present building). St Marwenne was probably the same as Morwenna of Morwenstow. In the 9th century the district was probably on the border between Cornwall and Devon as the farms in the parish have Saxon names unlike those of Poundstock on the other side of the River Neet.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 153-154 Marhamchurch was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) when it was one of several manors held by Hamelin from Robert, Count of Mortain. There was one virgate of land and land for 2 ploughs. There was one plough, 1 serf, 1 villein, 2 smallholders, 20 acres of pasture and 20 sheep. The value of the manor was 6 shillings though it had formerly been worth 10 shillings.Thorn, C. et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall.

Medieval music =Liturgical repertoire= In the early days of the Catholic Church, several local liturgies developed, such as the Gallican in France, the Sarum in England, the antique Roman in Rome and the Ambrosian rite in Milan. The Visigothic Council of Toledo organized the Hispanic rite (Visigothic or Mozarab are variant terms) in 633. The main source of the Hispanic rite is the León Antifonary (tenth century), which was most probably copied from an original collected in Beja (now in Alentejo, southern Portugal). The Beja region is home to one of the earliest mentions of a musician, in the activity of Andre Princeps Cantorum (489–525). The oldest manuscript (eleventh century) of Portuguese liturgical music in Toledan Hispanic notation is kept at the University of Coimbra General Library. Most other existing documents use Aquitan notation. From the middle of the thirteenth century on, the notation presents typically Portuguese variations; this Portuguese notation was used until the fifteenth century, when modern notation in staves was adopted. However, the church would start worrying soon about the proliferation of liturgies. From the mixture of the galican liturgy with the antique Roman one would result, traditionally under pope Gregory I (540–604), the modern Roman liturgy, also known as Gregorian liturgy, comprising the Gregorian chant. This would become the official liturgy of the Catholic Church and substituted gradually the local ones. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Council of Burgos decreed the substitution of the Hispanic rite by the modern Roman one in 1080. This measure was eased by the fact that, during the Reconquista, most part of the bishops were French (Gérard, Maurice Bourdin, Jean Péculier, Bernard, Hughes). =Profane music= King Dinis I of Portugal. In Portugal, an aristocratic poetical-musical genre was cultivated, at least since the independence (1139), whose texts are kept in three main collections (Cancioneiros): Cancioneiro da Ajuda (13th century), Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional (16th, on originals from the 14th), Cancioneiro da Vaticana (16th, on originals from the 14th). The 1680 poems kept in the Cancioneiros are divided in three forms: cantigas de amigo (songs of friend), cantigas de amor (songs of love) and cantigas de escárnio e maldizer (songs of mockery). The intrinsic link to music is well expressed in the Cancioneiro da Ajuda, where the staves have been drawn, but no melodies have been written. The only known musical source known until recently was due to a bookseller in Madrid, who found in the beginning of the 20th century a parchment with the seven Cantigas de Amigo by Martin Codax, six of them with the respective melodies. Codax was a (Galician? Portuguese?) troubadour from the court of King Dinis I of Portugal. In 1990, Prof. Harvey L. Sharrer (University of California at Santa Barbara) discovered at the Torre do Tombo in Lisbon a medieval document (the Pergaminho Sharrer) with seven Cantigas de Amor by King Dom Dinis, including its musical setting. Development of polyphony Little is known about the introduction of polyphony in Portugal. Polyphony was used in nearby places, such as Santiago de Compostela in Galicia (Spain), and it was imported to Portugal in well-developed stage. Jehan Simon de Haspre was a well-known composer and defender of the ars subtilior, and helped popularize polyphony while in the court of Fernando I of Portugal. The main centers for Portuguese musical development during this period was the royal chapel, the monasteries (Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra and the Alcobaça Monastery), royal court, cathedrals (specially the Cathedral of Évora) and the University. =The royal chapel= The Capela Real, royal chapel, was founded by D. Dinis in 1299. D. Duarte (1391–1438) elaborated a Regiment (Ordenaçam) of the Chapel, which indicates that the standard practice was a three-voice singing. His son, Afonso V (1432–1481), sent the Mestre de Capela (Master of the Chapel), Álvaro Afonso, to the court of Henry VI of England (1421–1471) in order to get a copy of the statutes, regiment and liturgy practiced in the English Royal Chapel. The detailed description written by William Say is still kept at Évora. =The Court= Testou minha ventura, one of the 65 anonymous works compiled in the Cancioneiro de Elvas. As with the trovadoresque poetry, we keep important collections of texts of the 15th and 16th century (e.g. Cancioneiro Geral, compiled by Garcia de Resende), but the musical documents are fewer. The main sources of the court music in the Renaissance and Mannerist periods are: Cancioneiro de Elvas (Públia Hortênsia Library, at Elvas), Cancioneiro de Lisboa (National Library, Lisbon), Cancioneiro de Paris (École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris), Cancioneiro de Belém (Museu Nacional de Arqueologia e Etnologia, Lisbon) The poetical forms are the vilancete (or vilancico), the cantiga and the romance. The first two, similar to the French virelai and to the Italian ballata, are generally dedicated to the love thematic, though satire and social criticism are not excluded. They share a refrain and stanzas structure. The romance is dedicated to celebrate historical events, applying the same musical text to all the stanzas of the poem. =The Cathedrals= Cardinal-Princes D. Afonso (1509–1540) and D. Henrique (1512–1580), sons of D. Manuel I of Portugal (1469–1521) administrated the main Portuguese dioceses through the 16th century. Afonso administrated the Évora and Lisboa dioceses until his death. Henrique was successively Archbishop of Braga, Lisboa and Évora, as well as head of the Portuguese Inquisition. He became King of Portugal when his grand-nephew Sebastião I (1554–1578) died at Alcácer-Quibir (1578). As princes, they had their personal chapels and imposed a magnificent liturgy in the cathedrals they administrated. Cardinal-Infante Afonso of Portugal In Évora, D. Afonso attracted high-quality musicians (like Mateus de Aranda, Mestre de Capela from 1528 to 1544) for the cathedral by establishing significant wages; Pedro do Porto (also known as Pedro Escobar, El Portugués), Cantor of the chapel of Isabel I of Castile, the Catholic Queen, and Master of the choir boys at Sevilla, comes as Mestre de Capela to Évora. He is the author of the most ancient polyphonic piece by a Portuguese author (a three-voice Magnificat), as well as the most ancient polyphonic treatment of the Requiem in the Iberian Peninsula. D. Afonso also founded a school for the choir boys, allowing them to study after the voice-change; many of these boys became professional musicians. This Évora school formed high-standard musicians for more than 150 years. Besides Évora, Braga and Coimbra show a particular care in the liturgy. The most ancient version from a Mass by a Portuguese author is from a Cantor of the Coimbra cathedral, Fernão Gomes Correia (active 1505–32). =The Main Monasteries= The Santa Cruz Monastery The most important monasteries kept a solemn liturgy. From these, the Santa Cruz Monastery, in Coimbra, had a particular importance. Founded in the 12th century by D. Afonso Henriques, it was the first school of superior studies in Portugal (St. Anthony of Padua – or of Lisbon – studied there). In the 16th century, several monks distinguished by their musical gifts, as D. Heliodoro de Paiva and D. Francisco de Santa Maria. The musical performances at Santa Cruz competed with those at El Escorial, and were praised for their conciliation between polyphony and the respect for the sacred texts. =The University= The Portuguese University was founded in Lisbon by D. Dinis in 1290 and had a Music teacher as early as 1323. After several transfers between Coimbra and Lisbon, King João III (1502–1557) established it definitively at Coimbra in 1537. The move to Coimbra was followed by a reorganization in 1544, in which the King himself proposed Mateus de Aranda (Mestre de Capela at Évora after Pedro do Porto) as music teacher. The music teacher was also Mestre de Capela of the University.  The Mannerist Period (2nd half 16th and 17th centuries) =Historical context= In the end of the 16th century, the circumstances lead to the disappearing of profane music in Portugal and a taking over by religious music. There are economical and political factors, like the troubles to keep the Portuguese conquests in Morocco and the competition led by Venetians and Turks (later by Dutch and English) to the spice trade, which leads to the closing of the Portuguese feitoria (which was a kind of \\"spice supermarket\\") in Antwerp. In cultural terms, the influence of the Counter-Reformation in Portugal is enormous: i) João III introduces the Inquisition in Portugal in 1536; his brother Henrique will be the first General Inquisitor; ii) the Jesuits come to Portugal in 1540 and soon start teaching in their own colleges in Coimbra and Lisbon. In 1555, they are in charge of the Arts College in Coimbra (the superior school in Portugal with most prestige), after the expulsion by the Inquisition of its most reputed teachers (like André de Gouveia); iii) the Portuguese church participated actively in the Council of Trent and, in 1564, Portugal becomes the only Catholic country where the council decisions (namely those concerning the musical practice in the church) are integrally published as laws. Duarte Lobo In this context, the profane music declined in the courts of João III and his grandson Sebastião I. In 1578, with the death of Sebastião I, Cardinal Henrique becomes king of Portugal. After his death in 1580, Portugal loses its independence, as the throne is inherited by Felipe II, king of Spain (1527–1598). With the disappearance of the court in Lisbon, the aristocracy retired to their homes in the countryside, and the profane music nearly vanishes. The development of the Portuguese music in the end of 16th is thus mainly in the sacred polyphony. =Climax of the Évora school= In 1575, Cardinal Henrique brought Manuel Mendes (?-1605), Mestre de Capela at Portalegre, to Évora, where he took the Mestre de Claustra position. Besides his qualities as a composer, Manuel Mendes is remarkable as a teacher. He formed the most part of the extremely competent professional musicians who would have the most reputed musical positions in Portugal in the next decades. Between his students at Évora, we have the most noted polyphonists of the next generation: Fr. Manuel Cardoso (1566–1650), Filipe de Magalhães ( – 1652) and Duarte Lobo (1564/69-1646) [6]. These continued the pedagogical action of their teacher, worthing him references as «mestre de toda boa musica deste reino» («teacher of every good music in this kingdom») and «el Mendes Sonoroso que de Musicos llena toda a Europa» («the sound Mendes who replenishes Europe with musicians»). =Other centres of musical activity in the 17th century= Santa Cruz at Coimbra The main composers in the 17th century are D. Pedro de Cristo, D. Pedro da Esperança and D. Gabriel de S. João. The manuscripts kept at the General Library of the University of Coimbra reveal innovative polyphonic practices, such as polychorality, accompanied monody and instrument obligato. The Royal Chapel In spite of the absence of the King, it remains an important centre, with Mestres de Capela such as Francisco Garro, Filipe de Magalhães and Marcos Soares Pereira. Chapel of the Dukes of Bragança at Vila Viçosa João Lourenço Rebelo, pictured by José de Avelar Rebelo, c. 1646. During the Spanish domination, the duke of Bragança retired to his palace in Vila Viçosa. The ducal chapel maintained a magnificent liturgy and, in 1609, Teodósio II founded the Santos Reis Magos College, working in a similar way to the Évora school. Roberto Tornar, mestre de Capela at Vila Viçosa, would become the musical instructor of the young Duke of Barcelos, D. João (later D. João IV, king of Portugal). This king, both before and after succeeding to the Portuguese throne, enlarged immensely the musical library of his father, transforming it in the biggest musical library of the time in Europe. Further, João IV was a composer and a theorist himself, as well as a devoted patron of João Lourenço Rebelo (1610–1661), whose works he would send for printing at Rome. Robelo, some of whose pieces have been issued on CD, composed in an innovative style, making use of opulent polychoral writing à la Giovanni Gabrieli and combining it with the more conservative idiom of Palestrina. =Instrumental music= It was in the domain of organ music, the organ being itself the liturgical instrument par excellence, that Portugal's composers of the 16th and 17th centuries achieved particularly high standards. Portuguese organs, as well as Spanish ones, usually had just one manual, without pedalboard. (Or, if a pedalboard was included, it was very basic, and it forbade any melodic complexity of the sort that German composers of organ music from the early 16th century, such as Arnolt Schlick, took for granted in their own pedal parts.) Nevertheless, the surviving music conceived for these organs does often show considerable contrapuntal ingenuity as far as the writing for keyboard is concerned. Several organ mechanisms were cultivated more in the Iberian peninsula than anywhere else. For example, these organs frequently incorporated a device known as meio-registo (\\"half-stop\\"), which, when activated, divided the keyboard into two distinct parts with sharp contrasts in timbre, giving the effect of two manuals instead of one. Another conspicuous feature in both Portugal and Spain was the horizontal placing (em chamada, the Portuguese called it) of particularly powerful, strident reed stops, very useful for imitating trumpet fanfares. In the 16th century António Carreira was the chief Portuguese organist-composer (his significance to Portugal resembles that of his slightly older contemporary Antonio de Cabezón to Spain). But Carreira's output was never published during his lifetime. The first printed volume of Portuguese instrumental music did not appear until 1620: Flores de Música para o instrumento de tecla e harpa (\\"Music flowers for the keyboard instrument and harp\\"), by Manuel Rodrigues Coelho, who died in around 1635. This contains only sacred compositions. Coelho worked as an organist in the cathedrals of Badajoz, Elvas and Lisbon. During the 17th century a notable school of organists developed in Braga. The main figures in this connection were Gaspar dos Reis, employed at Braga Cathedral; Pedro de Araújo; and a priest-composer, Diogo da Conceição. Two prominent genres of early Portuguese organ music were the Tento de Meio-Registo (Half-Stop Tento) and the Batalha (Battle). This last form goes back to one of the most famous pieces by Clément Janequin: La bataille de Marignan ou La Guerre, in which the characteristic sounds of a battle are imitated. The Iberian composers would often quote whole phrases from Janequin's original, adding to these phrases distinctive keyboard figuration. The Baroque period and the Italian influence =João V, the Magnificent= Domenico Scarlatti, in a 1738 portrait by Domingo Antonio Velasco Around the end of the 17th century, Portuguese composers gradually evolved towards the new musical language that would result in the modern tonalism. The government of João V (1706–50) marks a profound transition in the Portuguese society and culture. After the definitive peace with Spain, the monarch will try to modernize the Portuguese economy and to drive the country to a development scheme similar to the French Absolutism of Louis XIV. The main originality on D. João V's absolutism is that he managed, using his influence with the Pope, to face the huge political, economical and cultural power of the Church, by reorganizing it in order to strength its unity and discipline and then putting it under the royal authority. In a very clever process, João V got for his chapel the dignity of Patriarchal Basilica, by dividing the Lisbon archdioceses. The chaplain became a Cardinal. Then he got the reunification of the dioceses under the command of the royal chaplain. So, the Cardinal-Patriarch, Archbishop of Lisbon, was merely the chaplain of the King of Portugal... João V took a special care with the liturgy in his chapel, which he wanted as monumental as the Papal chapel in Rome. He got it repeating somehow the formula of Cardinal D. Afonso two hundred years before: contracting high-standard professional musicians and creating structures for the adequate formation of Portuguese musicians. As such, he contracted the brilliant Master of the Capella Giulia, in Rome, Domenico Scarlatti, as Mestre da Capela Real and music teacher of princess D. Maria Magdalena Bárbara and founded in 1713 a specialized school annex to the Patriarchal Basilica: the Patriarchal Seminary, which would become the major music school in Portugal and form generations of professional musicians of remarkable quality until the foundation of the National Conservatory in 1835. The most gifted students of the Patriarcal Seminary were sent to Rome at the King's expenses. Those were the cases, namely, of António Teixeira, João Rodrigues Esteves and Francisco António de Almeida, who were hence formed in the Roman ecclesiastic baroque school and had the chance of getting acquainted with the Roman operatic tradition. =Opera and its beginnings= The first performance of Il Don Chisciotte della Mancia, with music by Scarlatti took place in 1728 in the Ribeira Palace at Lisbon. This was the first operatic-style performance in Portugal and was followed by other opera buffa performances in the Royal Palace in the years to come. However, they had little impact in the music life, not only because the public had extremely limited access, but also because the King did not pay much attention to them. It was in the Trindade Theatre, in 1735, that the Alessandro Paghetti company had permission to perform the first opera seria for a wider (aristocratic) audience. The success was enormous and the company kept performing until 1742, now in the Rua dos Condes Theatre. At the same time, a set of performances in Portuguese by António José da Silva's (o Judeu) plays had begun (1733) in the Bairro Alto Theatre, with music by António Teixeira. The audience of these plays grew even wider. However, D. João V became ill in 1742, and the mysticism that surrounded him in his last years resulted in a prohibition against all theatrical performances until his death. =Instrumental music= Carlos Seixas Undoubtedly, the most important Portuguese keyboard composer of the time is José António Carlos Seixas (1704–1742). Son of Francisco Vaz, organist of the Coimbra Cathedral, Carlos Seixas goes, with only sixteen years of age, but already very famous, to Lisbon, where he is appointed as organist of the Patriarchal Cathedral. There, he would soon be appointed as Vice-Mestre de Capela (the Mestre de Capela was Scarlatti himself and Seixas was, at the time, the only Portuguese member of the Royal Chapel). Seixas has left us 105 two-part baroque Sonatas (or Tocatas) for keyboard. He also wrote religious and orchestral music. However, his most original contribution is a Concert for harpsichord and strings, one of the first examples of this form in Europe. =Opera and Sacred music under D. José I and D. Maria I= Depiction of the stage of the Ópera do Tejo on opening night, 31 March 1755. With D. José I (1714–1777), the operatic activity is taken again. The neapolitan David Perez (1711–1778), one of the most reputed Italian opera composers, is hired in 1752. The climax of Perez activity would be the inauguration of the monumental Ópera do Tejo, in March 1755, with the opera Alessandro nell'Indie. But the Lisbon earthquake of 1 November 1755 destroyed the new building, together with Lisbon downtown. The royal palace also disappeared, and with it the musical Library of D. João IV. After the earthquake, the public theatres like the Rua dos Condes Theatre and the Bairro Alto Theatre are rebuilt (but not the Ópera do Tejo). Already under D. Maria I, would be built the S. Carlos Theatre (now Teatro Nacional de S. Carlos), in Lisbon (1792) and the S. João Theatre in Oporto (1798). The neapolitan influence is enormous and, under D. José and D. Maria, the gifted music students of the Patriarchal are sent to Santo Onofre Conservatory in Naples. Afterwards, these students distinguished in the Neapolitan operatic style, as well as in the sacred music. Between these we have João de Sousa Carvalho (1745–1798), a Vila Viçosa school student and perhaps the most prominent composer of the 2nd half of the 18th century. Besides his operatic and sacred music production, he may also be considered the most remarkable keyboard composer of the time. Other relevant Portuguese composers of the time are Jerónimo Francisco de Lima, Luciano Xavier dos Santos, José Joaquim dos Santos, José dos Santos Maurício, António Leal Moreira and, particularly, Marcos Portugal, perhaps the Portuguese composer with the most international career ever. The 19th century Marcos Portugal, the most internationally acclaimed Portuguese composer. With the Napoleonic invasions, the Royal family goes to Brazil and the court establishes in the Rio de Janeiro. This presence would conduce to the independence of this colony (1822) and would be benefic as well to the development of Brazilian music (the first significative Brazilian composer is José Maurício Nunes Garcia, member of the royal chapel at the Rio de Janeiro). Meanwhile, the constitutional régime is proclaimed (1820) and King D. João VI (1767–1826) is forced to come back. The activity of the Royal Chamber Orchestra (founded by D. João V), which had been in the previous century one of the most important chamber orchestras in Europe, declines irreversibly. However, in the turn of the 19th century, generalizes the tradition of amateur academies performing the contemporary instrumental music. The generalization of public concerts is due to João Domingos Bomtempo (1775–1842), the most prominent musical figure of the first half of the 19th century. Bomtempo, son of an Italian musician of the court Orchestra, studied with the Patriarchal masters. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he was not interested in opera and, in 1801, instead of going to Italy, he travels to Paris, starting a virtuoso pianist career. He moves to London in 1810 and gets acquainted with the liberal circles. In 1822 he is back to Lisbon, and founds a Philharmonic Society to promote public concerts of the contemporary music. After the civil war between liberals and absolutists, Bomtempo becomes music teacher of Queen D. Maria II (1819–1853) and first Director of the National Conservatory, created in 1835 and which replaced the old Patriarchal Seminary, extinct by the liberal régime. As a composer, Bomtempo produced a vast amount of concerti, sonatas, variations and fantasias for the piano. His two known symphonies are the first to be produced by a Portuguese composer. The master piece of Bomtempo is his Requiem to the memory of Luís de Camões. The 20th century =The turn of the 20th century= Alfredo Keil, who composed patriotic march A Portuguesa, later used as the country's national anthem; and A Serrana, the first modern opera with a Portuguese libretto. Throughout the 19th century, there is a proliferation of concert societies. Bernardo Moreira de Sá (1853–1924), in Oporto, is the director, among others, of the Quartet Society and forms the Moreira de Sá Quartet, which will have an international career. He will have a decisive influence in the Formation of the Oporto Conservatory (1917). However, opera remained as the favourite activity of Portuguese composers, though the creative activity moved slowly towards the symphonic and chamber music fields. The two most significative lyric composers are Alfredo Keil (1850–1907) and Augusto Machado (1845–1924). José Vianna da Motta (1868–1948) and Luís de Freitas Branco (1890–1955) have a special place in the Portuguese musical life in the turn of the 20th century. Vianna da Motta Vianna da Motta went to Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin in 1882 at expenses of King Fernando II of Portugal. He also attended Liszt's classes at Weimar in 1885, as well as Hans von Bülow's. In Germany, he started a career as a concertist and exceptional interpret of Bach, Beethoven and Liszt. During the First World War, he taught at Geneva Conservatory. In 1917, he came back to Portugal, becoming director of the National Conservatory. As a composer, he is very close to the German Romanticism, and dedicates himself to the production of a national style, by including and recreating the national folklore. His most emblematic work is the A Major Symphony \\"À Pátria\\" (1895). Luís de Freitas Branco Luís de Freitas Branco (1890–1955) is usually appointed as the «introducer of modernism in Portugal», by his decisive role in the approximation of Portuguese music to the most innovative European aesthetics, namely the Schönberg atonalism and the French impressionism. Pupil of Augusto Machado and Tomás Borba, he studied with the Belgian organist and composer Désiré Pâque and, in 1910, went to Berlin to study with Humperdinck. There, he attended to a performance of Debussy's Pélleas et Mélisande, which was determinant in his aesthetic orientation. In his early work we count the symphonic poems \\"Váthek\\" and \\"Paraísos Artificiais\\" and several piano pieces. His prolific production includes five symphonies, a violin concert and enumerous vocal works. Other composers In the turn of the 20th century, other relevant composers are Francisco de Lacerda (1869–1934), Óscar da Silva (1870–1958), Luiz Costa (1879–1960) and António Fragoso (1897–1918). Lacerda was as well a famous director specialist in the French and Russian repertoire. He became assistant of Vincent d'Indy at the Schola Cantorum in Paris. His musical language is very close to that of Fauré and Debussy. The Estado Novo régime The military coup of 1926 installed in Portugal a dictatorship (self-called Estado Novo, \\"the new state\\") which would condition the Portuguese life for near half century. The concept of culture is substituted, in the mainstream of European fascisms, by the concept of propaganda. This propaganda had its maximum height at the Nationality Centenary in 1940; the S. Carlos Theatre was then reopened after a restoration with an opera by the regime semi-official composer Ruy Coelho. Curiously, the most important figure of Portuguese musical life in that period is a composer who openly contested the régime and its aesthetic orientations and who, consequently, was forced to do his entire activity outside the institutional circuits: Fernando Lopes Graça. Lopes Graça Fernando Lopes Graça (1906–1995) was student of Tomás Borba, Luiz de Freitas Branco and Vianna da Motta at the National Conservatory and finished the Superior Course on Composition in 1931. He tried to get a position at that institution, but was arrested by political reasons and the place was not conceded to him. He taught for some time in the Music Academy in Coimbra and, in 1937, went to Paris at his expenses, where he studied musicology. There he composed the first works of his musical maturity (2nd Piano Sonata, Quartet for Violin, Viola, Cello and Piano). After coming back to Portugal in 1939, Lopes Graça taught at the Academia de Amadores de Música at Lisbon. Of his production, it worth mentioning the numerous harmonizations or adaptations of popular Portuguese songs for choir or soloist, the songs for voice and piano over the poems of the most important Portuguese poets, the innumerous political songs, as well as the symphonic music, chamber music and piano music production. Lopes Graça undertook, with the Corsican ethnologist Michael Giacometti, a systematic study of Portuguese folk music, which he assimilated and used thoroughly in his musical speech. His view from the folklore is far from the regime bucolic or picturesque view, rather strengthening the hard dimensions of rural life. The contemporaries of Lopes Graça generally choose a more pacific conservative \\"neo-classic\\" style: these were the cases of Armando José Fernandes (1906–1983), Jorge Croner de Vasconcelos (1910–1974), Frederico de Freitas (1902–1980), Joly Braga Santos (1924–1988) and Cláudio Carneyro (1895–1963). Contemporary trends The coup of April, 25th of 1974 restored the democracy in Portugal. The country knew a great development since then, particularly after the adhesion to the European Economic Community (now European Union) in 1986. The intellectual and cultural life had particular improvements. Music has also benefited from the increasing number of Conservatories and specialized superior schools, in a freedom context, as well as from the generalization of music festivals. The role of Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian (founded in 1953) has been of outstanding importance in every aspect of the cultural life, particularly the musical one.

It is built along the Stuart Highway. It was the railhead on the North Australia Railway during World War II. Description Larrimah was established in March 1941 as a \\"village\\" during World War II. The 8th Australian Staging Camp, built by the Australian Army, was set up for troops making the journey by road from Adelaide before transferring onto rail at Larrimah siding for the rest of the journey to Darwin. No. 45 Australian Camp Hospital was also set up at Larrimah by the Australian Army. The town then served as a railhead until the line closed in 1976. The town's pub, the Pink Panther, was originally 9 km south in Birdum, but was moved when Larrimah became the end of the railway. It is the home of the Big Stubby, a large replica of a Darwin Stubby beer bottle. In 1998, it received a National Tidy Towns award. Larrimah's fuel station burnt down in October 2009 so no fuel is available there. The closest fuel available is 76 kilometres north at Mataranka, or 100 kilometres south at Daly Waters. There is a Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service unit stationed there to attend motor vehicle accidents and local bush and grass fires. On the north end of town is Fran's Devonshire Tea House. Fran's is the location of Larrimah's old police station. Along with much history visitors are served some good homemade tucker. Frans has been open for 47 years as the tea house ran but Fran her self. The shop is the trackers quarters and courthouse the building next door is the police station and along side the jail cells with has been rebuilt, but has used the original bars and windows of the jail cells.

Three days later, police searched his house, finding his car, quad-bike, keys, hat, glasses, wallet, and food in the microwave. There were no signs of violence or a struggle. Police then scoured the local area but called off their search on 23 December and are treating the case as a suspected homicide. As of February 2018, no reward has been offered in the case. An inquest was held in Katherine into his suspected death in June 2018. To aid the case, one year after the disappearance, police released photos of the inside of his home. The unique character of the case soon made it well-known internationally. In tracking next of kin, media learnt that Moriarty had immigrated to Australia aged 19 in the 1960s on Fairstar, and members of his extended family were traced to Abbeyfeale, in Limerick, Ireland, and others who had gone to the US. The Walkley Award winning Australian crime podcast Lost in Larrimah, released in April-May 2018, explored the mystery of Moriarty's disappearance, as well as the town's history in great depth, including the feuds within the small community. The disappearance was also the subject of a four part Radio National series by ABC News called A Dog Act: Homicide on the Highway, released in December 2018.

It forms yellow crystals in pure form; however, the color of impure forms may vary from dark yellow to green to dark brown.Robert Matyáš and Jiří Pachman, Primary Explosives (Berlin, Germany: Springer Verlag, 2013), Chapter 6: Diazodinitrophenol, pp. 157-166 ; see p. 159. It is soluble in acetic acid, acetone, concentrated hydrochloric acid, most non-polar solvents and is slightly soluble in water.Tadeusz Urbański with Marian Jurecki and Sylvia Laverton, trans., Chemistry and Technology of Explosives (Oxford, England: Permagon Press, 1967), vol. 3, pp. 201-204; see especially p. 202. A solution of cold sodium hydroxide may be used to destroy it.(Urbański, 1967), p. 202. DDNP may be desensitized by immersing it in water, as it does not react in water at normal temperature. It is less sensitive to impact but more powerful than mercury fulminate and almost as powerful as lead azide.(Urbański, 1967), p. 204. The sensitivity of DDNP to friction is much less than that of mercury fulminate and lead azide. DDNP is used with other materials to form priming mixtures, particularly where a high sensitivity to flame or heat is desired. DDNP is often used as an initiating explosive in propellant primer devices and is a substitute for lead styphnate in what are termed \\"green\\" or \\"non-toxic\\" (lead free) priming explosive compositions. Lead free primers have been judged as inadequate for service use in firearms due to weak and uneven initiation compared to lead based primers.

Nitromethane is a highly combustible substance that is generally only used in very specifically designed engines found in Top Fuel drag racing and miniature internal combustion engines in radio control, control line and free flight model aircraft. The term \\"nitro\\" has come into use in the last few decades to describe these engines and has its origins in marketing hype in the model car market. For the fifty or so years prior to this term since the engines were first developed, they were simply referred to as \\"glow engines\\", but the term \\"nitro\\" has more impact in ad copy. These engines are actually fueled by methanol, but the fuel is often doped with nitromethane as a performance additive. The ignition system consists of a glow plug - hence the older term \\"glow\\" engine - which has a coil of platinum-containing wire alloy, usually platinum-Iridium. The glow plug is heated with electric current for starting, after which power is disconnected and the combination of residual heat and catalytic action of the platinum alloy with methanol ignites the fuel mixture. Working cycle Nitro engines for models can turn in excess of 50,000 RPM. Typical operating rpm for sport model aircraft engines is 10,000-14,000 rpm. For radio control (RC) boats and ducted fan aircraft engines, 20,000-25,000 is the usual range, and for cars rpm in the range of 25,000-37,000 is common. With this much movement, a lot of frictional heat is generated and the fuel used for these engines usually contains between 12-20% oil content depending on the nitromethane and methanol percentage, the engine type and application. Most engines in RC cars today are 2 stroke engines, which means that it takes 2 strokes of the piston (one revolution) to complete the engine cycle. On the first stroke as the piston travels upward, a mixture of fuel and air is sucked into the crankcase, from the carburettor. When the piston travels downward the new fuel air mixture travels into the induction port and finally into the combustion chamber. As the piston travels upward the mixture is compressed which causes the fuel/air mixture to ignite, producing hot gas under pressure to force the piston down. As the piston travels downward the spent exhaust gases escape out of the combustion chamber through the exhaust port, and the cycle starts over by the fuel mixture being again pushed into the induction port. Ignition When starting, the glow plug is electrically preheated by electric current. The glow plug is not to be confused with a spark plug - there is no spark in the glow plug. Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel. Carburetor Nitro engines typically use a carburetor to mix the fuel and air together, although for some applications where throttling is not required they have a simple venturi with a spraybar and needle valve. The carburetor can either be sliding or rotary. On a rotary carburetor, the slide is opened as the arm is turned by the servo. On a slide carburetor the slide is opened by sliding the arm out by the servo. Both are held open slightly by an idle screw which allows the engine to receive a very small amount of fuel to keep the engine running when the vehicle is at a stop. The carburetors usually feature 2 needles used to tune the mixture. A high speed needle tunes how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at mid to high RPM, and a low speed needle determines how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at low to mid range RPM. Turning either needle in a clockwise motion will thin the fuel mixture. Lean describes the amount of fuel in the fuel / air mixture. To a point this will make the engine run faster with better performance, but once too lean the engine will overheat, and wear out prematurely due to not receiving enough lubrication. Turning either needle counterclockwise will enrich the fuel mixture (unless the low speed needle is an air bleed in which case the opposite is true). Rich is the opposite of lean, it means more oil (fuel mixture) is entering the engine. If the engine is too rich, it will run poorly, and fuel that has not yet been burnt may start to spit out of the exhaust. The engine will run very slowly and seem to have no power and possibly cut out from being flooded with fuel. Although, being too rich is better than being too lean, because being too rich just means the engine is getting too much oil which is perfectly fine, although performance may not be as good as if the engine were lean. An excessively lean mixture can damage an engine in a short time, as it will run above its design temperature. A properly tuned engine will last a long time with good performance throughout its life. Variations There are different types of R/C engines. There are on-road, off-road, aircraft, marine, and monster truck engines. =On-road and off-road= On-road engines are designed to come into their power band from mid to high RPM. These engines can be used in off-road vehicles but are normally used in on-road sedans where very high RPM and high speed is required. Off-road engines have a less abrupt power curve compared to on-road engines. Off-road engines have a power band that extends through most of the RPM range. Off-road engines do not rev as high as on-road engines, but they do have more torque that can easily propel the vehicle it is in to impressive speeds. Off-road engines are usually used in 1/8 scale buggies where high speeds and bad accelerations are less important. =Monster truck= Monster truck engines are generally very large compared to on-road and off-road engines. Where an off-road engine may be 0.21 cubic inch (ci) size, a monster truck engine may be as much as 0.46 ci. Monster truck engines generate much of their torque and horsepower at low to mid range RPM. They are usually used in large and heavy trucks where all that power is needed to get good performance out of the vehicle. =Aircraft= Aircraft engines are manufactured to be able to sustain high RPM. The biggest difference between all other nitro engines and aircraft engines is the ability to sustain RPM. Other nitro engines tend to break if run at full throttle for a full tank of fuel. =Marine= Marine engines are cooled with water rather than air like other nitro engines. Drag racing Members of the full scale drag racing industry use much higher concentrations of nitromethane: they are limited by the rules to 90% (at least in the NHRA, the main sanctioning body). Historically, racers used higher percentages which frequently caused massive explosions. Modern engines are estimated to generate around 8000 horsepower. The cars can accelerate from 0 to 100 mph in 0.8 seconds and 0 to 335 mph in 4.5 seconds.

(1996). \\"Giant ichthyosaurs of the Early Jurassic\\". Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 33(7): 1011-1021 Temnodontosaurus is known for its incredibly large eyes which, at approximately 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, are believed to be the largest of any known animal.Sander,P.M.(2000). \\"Ichthyosauria: their diversity, distribution, and phylogeny\\", Paläontologische Zeitschrift 74: 1–35 It possessed a tail bend which was characteristic of Jurassic ichthyosaurs McGowan, C. (1992). Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons. Harvard University Press and had many conical teeth filling its jaw that were set in a continuous groove. The number of valid Temnodontosaurus species has varied over the years. Christopher McGowan in 1992 believed there to be around thirteen species in the genus Temnodontosaurus. Michael Maisch in 2000 listed T. platyodon, T. trigonodon, T. acutirostris, T. nuertingensis and T. eurycephalus as the valid species of Temnodontosaurus. History of discovery The first ichthyosaur skull ever discovered was that of Temnodontosaurus platyodon. The specimen (BMNH 2149) was found in the Lias of Lyme Regis by Joseph Anning in 1811.Davis, Larry E. (2009). \\"Mary Anning of Lyme Regis: 19th Century Pioneer in British Palaeontology\\". Headwaters: The Faculty Journal of the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John’s University 26: 96-126 The rest of the skeleton was recovered in 1812 by his sister, Mary Anning, but has been lost since. The ichthyosaur was subsequently described by the anatomist Sir Everard Home, in what was the first scientific description of an ichthyosaur. T. platyodon is the type species of Temnodontosaurus and the most common species. The type skull is currently located at the Natural History Museum in London. The specimen was originally named Ichthyosaurus platyodon but then renamed Temnodontosaurus.Pierce, P. (2006). Jurassic Mary: Mary Anning and the Primeval Monsters. Sutton Publishing The genus Temnodontosaurus was named by Richard Lydekker in 1889. The species Temnodontosaurus platyodon was named by William Conybeare in 1822 from the specimen BMNH 2003 from the Lyme Regis. This specimen is located at the British Museum of Natural History. T. platyodon is from the Upper Hettangian-Lower Sinemurian. It is the type species for Temnodontosaurus. T. platyodon specimens have been found in England, Germany and Belgium. This includes the Lyme Regis in Dorset England, Herlikofen in Germany and Arlon in Belgium. Only one complete skeleton of T. platyodon is known of (BMNH 2003) and there is also a well preserved skull (BMNH R1158). Crystal Palace In 1995, Christopher McGowan explained that the previously named T. risor specimens are really juvenile versions of T. platyodon. The specimen he used to back up his argument was one collected by David Sole in 1987 from Black Ven (East of Lyme Regis). The previously known T. risor specimens (three skulls) were seen previously as different to the T. platyodon species because they had larger orbits, smaller maxillae and curved snouts. However, McGowan described them as juveniles because of the small size of the forefin relative to the skull. The T. risor skulls are thought to be juveniles because the skull is relatively long compared to the postcranial skeleton. The species T. acutirostris was initially named by Richard Owen in 1840. This holotype (BMNH 14553) was from the Alum Shale Formation of Lower Toarcian in Whitby, Yorkshire, England. Michael Maisch, in 2000, described it as belonging in the genus Temnodontosaurus. However, in 2010 Maisch published a paper stating that the specimen didn't belong in Temnodontosaurus, as he had thought previously, and should probably be assigned to Ichthyosaurus instead. T. trigonodon was named by von Theodori in 1843. The type specimen for T. trigonodon is an almost complete skeleton from the upper Liassic of Banz, Germany of the Lower Toarcian. The specimen is roughly 9.8 m long with a 1.8 m long skull. Other specimens have been found in Germany and also France from the Lower Toarcian of Saint Colombe, Yonne, France. A T. trigonodon specimen from the Upper Toarcian, Aalen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany is at The Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde, Stuttgart in Germany (15950). The species T. eurycephalus has only one specimen, a holotype. The specimen (R 1157) is a skull and was named in 1974 by McGowan. It is from the Lower Sinemurian, Bucklandi Zone and was found in Lyme Regis, Dorset, England in a limestone bed called Broad Ledge. The T. eurycephalus specimen (R 1157) is currently located at the Natural History Museum in London. T. burgundiae skulls The validity of the species T. burgundiae has been disputed. In 1995, McGowan proposed Leptopterygius burgundiae should be placed in Temnodontosaurus. The paleontologist Michael Maisch does not see T. burgundiae as belonging to Temnodontosaurus. In 1998, Maisch identified this name as a junior synonym of T. trigonodon. Other specialists recognize T. burgundiae as a species including Martin Sander who described in 2000 specimens from the Toarcian of the Holzmaden area of Germany and from France as being Temnodontosaurus burgundiae. The species T. azerguensis was described in 2012 by Jeremy Martin of the University of Bristol. The species was described from a holotype that is almost a complete skeleton from the Bifrons ammonite zone, Middle Toarcian. It was found by 1984 by M. Dejob and Ms. Laurent from the Lafarge Quarry in Belmont d’Azergues, Rhone, France. The specific name derives from the name of the river and valley near the Belmont quarry where it was found, ‘Azergues’. It is currently located at the Musee des Amis de la Mine in Saint-Pierre La Palud, Rhone department, France. The holotype of T. crassimanus is on display at the Yorkshire Museum, however it has remained largely understudied and the validity of the species has long been questioned. Swaby and Lomax (2020) highlighted several morphological features of the postcranial skeleton and determines that T. crassimanus is a valid species of the genus Temnodontosaurus and includes several distinct characters that can be used to distinguish it from T. trigonodon, to which it was once assigned. Swaby. E.J and Lomax. D.R. (2020). A revision of Temnodontosaurus crassimanus (Reptilia: Ichthyosauria) from the Lower Jurassic (Toarcian) of Whitby, Yorkshire, UK. Historical Biology, https://doi.org/10.1080/08912963.2020.1826469. T. azerguensis had a similar size and postcranial anatomy to other Temnodontosaurus species, however its cranial morphology differed. The rostrum was more elongate and thin and had a reduced quadrate. Since T. azerguensis either had very small teeth or no teeth at all, it has been proposed that it was probably not effective at eating hard shelled or bony prey, and instead had a diet of smaller and softer prey compared to the other Temnodontosaurus species. T. azerguensis is younger than other ichthyosaurs, originating from the bifrons ammiote zone of the middle Toarcian. Description Temnodontosaurus with a human for scale Temnodontosaurus had a thunniform, or \\"fish-shaped\\" body form. Its body was long, robust and slender. The tail was either as long as the body or longer. The vertebral count was roughly less than 90. The axis and atlas of the vertebrae were fused together, serving as stabilization during swimming.Emily A. Buchholtz (2000). Swimming styles in Jurassic Ichthyosaurs. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 21, 63-71 T. trigonodon possessed unicipital ribs near the sacral region while it had bicipital ribs more anteriorly. This helped to increase flexibility while swimming. Temnodontosaurus did not have gastralia. The forefins and hindfins of Temnodontosaurus were of roughly the same length and were rather narrow and elongate. This is unlike other post-Triassic ichthyosaurs such as the thunnosaurians, which had forefins at least twice the length of their hindfins. The pelvic girdle was also not reduced, unlike post-Triassic ichthyosaurs. Like other ichthyosaurs, the fins exhibited strong hyperphalangy.Temnodontosaurus only had 3 primary digits compared to Ichthyosaurus which had 6 to 7 digits. It also had one postaxial accessory digit. The proximal elements of the fin formed a mosaic pattern while the more distal elements were relatively round. There were two notches on the fin's anterior margin. The paired fins were used to steer and stabilize the animal while swimming instead of paddling or propulsion devices. The pelvic girdle was tripartite. It had a triangular shaped dorsal fin. Restoration of T. platyodon Like other ichthyosaurs, Temnodontosaurus likely had high visual capacity and used vision as its primary sense while hunting. Temnodontosaurus had the largest eyes of any ichthyosaur, and of any animal measured.Motani R.(2005). Evolution of fish-shaped reptiles (Reptilia : Ichthyopterygia) in their physical environments and constraints. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences. 33: 395-420 The largest eyes measured belonged to the species T. platyodon. Despite the enormous size of its eyes, Temnodontosaurus had blind spots directly above its head due to the angle at which its eyes were pointed. The eyes of Temnodontosaurus had sclerotic rings, hypothesized to have provided the eyes with rigidity. The sclerotic rings of T. platyodon were at least 25 cm in diameter. The head of Temnodontosaurus had a long robust snout with an antorbital constriction. It also had an elongated maxilla, a long cheek region and a long postorbital segment. The carotid foramen in the basisphenoid in the skull was paired and was separated by the parasphenoid. Also, the parasphenoid had a processus cultriformis. The skull of T. platyodon measured about 1 m to 1.5 m long. T. eurycephalus had a shorter rostrum and a deeper skull compared to other species, perhaps serving to help crush prey. T. platyodon had a very long snout which was slightly curved on its dorsal side. The snout of T. trigadon was also elongate but ventrally curved. The snout of T. acutirostris was slender with a more pointed tip. Temnodontosaurus had many pointed conical teeth that were set in a continuous grooves, rather than having individual sockets. This form of tooth implantation is known as aulacodonty. Its teeth typically had two or three carinae, however the species T. nuertingensis possessed none. The teeth of T. eurycephalus possessed bulbous roots. Temnodontosaurus had a weak tail bend at an angle of less than 35°. The caudal fin has variously been described as either lunate or semi-lunate. The caudal fin was made up of two lobes; the lower lobe was skeletally supported whereas the upper lobe was unsupported. The tail was used as the main propulsive force for movement; the fins were not involved with propulsion of the body. Palaeobiology =Feeding mechanisms and diet= T. burgundiae attacks Stenopterygius hauffianus, Lias of Germany Temnodontosaurus was an apex predator in the Early Jurassic seas. Its diet likely consisted mainly of vertebrates such as fish, plesiosaurs and other ichthyosaurs, and may also have preyed on cephalopods. It is the only Jurassic ichthyosaur genus for which a diet consisting mainly of vertebrates has been proposed. One T. trigonodon specimen (located at the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde in Stuttgart) shows remains of Stenopterygius, another ichthyosaur, in its abdominal cavity.Thies, D. & Hauff, R.B. (2013). A Speiballen from the Lower Jurassic Posidonia Shale of South Germany”. – N. Jb. Geol. Paläont. Abh., 267: 117–124; Stuttgart Due to its more robust teeth and deeper jaw, T. eurycephalus probably ate large prey such as other ichthyosaurs, while species such as T. platyodon with pointed but more modest sized teeth perhaps preferred soft-bodied prey and smaller vertebrates such as fish. Temnodontosaurus likely utilised ram feeding methods of predation.Scheyer, Torsten M. et al. (2014). Early Triassic Marine Biotic Recovery: The Predators’ Perspective. PLoS ONE 9.3 (2014): e88987 The movements of its jaw were likely rapid and so it probably used snapping rather than chewing mechanisms to eat its prey. =Swimming and movement style= Like other ichthyosaurs, Temnodontosaurus was a fast cruiser or swimmer. Jurassic ichthyosaurs such as Temnodontosaurus swam via the lateral oscillation of their caudal fluke on a flexible tail stock. T. trigonodon had a highly flexible, long, thin body with a high vertebral count and modest regional differentiation. It used its large limbs as rudders. The style of swimming was thunniform, unlike more basal ichthyosaurs whose swimming was anguilliform. This trait can be inferred in Temnodontosaurus and other Jurassic and post- Jurassic ichthyosaurs due to their semi-lunate tail fins and shortened bodies relative to the tail. Classification Temnodontosaurus is the only genus in the family Temnodontosauridae.HIERARCHICAL TAXONOMY OF THE CLASS EODIAPSIDA. Retrieved January 16, 2009.McGowan, C.

Life Sciences Contributions, Royal Ontario Museum 97: 1–37 The family Temnodontosauridae was described by C. McGowan and is from the Lower Liassic. Temnodontosauridae is part of the monophyletic group Neoichthyosauria, a clade named by Martin Sander in 2000 that includes the families Temnodontosauridae, Leptonectidae and Suevoleviathanidae. Temnodontosaurus is one of the most basal post-Triassic ichthyosaurs. T. platyodon skeletons in London Cladogram below based on Maisch and Matzke (2000) and Maisch and Matzke (2003) with clade names following Maisch (2010): Palaeoecology The habitat of Temnodontosaurus was in the open ocean, away from the shore line. It lived in the pelagic zone of the water column and didn't associate with the sea floor. Fossils of Temnodontosaurus have been found in England, Germany and France from rocks associated with marine environments. Specimens have been found especially in the Lias of the Lyme Regis in Dorset, England. The Lias is made up of alternating units of limestone and mudstone and contains many ammonites.“The lithostratigraphy of the Blue Lias Formation (Late Rhaetian–Early Sinemurian) in the southern part of the English Midlands”. Proceedings of the Geologists' Association. 112(2): 97-110 The newly described species T. azerguensis was found in a belemite rich marlstone bed in the Bifrons ammonites zone, Middle Toarcian, in Belmont d’Azergues, Rhone, France. Temnodontosaurus fossils have been found in the Posidonia Shale near Holzmaden, Germany. The Posidonia Shale is composed of black bituminous shales with intercalated bituminous limestone. The environment is known to have been marine because fossils of marine animals such as plesiosaurs, crocodylians and especially ammonites have been found there in abundance.Bottjer, Etter, Hagadorn, Tang, editors (2001). “Exceptional Fossil Preservation”.

The village is split into four parts: St Ive Church End, St Ive Cross, St Ive Keason and St Ive Parkfield. In addition to the Parish an electoral ward exists stretching north of St Ive. The population at the 2011 census was 4,246. History and geography The parish used to be a large rural area of rolling landscape with wooded valleys and the population was sparse with the largest village being St Ive itself, sited on the A390. The hamlet of Woolston lies to the northwest of St Ive. The demography of the parish was radically altered with the mid-Victorian mining boom centred on Caradon Hill. South Caradon Mine situated just over the parish border was at one time the largest and most prosperous copper mine in the world. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse, politician and sociologist, and his sister Emily Hobhouse, the social activist, were both born in St Ive. Parish church The old vicarage, St Ive The parish church is probably dedicated to Saint Ive. However it is not certain whether he was a supposedly Persian bishop whose body was found in 1001 at St Ives in Cambridgeshire. The building is mainly 14th century and similar to the church of South Hill, though more elaborate in detail. The consecration of the church in 1338 is recorded in the diocesan register. The south aisle, south porch and the top of the tower were added either in the 15th or early 16th century: (the tower has 12 pinnacles). The pulpit is dated 1700 but is in the Jacobean style. A monument to J. Lyne, d. 1791, is by Robert Isbell; another monument to a member of the Wrey family, formerly of Trebeigh Manor within the parish, was moved to their principal seat of Tawstock, Devon, in 1924.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Penguin Books; p. 179 There are two stone crosses in the churchyard. One is a Latin wayside cross which was found in use as a gatepost in one of the glebe fields near the churchyard in 1932. A month later it was erected in its present position. The other is an incomplete cross which was found in the vicarage garden in 1965. In 1982 it was erected in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 39-40 Trebeigh Manor Trebeigh, St Ive, in Cornwall was a manor listed in Domesday Book as held by the Earl of Mortain, the largest landholder in that county. He is said to have taken it away wrongfully from the church. Contrary to popular belief, it was never owned by the Knights Templar.Trebeigh and St Ive are not mentioned in the Templars' Inquest of 1185 (published by Beatrice A. Lees, ed., Records of the Templars in England in the Twelfth Century: The Inquest of 1185 with Illustrative Charters and Documents (London: Oxford University Press, 1935): the Cornish properties are on p. 60); nor are they mentioned in the accounts produced by King Edward II's officials for the Templars' properties in Cornwall after the Templars' arrest in 1308 (Kew, The National Archives of the UK: E 358/20 rot. 11). In 1338 Trebeigh belonged to the Hospital of St John or Knights Hospitaller, later the Knights of Malta, and formed the Preceptory of Trebeigh.A document of 1338 in the National Library of Malta (Archives of Malta, AOM 2191) lists the preceptory among the Hospitallers' own estates and states that two Hospitallers were living there.

Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the manor of Trebeigh was granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1573 to Henry Wilbye and George Blyke, from whom it was acquired by John Wrey, who made it his family's chief seat until his descendants inherited Tawstock in Devon from the Bourchiers in 1654.Vivian, (ed.), Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, p. 107 The family owned the Wheal Wrey mine in the parish.

He is best known for his work on the segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Early life and education Nasmyth was born in London in 1952 of James Ashley (Jan) Nasmyth and Jenny Hughes. His father Jan was doubly descended from King Charles II and founder of the billion dollar publishing company Argus Media. He attended Eton College, Berkshire, then the University of York, where he studied Biology. Nasmyth went on to complete his graduate studies in the group of Murdoch Mitchison at the University of Edinburgh. Here he worked on the cell cycle alongside Paul Nurse and his PhD thesis focused on the control of DNA replication in fission yeast. In Mitchison's lab he made substantial contributions to the study of the cell cycle in fission yeast isolating and characterising cell cycle mutants and the first identification of a gene product (DNA ligase) in these mutants. Career and research Kim Nasmyth explaining loop extrusion with a climbing rope thumb The cohesin complex entrapping sister DNAs Nasmyth joined Ben Hall's lab in Seattle as a postdoctoral researcher where he developed ways of cloning genes by complementation in yeast and, in collaboration with Steve Reed, cloned the CDC28 gene from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a group leader in Cambridge Nasmyth became interested in the phenomenon of mating-type switching in yeast. Together with Kelly Tatchell he cloned the S. cerevisiae mating-type locus and found, surprisingly, that 'silent' copies of the mating- type genes including their promoters are maintained in the yeast chromosome. This represented the first case where the position of a gene in the chromosome had demonstrable biological significance, and prompted Nasmyth to abandon work on the cell cycle for a time and concentrate instead on studying gene silencing. He was one of the first to demonstrate that gene expression can be regulated through specific control elements which are distant from the start of transcription. Max Birnstiel invited Nasmyth to join him at the then newly founded Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, Austria, where he was director. Nasmyth became one of the first three senior group leaders that Birnstiel recruited in 1986. At the IMP, Nasmyth changed his focus from gene silencing back to cell cycle control. In the mid-1990s Nasmyth co-discovered the APC/C and showed that its activity induces chromosome segregation. Using temperature-sensitive mutants of the APC/C he found several genes which are required for sister chromatid cohesion which we now know encode subunits of the cohesin complex. Nasmyth has since shown that cohesin forms a ring, that sister chromatids are held together within this ring and that they are released by cleavage of cohesin by separase. Following Max Birnstiel's retirement, Nasmyth became scientific director of the IMP in 1997. In 2006, Nasmyth left the IMP to become head of the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Oxford, a post he held until 2011. Nasmyth continues to head a research group at this department. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. His research has been funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Wellcome Trust, and Cancer Research UK. He plans to retire from research in 2022. =Awards and honours= Nasmyth has also been awarded the following: * 1985 Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization * 1989 Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society * 1995 FEBS Silver Medal * 1996 Unilever Science prize * 1997 Louis- Jeantet Prize for Medicinede médecine 1997 and Travaux de recherche * 1999 Wittgenstein-PreisWittgensteinpreis-Träger 1999 Univ.

At the time of the assassination of president Habyarimana of Rwanda, Bizimana held a non permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. He knew many of the leaders of the Hutu Power movement, and has therefore been wrongly accused by some, such as General Roméo Dallaire, of aiding the Rwandan genocide by publicizing Hutu Power propaganda to the West, and passing confidential Security Council intelligence to his government. Bizimana has accused Dallaire of partiality for siding with RPF and incompetency as corroborated by Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in his book \\"Le Patron de Dallaire Parle\\". In that context, Bizimana had asked the UN Secretary General to end Dallaire assignment before the genocide and subsequently, Dallaire would use any forum to make unsubstantiated claim against Bizimana. During the Rwandan genocide, Bizimana had also charged that the United States didn't accede to his request to intervene and stop the genocide while the Clinton Administration had the information but opted for inaction as long as it was helping its ally, the RPF, to take power no matter the subsequent collateral human tragedy that cost lives to many thousands of innocent people. In an interview several years later, Michael Barnett, a diplomat with the United States mission spoke of the level of frustration at Bizimana's statements by those who were aware of what was happening in Rwanda but like the United States, didn't want to assist and stop the genocide.\\"Nobody said, 'Why don't you get out of the room?'

It was directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, with music direction by Scott Bradley The cartoon was animated by Ray Patterson, Irven Spence, Ken Muse and Pete Burness. Mouse Trouble won the 1944 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, the second consecutive award bestowed upon the series. It was released in theatres on November 23, 1944 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer and reissued on December 12, 1951. Plot After the postman puts a gift into Tom's mailbox, Tom opens the box and finds a book on how to catch mice and for the rest of the cartoon, he takes its advice to attempt to catch Jerry. The first thing the book suggests is to locate the mouse. Tom finds Jerry reading the book with him, but when he tries to grab Jerry, the mouse steps off the book and slams Tom's nose in it. Tom sets out a simple mouse trap. Jerry succeeds in freeing the cheese without setting the trap off. Shocked at the trap's failure, Tom tests it, and the trap snaps Tom's finger, which causes the cat to yell in pain as soon as he touches it. Tom then sets a snare trap around a piece of cheese and gets ready to pull the string but is distracted by a bowl of cream substituted for the cheese by Jerry, who activates the trap, sending the cat out to the tree himself. Practicing the \\"A Curious Mouse is Easy to Catch\\" chapter, Tom sits outside Jerry's mousehole reading the book and loudly laughs at it but denies Jerry any chance to see it. When Jerry climbs onto the book to see it, Tom slams it shut on him. However, when Tom grabs him, Jerry pretends to look inside his fists to show Tom that he has something in and when Tom looks into his fists, Jerry punches him in the eye. Tom corners Jerry and, after reading the passage in the book \\"A cornered mouse never fights\\", pounces on him and the two engage in a violent brawl. Tom sticks his head around the corner, bruised and battered, and eerily says: \\"Don't you believe it!\\" At this point, Tom stops reading from chapter-to-chapter and tries suggestions he thinks will work. Upon reading Chapter VII: \\"Be scientific in your approach\\", Tom uses a stethoscope to listen for Jerry within the walls of the house. This backfires when Jerry screams into the stethoscope, almost deafening Tom. Tom then forces a double-barreled shotgun into Jerry's mousehole. However, the barrels protrude out of the wall and point straight at Tom's head as the cat fires and he ends up shooting himself in the head, rendering himself bald. In the next scene, Tom (now wearing a dodgy orange toupee for the rest of the cartoon) sets a bear trap and slides it into the mousehole. Jerry walks outside from another hole behind Tom and puts the trap behind him, which triggers as Tom sits down and sends him flying into the ceiling in pain. Tom then tries to use a mallet to flatten Jerry, but Jerry pops out of a hole behind a picture right above Tom, grabs the mallet, and hits him. After reading the chapter 'Slip him a surprise package', Tom attempts to disguise himself in a gift box. Jerry, seeing the box, knocks on it, hearing no response. Inexplicably, Jerry proceeds to impale the box with pins while Tom whimpers and groans in pain before sawing the box in half. Still hearing nothing, Jerry eagerly looks inside the box but just as quickly pulls his head out. Horror-stricken, he gulps and displays a sign reading \\"IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?\\". Now covered in bandages, Tom winds up a female toy mouse which repeatedly says \\"come up and see me some time\\". Jerry, noticing the toy, walks with it. Tom attempts to lure Jerry into a mouse-sized pretend hotel which is named \\"cozy arms\\", the door of which leads into Tom's open mouth. Jerry ushers the toy mouse into the hotel first, which causes Tom to eat it shattering his teeth in the process. After inspecting his ruined teeth in a mirror, Tom smashes it in rage and brutally tears the book to shreds, all the while hiccupping \\"come up and see me some time\\" since the toy's voice box is stuck in his throat. Having gone mad with revenge, Tom attempts to blow away Jerry with dozens of explosives (TNT, gunpowder, dynamite and a massive block buster). When Tom ignites a piece of dynamite, it does not start the fuse enough, so he blows the fuse too hard. This causes the fuse to be fired immediately and the explosives erupt, killing Tom. Nothing but Jerry (who survived the explosion) and his mousehole remains of the house while a fed-up Tom (who was seen by Jerry), now in spirit form, is seen on a cloud floating to heaven, repeatedly hiccuping \\"come up and see me some time\\".

Stephen Hannock (born March 31, 1951) is an American painter known for his atmospheric landscapes––compositions of flooded rivers, nocturnes and large vistas––which often incorporate text inscriptions that relate to family, friends or events of daily life. The artist is known for creating a unique luminosityhttp://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11∫_new=55042#.UXMhc4LbZG4 using a signature technique that involves building up layers of paint on the canvas, sandpaper-polishing it, applying new layers of paint and polishing again. Some of his work is thought to be inspired by the Hudson River School. Early life and education It was 3 years at the Trinity Pawling School and a final year at Deerfield Academy (where he spent a post-graduate high school year), that Hannock took his first art class since grade school. He later attended Bowdoin College for two years before taking classes at Smith College. In 1976, Hannock earned a degree from Hampshire College based on work done at both Bowdoin and Smith. While at Smith College, Hannock caught the eye of sculptor and printmaker Leonard Baskin with whom he apprenticed for several years creating anatomical drawings, woodcuts, sculptures and paintings. In an interview, Hannock described his apprenticeship with Baskin: :“I got permission to take a season back from hockey to work privately for Baskin, but I never went back,” Hannock said. “Art just took off and required all my focus. Working with Baskin was the best art school you can imagine, going one on one with a guy who was arguably one of the half dozen great artists of the time.\\" Taking classes at Smith also put Hannock within the sphere of Elizabeth Mongan, who taught art history at Smith College, and her sister, Agnes Mongan, who was Director at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University. Hannock worked with this pair for 25 years; he dedicated his painting The Oxbow of 2000, now at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, to the sisters. When he left his apprenticeship with Baskin, Hannock found an abandoned factory in Northampton, Massachusetts, to begin a career as an artist. Early career (1974-1984) While studying with Leonard Baskin, Hannock began experimenting with phosphorescent paints, creating large scale, imaginary landscapes that glow when placed under black lights. These luminous canvases were an attempt to simulate glowing movie screens and became the basis for the artist's first museum shows at the Smith College Museum of Art (where he was the youngest artist ever to be given a one-man show) and the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts.Luminosity: The Paintings of Stephen Hannock, preface by S. Lane Faison, Jr., introduction by Duncan Christy. Published in 2000 by Chronicle Books. 1984-2000 In 1984, Hannock moved from Northampton, Massachusetts to New York City where Neo-Expressionism was in full swing and conceptual works which, at first glance, seemed a world apart from the landscapes Hannock was creating. Hannock relied on grants from patron Irene Mennen Hunter––along with odd jobs and occasional work as a fashion model––to pay for studio space and groceries. As Hannock says, \\"It took me two years before anyone would even look at my slides.\\" In December, 1988, Newsweek featured an article by writer Cathleen McGuigan entitled, \\"Transforming the Landscape\\" in which––along with artists such as April Gornik and Mark Innerst––Hannock was spotlighted as one of the \\"maverick\\" landscape painters whose seductive works map \\"a place that feels at once familiar and strange.\\" In 1991, restaurant owner Danny Meyer and his partner/chef Tom Colicchio approached Hannock with the idea that he work with architect Peter Bentel on the interior of their New York City project, Gramercy Tavern, which opened in 1994. Their novel idea was that, rather than an afterthought, art could be a fundamental part of the restaurant's design. To date, Hannock has created over a dozen paintings for the team's restaurants, including a huge canvas of the Chelsea Highline at Colicchio and Sons on the Hudson River in New York City. In 1999 Hannock, along with the rest of the film's technical crew, won an Academy Award for \\"Special Visual Effects\\" for the film, What Dreams May Come. Dozens of paintings Hannock began in 1996 were the foundation for the film's \\"Painted World\\" scenes. In 2000, an exhibition of paintings inspired by views of the Oxbow in the Connecticut River, subject of Thomas Cole's The Oxbow (1836), included Hannock's The Oxbow: After Church, After Cole, Flooded, (Flooded River for the Matriarchs, E. & A. Mongan), Green Light (2000) It is held in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Also part of the permanent collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is the artist's painting Kaaterskill Falls for Frank Moore and Dan Hodermarsky, acquired in 2007. The painting includes collage elements and written words. In addition, Hannock's work is in such collections as the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; The Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, N.Y.; the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA.

Northern City Renaissance, Newcastle, England, (2008) was completed and unveiled in the Fall of 2009 at the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne. Newcastle, a former coal and shipbuilding capital that fell into harsh economic times by the 20th century has recently been enjoying a cultural regeneration.http://www.bugbog.com/gallery/england_pictures/newcastle- england.html In its description of the 8 by 12 feet painting, the Laing describes how Hannock captures both past and present in his multi-layered work: > Hannock depicts a view of the River Tyne as it is today, with The Sage > Gateshead, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art and the Millennium Bridge. > Partially hidden from sight under the layers or paint are images and text > relating to the city's mining heritage. Speaking to Barbara Hodgson of The Journal Hannock shares his belief and hope that his painting tells the story of many cities: “'industrial cities coming back on the wings of culture'” – a comfort, he feels, in view of the current economic climate.\\"http://www.journallive.co.uk/culture- newcastle/2008/10/30/sting-to-unveil-piece-at-laing-art- gallery-61634-22151570/ By October 17, 2005, Hannock was the subject of a Fortune magazine article entitled, Portrait of an A-List Artist by Andy Serwer. That article includes quotes from a museum director, a curator, and a critic––each with his own view of the artist: > \\"Because his works are so arresting and immediately accessible, much of the > contemporary art world is deeply suspicious of him,\\" says Hugh Davies, > director of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. \\"They think it's too > pretty to be profound. It takes time to realize that there is real > profundity and depth to his work.\\" > \\"What is interesting is that Hannock has defied modernism,\\" says Gary > Tinterow, Engelhard curator in charge of 19th-century, modern, and > contemporary art at the Metropolitan Museum. \\"He isn't doing abstract > painting, or painting according to critical demand. He painted what he > wanted to make. The key to Hannock's work is that it is beautiful. Since the > fall of modernism as an exclusive ideology, anything goes.\\" > \\"Are Hannock's paintings too derivative? Too accessible? Certainly a devotee > of the avant-garde would say so. And it's true that neither the Museum of > Modern Art nor the Whitney, the two pantheons of contemporary art, have > Hannock's paintings in their collections. Several prominent art critics > contacted by FORTUNE either didn't want to talk about Hannock or hadn't > heard of him. When I explained to the critic Robert Hughes that many wealthy > collectors own Hannock's work, he responded, \\"The taste of the American rich > is shit.\\"\\" > Note: In 2007, the Whitney Museum of American Art acquired one of Hannock's > works––Maternal Nocturne: Clearing Storm (Mass MoCA #66-C); polished mixed > media on envelope over Chuck Close daguerreotype; 2007. In June, 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degree from Bowdoin College. In autumn, 2013, Stephen Hannock became the first American artist to be signed by Marlborough Fine Art, London, since Richard Diebenkorn 40 years before. The painter was featured in a solo exhibition there––Stephen Hannock: Moving Water, Fleeting Light––which opened on February 4, 2014 and ran through March 1. Jason Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Distinguished Chair and Professor of Art History at Marymount Manhattan College, New York, curated the show of thirteen paintings and wrote in the accompanying catalogue: > “Hannock’s approach involves an intricate layering of glazes of subtly > modulated acrylic or oil across the prepared surfaces, repeatedly honing > down the paint using power sanders, veneering the final sanded pigment layer > with sheets of reflective resin, and then polishing that down to a matte > sheen. This allows light to penetrate deeply into the strata of the picture > plane and reemerge with an exceptional > radiance.\\"https://issuu.com/marlboroughfineart/docs/1540_mfa_stephen_hannock_catalogue_?e=10236032/6434752 In 2013, Hannock received the Olana Partnership Frederic E. Church Award along with co-honoree Elizabeth Broun, the Margaret and Terry Stent Director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The awards ceremony was held at the New York Public Library on May 23, 2013 with the theme “The Extraordinary American Landscape.\\" The painter’s friend, the musician and art collector Sting presented Hannock’s award to him and a video tribute, featuring comments from Hannock collectors, was also shown. A painting by the artist, Niagara Falls, was among the featured items offered at the Benefit Auction. Stephen Hannock: Olana Tribute Video Northern City Renaissance (Mass MoCA #53) 8 x 12 feet, (96 x 144 in.), polished mixed media on canvas, 2008 Hannock’s 8 x 12 foot painting, Northern City Renaissance, Mauve Dawn (Mass MoCA #161), was included in the May 17–September 21, 2014 exhibition Shafts of Light: Mining Art in the Great Northern Coalfield at the Bowes Museum in County Durham in northern England. The painting is the same in size and theme his earlier work, Northern City Renaissance: Newcastle, England (Mass MoCA #79-E), which was commissioned by the musical artist, Sting for the November 2008, opening of the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle, England. In 2014, the Yale University Art Gallery acquired Hannock’s 2013 painting The Oxbow for Frank Moore and Dan Hodermarsky (Mass MoCA #196). The polished mixed media on canvas over panel work measures 48 x 72 inches. Also in 2014, Hannock was invited to curate an exhibition of contemporary art to be held at The Thomas Cole House––home and studio of 19th century American artist Thomas Cole––and Olana, the home of Cole's student, Frederic Edwin Church. The exhibition of 28 artists, open May 3 through November 1, 2015 and entitled Rivercrossingsis the first-ever collaboration between these two historic sites of American art. A New York Times review of the show, stated: > “Rivercrossings is the project of the luminist painter Stephen Hannock, > whose contemporary style owes much to the Hudson River School’s monumental > studio work. Curators often talk about pieces in exhibitions creating 'a > visual dialogue' with one another. But this show goes beyond polite > discourse.

The book is a compendium of woodcuts by Hannock inspired by the music and lyrics for The Last Ship, the musical by the same name. Both book and musical center on the dying shipbuilding industry in Sting's hometown, Newcastle, a theme that has informed the work of Hannock and Sting for the last several years. Hannock is among the handful of living artists to be included in The Metropolitan Museum of Art: Masterpiece Paintings, published in 2016. The book provides illustrations and details of 500 art works from the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum—works created over the course of 5,000 years in cultures across the globe.https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-big- beautiful-book-and-a-new-old-way-to-read-it-1483110206 Personal life Hannock married Bridget Watkins, then PR director and assistant to restaurateur Danny Meyer, in 2000. The couple's daughter, Georgia, was born in June of that same year. Just four years later, in October, 2004, Hannock was widowed when his wife died due to complications stemming from a brain tumor diagnosed while she was pregnant.

She was introduced in the 2005 arcade game Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection (an upgrade of Tekken 5) as an affluent teenager whose role in the series involves clashing with her businessman father over her participation in the series' King of Iron Fist fighting tournaments, and her later dealings with Jin Kazama's devious Mishima Zaibatsu corporation. Lili has been used to promote the Tekken games, is featured on official series merchandise, and has made crossover game appearances outside of the Tekken franchise. She has received mostly positive critical reception for her gameplay and character design. Appearances =Tekken series= Lili is a Monégasque teenager who is the only child of a pacifistic oil tycoon. At the age of twelve, she had been held for ransom by a group of thugs, but unwittingly took out one of her captors in her attempt to break free. Lili consequently took pleasure in the thrill of defeating her opponents, but her father wants her to grow into a prim and proper lady and not a fighter. She nonetheless steals his private jet to travel abroad and compete in street fighting competitions. This gains the attention of an unknown individual who invites her to compete in the King of Iron Fist tournament, but Lili notices that the tournament organizer, the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation, had caused her father problems in the past. This makes her determined to emerge victorious and put an end to this situation, but she is thwarted by her rival Asuka Kazama, a relative of Mishima Zaibatsu CEO Jin Kazama. Before Lili can attempt to seek revenge, her father learns of her participation and confines her to the family home as punishment. However, the Zaibatsu later annexes her father's oil fields, negatively impacting the business and causing him to suffer anxiety attacks. Lili therefore again defies her father's policy of nonviolence and enters the sixth tournament to take back his property. In Tekken 6's \\"Scenario Campaign\\" story mode, Lili attempts to infiltrate the Mishima Zaibatsu and hunt down Jin, but she first has to go through Lars Alexandersson and Alisa Bosconovitch in combat, which she fails. Gracious in defeat, she provides the duo with a new sport utility vehicle that she had previously received as a birthday gift, and makes them guarantee in turn that they will defeat Jin. In Tekken 7, Lili enters the seventh tournament without telling her father for the second time to fight Asuka once again. Lili appears in the noncanonical games Tekken Tag Tournament 2; the crossover title Street Fighter X Tekken with Asuka as her official tag partner; and the 2013 free-to-play game Tekken Revolution exclusive to the PlayStation 3. Design and gameplay GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz described Lili as a \\"baby-faced girl who dresses like a pop star.\\" Her primary outfit is a frilly white dress with long sleeves and a red cravat, worn over a short skirt and high-heeled white boots. Her third costume for Tekken 6, a lingerie-themed wedding dress with a length of chain dangling from her left wrist, was designed by manga artist Ito Ōgure. Two additional costumes—a bikini and a fluffy skirt—were available as downloadable pre-order bonuses for Tekken Tag Tournament 2. The skirt was created as an experiment in cloth physics using Havok software. For Tekken 7, Lili was given a commemorative outfit modeled after character Miki Hoshii from fellow Bandai Namco franchise The Idolmaster. Lili's official style is street fighting, combined with gymnastic maneuvers such as flips, cartwheels and handstands. Mike Reilly of Game Revolution said in his 2006 review of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection that Lili \\"takes a good deal more practice to master\\", an issue he opined was offset by the presence of an in-game training mode. Brett Elston of GamesRadar commented on Lili's fighting style in the game: \\"She doesn't really have a definable combat style, so it's mostly all flash and sexy high kicks ... [but] her quick movements and wide-reaching legs make her ideal for first- timers—those same dance-like attacks also make it hard to get a bead on her next move\\". According to IGN, Lili's counterattacks, juggles and wall fighting in Tekken 6 are known to cause a lot of damage, but she was \\"lacking in the low attack department and many of her crush attacks will leave her vulnerable.\\" Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote in 2012 that Lili's \\"quirky yet ultimately unique style provides ample opportunity for juggles and she can mix it up with the best of them thanks to an arrange of low-mid attacks.\\" Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said of the character in Tekken Tag Tournament 2: \\"Lili is one of the series' less fleet-footed characters, with a gymnastic-influenced style that favors precision over quickness.\\" =Other video games and media= Outside of the Tekken series, Lili is selectable in the roleplaying games Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos and Digimon World Re:Digitize, the latter as a guest character who uses her trained Numemon, Monzaemon and Lillithmon to fight other players. She is additionally the central character of Queen's Gate Lili, part of the Japan-exclusive Queen's Gate gamebook series. =Promotion and merchandise= Nina and Lili at E3 2012 Lili was among many Tekken female characters portrayed by models for a 2006 Maxim photoshoot. A live-action trailer from the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards that promoted the console versions of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 showed Lili, Asuka Kazama, Kazuya Mishima and Bryan Fury in a four-way battle, though their faces were silhouetted. Model-actress Corissa Furr played Lili in a Tekken Tag Tournament 2 \\"Girl Power\\" trailer that was shown at Comic-Con in 2012, and appeared at the event dressed as the character. A render of Lili in a bikini was featured on the cover of Play magazine's 2009 Girls of Gaming Vol. 7 issue. A wall poster was released to promote her Street Fighter X Tekken appearance. In 2009, two Lili action figures were manufactured by Super Modelling Soul and released by Bandai as part of their Tekken 6 toyline. In 2011, Hobby Japan released a Lili figure based on her Queen's Gate appearances. As part of the Tekken Tag Tournament 2 line, Kotobukiya released a Lili bishōjo figurine in February 2013 that was based on an illustration by former Square Enix character designer Shunya Yamashita. Reception The character has received mostly positive critical reception. IGN's Andrew Alfonso described Lili as a \\"deadly Lolita-looking warrior\\". Luke van Leuveren of PALGN opined that Lili and the other new characters who debuted in Dark Resurrection \\"fit well into the game and don’t feel tacked on.\\" James Mielke of 1UP.com, in 2007, deemed Lili \\"the most substantial new character the series has seen in years\\". NowGamer described Lili as \\"an instant hit\\" for her \\"flowery girly-girl appearance\\" and \\"light-footed fighting style\\", because, the site wrote, \\"she’s a girl and girls love that kind of stuff.\\" Brian Soboleski of TeamXbox included Lili among the site's eleven \\"hotties in the Xbox universe\\" for \\"her role of a childish, yet seductive, fighter whose self confidence made her even more appealing.\\" She was listed as the ninth-\\"sexiest female video game character of all time\\" by Albert Costill of AMOG in 2013: \\"She’s a cute, blonde bombshell that blends street fighting with gymnastics. It doesn’t get any better than that.\\" Kevin Wong of Complex listed her as the fifteenth-best Tekken character in 2013: \\"If a player wants to kick ass and look impeccable doing it, Lili is the girl for the job.\\" Jayson Dubin of GameZone criticized Lili's \\"faux originality\\" in his 2006 review of Dark Resurrection: \\"She's a decent character that offers a lot of moves to learn. But when I control her, I don't feel like I'm in the next evolution of Tekken. I feel like I'm charge of a rehash.\\" Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said in 2012, \\"[It's] nice to see that someone finally found a way to work a character with daddy issues into the Tekken series,\\" but Writtin King of Game Informer included Lili in his 2012 ranking of the most \\"ridiculous\\" Tekken characters on the basis of her primary costume. \\"[We're] supposed to believe Lili is proficient in street fighting? Give me a break.\\" King additionally commented on her storyline of being housebound by her father for fighting in the tournament: \\"In other words, she got grounded. I wonder if she lost her telephone privileges, too.\\" In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lili was the most-requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter with 16.72% (14,764) of 88,280 votes, finishing two hundredths of a percentage point ahead of Jun Kazama.

Whereas the singleton allows only one instance of a class to be created, the multiton pattern allows for the controlled creation of multiple instances, which it manages through the use of a map. Rather than having a single instance per application (e.g. the object in the Java programming language) the multiton pattern instead ensures a single instance per key. Most people and textbooks consider this a singleton pattern. For example, multiton does not explicitly appear in the highly regarded object-oriented programming textbook Design Patterns (it appears as a more flexible approach named registry of singletons). Description While it may appear that the multiton is a hash table with synchronized access there are two important distinctions. First, the multiton does not allow clients to add mappings. Secondly, the multiton never returns a null or empty reference; instead, it creates and stores a multiton instance on the first request with the associated key. Subsequent requests with the same key return the original instance. A hash table is merely an implementation detail and not the only possible approach. The pattern simplifies retrieval of shared objects in an application. Since the object pool is created only once, being a member associated with the class (instead of the instance), the multiton retains its flat behavior rather than evolving into a tree structure. The multiton is unique in that it provides centralized access to a single directory (i.e. all keys are in the same namespace, per se) of multitons, where each multiton instance in the pool may exist having its own state. In this manner, the pattern advocates indexed storage of essential objects for the system (such as would be provided by an LDAP system, for example). However, a multiton is limited to wide use by a single system rather than a myriad of distributed systems. Drawbacks This pattern, like the Singleton pattern, makes unit testing far more difficult, as it introduces global state into an application. With garbage collected languages it may become a source of memory leaks as it introduces global strong references to the objects. Implementations In Java, the multiton pattern can be implemented using an enumerated type, with the values of the type corresponding to the instances. In the case of an enumerated type with a single value, this gives the singleton pattern. In C#, we can also use enums, as the following example shows: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; public enum MultitonType { Zero, One, Two } public class Multiton { private static readonly Dictionary instances = new Dictionary(); private MultitonType type; private Multiton(MultitonType type) { this.type = type; } public static Multiton GetInstance(MultitonType type) { // Lazy init (not thread safe as written) // Recommend using Double Check Locking if needing thread safety if (!instances.TryGetValue(type, out var instance)) { instance = new Multiton(type); instances.Add(type, instance); } return instance; } public override string ToString() { return \\"My type is \\" + this.type; } // Sample usage public static void Main() { var m0 = Multiton.GetInstance(MultitonType.Zero); var m1 = Multiton.GetInstance(MultitonType.One); var m2 = Multiton.GetInstance(MultitonType.Two); Console.WriteLine(m0); Console.WriteLine(m1); Console.WriteLine(m2); } } References External links * Multiton implementation in Ruby language * Multiton usage in PureMVC Framework for ActionScript 3 * Article with a C# Multiton implementation, example of use, and discussion of memory issues Category:Software design patterns Category:Articles with example Java code ","title":"Multiton pattern"},{"id":"3430786","text":"The Chapa pygmy dormouse or Vietnamese pygmy dormouse (Typhlomys cinereus chapensis) is a rodent endemic to Vietnam.

Constantine is named after Saint Constantine, a 6th-century Cornish saint possibly identified with a minor British king Constantine. History In pre-historic times, a fogou was constructed near Trewardreva: its purpose is unknown. The ancient name of Constantine, \\"Langostentyn\\", implies that the settlement was monastic, with the \\"Lan\\" prefix.

The stone cross at the cross-roads in High Cross was found in 1992 and re-erected nearby.Stone Crosses: Andrew Langdon (Dyffresyas Crowson – Protector of Crosses) Stone crosses in West Cornwall (including The Lizard), The Federation of Old Cornwall Societies, 1999 (Cornish Cross series No. 5) . Langdon holds that place-names starting \\"Lan\\" indicate the location of a Burial Ground, not a church or monastery (p. 3, section d). The items listed in the book in Constantine are numbered 18 to 29. Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded six Cornish crosses in the parish; in the churchyard, at Bosvathick, at Merthen, at Nanjarrow, at Trevease and at Trewardreva.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard =St Constantine Church= Little remains of the Norman church, which was rebuilt between 1420 and 1480: the tower has been called impressive. There is a brass of 1574 to Richard Gerveys and family. The chancel was rebuilt in 1862 and there was other restoration work between 1859 and 1901.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Penguin Books; pp. 55–56 Restoration of the roof timbers (costing £1,200) commenced in 1874, completed in 1878, with the re-opening ceremony held on 22 January 1879 by Edward Benson the Bishop of Truro. In 1882 the north aisle was restored with a new roof of pitch pine and slates, as well as new seating. The restoration of the Bosahan aisle was commenced in the summer of 1882 and completed the following May. The church was given a grade I listing on 10 July 1957. =Extractive industries= The settlement called Constantine Churchtown grew up around the church. Mineral extraction led to an increase in population and the village expanded down what is now called Fore Street, during the 19th century.Ordnance Survey 6-inch map, 1888, surveyed in 1878 Sheet LXXVII NW shows the street complete. However, one property, \\"The Bow Window\\", is thought to be a 300-year-old farmhouse. The parish had three main industries: agriculture; mining for tin, copper, and iron; and quarrying granite.See also pages 44–49 of the Book of Constantine. For more information on quarrying in the Constantine area, see Peter Stanier's South West Granite The largest mine was Wheal Vyvyan, which was worked from 1827 to 1864. The production figures for copper 1845–1864 and for tin ore, 1855–1864, are given in Cornish Mines.Cornish Mines The value of copper raised peaked in 1845, 1850 and 1855. The peaks of value in tin ore production were in 1856 and 1863. In 1864, the value of tin raised was only a quarter of the previous year's value and the mine closed.The story of the local mines is covered in detail in pages 40–43 of the Book of Constantine =Twentieth-century= View of the Church and the Recreation Ground, showing the Social Club on the left of the picture In 1921, Alice Hext of Trebah gave the playing field and sports pavilion to the village, in memory of her husband, Charles Hawkins Hext, who died in 1917.The book of Mawnan (2002) She supported the development of the Sport and Social Club until her death in 1939.Minute Book of the Constantine Sport and Social Club (in private hands); review of the year 1940 In 1933, overhead cables, providing electricity to homes were installed in the village.Electricity supply: West Briton, 17 November 1933.

Located at the corner of Avenida Corrientes and Avenida Bouchard; in the San Nicolás neighborhood. Initially, the arena primarily hosted boxing and other sporting events. In the 1950s, it was expanded to host stage shows and concerts. The stadium has hosted countless internationally famous personalities, including Pope John Paul II, several ballets, tennis and volleyball matches, world championship and important non-championship boxing fights involving Nicolino Locche, Hugo Corro,http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-535685648-entrada-ticket-boxeo- luna-park-corro-vs-ronnie-harris-1978-, Santos Laciar, Carlos Monzón, Omar Narvaez, Juan Roldán, Julio César Vásquez and many other famous boxers, circuses, the Harlem Globetrotters, Holiday on Ice and many more. The arena also hosted the 1950 FIBA World Championship, the final phase of the 1990 Basketball World Championship and the 1976 Basketball Intercontinental Cup in which Real Madrid won the competition. The arena also hosted the Six Days of Buenos Aires cycle race. History At the beginning of the twentieth century, Buenos Aires was inhabited by thousands of immigrants from Europe. Additionally, there was an abundance of tourists from throughout the Americas. In 1910, Italian merchant Domingo Pace built Luna Park, an open street fair in the heart of the city. By the 1920s, the amusement park became the playground of the aristocrats and wealthy in Argentina. With the change of scenery, the park began to decline and by 1929, many of the rides were abandoned. In 1931, Ismael Pace (son of Domingo) and boxing legend Jose Pepe Lectoure purchased land from the city. With the decline of Luna Park, Pace envisioned creating a sports arena in the likes of Madison Square Garden and the Berliner Sportpalast. Before opening in 1932, the arena went through three names: Estadio de Corrientes y Bouchard, Catedral del Boxeo then Palacio de los Deportes before settling on Estadio Luna Park (in remembrance of the now torn down amusement park). Opening February 1932 as an opening air venue and carnival. The arena hosted a boxing match every Saturday, with first match being held on 5 March 1932. At this time, the arena could sit 22,000 spectators. During the off season, the arena ran rampant with the homeless, causing the venue to become an enclosed space in 1934. During the Second World War, the arena became the site of many Nazi and Fascist rallies. In 1944, during a charity event, Eva Duarte and Juan Perón met for the first time. In the 1950s, the arena began to decline. Lectoure and Pace were pressured by the city to seek better revenue. In 1951, renovations began for the arena in the style of Art Deco, substantially, the capacity of the arena was reduced. Before construction ended, Pace and Lectoure died. Ownership of the venue was given to Lectoure's son, Juan Carlos Lectoure. Known as Tito, he convert the arena into the site for concerts and it became a major venue for the Argentine rock scene. In 2007, the arena was declared a Monumento Histórico Nacional. After 80 years, the Lectoure family no longer owned the historic venue. After the death of Tito's wife, Ernestina Devecchi de Lectoure (in 2013), ownership of the arena was transferred to Sociedad Salesiana de San Juan Bosco and Cáritas Argentina.

He is known for having been arrested while acting as the legal envoy of two of the families of dissident Iranian writers who were assassinated in November 1998 in what came to be known in Iran as the \\"Chain Murders\\" or \\"serial murders\\" case. The arrest was widely condemned by human rights groups.3/16/07 Iranian Lawyer Nasser Zarafshan Released After Five Years In Prison It is reported that Zarafshan had been tremendously critical of the shortcomings in the official examination into these killings. In 2002 he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and was released from prison in March 2007. Before his arrest As a member of the Iranian Writers' Association Kanoon and a notable member of the Iranian Bar Association, Zarafshan's translations and articles have appeared in important periodicals in Iran. The murdered journalists included Majid Sharif, an editorialist with the monthly Iran é Farda, writer- journalists Mohamad Mokhtari and Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, and a couple, Dariush and Parvaneh Forouhar, who were freedom of expression activists.  Case history  Zarafshan was arrested by members of the Judicial Organization of Armed Forces (JOAF) in October 2000 after giving a speech in the city of Shiraz in which he stated that the intelligence services had murdered five Iranian intellectuals in 1998 in Tehran. He was initially charged with publishing information about the assassinations, imprisoned in December 2000, and was released after a month pending trial. In February 2002, he was tried in a military court behind closed doors with his solicitor present; the presiding judge was a prosecutor with the JOAF. While in detention, Zarafshan's office was reportedly searched, and weapons and alcohol were allegedly found. He was sentenced on 19 March 2002 to five years' imprisonment (two years for disseminating state secrets, three years for the possession of firearms) and 70 lashes for the possession of alcohol. Zarafshan denies the firearms and alcohol charges and claims these were planted in his office by the authorities. Zarafshan was awarded the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award in 2004, the Kurt Tucholsky Award of the Swedish PEN section in 2006 and the Human Rights Award of the German Association of Judges in 2007.  Imprisonment  Iranian judicial organizations have so far failed to explain why Zarafshan, a civilian, was brought before the JOAF, the purpose of which is to try members of the armed forces and Revolutionary Guards for violations of the military code. It is reported that the Chair of the Iranian Parliamentary Committee for Human Rights has protested against the use of a military court in these circumstances, branding it \\"unconstitutional.\\" Zarafshan has reportedly appealed to the Supreme Court and is currently awaiting a decision, which, according to information as of October 2002. During his imprisonment, he was not only denied medical care for an urgent kidney disease for a period of time, but also was held in a cell with prisoners of violent crimes. On 7 June 2005, Zarafshan started a hunger strike to protest the absence of medical treatment. After a significant deterioration in his health, he ended his hunger strike and was hospitalized for an operation on his kidney in July 2005. On 16 March 2007 after serving his sentence, Zarafshan was released from prison and told reporters, \\"I will now do the same things I did before.\\" See also * Human rights in Islamic Republic of Iran * Mohammad Mokhtari * Mohammad-Ja'far Pouyandeh References External links * Official Website * PEN Profile of Nasser Zarafshan * Nasser Zarafshan, \\"The Third Side Also Exists: Regarding the Likely American Attack on Iran\\" Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian lawyers Category:Iranian writers Category:Iranian prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Iran Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Persian-language writers Category:Iranian critics Category:Iranian Writers Association members ","title":"Nasser Zarafshan"},{"id":"3430826","text":"Marsilea is a genus of approximately 65 species of aquatic ferns of the family Marsileaceae. The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656–1730). These small plants are of unusual appearance and do not resemble common ferns. Common names include water clover and four-leaf clover because of the long-stalked leaves have four clover-like lobes and are either present above water or submerged. The sporocarps of some Australian species are very drought-resistant, surviving up to 100 years in dry conditions. On wetting, the gelatinous interior of the sporocarp swells, splitting it and releasing a worm-like mass that carries sori, eventually leading to germination of spores and fertilization. Uses thumb Marsilea hirsuta was introduced to the Azores but formerly thought to be an endemic species, M. azorica =As food= Sporocarps of some Australian species such as Marsilea drummondii are edible and have been eaten by Aborigines and early white settlers, who knew it under the name ngardu or nardoo. Parts of Marsilea drummondii contain an enzyme which destroys thiamine (vitamin B1), leading to brain damage in sheep and horses. During floods in the Gwydir River basin 2,200 sheep died after eating nardoo. Three-quarters of the sheep that were affected did however respond to thiamine injections.Watt, Bruce, Managing the land – Toxic Plants, Pro Grazier, Winter, 2009, MLA Thiamine deficiency from incorrectly prepared nardoo likely resulted in the starvation and death of Burke and Wills. The leaves of Marsilea crenata are part of the East Javanese cuisine of Indonesia, especially in the city of Surabaya. It is called Pecel Semanggi and is served with spicy peanut and sweet potato sauce. =Ornamental= A few species in the genus, such as Marsilea crenata, Marsilea exarata, Marsilea hirsuta, and Marsilea quadrifolia, are grown in aquaria.

There were several types of Audichron machines including the stand time piece (STM), M12, temperature machine (TEMP) and the Comparator.  Types  =STM= STM stood for \\"Small Town Machine\\".Audichron STM100-T This was the standard time piece. It made announcements such as: \\"Save by the 10th, earn from the first, at Central Brevard National Bank. Time one forty two.\\" The STM had three recording drums and two sound heads. The drum on the left side of the machine was the widest; it held the customers' messages. On the right side of the machine were the hour drum and the minute drum. The hour drum was the narrowest of the three drums; it simply had the hours 1 through 12 recorded on it. The minute drum had the minutes 1 through 59 and o'clock recorded on it. Inside the STM were a series of gears that caused the drums to rotate and index independently to new messages (there were up to twenty four messages on a drum, twelve each in two groups), new hours and new minutes. There was a sound head on each side of the machine. The first would come down and play the message. Then it would be raised and the other sound head would drop down to play the hours and minutes. STMs were typically used in small towns with fairly low traffic volume. =M12= This machine was similar in design to the STM machine.Audichron M-12 However, it had a feature called TLP (traffic load protection). M12s were used in larger cities with high call volumes. When call volumes were heavy, the M12 would shorten the message and then give the time. For example, \\"Central Brevard National Bank Time four o'clock.\\" This allowed the phone company to handle more calls without overwhelming its system. =Temp= This was the temperature machine.Top view of Temperature mechanism It consisted of a long rotating drum (perhaps 18 inches long). Recorded on the drum were a series of temperatures (minus 40 °F to 120 °F, or −40 °C to 50 °C). A single soundhead was attached to a lead screw. A thermometer was placed on top of the telephone company central office and connected to the Audichron temperature machine. This would cause the leadscrew to rotate and position the soundhead on top of the correct temperature recording. Thus with a time and temperature machine, a caller might hear: \\"Save by the 10th, earn from the first, at Central Brevard National Bank. Time one forty two. Temperature 98.\\" In reality they were hearing announcements with four rotating drums on two separate mechanisms. Audichron sometimes made special temperature machines that went up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) for desert cities in such states as California, Arizona as well as others. = Comparator = The comparator units were found only in the largest cities. They were similar to M12 units but had an extra drum for seconds. Callers heard messages such as: \\"At the tone, the time will be twelve fifteen and 10 seconds\\" followed by a tone. The comparator units used an oscilloscope to monitor the National Bureau of Standards radio station WWV to ensure the time was accurate. WWV used an Audichron machine to broadcast the time over the radio.

It works by taking advantage of the decrease in vapor pressure that occurs when solutes are added to pure solvent. This technique can be used for polymers with a molecular weight of up to 20,000 though accuracy is best for those below 10,000. Although membrane osmometry is also based on the measurement of colligative properties, it has a lower bound of 25,000 for sample molecular weight that can be measured owing to problems with membrane permeation. Experiment A typical vapor phase osmometer consists of: (1) two thermistors, one with a polymer-solvent solution droplet adhered to it and another with a pure solvent droplet adhered to it; (2) a thermostatted chamber with an interior saturated with solvent vapor; (3) a liquid solvent vessel in the chamber; and (4) an electric circuit to measure the bridge output imbalance difference between the two thermistors. The voltage difference is an accurate way of measuring the temperature difference between the two thermistors, which is a consequence of solvent vapor condensing on the solution droplet (the solution droplet has a lower vapor pressure than the solvent). Mn Calculation and Calibration The number average molecular weight for a polymer sample is given by the following equation: :M_n = K / ( \\\\lim_{c \\\\to 0}(\\\\Delta V/c) ) where: K is a calibration constant, \\\\Delta V is the bridge imbalance output voltage, c is the polymer-solvent solution concentration It is necessary to calibrate a vapor phase osmometer and it is important to note that K is found for a particular solvent, operational temperature, and type of commercial apparatus. A calibration can be carried out using a standard of known molecular weight. Some possible solvents for VPO include toluene, tetrahydrofuran, or chloroform. Once the experiment is performed, concentration and output voltage data can be graphed on a plot of (ΔV/c) versus c. The plot can be extrapolated to the y-axis in order to obtain the limit of (ΔV/c) as c approaches zero. The equation above can then be used to calculate K. Alternatives Vapor phase osmometry is well suited for the analysis of oligomers and short polymers while higher polymers can be analyzed using other techniques such as membrane osmometry and light scattering. As of 2008, VPO faces competition from matrix- assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), but VPO still has some advantages when fragmentation of samples for mass spectrometry may be problematic.

It is also a municipality in the district of Friesland in Lower Saxony in Germany. Wangerooge is one of the East Frisian Islands. It is the easternmost and smallest of the inhabited islands in this group (according to some other measurements, Baltrum is the smallest) and the only one that belonged to the historical district of Oldenburg between 1815 and 1947, whereas Borkum, Juist, Norderney, Baltrum, Langeoog and Spiekeroog always belonged to the county of Ostfriesland. As of the census of 2004, the island has 1,055 inhabitants. Especially in summer the island accommodates more than 7,000 visitors a day. Wangerooge is separated from the island of Spiekeroog by a gat known as the Harle. The island is attractive to tourists due to the beaches, various recreation facilities and its relaxed atmosphere. The island's slogan, visible on a sign at the harbor, emphasizes this: \\"God created time, but he never mentioned haste.\\" A yearly beach volleyball tournament, usually held at the beginning of August, is one of the main attractions in the summer, and has served to modify the general impression that the island is exclusively attractive to older people and young families. In addition, windsurfing, kite-surfing and board-riding activities attract younger people. 2012-05-13 Nordsee-Luftbilder DSCF8674.jpgAerial view of Wangerooge 2012-05-13 Nordsee-Luftbilder DSCF8702.jpgThe port of Wangerooge Alter Leuchtturm-01.jpgOld Lighthouse Neuer Leuchtturm Wangerooge.jpgNew Lighthouse Wellenbrecher, Düne.JPGBeach and dike of Wangerooge 2012-05-13 Nordsee-Luftbilder DSCF9125.jpgCafé Pudding In order to guarantee a relaxed atmosphere, cars are prohibited on the island. The island can be reached by ship from Harlesiel, or it can be reached by plane via its airfield, regular service being offered from Harlesiel, Bremen, or Hamburg. The ferries leave at different times every day according to the tide. As on most East Frisian Islands, a small narrow gauge railway line, the Wangerooge Island Railway, connects the harbor to the main village. As for historical sites and other places of interest, the island has one active lighthouse, one old lighthouse, and the Western Tower. Since the whole island used to be shifting constantly eastwards until sea defenses were built a century ago, old buildings were gradually lost to the sea. The Western Tower was built in 1597 and was originally in the east of the island. Wangerooge is also known as the site of a historic World War II B-17 Flying Fortress crash, or rather a double crash. During a bombing mission on Hamburg on New Year's Eve, 1944, a B-17 squadron was attacked by German fighter planes on its homeward flight. While in tight formation, one plane was shot down and became entangled with the plane below it. One of the pilots managed to take control of the two aircraft and steer them back towards the German coast for an emergency landing. At the time, the two entangled aircraft were described as resembling breeding dragonflies as the ball turrets of each plane were caught in the chassis of the other. Most of the crew bailed out, while two remained and successfully made a crash landing in a field. Wangerooge has an airfield with scheduled services. Location of Wangerooge in Friesland district  Geography  = Location = Wangerooge is a German island in the southern North Sea and is the easternmost of the seven inhabited East Frisian islands. The island stretches over 8.5 kilometers in length in the east-west direction. The north-south extension is a maximum of 2.2 kilometers in the western part, and 1.2 kilometers at the level of the village. The distance to the main land is 7 kilometers. To the west of Wangerooge, which is separated by the Gat of Harle, the eastern Spiekeroog is 2 kilometers away. Separated by the Blaue Balje, the island Minsener Oog begins, which is 2 kilometers east-southeast. On the northside, there is a sandy beach that is about 100 meters wide and 3 kilometers long. In the east, this beach merges into a 500 meter wide and 3 kilometer long field with sand deposits. In the west of the island, there are two more beaches that are ½ kilometer and 1 kilometer in length. To the south of the island lies the Wadden Sea, which is part of the Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park, like the islands, and is very dry at Baseflow. Below the island, at a depth of about 15 meters, there is the Geest base. The highest elevation of the island is the look-out dune, which is 17 meters above sea level. The remaining sand dunes reach heights of up to 12 meters. = Area = With an area of 7.94 square kilometers (2008)Laut Auskunft des Niedersächsischen Landesbetriebs für Wasserwirtschaft, Küsten- und Naturschutz (NLWKN), Wangerooge is the second smallest of the inhabited East Frisian islands after Baltrum, and the larger areas can be up to 8.5 square kilometers. Higher values include beach areas that lie below the mean tide line (Mittleres Tidehochwasser, MTHW), but these are regularly washed over by the sea water of the North Sea and are, therefore, not considered as land areas. Since part of the land area, about 2.97 square kilometers, is not municipalized as a part of a federal waterway, the area of the municipality of Wangerooge covers only 4.97 square kilometers.

It served the students until 1885 when the school had 156 students and a larger building was needed. (This school is currently located on Monmouth Road, Oakhurst) The Poplar Road School, since demolished, was located between Deal Road and West Park Avenue in the Poplar section of town, this school was used from 1864 until 1911 when the students were sent to the new Oakhurst School. The first Wayside School was located on the Tinton Falls side of Hope Road it was used until 1911, when pupils were sent to the new Oakhurst School, at this time however all high school students traveled to Long Branch High School by stagecoach. The Oakhurst School was built in 1900. It accommodated all students from Wayside and Oakhurst in grades one to eight from 1900 until 1958. From 1959 to 1975, it was used as a K-4 and K-5 facility. Principals included Ralph Busch, Charles J. Strahan, Frank Parker, Jesse Love, Harry Patterson, Estelle Voorhees, Ernest Smith, Richard Randall, John D.W. Rasp, Donald Vineburg, and Glen Morgan. Since 1975, the building has been used as the school district's administrative offices. The Wanamassa School, opened in 1930 to serve all students in Wanamassa. Before that, students walked to the Bradley School in Asbury Park. The school is stilled used to this day for grades PK-4 and Special Education Disabilities Classes. Principals included Victoria Green, Edward German, J. Anthony Covino, Joseph Palaia, Douglas Deicke, Camille Tighe, Margaret Grilli, Justine Salvo, and current Victor Milano. The Ocean Township Elementary School on Dow Avenue opened in 1958 as a middle school, serving grades five to eight. Upper-grade teachers from Wanamassa and Oakhurst Schools moved to the new school with their principal J. Anthony Covino. In 1984, Cavino retired and Mrs. Villapiano, Assistant Principal, took over. At her retirement in 2002, William Galatro took over and served until 2007. Dr. Doreen O. Ryan is currently Principal. The school currently housed Grades PK-4 and Special Education Disabilities Classes. The Wayside Elementary School opened on January 5, 1970. It houses grades PK-4. John D.W. Rasp was the first principal until 1988. Other principals have included Douglas Deicke, Thomas Pagano, David Enderly, and currently Denise Palaia. Before the Ocean Township High School opened in 1965, students from the district were bused to Long Branch High School or Asbury Park High School. The principals were Charles Scott, Douglas Fredricks, Robert Mahon, Gardner Atlee, John Crews, John Connelly, John Tighe, Margaret Morgan, John Lysko, Dr. William Cohee, Julia Davidow, and currently Kelly E.

The Township of Ocean Intermediate School was opened in 1975 to house grades seven, eight, and nine. It now houses grades five, six, seven, and eight. In April 2017, more than 95% of Loch Arbour voters participating in a referendum chose to leave the Ocean Township district and to begin sending students for elementary school to the West Long Branch Public Schools and then move on to attend Shore Regional High School, under the terms of sending/receiving relationships with the two districts by which Loch Arbour would be charged on a per-pupil basis. The average cost to Loch Arbour taxpayers of educating students in the sending districts would be $16,000 per student, a significant drop from the $126,000 was paying in property taxes per student under its relationship as part of the Ocean Township School District.Spahr, Rob. \\"Shore town votes to leave longtime school district\\", NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, April 5, 2017.

Before the attack of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) on October 1st, 1990, Radio Rwanda was the only national radio station in Rwanda, which represented both the views of the state and that of the party in power. Shortly after the start of the war, the FPR created its own radio station, Radio Muhabura. In March 1992, Radio Rwanda began to broadcast false information regarding the possible assassination of Hutu officials, after which many Tutsis were consequently killed in the Bugesera region. When the transitional government was installed in April 1992, it demanded a programming change of the radio by President Habyarimana. This preserved the transitional government's role in the state radio, but stopped that of the President's party, the MRND. Due to the growing influence of Radio Muhabura, radical Hutus created a new radio station in 1993, named Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, abbreviated as RTLM. RTLM frequently made hateful statements against the Tutsis, and several of its journalists were eventually convicted of inciting Genocide against the Tutsi.http://unictr.unmict.org/en/news/three-media-leaders-convicted-genocide Despite Radio Rwanda and RTLM being two distinct, independent radio stations, they were broadcast at the same wavelengths at different times, which led the population to confuse them. Radio Rwanda was reestablished between 1994 and 2000, with financing from the German government. Today Radio Rwanda has become a national Public radio with other 6 regional stations including Magic FM (Kigali), Radio Rusizi (Rusizi), Radio Musanze (Musanze), Radio Nyagatare (Nyagatare, Radio Rubavu (Rubavu) and Radio Huye (Huye).

It dates to 1832, when blackface performers such as George Nichols, Thomas D. Rice, and George Washington Dixon began to sing it. These performers and American writers such as T. Allston Brown traced the song's origins to black riverboatsmen.Brown, T. Allson, \\"The Origin of Negro Minstrelsy\\", in Charles H. Day, Fun in Black, New York, 1874. Quoted in Nathan 186. \\"Clare de Kitchen\\" became very popular, and performers sometimes sang the lyrics of \\"Blue Tail Fly\\" to its tune. Musicologist Dale Cockrell sees echoes of European mumming traditions in \\"Clare de Kitchen\\". In traditional mumming plays, the participants first entered a private household. One mummer, usually with a broom and sometimes with blackened face, would then clear an area and declare the space to now be public, for the use of the players.Cockrell 47, 49. \\"Clare de Kitchen\\", Cockrell argues, moves this public/private space to the theatre.Cockrell 50. The first verse reflects this relationship to mumming: :In old Kentuck in de arternoon, :We sweep de floor wid a bran new broom, :And dis de song dat we do sing, :Oh! Clare de kitchen old folks young folks :Clare de kitchen old folks young folks :Old Virginny never tire.Quoted in Cockrell 50. The line \\"I wish I was back in old Kentuck\\" is one of the earliest examples of \\"I wish I was in\\" from blackface minstrelsy. This line eventually became the famous \\"I Wish I Was in Dixie\\" in 1859.Nathan 260. An alternate set of lyrics, sung by Thomas D. Rice in the mid-1830s, may reflect the input or influence of American blacks. This version features animal characters and trickster figures triumphing over larger animals in the same way that such figures do in African folktales: :A jay bird sot on a hickory limb, :He wink'd at me and I wink'd at him, :I pick'd up a stone and I hit his shin, :Says he you better not do dat agin. :A Bull frog dress'd sogers close, :Went in de field to shoot some crows; :De crows smell powder and fly away, :De Bull frog mighty mad dat day.Quoted in Lott 22-3.

The red-headed or 'common' cardinal beetle (Pyrochroa serraticornis) is a red to orange beetle with, as the name suggests, a red head. It is about long, and is found throughout Britain. The rarer black-headed cardinal beetle (P. coccinea), similarly found at sites across Britain, is larger and a deeper blood red. The scarce cardinal beetle (Schizotus pectinicornis) also has a black head, but is smaller at around long. The scarce cardinal is only found at a few sites in Scotland and Wales. Pyrochroa coccinea Schizotus pectinicornis on grass in a meadow Cardinal beetles prey on other insects, while their bright red colour prevents them being the target of other predators which believe them to be toxic. Habitat Red-headed cardinal beetles are normally found at the edges of woodland. Adults of this variety usually emerge around May in England, when they tend to be found under loose bark on deciduous trees. Fallen and standing timber and rotting stumps may also host this species. As the weather gets warmer, they disperse and are often found on dense, low herbage. They bask for long periods on large leaves often near water – the Grand Union Canal being one particular hotspot. Identification People often mistake the smaller scarlet lily beetle, Lilioceris lilii, for a cardinal beetle as they also have a black underside and wings that are spotless and red. However, the scarlet lily leaf beetle's wing cases have tiny dimples and are shinier and more rounded than the dull, narrow, flattened and elongated cardinal beetle. The beetles can also be distinguished by the cardinal's toothed antennae. Another difference between the two is their diets. Scarlet lily leaf beetles are herbivores and are usually found eating lily leaves, whereas cardinal beetles are usually found on tree bark and flowers and feed on flying insects.

He was a professor at the universities in Breslau, Berlin and, from 1903, Königsberg. He is best known for his multi-volume Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur (first published 1898–1902) ('History of Arabic literature') which included all writers in Arabic to 1937, and remains the fundamental reference volume for all Arabic literature, apart from the Christian Arabic texts (covered by Georg Graf). He also published Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar (1899), Semitische Sprachwissenschaft (1906), Lexicon syriacum (1928), and Arabische Grammatik (under his own name 1941, but this was the eleventh edition of the grammar of Albert Socin, previously revised by Brockelmann several times).  Career  Brockelmann pursued Oriental studies, classical philology, and history in Rostock, Breslau, and Strasburg. He earned his Ph.D. in Strasburg, in 1890, under the direction of Theodor Nöldeke, and his Dr. habil. degree in Breslau in 1893. In 1900 he was appointed to a chair in Breslau, in 1903 in Königsberg, in 1910 in Halle, in 1922 in Berlin, and in 1923 in Breslau again. After his retirement in 1935 he returned to Halle/Saale, where he died.  Works * Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur.

Description They are medium-sized, with the female weighing in at between 580 and 680 kilograms (kg) and standing 1.30 metres tall. They are golden brown in color with a white head (apart from the eyes), underside of the abdomen, and extremities of its legs. The bull weighs in at between 645 and 820 kilograms (kg) and stands 1.70 metres tall. Their colour is different, with a chestnut red and a bit of white on the head. Their milk is rich in both fat and protein, with a good balance between the two. The milk is traditionally used to produce Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) cheese such as the reblochon, abondance, tome des Bauges and the beaufort. Typical milk production is 5700 kg per lactation. This breed of cattle is especially appreciated for its ability to withstand extreme variations in temperature, its fertility, its ease of breeding, its milk, its long life and its meat.

He served as a Teachta Dála from 1918 to 1921 and 1922 to 1923. Early years O'Kelly was born in Coramore, on Valentia Island off the County Kerry coast, he was the son of Patrick Kelly, a farmer, and Ellen Sullivan. While his birth date is recorded as 7 July 1872, his family gave it as 4 July. Political career He joined Sinn Féin at its inaugural meeting on 5 November 1905. Following the 1916 Easter Rising, O'Kelly joined the Irish Nation League and became treasurer of the Irish National Aid and Volunteers' Dependants' Fund for the relief of prisoners and their families. In February 1917, he was arrested and deported to England where he was interned without trial for several months. On his release O'Kelly was elected to the Provisional Committee of the newly merged Irish Nation League and Sinn Féin, thereafter called Sinn Féin. He was appointed editor of the influential \\"Catholic Bulletin\\".Recent book on the Bulletin In the 1918 general election he was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for Louth by 255 votes in what was the closest contest in Ireland in that election. The closeness of the contest was due to the strong AOH organisation in the county that campaigned for outgoing North Galway MP Richard Hazleton of the Irish Parliamentary Party. O'Kelly took his seat in Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin TD and was Leas-Cheann Comhairle (Deputy chairman) from 1919–21. He was appointed Minister for Irish in the Government of the 2nd Dáil. This position that was expanded as the Minister for Education in the Government of the 2nd Dáil. From 1919 to 1923, he was President of the Gaelic League. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty that was ratified by the Dáil in January 1922, and refused to accept the legitimacy of the Irish Free State established in December 1922. He and others maintained that the Irish Republic continued to exist and that the rump of the Second Dáil, composed of those anti-Treaty TDs who had refused to take their seats in what became the Free State parliament, was the only legitimate government for the whole of Ireland. In June 1922, he was elected to the Third Dáil for the constituency of Louth-Meath but abstained from taking his seat. In August 1923, standing as a Republican for the Meath constituency, he was defeated for an abstentionist seat in the 4th Dáil. He was again defeated in the Roscommon by-election of 1925, his last election attempt. After the resignation of Éamon de Valera as president of Sinn Féin in 1926, O'Kelly, who maintained an abstentionist policy towards Dáil Éireann, was elected in his place and remained in this position until 1931 when Brian O'Higgins took over the leadership. O'Kelly was hostile towards the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, claiming it was insufficiently supportive of Irish Republicanism and that the Constitution also did not require the President of Ireland to be of Irish birth.Dermot Keogh and Dr. Andrew McCarthy, The making of the Irish Constitution 1937: Bunreacht na hÉireann. Mercier Press, 2007 (p.193). Sceilg was unusual among Irish Republicans in that he regarded Daniel O'Connell and T.M. Healy as political heroes. This apparently reflected local patriotism (both men came from south-western Ireland near to Sceilg's own birthplace) and Sceilg's own devout Catholicism, which led him to exalt O'Connell's achievement of Catholic Emancipation and Healy's claims that the adultery of Charles Stewart Parnell with Katharine O'Shea made Parnell unfit for political leadership. Sceilg was also explicitly hostile to the Spanish Republic declared in 1931, believing it to be anti-Catholic and supported by pro- British Freemasons. Literary interests He was a prolific author on Irish language and history topics, editing Banba, The Catholic Bulletin and An Camán. He was intensely religious and an active Catholic. O'Kelly opposed members of the IRA fighting against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, he was one of seven remaining abstentionist Second Dáil TDs who transferred the \\"authority\\" of what they believed was the \\"authority\\" of the Government of the Irish Republic to the IRA Army Council (see Irish republican legitimatism). In 1938, he visited Germany, later publishing his impressions in the Irish Independent.Irish Independent, 27 March 1957. Anti-Semitism Many of O'Kelly's speeches and writings contained content critical of Freemasons and Jews.Joost Augusteijn(ed.), The Irish Revolution, 1913–1923. Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p. 46; David Fitzpatrick, The Two Irelands 1912–1939 Oxford, 1998, p. 188. In 1916, members of Ireland's Jewish community protested after the Catholic Bulletin published a series of articles by Fr. T.H. Burbage accusing the Jewish community of carrying out ritual murders; O'Kelly refused to apologise for the articles.Dermot Keogh, Jews in Twentieth-century Ireland: Refugees, Anti-semitism and the Holocaust, Cork University Press, 1998, pp. 70-1. O'Kelly also featured the anti-semitic writings of Denis Fahey in the Bulletin.Enda Delaney, 'Political Catholicism in Post-War Ireland', Journal of Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 52, No. 3, July 2001, p. 493 In 1930, O'Kelly, speaking as Sinn Féin President to its members, said, \\"In the signs of the Anti-Christ, England is today the prey of rival groups of unscrupulous Jews fighting for their lands.\\" In 1939 O'Kelly spoke at Cork City Hall and praised Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews, saying: \\"England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity...its seems to me that England prefers to plant the Jews in Ireland, as she planted the Cromwellians, The Orangemen...How many people in Ireland reflect that the Treaty of Versailles placed Germany...with the heel of Jews on her neck...while Jewish usury emancipated and the Jewish White Slave Trade sought to corrupt the whole land\\". Death O'Kelly died in Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, on 26 March 1957, and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery on 28 March.Irish Independent, 27 March 1957.

In 1898 the American Unitarian Association elected him secretary (a position effectively the chief executive officer) but in 1900 the position was redesignated as president and Eliot served in that office from inception to 1927, significantly expanding the association's activities and consolidating denominational power in its administration. A member of the wealthy Eliot family, he was the son of Harvard President Charles W. Eliot and grandson of Boston politician Samuel Atkins Eliot. His fourth cousin, Frederick May Eliot, also served as President of the American Unitarian Association (1937–1958). Biography =Early life and education= Samuel Atkins Eliot was born in Cambridge, Mass. in 1862. His father, Charles W. Eliot, a chemist, became President of Harvard University when his son was four. His mother, Ellen Derby Peabody, daughter of Unitarian minister Ephraim Peabody, died the same year. Samuel graduated from Harvard College in 1884. He enrolled at Harvard Divinity School the following year, and after briefly serving as a missionary in Seattle, Washington, graduated in 1889. He held pastorates at Unity Church in Denver, Colo. (1889–92) and the Church of the Saviour in Brooklyn, N. Y. (1892–98). =AUA Presidency= Eliot left congregational ministry to serve as Secretary of the American Unitarian Association (AUA) in 1898. At Eliot's urging, his position was re-titled President in 1900, a title which he retained until 1927 and transformed from a presiding to an executive office. Eliot's efforts to consolidate the National Council of Unitarian Churches under the American Unitarian Association established the denomination's modern associational governance. Where the pre- Eliot AUA had been an organization for individual membership, the merger created a structure of congregational membership and governance, an early incarnation of the Unitarian Universalist Association's General Assembly. Eliot also attracted wealth Unitarians to serve on the AUA's board, who presided over a major expansion of the AUA's operations into public advocacy, Sunday School curriculum, and ministerial credentialing. Eliot was sympathetic to mid-20th century social reforms and established the first Department of Social Justice with the AUA. Responding to declining wealth in American central cities in the early twentieth century, Eliot encouraged the growth of suburban Unitarian churches. He was also active in shaping the political commitments and demographics of Unitarian clergy by using his office to de- fellowship ministers who objected to American involvement in World War I, discouraging women from seeking Unitarian ordination, and excluding women ministers from associational leadership. While commemorating the American Unitarian Association's centennial in 1925, one of Eliot's final acts as President was to move the association to a new headquarters on Beacon Street. The new building, completed in 1927, retained the AUA's historic address (25 Beacon Street), but moved the Association from the east side of Massachusetts State House to its west side. In the following decades, the denomination purchased several more properties on Beacon Hill. The Unitarian Universalist Association, successor to the AUA after its 1961 merger with the Universalist Church of America, occupied the building until 2014, when it moved to Boston's Seaport District. During and after his tenure as American Unitarian Association president, Eliot wrote and edited books on Unitarian and Massachusetts history, including two large biographical dictionaries, the Biographical History of Massachusetts (1906) and Heralds of a Liberal Faith (1910). The latter volume constituted his efforts to catalog Unitarian history and articulate Unitarianism as a discrete American tradition. Eliot also chaired an editorial committee and edited several volumes for the Centennial Edition of the works of Theodore Parker and completed a A History of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1630-1913 in 1913. =Later life= After twenty- nine years at the helm of the American Unitarian Association, Eliot retired to become senior minister of the Arlington Street Church, the largest Unitarian congregation in Boston, where he remained until 1935.

It lies in the Faughan Valley, southeast of Derry, where the River Glenrandal joins the River Faughan. It is situated in the civil parish of Cumber Upper and the historic barony of Tirkeeran. It is also part of Derry and Strabane district. Claudy had a population of 1,336 people in the 2011 Census. It has two primary schools, two churches and a college named St Patrick's and St. Brigid's College. History During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, 13 people were killed in or near the village of Claudy in County Londonderry. Nine of these people, including one nine-year-old child, were killed in the Claudy bombing of 31 July 1972, in which three suspected Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) car bombs exploded almost simultaneously in Main Street. Inadequate warning was given, and no paramilitary group has ever admitted responsibility for the bombing. Of the other four people to be killed in Claudy, three were Protestant members of the security forces (two Ulster Defence Regiment and one Royal Ulster Constabulary), and all were killed by the IRA in separate incidents. The other person to be killed was a Catholic civilian killed by the Ulster Freedom Fighters. All 13 victims died during a relatively brief period, from 1972 to 1976. Because of Claudy's small population, it has one of Northern Ireland's higher Troubles-related fatality rates. The 13 people killed there in the Troubles are equivalent to one percent of the village's 2001 population; in comparison, the death rate in Belfast was equivalent to just over half a percent of the city's 2001 population, and that in Derry a quarter of a percent.Sutton Index of Deaths: Deaths by Geographical Location Sport *Claudy has a local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Claudy GAC. *Claudy is home to two rival football clubs, Claudy United and Claudy Rovers. *The village also has a local leisure centre called the Diamond Centre. It has sporting, gym, and ICT facilities. Demography =2011 Census= In the 2011 Census, Claudy had a population of 1,340 people (504 households). On Census Day 27 March 2011, in Claudy Settlement, considering the resident population: * 99.10% were from the white (including Irish Traveller) ethnic group; * 80.45% belong to or were brought up in the Catholic religion and 17.39% belong to or were brought up in a 'Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)' religion; and * 22.24% indicated that they had a British national identity, 50.45% had an Irish national identity and 31.04% had a Northern Irish national identity. =2001 Census= Claudy is classified as a village by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 1,000 and 2,250 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 1,316 people living in Claudy. Of these: *26.7% were aged under 16 and 12.3% were aged 60 and over *49.1% of the population were male and 50.9% were female *77.9% were from a Catholic background and 21.4% were from a Protestant background *4.9% of people aged 16–74 were unemployed..

The specific epithet is occasionally written japonica, but this is incorrect due to the gender of the genus. Its native range includes much of east Asia, including the Russian Far East, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines. It has been intentionally introduced to other parts of the world as a pet and as pest control, with mixed results. As one of the native species of the Japanese islands, it has been depicted in Japanese art on numerous occasions, and historically was kept as a cage bird. Taxonomy The warbling white-eye was described by the ornithologists Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel in 1845 from a specimen collected in Japan. They coined the binomial name Zosterops japonicus. The English name \\"Japanese white-eye\\" was formerly used for Zosterops japonicus and what are now the Philippine subspecies of Z. japonicus were treated as a separate species, the \\"mountain white-eye\\" Z. montanus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018 found that Z. montanus and several subspecies of Z. japonicus were conspecific, and they were therefore lumped together. They were placed in Z. japonicus Temminck & Schlegel, 1845 as this has priority over Z. montanus (Bonaparte, 1850). The new English name \\"warbling white-eye\\" was introduced for the combined taxa. At the same time, several other subspecies of the former Z. japonicus were split off into their own separate species, Swinhoe's white-eye Z. simplex. There are 15 recognised subspecies many of which are island endemics: * Z. j. japonicus Temminck & Schlegel, 1845 – south Sakhalin, Japan and coastal Korean Peninsula * Z. j. stejnegeri Seebohm, 1891 – Izu Islands south to Torishima (Nanpo Archipelago) * Z. j. alani Hartert, 1905 – Iwo Jima (Volcanic Islands) * Z. j. insularis Ogawa, 1905 – north Ryukyu Islands * Z. j. loochooensis Tristram, 1889 – Ryukyu Islands except northern * Z. j. daitoensis Kuroda, 1923 – Borodino Islands * Z. j. obstinatus Hartert, 1900 – Ternate, Tidore, Bacan Islands (west of Halmahera) and Seram Island * Z. j. montanus (Bonaparte, 1850) – mountains in Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lesser Sundas, Sulawesi and southern Moluccas * Z. j. difficilis (Robinson & Kloss, 1918) – Mount Dempo (south Sumatra) * Z. j. parkesi (duPont, 1971) – Palawan (west Philippines) * Z. j. whiteheadi (Hartert, 1903) – north Luzon (north Philippines) * Z. j. diuatae (Salomonsen, 1953) – north Mindanao (south Philippines) * Z. j. vulcani (Hartert, 1903) – central Mindanao (south Philippines) * Z. j. pectoralis (Mayr, 1945) – Negros (westcentral Philippines) * Z. j. halconensis (Mearns, 1907) – Mindoro (northwest Philippines) Description The warbling white-eye is olive green on its back, from anterior to posterior, and is pale green on its underside. Its feet, legs, and bill range from black to brown.van Riper SG. (2000) \\"Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus)\\" in The Birds of North America, no. 487. A. Poole and F. Gill (Eds.). Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, and American Ornithologists' Union, Washington, D.C. It has a green forehead and a yellow throat. The white-eye has rounded wings and a long, slender bill – both of which indicate this bird to be very acrobatic. Its wings are dark brown, but outlined in green. Like other white-eyes, this species exhibits the distinctive white eyering that gives it its name (mejiro also meaning \\"white eye\\" in Japanese). Adults range from 4 to 4.5 inches in length, and weigh between 9.75 and 12.75 grams. Habits =Behavior= Courting This bird species is rarely found on the ground. It is a very sociable species that may form flocks with other species, in which the birds form groups to forage during flight; white-eyes only flock with birds of other species outside of the breeding season. Allopreening – the art of cleaning, grooming, and maintaining parts of the body – is extremely common. Interspecific allopreening (between different species) has been observed in captivity. While sociable, however, the white-eye typically forms monogamous relationships with mates – it has only one mate at any one time. Social hierarchy in a flock is established through physical displays. Some of these displays are not sex dependent, such as wing flicks exposing the underwing, wing flutters and vibrations, as well as open beak displays and beak snaps (rapid shutting of the beak to make a snapping noise). During breeding seasons, however, males establish territories via the sex-specific activity of singing loudly. Males will fend off intruders of the same species, yet will allow other species of birds to nest inside of their territory. =Nesting= Pairs of individuals, generally monogamous, choose a location for the nest between 1 and 30 meters above ground level. Construction of the nest lasts 7–10 days on average, and a variety of nesting material may be used (living and non-living); spider webs, moss, lichens, and mammal hair are all examples of building media that the birds employ. When building nests, they often steal material from the nests of other birds.Guest, Sandra J. (1973) A reproductive biology and natural history of the Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonica japonica) in urban Oahu. Technical Report 29. Island Ecosystems. US International Biological Program. Nests tend to be cup shaped, with a diameter of 56.2 mm and a depth of 41.7 mm. The majority of nests are only used once, but some may be used up to three times in any given season. =Feeding= The species is omnivorous, living on a diet of fruit from several species of flowering plants, various types of insects, and nectar at all levels of foliage. It feeds on insects by searching the leaves of flowers and scouring tree bark for larvae. Consequences of its diet include regulation of local insect populations and dispersal of seeds; however, the white-eye's seed- dispersal ability does not seem to be significant in Hawaii. Distribution The warbling white-eye is found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, eastern China, and the northern Philippines. Migratory populations of the bird spend winters in Burma, Thailand, Hainan Island, and Vietnam. The white-eye is widespread and common in Japan, considered one of the more dominant bird species.Atkins China Ltd. (1997) Route 9 Detailed Feasibility Study. Final Environmental Impact Assessment Report, 6: 49–60. In spring 2018 there were several sightings of Japanese white-eyes in Southern California, with confirmed breeding in San Diego County as of 2019.. However, in 2019 the California birds were reclassified as belonging to a newly designated species, Swinhoe's white-eye. The dominant white-eye population in Taiwan has similarly been reassigned to Swinhoe's. =Hawaii= The warbling white-eye, originally introduced in O’ahu in 1929, has rapidly expanded its population and can now be found on every island of Hawaii; the climates of these islands range from tropical rain forests to deciduous forests.Global invasive species database [database on the Internet]. Zosterops japonicus (bird): Invasive Species Specialist Group, IUCN Species Survival Commission. [cited 2011 March 18]. After subsequent releases and natural range expansion (enlargement of the area it occupies), the white- eye was determined to be the most abundant land bird on the Hawaiian Islands as early as 1987. It has become a vector for avian parasites that are now known to adversely affect populations of native birds such as Hawaiian honeycreepers, as well as spreading invasive plant species through discarded seeds. Predators Organisms known to prey upon native Hawaiian avian species include small mammals, like the Polynesian, black, and Norway rats, and the mongoose.Fielder, PL & Kareiva, PM. (1998) Conservation Biology: For the Coming Decade. New York: Chapman & Hall. There are no documented predators of the warbling white-eye. It can only be inferred that organisms that prey on small mammals and birds in the same area as the warbling white- eye also prey on the white-eye itself. Competitors In its natural habitat, the warbling white-eye competes with other native passerine bird species, including those of the same genus, such as the Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron familiare). In Hawaii, the warbling white-eye competes with native passerines such as the common 'amakihi, for food (such as nectar and fruit), as well as for space.Gibson L. (2000) Rules and Regulations. Federal Register, 65(75): 20760-20769. In Hawaii, the warbling white-eye has been observed visiting endemic (native) floral species thought to have coevolved with endemic nectarivorous avian species (those that eat nectar). This means that, over time, changes in native flowers have triggered changes in native birds that feed on the nectar of these flowers; the latter change then triggers another change in the flowers, and the whole process continues to repeat itself. The visitation of the white-eye, along with the disappearance of those endemic nectarivorous passerine bird species, suggests that the white-eye is out- competing those endemic species for the floral resource (nectar). Conservation Native species need normal juvenile mass and bill length to recover and persist, but for this to happen, food must be restored to former levels. There is support that an introduced bird, such as the warbling white- eye, is responsible for the food shortage. Control of the white-eye is therefore essential for the recovery of native Hawaiian birds. The determination of the status of native birds is essential; those found to be endangered could possibly benefit from the designation of critical habitat. In 1980, a program to eradicate the Indian white-eye in California involved mist- netting and shooting the birds, and this proved to be the most successful of the various capture methods explored.Van Way V. (1984) \\"The White-eyes Eradication Efforts in California\\". Proceedings of the Eleventh Vertebrate Pest Conference (1984), University of Nebraska. Whether eradication is feasible and applicable to other instances of invasive exotic birds is yet to be determined, but could be considered a possibility for the eradication of the warbling white-eye in the Hawaiian Islands. However, because the white- eye's current ecological role is not fully understood (i.e. seed disperser, pollinator, etc.) further studies are necessary before any drastic measures are taken.

Based on the rear-engined Škoda 105 120 and 130 saloon, it was a replacement for the Škoda Garde coupe built between 1981 and 1984 itself based upon the Škoda 105/120 sedan design, which was also called the Rapid in the UK market. Some Garde/Rapid cars were sent to Ludgate Design & Development in Kent, United Kingdom, by Škoda to be converted into convertibles. the Škoda Rapid was famous being described as \\"the poor man’s Porsche\\" after Autocar and Motor defined the Škoda Rapid \\"a beginners' course to the 911\\", as it had a rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive, just like the Porsche 911. Today the Škoda Rapid is gaining in popularity as a classic car with Garde and convertible models being most sought after. According to the website \\"How Many Left?\\", there were a total of 50 Škoda Rapids left on British roads in 2011. The Rapid name was originally used on 1930s Škoda models, and was revived again in 2011 on an Indian market Rapid saloon, based on the Volkswagen Vento, and in 2012 on a Rapid hatchback for the international market. The Rapid, and its predecessor Garde, were internally known as Type 743 models, with the later 135/136 Rapids being referred to as Type 747. Specifications The Rapid used a unibody structure and a rear- engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Front suspension was by double wishbones and coil springs. At the rear there were semi-trailing arms and coil springs, a major upgrade from the swing axle of earlier Škodas that gave safer and more predictable handling. Brakes were discs with four-pot calipers at the front, and drums at the rear. The engine was a water-cooled, carburated, OHV inline four mounted longitudinally, slanted to the right and overhanging the rear axle. Power was sent to the rear wheels through a transaxle gearbox. Engine upgrades were introduced concurrently with the analogous ones of the Škoda 130 series saloon. In the first years of production, Škoda Rapid 120 had 1174 cc aluminium block, cast iron heads engine and four-speed gearbox carried over from its predecessor Škoda Garde. These first series were made in BAZ Bratislava and they were known for its unreliability. A stronger 1289 cc engine fitted with a five-speed manual gearbox was mounted on the Škoda Rapid 130, producing at 5000 rpm and at 2850 rpm. Top speed was and the car could accelerate from standstill to in 16.5 seconds.Daily Mail Motor Show Review 1984, page 74 The 1987 Rapid 136 introduced an upgraded 1.3, with new aluminium alloy 8-port cylinder heads. Power and torque increased to at 5000 rpm and at 3000 rpm. While top speed did not improve, acceleration to was reduced to 14.9 seconds.Daily Mail Motor Review 1989, page 83 In 1988 the Rapid 135 replaced the Rapid 130; it used the all-aluminium engine of the 136, albeit with a lower compression ratio that lowered output to .

Standard Rapid coupés were imported and converted in the UK by specialist Ludgate Design & Development (LDD ltd.) in Kent, and were sold through the official Škoda dealerships. The cars retained their window frames, and were reinforced with additional chassis bracing and a T-shaped rollbar similar to the Triumph Stag's. At a total price of just under 5,000, the Rapid Cabriolet was the cheapest convertible on sale in the United Kingdom.

R. R. Tolkien, Oxford academic and author of the fantasy books The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town Kreuzburg near Königsberg, where the Tolkien name is attested since the 16th century. The verified paternal line of J. R. R. Tolkien starts with Michel Tolkien, born around 1620 in Kreuzburg. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706–1791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752–1819) emigrated to London in the 1770s, and became the ancestors of the English family. The family first appears in English records in 1777. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Their German nephew Daniel Gottlieb Bergmann also joined them in London. Johann (John) Benjamin Tolkien, who died in London in 1819, was the 2nd great-grandfather of J. R. R. Tolkien.Ryszard Derdziński, Z Prus do Anglii. Saga rodziny J. R. R. Tolkiena (XIV-XIX wiek)Ryszard Derdziński, \\"On J. R. R. Tolkien's Roots\\", 2017 Etymology According to Ryszard Derdziński the Tolkien name is of Low Prussian origin and probably means \\"son/descendant of Tolk\\", with Tolk meaning interpreter or negotiator and originating as a nickname. A number of other theories on the meaning of the name have been proposed, including that it is derived from the village of Tolkynen in East Prussia. J. R. R. Tolkien suggested the name was derived from the German adjective tollkühn, meaning foolhardy. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them are descendants of recent refugees from East Prussia who fled the Red Army invasion. J. R. R. Tolkien's own knowledge of the family history was limited to its 18th-century German origin,Carpenter, Humphrey; Tolkien, Christopher, eds. (1981). The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien. no. 165. London: George Allen & Unwin. . according to Derdziński in part because he was \\"early isolated from the family of his prematurely deceased father.\\" Notable members =J. R. R. Tolkien= John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE (3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English philologist, writer and professor of Oxford University. He was a devout Roman Catholic. Much of Tolkien's published fiction is a connected body of tales, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth (derived from the Old English word middangeard, the lands inhabitable by humans) in particular, loosely identified as an \\"alternative\\" remote past of our own world. Tolkien applied the word legendarium to the totality of these writings. Most of the \\"legendarium\\" was edited and posthumously published by his son Christopher. While Tolkien was preceded by other fantasy authors, his enduringly popular and successful works have had a remarkable influence on the genre. Thus he has been popularly identified as the \\"father of modern fantasy literature\\", or to be precise, high fantasy. L. Sprague de Camp and others consider him the father of modern fantasy together with sword and sorcery author Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian). =Arthur Tolkien= Arthur Reuel Tolkien (c. 18 February 1857 – 15 February 1896), the father of author J. R. R. Tolkien, was born in Handsworth, Staffordshire, England (now a suburb of Birmingham). He was the eldest child of John Benjamin Tolkien and Mary Jane Stow, who had married on 16 February 1856 in All Saints Parish Church, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England. Arthur's father John had previously been married to Jane Holmwood, with whom he had four children: Emily (b. 1838), Louisa (b. 1840), John Benjamin (b. 1845), and Jane (b. 1846). John Benjamin Tolkien had been a piano teacher and tuner, as well as a music seller, but he had gone bankrupt in 1877, when he was described as \\"John Benjamin Tolkien, of High-street, Birmingham, in the county of Warwick, Pianoforte and Music Seller\\". Arthur did not follow his father into the traditional Tolkien trade in pianos, which many of his London cousins also followed; instead he became a bank clerk and ended up moving to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now part of South Africa), where he became manager of the Bloemfontein branch of the Bank of Africa.Welcome to South Africa A furniture shophobbits now occupies the Bradlow's Building on the site where the bank once stood, on the corner of West Burger and Maitland Streets. Arthur was later joined by his fiancée, Mabel Suffield. They were married on 16 April 1891 at the St. George's Cathedral, Cape Town, Cape Colony (later Cape Province, South Africa). Two children: John Ronald Reuel (b. 1892) and Hilary Arthur Reuel (b. 1894) followed, and the family lived next door to the bank. Mabel Tolkien felt the English climate would be better for the boys' health and returned to England with them in 1895. Arthur remained in South Africa, where he died of severe haemorrhage following rheumatic fever, on 15 February 1896, before he had the opportunity to join his family in England. He is buried in President Brand Cemetery, on the corner of Church and Rhodes Avenues, Bloemfontein. =Mabel Tolkien= St Peter's Catholic Church, Bromsgrove: grave of Mabel Tolkien (1870–1904) Mabel Tolkien, born Suffield (1870 – 14 November 1904) was the mother of J. R. R. Tolkien. Her parents, John Suffield and Emily Jane Sparrow, lived in Stirling Road, Birmingham and owned a shop in the city centre. The Suffield family had a business in a building called Lamb House since 1812. From 1812 William Suffield ran a book and stationery shop there; Tolkien's great-grandfather, also John Suffield, was there from 1826 with a drapery and hosiery business.Image of John Suffield's shop before demolition with caption – Birmingham.gov.uk Her husband Arthur Tolkien's death in South Africa in 1896 left her and their two young sons without a source of income. At first, they lived with her parents in Birmingham, then moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. Mabel tutored her two sons, and J. R. R. (or Ronald, as he was known in the family) was a keen pupil. She taught him a great deal of botany, and she awakened in her son the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. But his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early. She also taught him how to write, and her ornate script influenced her son's handwriting in his later life. Mabel Tolkien converted to Roman Catholicism in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family who then stopped all financial assistance to her. She died of acute complications of diabetes in 1904 (at about 34 years of age, about as long as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could live with no treatment – insulin was not discovered until two decades later), when Tolkien was twelve, at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which they were then renting. For the rest of his life Tolkien felt that she had become a martyr for her faith, which had a profound effect on his own Catholic beliefs. =Edith Tolkien= Edith Mary Tolkien, born Bratt (21 January 1889 – 29 November 1971) was the wife of J. R. R. Tolkien. She served as the inspiration for his fictional character Lúthien Tinúviel, an Elven princess and the most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar (the name of God in Tolkien's fiction). Bratt first met Tolkien in 1908, when they lived in the same boarding house. Both were orphans. The two fell in love, despite Bratt being Tolkien's senior by three years. Before the end of 1909 the relationship became known to Tolkien's guardian, Father Francis Xavier Morgan, who forbade Tolkien to see Bratt until he was 21. With one exception, Tolkien obeyed this instruction to the letter while Father Morgan's guardianship lasted. They were married in 1916. The couple are buried side by side in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford; below the names on their grave are the names Beren and Lúthien: in Tolkien's legendarium, Lúthien and the Man Beren were lovers separated for a time by Lúthien's father King Thingol. =Hilary Tolkien= Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien (17 February 1894 – 1976), the younger brother of J. R. R. Tolkien, was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa. The climate did not suit the young J. R. R. Tolkien and his mother took both her sons to visit her parents in Kings Heath in Birmingham. When her husband died in 1896 she decided to stay back in England with her sons. They moved to Sarehole, a village then outside Birmingham, in 1896. As a child, J. R. R. Tolkien used to tell stories to his younger brother Hilary, making ogres out of the adult people in the village. Ronald nicknamed the flour-coated miller's son in the nearby Sarehole Mill The White Ogre. A farmer who used to terrorise children intruding on his land was nicknamed as the Black Ogre. He once chased Ronald for plucking mushrooms from his farm. Hilary wrote the stories, letters and reminiscences of past times in a notebook during his twilight years. The contents of the notebook were published as a book titled Black & White Ogre Country: The Lost Tales of Hilary Tolkien in 2009. In 1902, the family moved to 26 Oliver Road in Edgbaston, Birmingham and later they both joined St. Philip's School in Birmingham. However, they soon left the school and their mother started teaching them at home. In 1904, both brothers contracted measles and whooping cough. Owing to the poor condition of their house on Oliver Road, Hilary also contracted pneumonia. When their mother became ill with diabetes, Ronald was sent to live with his aunt Jane's fiancé and future husband Edwin Neave. Hilary was sent to stay with his maternal grandparents, the Suffields. After the death of their mother they were raised by Fr Francis Morgan. Hilary later passed an entrance examination and joined King Edward's School in 1905 where his elder brother also studied. Hilary left school in 1910 and later helped his aunt Jane Neave run Phoenix Farm in the village of Gedling in Nottinghamshire. Hilary, his brother, aunt Jane and members of the Brookes-Smith family made a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1911. In late September 1914, J. R. R. Tolkien stayed with his aunt and brother at the farm for a few days. In 1914 during World War I, Hilary enlisted in the British Army with the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a bugler and was wounded in 1916. After his military service, Hilary returned to Gedling and, in 1922, bought an orchard and market garden near Evesham, ancestral town of his mother's family. In 1923, J. R. R. Tolkien, along with his wife and children, went to stay with Hilary for a while. A few months before his death, he visited Hilary in Evesham. Hilary married Magdalen Matthews in 1928. They had three sons. The first, Gabriel, was born in 1931, the second, Julian, in 1935, and the third, Paul, in 1938. =John Francis Reuel Tolkien= John Francis Reuel Tolkien (16 November 1917 – 22 January 2003) was the eldest son of J. R. R. Tolkien. He was born in Cheltenham. He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford and The Oratory School in Caversham, Berkshire where in his final year he decided to become a priest. On the advice of the Archbishop he decided to go to college to study English and joined Exeter College, Oxford from where he received his B.A. degree in 1939. In November 1939, he went to the English College, Rome to train as a priest. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the college was moved to Stonyhurst in Lancashire where John trained as a priest during the war. He was ordained as a priest at St Gregory & St Augustine Church in North Oxford. His first position was as a curate from 1946 to 1950 at the St Mary and St Benedict Church in Coventry where he taught weekly classes to 60 children and organized the building of church schools. From 1950 to 1957, he was a curate at the English Martyrs Church in Sparkhill, Birmingham. Thereafter he moved to North Staffordshire, where he was the chaplain of University College of North Staffordshire, now Keele University and at two grammar schools, St Joseph's College, Trent Vale and St Dominic's High School, Hartshill. He was parish priest at Knutton Roman Catholic Church from 1957 to 1966. In 1966, he became the parish priest at Our Lady of the Angels and St Peter in Chains Church, Stoke-on-Trent. He held the position until 1987 and there oversaw the building of a new school. He was chairman of governors at Bishop Bright School, chaplain to the North Staffordshire Catholic Teachers Association and area chaplain to the Young Christian Students. He moved back to Oxford in 1987, settling in Eynsham where he was the parish priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church until his retirement in 1994.

R. R. Tolkien. =Michael Hilary R. Tolkien= Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984) was a British teacher. He was J. R. R. Tolkien's second son and was named after J. R. R. Tolkien's brother Hilary. When young Michael lost his toy dog and became sad about this, his father began to write the story of Roverandom to comfort him. Michael's fear of spiders was J. R. R. Tolkien's inspiration for the encounter of Bilbo Baggins and the spiders of Mirkwood in The Hobbit. Michael also used to own a Dutch doll which became an inspiration for Tom Bombadil. In 1939, Michael volunteered for the British Army but he was told to continue his university studies. He studied history at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1941, Michael Hilary Tolkien served in an anti-aircraft role during the Battle of Britain for which he was awarded the George Medal. He met a nurse named Joan Audrey Griffith (1916–1982) whom he married the same year. Later in World War II, he served as an anti-aircraft gunner in France and Germany. In 1944, he returned to Trinity College and finished his studies. He graduated in Modern History in 1945. From 1947 until the 1970s he worked as a teacher at various Catholic schools in Britain. In 1973, Michael Tolkien published an article about his father in The Sunday Telegraph: \\"J. R. R. Tolkien – The Wizard Father\\". Michael and his wife Joan had three children: Michael George Reuel (b. 1943), Joan Anne (b. 1945) and Judith (b. 1951). Royd Tolkien is the son of Michael's daughter Joan.

During the Second World War he served in the RAF as a pilot. After the war, he followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a lecturer and tutor in English Language at New College, Oxford from 1964 to 1975. In 2001, he received some attention for his stance on New Line Cinema's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson. It was reported that he had had a falling out with his son Simon over the appropriateness of a film adaptation. Responding to these reports, he said he felt The Lord of the Rings was \\"peculiarly unsuitable for transformation into visual dramatic form\\". He said he did not disapprove of the movies, definitely not \\"to the point of thinking ill\\" of those with whom he might disagree. Christopher Tolkien married twice. He last lived in France with his second wife, Baillie Tolkien. =Faith Faulconbridge= Faith Lucy Tilly Faulconbridge (1928 – 24 October 2017) was the first wife of Christopher Tolkien, whom she married on 2 April 1951. Their son Simon was born in 1959. She produced a bust of J. R. R. Tolkien that is displayed in the English Faculty Library at Oxford University. She was born to F. T. Faulconbridge, whom J. R. R. Tolkien knew as a fellow student from King Edward's School, Birmingham. She received her B.A. degree from St Anne's College, Oxford in 1950 and later studied sculpture-making from Oxford Art School. She was initially known for portrait heads in bronze, some of which she presented in the Royal Academy in 1958. She made a bust of her father-in-law which the English faculty at Oxford presented to him on his retirement in 1959. He had it cast in bronze and in 1966 it was placed at the English Faculty Library. Her other subjects included Iris Murdoch and C. S. Lewis. She separated from Christopher in 1964 and divorced from him in 1967. In 1958, she produced a seated Madonna and Child for the Catholic Chaplaincy at Birmingham University. In the early 1980s she returned to religious themes, including working for the Corpus Christi Church in Headington, Oxford and the Church of the Sacred Heart in Sutton Coldfield.

R. R. Tolkien, his only daughter and only living child. Priscilla had long been hoped for, and was born to Tolkien and his wife in their house at 22 Northmoor Road in Oxford shortly before the couple moved into their new one at 20 Northmoor Road in 1930. She took an active part in production of The Lord of the Rings by typing out some early chapters for her father at the age of fourteen. She completed her B.A. degree in English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1951.

Like other species of the genus Eresus, it is commonly called ladybird spider because of the coloration of the male. E. sandaliatus is one of the three species into which Eresus cinnaberinus or Eresus niger has been divided. Description Male E. sandaliatus are generally (a little bit smaller than other species of the E. cinnaberinus complex) and characterized by a bright orange back featuring four large and two small ebony spots. White hairs are never present on the back, and legs always lack red hairs. In contrast, the females are and jet-black. Habits Males enter the adult stage in early September, but overwinter in their webs and search for females only in May or June of the next year. Otherwise, this species is very similar to other species of E. cinnaberinus complex. After the 35-80 eggs hatch, the spiderlings receive a liquid from the mouth of the female. The female later seems to digest its own body, which leads to her death a few days later. The spiderlings then suck on the mother. The next spring they leave the web and build their own in close vicinity.Bellmann, H. (1997). Kosmos-Atlas Spinnentiere Europas. Kosmos. Distribution E. sandaliatus is native to Europe, from England and southern Norway to northern Italy. Found this in Albania and Portugal and Salamanca near Portugal. Conservation It is classified as endangered by the British Red Data Book and hence protected under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. In 1993 it was estimated that only about 50 individual ladybird spiders were left in Britain, mainly due to deprivation of an appropriate habitat. In 2000, however, over 600 separate ladybird spiders were counted, probably owing to the efforts of English Nature's Species Recovery Programme and affiliated operations. It is currently the focus of a Back from the Brink conservation project, which aims to translocate spiders to start new populations.https://naturebftb.co.uk/the- projects/ladybird-spider/ References *ARKive: Ladybird spider, 2004.

He was a vocal activist for human rights and because of this, he ran afoul of the authorities and was jailed for more than four years. He spent the last 16 years of his life in exile in China. Biography =Education and early career= Born in Bangkok, Kulap studied at Debsirin, a school for students from wealthier families. Kulap himself did not come from a wealthy family. His father died when he was very young, and his mother, a dressmaker, and sister, a classical dancer, worked hard to fund his education. In 1928, he wrote three novels. Two of them, A Real Man (Luk Phu Chai) and The War of Life (Songkram Chiwit), stood out. By 1929, Kulap had gathered his friends into a publishing group known as Suphapburut (\\"The Gentlemen\\"). Under Kulap's leadership, the group went into journalism. In 1934, Kulap spent three months in retreat as a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk). He wrote a religious novel, Facing Sin (Phajon Barb). The following year, he married Chanid Priyacharnkun. She later became the translator of three of Jane Austen's novels under the pen name \\"Juliet\\", and helped him to translate Pool by W. Somerset Maugham as well as Anton Chekhov's In Exile and Maxim Gorky's Mother. In early 1936, Kulap was forced to resign from his work as a journalist. Late that year, he went to study in Japan, and upon his return, he wrote The Jungle of Life (Pa Nai Chiwit), and his romantic masterpiece Behind the Painting (Khang Lang Phap). Both stories were serialised in 1937. Behind the Painting was adapted as a film twice, in 1985 by director Piak Poster and in 2001 by director Cherd Songsri. In 1939, Kulap began writing journalistic articles again. He and his group restarted Suphapburut, which had been closed earlier. In 1944 and 1945, Kulap was elected president of the Thai Newspaper Association. In late 1947, he and his wife Chanid left Thailand for two years, and travelled to Australia where he studied political science. On his return, he started a publishing house to publish his own works and those of his friends' in cheap editions. He also wrote several books, including Till We Meet Again (Chon Kwa Rao Cha Phop Kan Ik). =Jailed, exile= In 1951, during the second premiership of dictatorial Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Kulap set up the Peace Foundation of Thailand. The following year, he protested against the Korean War. He also demanded the lifting of press censorship. When he went to distribute food and blankets to the needy in Isan, he was among more than one hundred \\"agitators\\" arrested on 10 November 1952. Accused of treason and sentenced to about 14 years in jail, he was freed in February 1957 to celebrate the advent of the 25th Buddhist century. During his years in jail, Kulap wrote the first two volumes of an unfinished trilogy Looking Ahead (Lae Pai Khang Na). In 1958, Kulap headed a delegation of writers to China. While he was attending an Afro- Asian Writers' Conference in Tashkent, there was a coup in Thailand and all members of Kulap's delegation were arrested and jailed on their return. Faced with the same fate, Kulap chose to remain in China where he led the life of a \\"democratic personality\\" in exile. He lectured on Thai literature at Peking University. He also contributed to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Front's cultural activities and to the Thai service of China's broadcasting radio. He died in China of complications resulting from pleurisy on 16 June 1974. Kulap's son, Surapan, was married to Wanee, the daughter of Pridi Banomyong and Poonsuk Banomyong. Kulap's 100th Centenary Celebration, organised by the Thai Writers' Association and the Thai National Commission for UNESCO, was held in Bangkok from 14 to 15 December 2005. Kulap's wife, Chanid, died on 15 June 2010. The following year, on 28 July, Surapan Saipradit died from cancer at the age of 72.  Legacy  The Sriburapha Award, an annual award given for excellence in writing, journalism, and the arts, is named in his honor.

The attack killed nine civilians, and became known as \\"Bloody Monday\\". Those who planted the bombs had attempted to send a warning before the explosions took place. The warning was delayed, however, because the telephones were out of order due to an earlier bomb attack. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) issued an immediate denial of responsibility, Archived article at HighBeam Research and later stated that \\"an internal court of inquiry\\" had found that its local unit did not carry out the attack. On 24 August 2010, following an eight-year investigation, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report into the bombing, which stated that the Royal Ulster Constabulary believed in the early 1970s that Father James Chesney, a local Roman Catholic priest, was the IRA's quartermaster and Director of Operations of the South Derry Brigade. The report found that the possibility of his involvement in activities including the Claudy bombing was covered up by senior police officers, government ministers and the Roman Catholic hierarchy. On the 40th anniversary of the bombing, former Provisional IRA leader Martin McGuinness described the events of that day as \\"appalling and indefensible\\" and \\"inflicted on totally innocent people\\"IRA bomb in Claudy was indefensible, says Martin McGuinness  UK news. The Guardian. Bombing On 31 July 1972 at about 4:00 am, the British Army had begun Operation Motorman. This was an operation to regain control of the \\"no-go areas\\" (areas controlled by Irish republican paramilitaries) that had been established in Belfast and Derry. The bombing of Claudy may have been a response to this operation. Shortly before 10:00 am, three car bombs were placed in the centre of the village, which was busy with shoppers at the time. Initial police investigations found that a car was seen travelling from Claudy at 10:00. It had stopped at the nearby village of Feeny, where a passenger tried to use the public telephone box, which was out-of-order. The car then travelled to Dungiven where it stopped on the Main Street. Two men got out and went into separate shops to use the telephones, which were also out of order following a bomb attack at the local telephone exchange. The men then asked the shop assistants to tell the police at Dungiven that there were three bombs in Claudy, but by this time the first bomb had already detonated.Public statement by the Police Ombudsman under section 62 of the Police (NI) Act 1998 Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, 24 August 2010 The first bomb, hidden inside a stolen Ford Cortina, exploded at 10:15 outside McElhinney's bar and store on Main Street. Six people were killed by this bomb; among the dead were an eight-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy. A second bomb, hidden inside a stolen Morris Mini Van parked outside the post office on Main Street, was spotted by a police officer, who then began directing people away from the area towards Church Street. At 10:30, a bomb hidden inside a stolen Mini Van detonated outside the Beaufort Hotel on Church Street. The bomb outside the post office exploded almost simultaneously, killing three people, including a 16-year-old boy injured in the first blast. Investigations =RUC investigation= The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) chief of staff Seán Mac Stíofáin stated local IRA units and operations staff had denied involvement in the attack. Derry politician Ivan Cooper (of the Social Democratic and Labour Party), however, stated in 2002 that the IRA and Father James Chesney (a Catholic priest from the nearby parish of Desertmartin) were involved in the attack. Cooper stated: > Within a couple of days, a man lurked like a scared rabbit outside one of my > constituency offices. He told me the IRA was behind the bomb and I had every > reason to believe him. He gave no names and I asked no names. That is the > way it was then. It was dangerous to know too much. But several months > later, I became aware of the identities and I have absolutely no doubt that > Father Jim Chesney was involved. The type and colour of car used by those who gave the bomb warning were rare in Northern Ireland at that time. In the first week of August 1972, the RUC arrested a suspect (called \\"Man A\\") who owned a similar car. He provided an alibi, however, that he had been at Chesney's home in Bellaghy at the time. Chesney and another person corroborated the man's alibi and he was released after being questioned. According to the Ombudsman's report, when Chesney was stopped at a police checkpoint in September 1972, a sniffer dog found traces of explosives in his car. The police officers involved in the original police investigation suspected the following: *that the alibi had been prepared beforehand; *that \\"Man A\\" was an IRA member and had played a key role in the bombing; and *that Chesney was the quartermaster and \\"director of operations\\" for the South Derry IRA and had also been involved in the bombing. In October 1972, police intelligence alleged that Chesney had formed an \\"independent group of the IRA\\". Some time after the bombing, Chesney was questioned by the then Bishop of Derry Neil Farren, and later again by Farren's successor Bishop Edward Daly. At both times, Chesney denied any involvement. Chesney served in the parish of Cullion from July 1972 until November 1972. He was then hospitalised and spent a period of recovery in County Donegal. In December 1973, he was transferred to the parish of Convoy, County Donegal. Although he often crossed the border into Northern Ireland, he was never arrested and never faced a police interview. mural on Lower Newtownards Road in Belfast making reference to the bombing. It shows a priest wearing a balaclava and holding a bomb and rosary beads. =PSNI investigation= No person was arrested for the bombings at the time, but following calls for a new inquiry, a fresh investigation was started by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2002. As part of the investigation, the police uncovered documents showing that the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Willie Whitelaw discussed Chesney's involvement with Cardinal William Conway. The actions of two other Catholic priests, Patrick Fell and John Burns, were also examined. On 30 November 2005, the PSNI detained four people in connection with the bombing. They were, however, released without charge the next day and denied involvement. Among those arrested was the then Sinn Féin MLA Francie Brolly, who subsequently secured an out-of-court settlement in a legal action against the police. =Police Ombudsman report= On 24 August 2010, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report into the bombing which concluded that the British government and the Roman Catholic Church had conspired to cover up Chesney's alleged involvement. The report stated: > The arrest of a priest in connection with such an emotive atrocity at a time > when sectarian killings in Northern Ireland were out of control and the > province stood on the brink of civil war was feared, by senior politicians, > as likely to destabilise the security situation even further. A deal was > therefore arranged behind closed doors to remove Fr Chesney from the > province without provoking sectarian fury. According to the report by Al Hutchinson, the Police Ombudsman, > The RUC's decision to ask the government to resolve the matter with the > Church and then accept the outcome, was wrong. The decision failed those who > were murdered, injured and bereaved in the bombing. The police officers who > were working on the investigation were also undermined. I accept that 1972 > was one of the worst years of the Troubles and that the arrest of a priest > might well have aggravated the security situation. Equally, I consider that > the police failure to investigate someone they suspected of involvement in > acts of terrorism could, in itself, have had serious consequences. The report found the following: * Detectives believed Father Chesney was the IRA's director of operations in southern County Londonderry and was a prime suspect in the Claudy attack and other paramilitary incidents. * A detective's request to arrest Chesney was refused by an Assistant Chief Constable of RUC Special Branch who instead said that \\"matters are in hand\\". * The same senior officer wrote to the government about what action could be taken to \\"render harmless a dangerous priest\\" and asked if the matter could be raised with the Church's hierarchy. * In December 1972, William Whitelaw met the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Cardinal William Conway, to discuss the issue. According to a Northern Ireland Office official, \\"the Cardinal said he knew the priest was 'a very bad man' and would see what could be done\\". The church leader mentioned \\"the possibility of transferring him to Donegal\\". In response to this memo, RUC Chief Constable Sir Graham Shillington noted: \\"I would prefer transfer to Tipperary.\\" * An entry in Cardinal Conway's diary on 4 December 1972 confirmed that a meeting with Whitelaw had taken place and stated that there had been \\"a rather disturbing tete-a-tete at the end about C\\". * In another diary entry two months later, the Cardinal noted that he had discussed the issue with Father Chesney's superior and that the superior \\"had given him orders to stay where he was, on sick leave, until further notice\\". Whitelaw died in 1999, Cardinal Conway in 1977, Sir Graham in 2001 and Father Chesney (aged 46) in 1980. Memorial Claudy bombing memorial statue by Elizabeth McLaughlin A memorial to those killed and injured by the bombing was erected on Claudy's Main Street in 2000, consisting of a bronze figure of a kneeling girl, created by sculptor Elizabeth McLaughlin, mounted on a stone plinth. A number of plaques commemorating the victims are affixed to the wall enclosing the statue. The statue was damaged on 20 October 2006 when vandals knocked it from the plinth.

How to Read a Film: The Art, Technology, Language, History and Theory of Film and Media. Rev. ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981. .Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. Film Art: An Introduction. Rev. ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1993. . It was standardized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as the standard film aspect ratio in 1932, although similar-sized ratios were used as early as 1928.  History  Silent films were shot at a 1.3 aspect ratio (also known as a 4:3 aspect ratio), with each frame using all of the negative space between the two rows of film perforations for a length of 4 perforations. The frame line between the silent film frames was very thin. When sound-on-film was introduced in the late 1920s, the soundtrack was recorded in a stripe running just inside one set of the perforations and cut into the 1.33 image. This made the image area \\"taller\\", usually around 1.19, which was slightly disorienting to audiences used to the 1.3 frame and also presented problems for exhibitors with fixed-size screens and stationary projectors. From studio to studio, the common attempt to reduce the image back to a 1.3:1 ratio by decreasing the projector aperture in-house met with conflicting results. Each movie theater chain, furthermore, had its own designated house ratio. The first standards set for the new sound-on-film motion pictures were accepted in November 1929, when all major US studios agreed to compose for the Society of Motion Picture Engineers' (SMPE) designated size of returning to the aspect ratio of 1.3:1. Following this, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) considered further alterations to this 1930 standard. Various dimensions were submitted, and the projector aperture plate opening size of 0.825 in × 0.600 in was agreed upon. The resulting 1.375:1 aspect ratio was then dubbed the \\"Academy Ratio\\". On May 9, 1932, the SMPE adopted the same projector aperture standard. All studio films shot in 35 mm from 1932 to 1952 were shot in the Academy ratio. However, following the widescreen \\"revolution\\" of 1953, it quickly became an obsolete production format. Within several months, all major studios started matting their non-anamorphic films in the projector to wider ratios such as 1.6, 1.75, and 1.85, the last of which is still considered a standard ratio along with anamorphic (2.39). 1.375:1 is not totally obsolete, nonetheless, and can still be found in select recent films such as Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/technical?ref_=tt_dt_spec Paul Schrader's First Reformed,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6053438/technical?ref_=tt_dt_spec Michel Hazanavicius's The Artist, Gus Van Sant's Elephant,Garry, John P. III. \\"Elephant: An Ordinary High School Movie. Except That It's Not.\\" Jump Cut. #47 (Winter 2005). Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank and Kelly Reichardt's Meek's Cutoff, as well on prints of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's The Lego Movie intended for 1.78:1 exhibition (a 2.39:1 version was also made).  Technical details  The Academy ratio is not created in the camera, which has continued to use the full frame silent aperture gate for all 4-perf spherical filming. Rather, it is created in the married print, when the optical soundtrack and frame lines are added. Though most non-anamorphic film prints with a soundtrack are now framed to one of the non-anamorphic widescreen ratios, from 1.6 to 1.85, some still retain Academy-sized frames. These frames are then cropped in the projector by means of aperture masks used in the projector's gate in conjunction with a wider lens than would be used for projecting Academy ratio films. During filming, using the 4-perf frame for widescreen framing when spherical lenses are used is sometimes considered to be wasteful in terms of the cost of film stock and processing, especially in the case of television, which does not require a film print. The 3-perf pulldown process was originally proposed in 1973, developed by Miklos Lente in 1976, and further developed by Rune Ericson in 1986 to solve this problem.Bernstein, N.D.; Wysotsky, M.Z.; and Konoplev, B.N. \\"A Universal Format for Film Production.\\" Journal of the SMPTE.

A social club may be a group of people or the place where they meet, generally formed around a common interest, occupation, or activity. Examples include: anime clubs, book discussion clubs, charity work, chess clubs, country clubs, criminal headquarters (e.g., the Cage Documentary featuring the work of ex-New Jersey State Trooper Mike Russell, whose undercover work for the New Jersey State Police led to the arrests of 41 members of the Genovese crime family, and of corrupt prison officials, and a state senator or the Ravenite Social Club), final club, fishing club, gaming club, gentlemen's clubs (known as private clubs in the US), hunting clubs, military officers' clubs, politics clubs, science clubs, university clubs, Christian Fellowships. This article covers only three distinct types of social clubs: the historic gentlemen's clubs, the modern activities clubs, and an introduction to fraternities and sororities. This article does not cover a variety of other types of clubs having some social characteristics.  History  Working men's clubs developed in Britain during Victorian times as institutes where working class men could attend lectures and take part in recreational pursuits. The Reverend Henry Solly founded the Working Men's Club and Institute Union (CIU) for this purpose in 1862. Many middle class social reformers founded these clubs during the temperance movement as a place to relax without alcohol, but in time this changed. They became a combination of public houses (pubs), music-halls, and clubs, becoming places to be entertained, to drink socially, and to play bar games. Working Men's clubs are still prevalent across the United Kingdom, though not as popular. Sociëteit in Palembang, Sumatra In the Dutch East Indies, sociëteits were established in various cities. Modern clubs include: San Francisco's Urban Diversion, which opened in 2003 as a general adventure and activities social club; and Soho, London's Groucho Club, which opened in 1985 as \\"the antidote to the traditional club.\\" The \\"traditional club\\" referred to is the elitist gentlemen's club, a fixture of upper class male British society. This is not to be confused with the modern use of the phrase, which now stands as a euphemism for a strip club. Legalities =England and Wales= Clubs in England and Wales were not controlled by the licensing system until the Licensing Act of 1902 was passed, or in Scotland until the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1903 was passed. They were passed mainly to check the abuse of “clubs” being formed solely to sell intoxicating liquors free from the restrictions of the licensing acts, but it applied to all kinds of clubs in England and Wales. The act required the registration of every club that occupied any premises habitually used for the purposes of a club and in which intoxicating liquor was supplied to members or their guests. The secretary of every club was required to give a return to the clerk to the justices of the petty sessional division with this information: # the name and objects of the club # the address of the club # the name of the secretary # the number of members # the rules of the club relating to: ## the election of members and the admission of temporary and honorary members and of guests ## the terms of subscription and entrance fee, if any ## the cessation of membership ## the hours of opening and closing ## the mode of altering the rules =United States of America= Social and recreational clubs may be considered tax- exempt 501(c)(7) organizations under certain circumstances.  Social activities clubs  Social activities clubs are a modern combination of several types of clubs and reflect today's more eclectic and varied society. These clubs are centered on the activities available to the club members in the city or area in which the club is located. Some have a traditional clubhouse, bar, or restaurant where members gather; others do not. Events can include a broad range of activities from sporting events and social parties to ballet, arts or book clubs. Unlike traditional clubs they are not limited to one kind of event or special interest but include a broad range of events in their monthly calendars. The members choose the events in which the club is going to take part, based upon the changing interests of the members. The members themselves determine the events they will attend of those offered. Because the purpose of these clubs is split between general social interaction and taking part in the events themselves, both single and married people can take part. However clubs tend to have more single members than married, and many clubs exist for only single people, only married couples, or only people with certain sexual preferences (homosexuality, pansexuality, bisexuality or heterosexuality). Membership can be limited or open to the general public, as can the events. Most clubs have a limited membership based upon specific criteria, and restrict the events to members to increase their feeling of security, creating an increased sense of camaraderie and belonging. There are many examples of private social clubs including the University Club of Chicago, The Mansion on O Street in D.C., Penn Club of New York City and New York Friars' Club. Social activities clubs can be for profit, non-profit, or a combination of the two (A for profit club with a non-profit charitable arm, for instance). Some social clubs have function halls which members or, sometimes, the general public can rent for parties. A number of Jewish community centers and other organizations such as the YMCA have social clubs for people with social anxiety and learning disabilities. Membership in these clubs is limited to individuals with these conditions. Sororities and fraternities Fraternities and sororities are part of \\"Greek life\\" prevalent in universities. Many young men and women pledge during their freshman year of college in order to become a brother or sister of a fraternity or sorority. The club is founded on principles of camaraderie and communal bonding. As a social club they may be philanthropic as a body, hosting fundraisers for charities or on-campus events.

During his career, he was a practicing Seventh-day Adventist and followed a vegan diet. Roa was first-choice for the Argentina national team at the 1998 World Cup. Club career Born in Santa Fe, Roa started playing professionally for Racing Club de Avellaneda, making his Primera División debut on 6 November 1988 at the age of 19. During a summer tour of Africa with the club he contracted malaria, but fully recovered. In 1994 he moved to Club Atlético Lanús, rarely missing a match with the Buenos Aires Province side as they achieved three consecutive third-place league finishes (one in 1995, two in 1996), and adding the Copa CONMEBOL in 1996. Roa then signed with Spain's RCD Mallorca alongside Lanús teammate Óscar Mena, playing 25 La Liga matches as the Balearic Islands club finished fifth straight out of Segunda División and also reached the final in the Copa del Rey, lost against FC Barcelona on penalties. In the 1999 summer, after helping Mallorca win the domestic Supercup and reach the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (already accompanied in the team by former Lanús teammates Ariel Ibagaza and Gustavo Siviero), 30-year-old Roa retired from football in order to take a religious retreat. After a year of charitable and religious work spent as a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, his convictions led to his refusal to discuss a new contract with his team because he believed the world was going to end in the near future. Less than one year later, Lechuga (lettuce, a nickname coming from his eating preferences) Roa returned to Mallorca, forced to play out the remaining two years of his contract. Never being able to reproduce his previous form, he was relegated to the bench by compatriot Leo Franco. Subsequently, Roa moved to another Spanish team, second division Albacete Balompié, appearing in 39 league games as the Castile-La Mancha side returned to the top division after a seven-year absence. Midway through the following season, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer and was forced to stop playing; after an operation, he spent an entire year between chemotherapy and rehabilitation. After keeping his fitness with amateurs CD Constancia and CD Atlético Baleares, both in the Majorca area, Roa returned to professional football and his country, joining Olimpo de Bahía Blanca and retiring after one top division season. In 2008 he joined amateurs Club Atlético Brown as goalkeeper coach and, two years later, he was appointed assistant manager at Club Sportivo Ben Hur; in the former capacity, he went to work under former international teammate Matías Almeyda at Club Atlético River Plate, Club Atlético Banfield and C.D. Guadalajara. International career In 1992, Roa appeared for Argentina at the 1992 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament in Paraguay, which saw the country fail to qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was selected by the full side for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France: after not conceding any goals during the group stage, he saved the decisive penalty in the shootout against England in the round-of-16, denying Newcastle United's David Batty. The national team was eventually defeated in the following match by Netherlands (1–2).

Quinn was predominantly a centre forward from 1979 until 1996. Micky now works on UK radio station TalkSPORT, mostly on the Weekend Breakfast show. Quinn played for Wigan Athletic, Stockport County, Oldham Athletic, Portsmouth, Newcastle United, Coventry City, Plymouth Argyle, Watford and PAOK Thessaloniki, during a career in which he played in 524 league matches and scored 235 league goals. Early life Quinn was born in the Everton area of Liverpool on Merseyside in 1962, the oldest of four children born to Michael Quinn and Patricia Silvano. From the age of five, Quinn lived on the Cantril Farm estate and from that young age he has been a supporter of Liverpool. Quinn is the grandson of Italian-born boxer Luigi Silvano (known professionally as Lou Sullivan) who died in 1948 at the age of 39.  Club career  =Early career= Quinn began his career as an apprentice with Derby County signing for the East Midlands club upon leaving school in 1978. However, Quinn only lasted four months at the Baseball Ground, and returned to his Merseyside home, suffering from homesickness. Eager to turn professional, Quinn joined Wigan Athletic in September 1979 as an apprentice and signed professional forms later in that season, being given his Fourth Division debut by manager Ian McNeill in April 1980, just prior to his 18th birthday. He went on to score 19 goals in 69 Fourth Division games for Wigan. After helping Wigan gain promotion to the Third Division in 1982, manager Larry Lloyd considered Quinn too inexperienced for the higher level of league football and was given a free transfer to Stockport County, who were still in the Fourth Division, and it was at Stockport where Quinn established himself as a regular goalscorer. Now having proven his worth, Quinn attracted the interest of manager Joe Royle at Second Division Oldham Athletic and joined the club for £53,000 in January 1984. Quinn was at Boundary Park for just over two years and proved himself as a competent goalscorer at the higher level of football. =Portsmouth= After scoring 34 goals in 80 Second Division games for Oldham, Quinn joined Portsmouth in March 1986, with manager Alan Ball paying £150,000 for Quinn's services in an attempt to push for promotion to the First Division, but Portsmouth just missed automatic promotion on the final day of the season – just as had happened the previous season. In April 1986, Quinn was found guilty of drink-driving and received a £100 fine, as well as a one- year driving ban for a similar offence committed in Liverpool during 1985. Quinn breached the driving ban twice later in 1986, and in January 1987 he was sentenced to 21 days in prison but was freed after serving 14 days. At the end of Portsmouth's home fixture against West Bromwich Albion on 25 October 1986, Quinn and teammate Paul Wood were both ejected from the ground by police officers after being overheard swearing at a linesman during the second half of the game. Chief Inspector David Hanna of Hampshire Constabulary said they would have been ejected at half-time if the incident had happened in the first half. Despite this, Quinn was Portsmouth's top goalscorer with 24 goals in all competitions, as they finished Second Division runners-up and reclaimed their First Division place that they had last held in the late 1950s. However, Portsmouth were relegated back to the Second Division after just one year, with Quinn scoring 11 goals that season. Weighing in at around , Quinn's goals were celebrated by Portsmouth fans with the song \\"He's fat, he's round, he's worth a million pound, Micky Quinn, Micky Quinn!\\" In August 1987, Quinn was fined £5000 by The Football Association for declaring that he was \\"the hardest man in football.\\" Quinn stayed at Fratton Park for the 1988–89 season and scored 20 league goals but Portsmouth finished 20th in the league and their good early season form was perhaps all that saved them from a second successive relegation. Midway through the season, manager Alan Ball departed Fratton Park and was succeeded by John Gregory. This transition was largely blamed for Portsmouth's slump in form. Gregory did appoint Quinn as the new first-team captain and when his contract expired at the end of the season Quinn was offered a new deal but rejected the offer and put in a transfer request, hoping for a transfer to a First Division club. =Newcastle United= Newcastle United manager Jim Smith paid £680,000 for Quinn in July 1989, just after their relegation to the Second Division. Portsmouth manager John Gregory had demanded £1.5 million for Quinn (an exceptionally large sum for a Second Division player at the time), but Smith had offered just £250,000 and the fee was set by a tribunal. At the time, Quinn was one of the most expensive players ever to be signed by the Magpies. Other clubs that were interested in signing Quinn at the time included Watford and Manchester City, who had just been promoted to the First Division. Quinn scored four goals on his debut in a 5–2 home win over Leeds United on 19 August 1989 and finished as the Football League's top goalscorer for the 1989–90 season with 34 league goals. Quinn managed 39 goals in all competitions that season. The Magpies were beaten to one of the automatic promotion places by Leeds United and Sheffield United and their promotion hopes were ended when they lost to local rivals Sunderland in the play-offs. Quinn scored 20 goals for the Magpies the following season but the club's league form slumped and they finished down in tenth position. Before the season ended Quinn and his teammates had a new manager after Jim Smith resigned and was succeeded by Ossie Ardiles. Quinn was ruled out of action for three months in October 1991, after he suffered a knee injury and managed just 7 goals in 22 matches. The 1991–92 season was arguably the worst season in Newcastle United's history as they only narrowly avoided relegation to the third tier of the English league. Ardiles was sacked on 5 February 1992 and was succeeded by Kevin Keegan but Quinn fell out with Keegan soon afterwards over newspaper speculation that Quinn had condemned the set-up as a \\"shambles\\"., serialised in The Sunday People: When the 1992–93 season started, Quinn was no longer a first-choice player on Tyneside and on 20 November 1992 was sold to Coventry City, whose manager Bobby Gould paid £250,000 for his services, after a bid from Aston Villa who were in the Premier League title race at the time was rejected by the North East England club. At the age of 30, Quinn would be playing in the top division of English football for only the second season in his career. =Coventry City= During his first six months at Highfield Road, Quinn scored 17 Premier League goals, 10 of which were in his first six games. Scoring in his first four games gives him the distinction of being one of only seven players to achieve this accolade and this would not be matched in the Premier League for 22 years. His 13 goal involvements in his first 10 matches is also a Premier League record, and was not matched until Bruno Fernandes in 2020. Quinn's run of goals included two goals each against Manchester City, Southampton, Liverpool and Aston Villa. Quinn's performances were not enough to take Coventry City beyond 15th place in the final league table, although they had occupied fourth place at one stage during the season. The club improved to 11th place the following season with Quinn scoring eight league goals, starting the 1993–94 season with a hat-trick versus Arsenal in a 3–0 away win at Highbury – the first game to be played at a remodelled all-seater Arsenal stadium. Quinn had been seriously considered for inclusion into the England squad in early 1993, at a time when Alan Shearer and David Platt were both unavailable due to injury but the international call-up from Graham Taylor never occurred. Quinn had already been approached by Jack Charlton with a view to playing for the Republic of Ireland but was not able to do so as his closest Irish-born relative was a great-grandfather and any player representing the Republic of Ireland would need at least one Irish-born grandparent. He was also eligible to play for the Italian national side due to having an Italian-born grandfather. However, Quinn was dropped just three games into the 1994–95 season after falling out with the club's manager Phil Neal, following his dismissal versus Blackburn Rovers in the third game of the season and soon afterwards, Quinn was pushed further down the pecking order by the arrival of £2 million rated striker Dion Dublin, who had arrived from Manchester United. He then handed in a transfer request. =Later career= Quinn then had unproductive loan spells with Plymouth Argyle, in November 1994 Micky Quinn Greens on Screen. Retrieved 5 February 2010. and Watford, in March 1995 before newly appointed manager Ron Atkinson released him on 1 May 1995, the day before his 33rd birthday. After leaving Coventry City, Quinn had a brief spell playing in Greece with PAOK Thessaloniki. Shortly after signing for PAOK, his younger brother Sean died at the age of 25, and his mother died of cancer the following year. Quinn left the Greek club in February 1996 and decided to retire from playing professionally. Personal life Quinn appeared on the BBC's Football Focus as part of their Cult Heroes series in 2005, inspired by his relatively prolific two seasons at Highfield Road. When at Coventry City, Quinn was nicknamed 'Sumo' and famously quoted that he was the Premier League's \\"fastest player over a yard\\". Quinn attracted the crowd chant of \\"Who Ate All the Pies?\\" due to his physique, which he used as the title of his 2003 autobiography. During his early days at Coventry, when he was in good goalscoring form, the affectionate chant \\"he's fat, he's round; he scores on every ground\\" was sung by fans. Other nicknames included \\"Sumo\\", \\"Hippofatamus\\", and \\"Bob\\", the latter from football fans who claimed that he bore a physical resemblance to the television presenter Bob Carolgees. Another nickname was the Mighty Quinn, another reference to his physique, from the song covered by Manfred Mann in 1967, although written by Bob Dylan. Quinn applied for the manager's job at Burnley in 1996 but it went to Adrian Heath instead and he then decided to retire from football and concentrate on his career as a racehorse trainer. Quinn now has stables at Newmarket in Suffolk. Quinn also covers horse racing and football on the radio station TalkSPORT.

The student group that produces it is also called the Critical Review. The reviews are written by Brown students from course evaluation questionnaires distributed to class members in the final days of the academic semester. Its purpose is to help students make informed course choices and to help instructors improve pedagogical techniques by supplementing the information in The Brown Course Announcement with real student experiences. History =The first decade: format and process= In 1976, just seven years after Brown's \\"New Curriculum\\" had been announced, The Other View: A Consumer's Guide to Courses at Brown was started by a group of Brown undergraduates as a publication of the Undergraduate Council of Students. In this annual magazine, students wrote reviews of courses based on responses to both the organization's own questionnaires and also based on departmental questionnaires which were made available by several departments. The written evaluations were short, and the numerical ratings sections, when presented, consisted of only averages. Department Undergraduate Groups were essential to the process because they distributed and collected questionnaires from classes and helped to develop customized questionnaires for their respective departments. There was no set process for putting the magazine together, and since the questionnaires were different for different classes, the course summaries varied significantly in terms of what information they presented and emphasized. \\"There must be a better way than having three people slave over questionnaires in the UCS office for two summer months,\\" wrote the editors on the cover page of one of the first editions, \\"A more rational, uniform process must be developed.\\" Sometime between 1978 and 1981, the name was changed to The Critical Review: A Consumer's Guide to Courses at Brown, and then to simply The Critical Review a few years later. The number of courses reviewed in each edition varied considerably from year to year. The editors changed the procedure for compiling the magazine annually. Co-Editors- in-Chief Tom Mashberg '82 and Ian Maxtone-Graham '82.5 led one such overhaul. In 1984, recently appointed Editor-in-Chief Rob Markey sought feedback from students and faculty and then overhauled the system in time to create a 1985–1986 Semester I edition, the first issue of the Critical Review to cover a single semester. The editors introduced the now standard two-reviews-per- page format, with bar graphs, which were meant to depict the general distribution of student responses. The bar graphs were implemented in order to improve the accountability of the Critical Review by balancing the written summaries with objective data from the student surveys and by presenting sample sizes, so that professors would know the reviews were not based on the comments of just one or two students. The editors also created customized software to make it easy to produce the bar graphs. They developed a matching questionnaire to generate the student input on the courses in quantitative form. However, at this point the Critical Review still relied on professors to distribute its questionnaires, which some refused to do or did haphazardly. The publication also accepted departmental evaluation forms as an alternative to its own questionnaire. As a result, bar graphs were not available for many classes. Nevertheless, having found a satisfactory and manageable system to which Brown students and faculty responded favorably, subsequent editors changed relatively little about the format, process, and policy of the Critical Review over the next few years. =The early 1990s: refinements= Mark Popofsky became Editor-in-Chief in 1989 and developed the bar graph system that the Critical Review still uses today. He established new policy for the organization which created lasting precedent: \\"Because we solely represent student opinion, the Critical Review no longer prints any department-sponsored articles and cannot use departmental evaluations.\\" The editors rewrote the questionnaire and developed new procedure that reduced the time required for the production cycle. As Popofsky wrote, \\"This issue marks the culmination of what has been a personal crusade of mine for the past year: to publish the Critical Review in time for preregistration.\\" Later editors said that he inspired them to make every effort to turn the Critical Review into a more professional-looking book. In 1991 the Critical Review began to publish \\"Insights from Student Surveys,\\" which quickly evolved into a regular feature called \\"Funny Quotes.\\" The level of faculty participation gradually rose from the 1980s to the early 1990s. The Critical Review began using an instructor questionnaire as well in 1992, \\"in order to gain the perspective of the faculty.\\" A few semesters after switching publishers to the company TCI Press in order to print higher quality magazines, the number of courses reviewed reached a peak of 425 in the 1993–1994 Semester I edition. The Critical Review began using the program Adobe PageMaker to compose its page layouts at this time, which further improved upon the look of the book. Despite the efforts and hard work of the editors, the editions of the Critical Review that were published at this time were not flawless. The accelerated production cycle, combined with limited computing resources available to editors, resulted in a few editions of the magazine that contained significant errors. Some instructors stopped participating in the Critical Review because they saw it as unprofessional or sloppy. The gradual upward trend in the number of courses reviewed per semester came to a halt, and the number of reviews per semester gradually decreased until 1998, at which point it flat lined at about 280 reviews per edition. =New questionnaire, new purpose= Christopher Anderson joined the Critical Review around 1993 and rapidly rose through its ranks as the computer consultant. He systematized many aspects of the production process when computing assistance was urgently needed and editors before him and after him identified him as a tremendous help. As editor-in-chief in 1995, he worked with faculty and Critical Review staff to perform a comprehensive analysis and revision of the organization's questionnaires. Despite all the help with the computer aspects that he offered over the years, he identified his new questionnaire as his greatest contribution to the Critical Review. Rebecca More, Professor of history at Brown and Director of the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning, was one of the faculty members who worked with Anderson on this project. \\"Many of the questions still in use today on the form date from that effort,\\" she says. \\"Our collective goal at that time was to develop questions which would be constructive and help faculty improve their teaching and student learning.\\" Chris Anderson envisioned the Critical Review as more than just a resource for students. He saw it as a constructive feedback service for faculty as well, and worked toward that end by organizing a \\"teaching forum\\" for faculty in the spring of 1995. Unfortunately, the frequency with which the Critical Review published errors at this time, to some extent due to understaffing, prevented many instructors from taking a renewed interest. Nevertheless, Anderson's new questionnaire was used from 1996 to 2001, at which point it was further modified with the help of faculty. =Web site and budget cuts= Even as early as 1993, the editors of the Critical Review recognized that the organization should eventually establish a web-based resource. As they wrote, \\"The goal of putting together an on-line CR connected to the Brown On-line Course Announcement (BOCA) should be discussed.\\" In 1997, the organization finally achieved that goal, thanks to its first website architect, David Tom '98. There was only marginal interest in the Critical Review's website during its first year of existence, however, as printed copies were still available for all undergraduates. Just as the website was constructed, the Undergraduate Finance Board decided to slice the Critical Review's annual budget from $25,890 to $11,490, the largest budget cut for any single student group that year. Facing a funding decrease themselves of more than $100,000 because of their reliance on diminishing holding funds, UFB deliberately targeted the Critical Review in order to eliminate its printed form. The Critical Review editors were devastated by this decision. Evan Snyder '00 served as editor-in-chief for the next edition, and he outlined his case for the importance of a printed form of the Critical Review in it. He argued that with just an online format, the Critical Review would not be able to attract as many writers, students and faculty would have more limited access to it, readers would no longer be able to browse it leisurely, and thus it would be \\"virtually impossible\\" for readers to discover great courses inadvertently. He added, \\"In our hyper-frantic rush to produce this book from scratch in a three-week period, the last thing we wanted to be doing was fighting for our existence. And yet this is precisely what circumstances dictate we do.\\" The editors said that faculty would probably have to pay for their own copies from then on, and that they would no longer be able to produce enough copies for every undergraduate. The Undergraduate Finance Board eventually returned most of the funding that it had taken away. After Evan Snyder graduated in 2000, however, UFB cut the Critical Review's printing budget again, and made the cut effective immediately. With the reduced budget, the circulation of the next edition was 2500 copies, down from 5500 copies three years earlier. In this edition, the editors again presented their argument for the importance of printed copies. \\"We asked each student who filled out a [questionnaire] to tell us whether she believed that the hard copy of The Critical Review should continue to exist, and the reply was 'yes' in overwhelming numbers [...]. But sadly, this view has not been that of those with the most financial control over the publication.\\" =Raising standards= Interest in the organization rose after 2001, as the number of courses reviewed per semester gradually increased. The number of Critical Review staff members nearly tripled from 2001 to 2004, to the point that for the first time in its history, the Critical Review was able to introduce an application process to become a writer. The organization's website also underwent major revisions from 2002 to 2004, and at the beginning of the spring 2005 semester, thousands of students visited it each day. Students and instructors from other universities, including UC Berkeley, Boston University, Clark University, and the University of Rhode Island, began to contact the Critical Review for advice about how to set up equivalent services at their respective schools. In a 2004 independent study to examine ways that the organization and service could be improved, co-Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Schade '05 studied available research on student ratings of instruction and sought suggestions from survey methodology experts. He also contacted Critical Review alumni, interviewed several Brown professors, and surveyed hundreds of students to compile a \\"Report on the Critical Review.\\" Among other things, this document brought to light concerns about the overall goals of the organization, institutional memory, faculty and student perceptions, and persistent internal difficulties. Partly in response to these issues, the editors hosted a \\"Faculty Forum\\" in December 2004 to seek suggestions and feedback from instructors about Critical Review policy and the questionnaires themselves. Some professors who had not participated in the Critical Review for years began to participate again. The editors formally rejected the perception that the publication is a service to only the student body by ratifying a group constitution in February 2005, outlining the objectives of the organization with regard to serving both students and faculty of Brown in a professional manner. Schade supplemented his report with other documents to produce a Critical Review \\"Chief Editor's Resource\\" in April 2005 so that these records could be further augmented, edited, and passed on to future editorial teams. Meanwhile, funding remained a major concern as the editors tried repeatedly to convince the Undergraduate Finance Board that the Critical Review must remain in print form. There were some gains, but after 2002, the Critical Review's budget increased only marginally. In 2007, despite the efforts of Editors-in-Chief Ariana Cannavo '08 and Dara Steinberg '09, UFB eliminated the entire printing budget, instructing the Critical Review to be a web-only publication. Since 2007, the organization has published course evaluations on its web page only. Staffing The names of the positions within the Critical Review have changed over the years, but since at least 1994, the overall structure of the staffing and hierarchy within the group have not varied significantly. All phases of the production are handled by student volunteers. The tabulation and writing of the review capsules is performed by a team of Writers. Those who demonstrate strong commitment to the group and whose work is of high quality may be promoted to the position of Editor. In addition to assisting groups of Writers, Editors also handle all final editing of the reviews and create the actual page layouts that are combined and sent to the publisher to form the magazine. One or more Editors-in-Chief oversee the whole writing and publication process. Alums *Thomas J.

He was ranked U.S. No. 5 in singles in 1899, 1900, 1903 and 1904. Tennis career In 1903, he reached the doubles final with L. Harry Waidner at the U.S. National Championships (now known as the U.S. Open) which they lost to the English brothers Reginald and Laurence Doherty in three close sets, 11–9, 12–10, 6–4. The following year, 1904, Collins again reached the doubles finals, this time partnered with Raymond Little and lost in five sets to Holcombe Ward and Beals Wright. In singles, he reached the semifinals twice, in 1899 and 1905, and the quarterfinals in 1902. At the tournament now known at the Cincinnati Masters, the oldest tournament in the U.S. played in its original city, Collins won the singles title in 1903 and reached singles finals in 1901, 1902 and 1905. He also was a doubles finalist in 1901 and 1903 (both times with L. Harry Waidner), and a mixed doubles finalist in 1901 (with Carrie Neely). He also won eight singles titles and four doubles titles at the Western Tennis Championship. Collins has been inducted into the USTA/Midwest Hall of Fame. Personal life He married Ruth Howells Coffin in 1898. In 1906, he went with the United States Davis Cup team to England, but did not compete due to trouble with his eyesight. By the next year, his poor eyesight had forced him completely out of competitive tennis. Collins died on 16 November 1909, after being struck by an electric street car in Chicago.

The NX was, loosely, an evolution of the Nissan Pulsar NX/Nissan EXA sold from 1987–1990 and the Nissan Sunny Coupe lines of the 1970s and 1980s, merging the Nissan B13 and N14 lineages. The NX was released in Japan in 1990. Models =NX1600/NX2000 (North America)= The NX1600 was based on the standard 1.6-litre Sentra (engine code GA16DE), and the NX2000 was based on the 2.0 L SE-R model (engine code SR20DE). Most models were fitted with T-Tops, whilst the remainder were hardtops. Constructed in Japan, it was sold from 1991–1993 in the US (mainly competing with the Mazda MX-3, Isuzu Piazza, Toyota MR2, and Honda Civic Del Sol). It was produced for a few more years for other countries. Its body was designed at NDI (Nissan Design International) in San Diego under the direction of NDI President Jerry Hirshberg, Blue Studio Chief Designer Allan Flowers, and staff designers Bruce Campbell and Doug Wilson. The NX2000 model included some mechanical improvements over its SE-R sibling in the form of larger brakes and more aggressive tires on wider 6\\" wheels (195/55VR-14 with 14x6\\" wheels vs. the 185/60HR-14 with 14x5.5\\" wheels and tires in the SE-R). The NX2000 brakes are a common aftermarket upgrade for B13 Sentra SE-Rs. The NX2000 also had a center armrest, a larger two-core radiator, and slightly lower ride height compared to the SE-R. However, the T-top roof in the NX2000 along with the mechanical upgrades made it slightly heavier than the SE-R. The NX2000, with its light weight, stiff chassis, and limited-slip differential, was considered one of the best-handling front- wheel-drive cars of the time. In 1992, Road & Track magazine included the NX2000 in a test of the world's best-handling cars against such competition as the Acura NSX, Porsche 911, Nissan 300ZX, Mazda Miata, and Lotus Elan. =100NX (Europe)= Rear view of a Nissan 100NX 2.0 16V T-bar (Germany) The 100NX came with two engine options, a 1.6 L and a 2.0 L. The 1.6 liter, made from 1990 to February 1993 had a carburetor fitted which tended to consume excessive fuel as it aged. From April 1993 to 1996, the 100NX was sold with a more efficient fuel injected setup. In November 1993 a version called the SR appeared. This stands for \\"Steel Roof\\" as this slightly sportier model was lighter and more rigid. The SR's engine produced somewhat more power than the regular GA16DS thanks to a modified control unit and an enlarged intake manifold. The gearing was also shorter than for the regular 1.6. *1.6 with ECU carbureted — *1.6 Non ECU carbureted — *1.6 fuel injected — *1.6 fuel injected — SR model *2.0 fuel injected — North American version *2.0 fuel injected — The 1.6 liter fuel injected version achieved in 10.5 seconds and had a top speed of . The 100NX was mainly sold with a T-bar removable roof in Europe although this does vary from country to country. Specialised Badged Editions sold only in 1995 include the \\"Pacific\\" in Ireland and the United Kingdom and the \\"Sail\\" in the Netherlands. Features vary from country to country, such features include heated seats, electric windows, other differences although rarer include cup holders, umbrella holder embedded in the driver's side B-pillar, and headlight wipers. =100NX (UK)= The Nissan 100NX was initially introduced in the UK in April 1991 as part of the Nissan Pulsar range replacing the Nissan Sunny 1.6 GSX Coupe. At this time Nissan UK, the British importer were in a heated dispute with Nissan Motor Corporation over profit margins. In an attempt to deliberately shrink market share Nissan UK launched the entire Pulsar range with no promotion as well as only providing a limited colour range and pricing all models well above their position in the market. At launch the 100NX was only available with the 1.6L 95 PS carburetor engine, and in a basic specification, priced at £14,585, the same price as a 2.0 L Toyota MR2 and £1,000 more than the 2.0L Honda Prelude. T-bar roof and automatic transmission were optional. In January 1992 Nissan Motor Corporation set up their own importer (Nissan Motor (GB) LTD) and relaunched the entire Nissan Range, the 100NX now coming with alloy wheels, T-bar roof and front foglights as standard at a lower price of £11,817 and was available in a full range of colours. From February 1993 to 1996, the 100NX the carburetor engine was replaced by a more efficient fuel injected setup. *1.6 Non-ECU carbureted — *1.6 fuel injected — =NX Coupé (Japan)= The Nissan NX was also sold in the Japanese domestic market as the Nissan NX Coupé. Some models were fitted with T-Tops, whilst others were hardtop. The Japanese domestic NX Coupés came with either a 1.5 DOHC carburetted engine (GA15(DS)), a 1.6 DOHC EFI engine (GA16(DE)), a 1.8 DOHC EFI engine (SR18(DE)) or the rare 2.0 DOHC EFI engine (SR20DE). The model was available in automatic or manual transmission. The 1.5 DOHC models were all fitted with digital speedometers, whilst all other engine versions had the standard analogue gage. All Japanese domestic models were fitted with electric windows, air conditioning, power steering, electric mirrors and central locking which locked the doors automatically at 18 km/h whilst driving, and was exclusive to Nissan Cherry Store Japanese dealerships. =NX Coupé/NX-R (Australia)= Interior Nissan NX-R (B13) in Australia. The Nissan NX was also sold in the Australian market as the Nissan NX Coupé. A range topping model known as the NX-R included an added front lip with fog/driving lights, side skirts, lip rear spoiler, 14\\" Alloy Wheels (N14 SSS Pulsar), cruise control, leather steering wheel and gear knob, electric windows and ABS (Anti-lock Braking System). Both models were only ever offered with the powerful 105 kW/178Nm 2.0L naturally aspirated inline 4 cylinder engine (SR20DE). The NX also came with a choice between a smooth 4-speed automatic gearbox or a sporty 5-speed manual. Unfortunately, no LSD (Limited Slip Differential) was offered in Australia for the NX range. It has a claimed 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 8.2 secondshttps://www.autoevolution.com/cars/nissan-100-nx-1991.html#aeng_nissan-100-nx-1990-20-gti and with a combined fuel consumption figure of just 8.4L/100 km would be considered above average. Safety In Australia, the 1991-96 Nissan NX was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing \\"significantly worse than average\\" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash. Racing =Land speed records= ;2011: Reg Cook Motor Sport set a new Class G/ Pro world record land speed class record at Bonneville speed week of 279.24 km/h (174.525 mph), using a Nissan NX Coupe 1999 cc SR 20 Eng =North America= SCCA Showroom Stock B Soon after its import into the United States, the NX2000 was classified by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) into its Showroom Stock B category for the 1992 year, pitting it against such cars as Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo (defending SSB champion Gerald Alaimo and others), its B13 cousin the Nissan Sentra SE-R (David Daughtery and others), and the sole second-generation Toyota MR2 (driven by Dane Pitaressi). The NX2000 posted several National wins throughout the year, and garnered much attention from competitors. The 1992 SSB SCCA Runoffs championships saw two podium finishes for the NX2000, with the gold medal taken home by Mark Youngquist, followed by Ken Payson in a Mirage, then Greg Amy in his NX2000 taking home third place. The 1993 season proved it wasn't a fluke, as David Daughtery took home yet another SCCA Runoffs championship for the NX2000. However, by that time the 1993 MR-2 with its updated suspension and the much-improved S14 version of the Nissan 240SX came along; while the NX2000 continued to be campaigned nationally, and sporadically posted wins throughout subsequent racing seasons, it never again won a Runoffs championship (Tony Suever won in '94 with the MR-2, and the '95 and '96 SSB championships were won by Daughtery in the S14 240SXh.http://www.nissannews.com/site_library/events/nissan/motorsport/2002/sccachampions.doc) The car timed out for eligibility for SSB racing soon thereafter. SCCA Improved Touring The Nissan NX2000 and the Sentra SE-R were soon approved for SCCA's Improved Touring category. At the time of its initial classification - due primarily to their larger (2.0-liter) displacement - they were dropped into the ITS, or Sports, class. This pitted them against other larger-displacement, GT-class cars such as the Mazda RX-7 and BMW 325. The cars languished in ITS for several years; despite a few sporadic oddball wins in ITS (\\"Crazy Joe\\" DiMinno in his Sentra SE-R at Watkins Glen International in the rain in 2003) due to its very low chances of winning it garnered very little interest from competitors. Further, despite numerous requests from SCCA competitors it was never re-classified into a lower class (such as ITA, with the Acura Integra, Honda CRX Si, Saturn SC, etc.). In 2001, Kakashi Racing from Connecticut began to prepare both a Nissan NX2000 for former SSB driver Greg Amy and provide support for DiMinno in his Sentra (the NX of Greg Amy was the same chassis he used in the '92 Runoffs). At the same time they began an effort to convince SCCA that the car belonged in ITA. They coordinated efforts with Kirk Knestis to form a sub-group called \\"Improved Touring 2\\" to bring attention to the \\"orphaned\\" 2-liter front-wheel-drive cars languishing in ITS. In 2004 SCCA announced a complete re-vamp of the IT classification process, placing both Nissan B13 cars into ITA for the 2005 racing season. The end result was a 2006 American Road Race of Champions (ARRC) ITA win at Road Atlanta for Greg Amy and Kakashi Racing. Due to this success the car has again garnered a lot of attention from competitors, and a resurgence of entries for both the NX2000 and Sentra SE-R in Improved Touring is expected.

They released their debut album at a time when such music was gaining commercial success in the Christian music industry. In turn, their success fed the contemporary worship music genre, expanding its appeal. Since their debut, Sonicflood has sold almost two million albums, and produced top worship hits (often as covers) including \\"I Could Sing of Your Love Forever\\", \\"Resonate\\", \\"Cry Holy\\" and \\"Here I am to Worship\\". In the early years of their existence, the group earned two Dove awards and three further nominations, and one Grammy nomination. Additionally, their eponymous debut took Gold status, and spawned several No. 1 hits on Christian radio. History =As Zilch= The band originally formed in 1997 under the name, \\"Zilch\\". Zilch began as dc Talk's traveling band, forming into an independent act in 1997. The initial recording lineup was lead singer and guitarist Mark Lee Townsend, keyboardist Jason Halbert, bassist Otto \\"Sugar Bear\\" Price and drummer Rick May. Zilch released its first album, Platinum, in 1997 on Gotee Records but received little publicity. Platinum featured a modern rock sound with clear influences from 1960s pop music. One review cited the sound as being similar to that of All Star United, and another to Weezer plus pop and hip-hop influences. This release was not praise and worship music, which the band would soon become known for, but contained more standard fare, including songs on topics like friendship, complacency, and priorities. Overall, the band was characterized as not taking themselves seriously, for instance by including a cover of the Schoolhouse Rock! song \\"My Hero, Zero\\", and reflected in the band's name, which was taken from the song by the same name written by The Monkees. Likewise, the title of the album was a play on their own status as musicians. \\"We're appointing ourselves superstars with a 'Platinum' album...\\" Jason Halbert told one reporter, \\"That basically means Zilch!,\\" Their song \\"In The Sky\\" is an answer to two hits at the time, Joan Osborne \\"One of Us\\" and Dishwalla \\"Counting Blue Cars\\", opening with the line, \\"... she asked if God was just a slob like us, well maybe something there is lacking,\\" the second verse begins with, \\"Let me tell you all my thoughts on God, cause I just met with Him this morning...\\" In early 1998 Mark Lee Townsend stepped down from the role of lead singer and was replaced by then-independent artist Jeff Deyo. Zilch would play shows, sometimes ending them with a praise song such as \\"Lord, I Lift Your Name on High.\\" The band found that playing such music changed the nature of audience interaction with their performance, in positive ways. =Formation of Sonicflood= Their label took notice as well, and eventually suggested that the band consider recording a full-length praise and worship album. This idea was initially met with resistance from the band, which was already in the process of recording a second album under the title Millennium. Eventually, the band agreed to do a praise and worship as a one- off, with no intention of continuing beyond the single album. However, as the recording progressed, the band decided to commit to the project. Jeff Deyo characterized the band's name change as a sign of that commitment, saying that it was similar to the story of the conversion of Paul of Tarsus. Sonicflood began rotating personnel making changes that would heavily impact the future of the band. Otto Price played bass, co-produced, and shared some writing credits on the album, but not wanting to continue touring, dropped out of the core band. Price would eventually take the spot of vice president of A&R; at Word Records. Mark Lee Townsend did similarly, and was listed on Sonicflood as an additional musician. Already an industry veteran, he went on to produce albums for The OC Supertones and Relient K, among others. Additionally, he intended to release a second project under the name Zilch. However, despite occasional status updates throughout the first decade of the 2000s, that album is yet unreleased. Seven Day Jesus guitarist Dwayne Larring and drummer Aaron Blanton became members of the band, bringing their number to four. The original lineup, under which the album Sonicflood was recorded consisted of Deyo, Halbert, Blanton, and Larring. Heil, then the Big Tent Revival bass guitar player, took over on bass guitar in early 1999 and joined as a founding member before Sonicflood began touring, but did not appear on the album. =Sonicflood and Sonicpraise= Sonicflood released its debut album in February 1999. With this release, the band became one of many bands in the burgeoning genre of praise and worship music, joining Delirious?, Hillsong, Matt Redman, and others at a time when the genre was a fast-growing part of the Christian music industry. The album landed on Billboard charts including the Billboard 200, the top 10 Christian albums, and peaking at No. 2 on the Heatseekers Chart. The band would stay on the top 10 Christian album charts well into the year 2000 (for over 72 weeks), and becoming possibly the best known praise and worship band in America. The release had two No. 1 hits on Christian radio, \\"I Want to Know You\\" (written by Andy Park) and \\"I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever\\" (written by Martin Smith of Delirious?), and several lesser charting singles. The latter was probably their most well known song, and would gain an additional Dove nomination the following year, in the \\"Song of the Year\\" category. The band garnered three Dove Award nominations in 2000 and one win, for \\"Praise and Worship Album\\". In 1999 the band recorded a live album at the Flevo Festival but featuring content from other shows as well. Originally scheduled for a late 2000 release, changes in the band's structure would delay the album until 2001. . In the fall of 1999 the band toured with speaker Josh McDowell. The following Spring Sonicflood joined the \\"Love Liberty Disco Tour\\", headlined by the Newsboys. The band also recorded a track for the compilation album City on a Hill with Peter Furler as lead vocalist. This release would take a Dove award for \\"Special Event Album\\" in 2001, although by that time the band would bear no resemblance to the one which recorded it. Sonicflood dissolved throughout the year 2000, citing differences over the vision of the band. Issues that led to the band dissolving included whether the band should return to a more conventional musical strain or continue making praise and worship music and how the band should sound. These were complicated by the fact that the band had no true leadership; the original arrangement was equal ownership for each member. In a corporate fashion, this meant that each one had equal say in the direction of the band. By the fall of that year, all members except Heil had departed. Heil took the role of lead singer and began recruiting new members to fill the band's touring obligations and continue making praise and worship music. By spring 2001, Sonicflood had gone Gold and the legal complexities that surrounded the band's name and ownership had been resolved. Partial reprint: Sonicpraise, the live album recorded in 1999, was finally released. Similar to their eponymous album, it featured a mix of songs from that Sonicflood and new covers written by other praise artists. This album earned a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Gospel Rock Album\\", and the band was on Billboard charts once again. =Under Rick Heil= With Heil at the helm, the band recruited Tom Michael, Todd Shay and Brett Vargason, each of whom were members of the John Cox Band and David \\"Moose\\" Alan, who played keyboards for Big Tent Revival. The band switched record labels, leaving Gotee and partnering with newly formed INO Records. Heil began developing a praise and worship album, designing it similarly to the band's 1999 release, with a mix of covers and original songs. The result of these efforts became Resonate, released in the fall of 2001. Their 2003 release Cry Holy takes an acoustic rock sound, drawing comparisons to Chris Tomlin. Following the 2005 release of This Generation, the band toured internationally, recording their performances along the way. While in Muslim-dominated Turkey the band filmed a music video for their song \\"This Generation\\". Sonicflood toured with sponsorship by Compassion International in the Spring of 2006, and continued to tour in Europe in the Summer. These recordings were released as Glimpse: Live Recordings From Around The World in fall 2006. As support for Glimpse, the band embarked on a United States tour, with sponsorship from the Southern Baptist Convention's International Mission Board, and included missionaries as speakers. In 2007, the band appeared on Trinity Broadcasting Network's Praise the Lord to promote their appearance at an upcoming World Harvest Church-sponsored event. Bandleader Rick Heil appeared again the following year, in support of A Heart Like Yours, telling the story of his healing from Crohn's disease Heil contracted the disease at the age of 11, and was afflicted with it for 26 years. Heil's case was particularly bad and, he was told, incurable, leaving his only hope for cure in miracles. While Heil does not profess to have experienced a miracle per se, he does say that \\"Jesus is the great physician... the healer of the heart, the soul, the mind.\\" The band went on to record \\"A Heart Like Yours\\" in 2008 which has a rock and piano-dominated sound. Then, in 2009 recorded a Christmas album, \\"When Love First Cried.\\" In 2009, guitarist Phil Baquie received notice of his military unit's activation, and orders to deploy to Afghanistan in October as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Though not yet a United States citizen, Baquie is in the military reserve, which is a possible path to citizenship. Baquie's final album appearance was on their 2009 Christmas album, When Love First Cried.

It pushed the Russian First Army back across its entire front, eventually ejecting it from Germany. Further progress was hampered by the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army on the Germans' right flank.  Background  The Russian offensive in East Prussia had started well enough, with General Paul von Rennenkampf's First Army (Army of the Neman) forcing the Eighth Army westward from the border towards Königsberg. Meanwhile, the Russian Second Army invaded from the south, hoping to cut the Germans off in the area around the city but making slow progress against a single German army corps. However, during their advance Yakov Zhilinsky, Chief of Staff of the Imperial Russian Army, made a strategic mistake by separating two large Russian armies and urging them to move rapidly over a marginally trafficable terrain in response to the requests of the French for an early offensive. As a result, the armies approached in a poorly coordinated manner, being isolated from each other by terrain obstacles, and before the logistical base could be established, the troops were worn down by a rapid march and had to face fresh German troops.William R. Griffiths. The Great War. Square One Publishers, 2003. P. 48 The Germans developed a plan to rapidly move their forces to surround the Second Army as it moved northward over some particularly hilly terrain. The danger was that the First Army would turn to their aid, thereby flanking the German forces. However, the Russians broadcast their daily marching orders \\"in the clear\\" on the radio, and the Germans learned that the First Army was continuing to move away from the Second. Using railways in the area, the German forces maneuvered and eventually surrounded and destroyed the Second Army at the Battle of Tannenberg between 26 and 30 August 1914. As the battle unfolded and the danger to the Second Army became clear, the First Army finally responded by sending units to help. By the time the battle proper ended on 30 August the closest of Rennenkampf's units, his II Corps, was still over 45 miles (70 km) from the pocket. In order to get even this close, his units had to rush southward and were now spread out over a long line running southward from just east of Königsberg. An attack by the German Eighth Army from the west would flank the entire army. Of course, the Germans were also far away, but unlike the Russians, the Germans could easily close the distance using their rail network in the area. On 31 August, with Tannenberg lost, Zhilinsky ordered Rennenkampf to stand his ground in the event of a German attack. Realizing his forces were too spread out to be effective, he ordered a withdrawal to a line running from Königsberg's defensive works in the north to the Masurian Lakes near Angerburg (Węgorzewo, Poland) in the south, anchored on the Angrapa River. Bolstering his forces were the newly formed XXVI Corp, which he placed in front of Königsberg (a fortress on the Baltic Sea), moving his more experienced troops south into his main line. His forces also included two infantry divisions held in reserve. All in all, he appeared to be in an excellent position to await the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army, forming up to his south.  Battle  General staff of the German 8th Army during the battle. German efforts at mopping up the remains of the Second Army were essentially complete by 2 September and Hindenburg immediately started moving his units to meet the southern end of Rennenkampf's line. He was able to safely ignore the Russian right (in the north), which was in front of the extensive defensive works outside of Königsberg. Adding to his force were two newly arrived Corps from the Western Front, the Guards Reserve Corps and the XI Corps. Then, like Rennenkampf, Hindenburg fed his newest troops into the northern end of the line and planned an offensive against the south. But unlike Rennenkampf, Hindenburg had enough forces not only to cover the entire front in the Insterburg Gap but had additional forces left over. He sent his most capable units, the I Corps and XVII Corps, far to the south of the lines near the middle of the Lakes, and sent the 3rd Reserve Division even further south to Lyck, about 30 miles from the southern end of Rennenkampf's line. Hindenburg's southern divisions began their attack on 7 September, with the battle proper opening the next day. Throughout 8 September the German forces in the north hammered at the Russian forces facing them, forcing an orderly retreat eastward. In the south, however, things were going much worse. The German XVII Corps had met their counterpart, the Russian II Corps, but were at this point outnumbered. The Russian II Corps maneuvered well, and by the end of the day had gotten their left flank into position for a flanking attack on the Germans, potentially encircling them. However, all hope of a Russian victory vanished the following day when then the German I Corps arrived in support of the XVII; now the Russians were outflanked. Meanwhile, the 3rd Reserve Division had engaged the Russians' XXII Corps even further south, and after a fierce battle forced them to fall back southeastward; its commander wired Rennenkampf he had been attacked and defeated near Lyck, and could do nothing but withdraw. Rennenkampf ordered a counteroffensive in the north to buy time to reform his lines, managing to push the German XX Corps back a number of miles. However, the Germans did not stop to reform their lines but instead continued their advances in the south and north. This left the victorious Russian troops isolated but still able to retreat to new lines being set up in the east. Now the battle turned decisively in the Germans' favor. By 11 September the Russians had been pushed back to a line running from Insterburg to Angerburg in the north, with a huge flanking maneuver developing to the south. It was at this point that the threat of encirclement appeared possible. Rennenkampf ordered a general retreat toward the Russian border, which happened rapidly under the protection of a strong rear guard. It was this speed that enabled the retreating Russian troops to escape the trap Hindenburg had planned for them. The German commander had ordered his wings to quicken their march as much as possible, but a trivial accident—a rumor of a Russian counterattack—cost the Germans half a day's march, allowing the Russians to escape to the east. These reached Gumbinnen the next day, and Stallupönen on the 13th. The remains of the First Army retreated to the safety of their own border forts. Likewise, the Tenth Army was forced back into Russia. German casualties were about 40,000, Russian 100,000.  Outcome  This was a strategically significant victory for The Eighth Army, completely destroying the Second Army, mauling the First, and pushing back all Russian troops in that region beyond the pre-war borders. Meanwhile, new German corps (under von der Goltz) were able to use this movement to safely move into position to harass the scattered remains of the Second Army, while far to the southwest the new German Ninth was forming up. It would not be long before they were able to face the Russians in a position of numerical superiority. However, this advantage was bought at a cost: the newly arrived corps had been sent from the Western front and their absence would be felt in the upcoming Battle of the Marne. Much of the territory taken by the Germans would later be lost to a Russian counterattack during 25–28 September. Around the same time far south on the Eastern Front, Russian forces routed the Austro-Hungarian army. It took another year before the German and Austro-Hungarian forces were finally able to reverse the Russian advances, pushing them out of Galicia and then Russian Poland.

She created a series, \\"Archetypes of the Feminine,\\" that consisted of more than 400 mixed media paintings. She has created murals and facilitated the creation of murals, including the Hollywood Walk of Fame Doors Project and Judy Chicago's Pomona Envisions the Future. Her works have been shown on television programs and have been on display at two Trump buildings in Atlantic City.  Personal life and education  Susan Krieg was born and grew up in Fargo, North Dakota. Her interest in art began as young child when she enjoyed coloring books. Krieg gave birth to a son, Adam, when she was 18 years old. Four years later she attended two semesters at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, and then worked for a painting contractor where she performed foreman and secretarial duties. Her interests in murals began at this time. Krieg moved to Phoenix where she attended Arizona State University. Interested in psychology, particularly Carl Jung, she switched majors. She received her bachelor's degree from Ottawa University in 1988. She has lived in Phoenix, Ventura, California, Chicago, Minneapolis, the San Francisco - Oakland, Oregon, and Manhattan.  Career  = Mixed media works = After she obtained her degree, Krieg worked at Phoenix Art Group, a position she obtained when she had been looking for a job in psychology. She created decorative commercial art made by hand painted etching. She had an arrangement that allowed her to create her own work one day a week. Krieg created a series, \\"Archetypes of the Feminine,\\" that consisted of more than 400 mixed media paintings using found objects, gold leaf, fabrics, papers and drawing media. It was made in 2007 for the Buenaventura Art Association \\"Trash to Treasure\\" project. The objects she found for her works included glass, seashells, beads, wine labels, a mesh onion bag or other items. She created pieces with the intention of evoking feelings, as when a mother held her child, which made them relatable to other women. Krieg said the artwork, influenced by Jungian psychology, was made to explore \\"the unconscious form where we all relate to the same symbolism. If I express something that is part of my psychology, part of my humanness, and you related to it, that is what I am trying to do.\\" Her work was exhibited at the Ventura Visitors and Convention Bureau's Discovery Annex. The collage and acrylic painting, Benediction is the jacket cover for Writing in the Feminine in French and English Canada: A Question of Ethics. = Murals = She led artists for the 2002 Hollywood Walk of Fame Doors Project, in which 40 roll-up security doors on the Hollywood Walk of Fame were painted with celebrity images. Krieg created a mural, Home of the Peach, with acrylics. It depicted the harvest of peaches and a large monarch butterfly among peach trees. It is located on Chandler Boulevard in North Hollywood, California. A 10-by-16 foot mural, Futurama, was made at the historic North Hollywood Train Depot during the 2001 NoHo Theatre & Arts Festival with the aid of about 16 local artists. It was her vision of what the NoHo Art District's presence would be in the future. In 2008, she led the painting effort for Pomona Envisions the Future, a project initiated by Judy Chicago. In 2011 she created a mural at the library of the Orange County High School. It depicts communication among people from pre-historic cave drawings through to use the modern means of communication, including telephones and social media. She worked with about 70 students over 6 or 7 weeks to paint the mural using images chosen by the students. =Other= Susan Krieg has maintained a studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Description The Ghost of Christmas Past is the first of the three spirits (after the visitation by Jacob Marley, his former business partner) to haunt Ebenezer Scrooge. This angelic and caring spirit shows Scrooge scenes from his past that occurred on or around Christmas, in order to demonstrate to him the necessity of changing his ways, as well as to show the reader how Scrooge came to be a bitter, cold-hearted miser. According to Dickens' novella, the Ghost of Christmas Past appears to Scrooge as a white-robed, androgynous figure of indeterminate age. A blinding beam of light radiates from its head and it carries a cap like a candle extinguisher, which it tells Scrooge that his own passions made and forced the ghost to wear. The ghost is often portrayed as a woman in dramatic adaptations of the story:After appearing in Scrooge's house, the Ghost of Christmas Past takes his hand and flies with him over London. It first shows Scrooge his old boarding school, where he stayed alone, but for his books, while his schoolmates returned to their homes for the Christmas holidays. The spirit then shows Scrooge the day when his beloved younger sister Fan picked him up from the school after repeatedly asking their cold, unloving father to allow his return, as she joyfully claims that he has changed and is now kinder than he was. Next, the spirit shows Scrooge a Christmas Eve a few years later in which he enjoys a Christmas party hosted by his first boss, Mr. Fezziwig, a kind and loving man, who treated Scrooge like a son and was more compassionate to him than was his own father. The spirit also shows Scrooge the Christmas Eve when, as a handsome, young man, his beloved fiancée Belle ended their relationship upon realizing that he now cared more for money than he did for her. Scrooge did not ask Belle to end their engagement, but he did not fight to keep her. Finally, the spirit shows him how she married and found true happiness with another man. After this vision, Scrooge pleads with the spirit to show him no more, to which the spirit replies: Angered, Scrooge extinguishes the spirit with its cap and finds himself back in his bedroom, where he very quickly fell asleep.

He experimented with many forms, but is best known for his meticulous still lifes and portraits. He is also remembered as one of The Kardomah Gang, an informal group of young artists in Swansea that included the poets Dylan Thomas and Vernon Watkins, and the composer Daniel Jones. Early life Alfred George Janes was born on 30 June 1911, in the city centre of Swansea, South Wales, above his parents' fruit and flower shop in Castle Square. He attended the Bishop Gore School and then the Swansea School of Art and Crafts (now part of Swansea Metropolitan University). At the age of 16 he exhibited at the 1928 National Eisteddfod (held in Treorchy that year). Three years later, while he was still concentrating on still lifes and portraits, he was commissioned to paint a portrait of the mayor of Swansea, Arthur Lovell. In 1931 he painted a portrait of a 17-year-old Mervyn Levy, thought to have been the painting that won him a scholarship to study art at the Royal Academy Schools in London. At the Royal Academy Schools his drawing tutors included Tom Monnington, but he was also stimulated by the modernist works displayed in the commercial galleries of nearby Cork Street, and he did not complete his Academy course. While in London, he shared several flats in and around Chelsea with contemporaries; at first with William Scott, the Scots-Irish artist whom Janes met at the Royal Academy Schools. The Kardomah Gang In 1932 Janes became part of a group of bohemian Swansea friends that included poets Dylan Thomas, Charles Fisher, John Prichard and Vernon Watkins, composer Daniel Jones, artist Mervyn Levy and \\"Marxist scholar\\" Bert Trick. Collectively, they became known as The Kardomah Gang or The Kardomah Boys, named after the Kardomah Café, in Castle Street, Swansea, where they would meet. The Café stood opposite the offices of the South Wales Daily Post, to which Fisher and Thomas were apprenticed in 1930, after they had left school. Dylan Thomas (1934) National Museum of Wales collection Although Janes and Thomas had been to the same school, Janes was some three years older than Thomas so they didn't get to know each other until after their schooldays. They first met in 1932 through their mutual friend, the musician Daniel Jones. In 1934 Janes, Thomas and Levy shared a flat at 5 Redcliffe Street, Earls Court and subsequently at Coleherne Road, Earls Court. In a radio broadcast in the early 1950s Dylan Thomas described how they shared rooms while Janes was a student at the Royal Academy of Arts, described Janes's meticulous technique and stated that, \\"After many Academy awards, and several paintings hung in London galleries, he returned to Swansea to work and experiment, which were synonymous.\\" Janes created three portraits of Thomas. The first, painted in Coleherne Road in 1934, is oil on canvas, displaying Janes's technique at this period of cutting lines into the paint with his pen-knife, to provide relief and focus. When Janes decided in 1936 to return to Swansea, he left his accumulated works behind and most are now lost; but the portrait of Dylan Thomas and some other paintings and drawings had been acquired by Cedric Morris and Augustus John, to form part of an exhibition of Welsh artists held in Cardiff, and the portrait was purchased in 1935 by the National Museum Cardiff. Later Janes \\"...complicated the technique by marking a polygonal grid on to the board before painting the subject, and then retracing and incising it into the finished painting. In this way he was able to achieve a unique crystalline brilliance of image.\\" The second portrait of Thomas is held by Swansea University. Janes's last portrait of Thomas is pen and ink on paper, drawn around 1964, a decade after the poet's death; it forms part of the permanent collection of the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea. Janes also made portraits of Vernon Watkins the poet; James Henry Govier, the painter, etcher and engraver; William Grant Murray, the painter and head of Swansea School of Art and Crafts; and Gwilym Thomas, the ceramic artist. In 1936 Janes settled in Swansea again, and taught part-time at the Swansea School of Art and Crafts. At this period he painted a series of still lifes. As well as being a painter Janes was also an accomplished pianist, and like his friend Ceri Richards he saw parallels between the arts of painting and music. Wartime and after In World War II he was a soldier in the Pioneer Corps. In November 1940, while on leave, he married Mary Ross (1913–2006), who had been an amateur actress in the Swansea Little Theatre. He and Mary would have two children – a son and a daughter (Hilly, born 1954). Janes was posted to Egypt, where he worked for two and a half years in a prisoner-of-war camp. There he learnt Swahili and Italian, and made friendships with some of the Italian prisoners which he would maintain in after years. After the war Janes returned to Swansea and resumed his teaching at the Swansea School of Art and Crafts and his painting. At this period he made portraits of Vernon Watkins and Daniel Jones. In 1953 he and his wife settled at Nicholaston in Gower. In 1963 Janes moved to London, accepting a post at Croydon College of Art, and from then until his death he lived at Dulwich. Among the younger generation whom he encouraged were Bridget Riley and Bruce McLean. He died in London on 3 February 1999.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-alfred- janes-1068986.html He is buried in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church, Penrice, Gower. In 1999 the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea, held a retrospective exhibition of his work. In 2011, to mark the anniversary of his birth, an exhibition was held at Oriel Kooywood, Cardiff.

Career  = Campaign consultant = Murphy is one of the Republican Party's most successful political media consultants, leading campaign teams to victory in more than forty races, including multiple Senate and Gubernatorial victories in California, Michigan, Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Idaho, Washington state and New Jersey. He's directed multiple successful independent expenditure campaigns, including recent work for Sen Pat Toomey's victory In 2016. He's worked on Presidential campaigns including Bush '88, Bush '92 and McCain 2000. His unsuccessful campaigns include statewide efforts for Oliver North, Rick Lazio and Meg Whitman. = Political commentary = Murphy serves as a commentator on NBC's Meet the Press and political programs. Murphy wrote a column for TIME Magazine during the 2008 election cycle. In August 2012, National Journal named Murphy one of \\"Ten Republicans to follow on Twitter\\". In 2003, Murphy visited a Georgian museum dedicated to Josef Stalin and recounted his experience. On September 3, 2008, after a segment on NBC, Murphy was recorded, along with conservative commentator Peggy Noonan and then NBC reporter Chuck Todd, giving critical analysis about Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. All three were apparently unaware that their microphones were still live. In the captured audio, Murphy describes the pick of Palin as \\"cynical\\". Murphy had been publicly critical of the strategy of the Palin choice, saying her appeal was mostly limited to the Republican base. In 2013, Murphy was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. During the 2016 election, Murphy created and hosted the Radio Free GOP podcast, consistently rated as one of the most popular political podcasts on iTunes. In June, 2019, Murphy launched the \\"Hacks on Tap\\" podcast with David Axelrod, focusing on developments in the 2020 Election. Murphy is a strategic advisor to Republican Voters Against Trump, a project of Defending Democracy Together, launched in May 2020.https://rvat.org/about-us/ = Revolution Agency = In 1986, Murphy teamed with close friend Alex Castellanos to form Murphy & Castellanos. In 1989 he established MPGH, which he sold eleven years later to Interpublic. Murphy is currently senior partner at Revolution Agency, a political advertising, advocacy, public affairs and political consulting firm in Washington, D.C. At Revolution, Murphy advises a variety of Fortune 500 companies, hedge funds, interest groups, political action committees and trade associations. =Right to Rise PAC= In the 2016 election cycle Murphy served as chief strategist for Right to Rise, a PAC supporting Jeb Bush's U.S. presidential campaign. The PAC raised over 100 million dollars, a record in primary PAC fundraising. Murphy set the PAC's strategy based on the assumption that Trump's campaign would inevitably fail, and so the PAC would instead concentrate on defeating other GOP candidates, \\"candidates in our lane that we can overcome.\\" Right to Rise spent over $118 million over the course of the 2016 Republican Presidential primary. Despite this sum Jeb Bush only won a total of 4 Republican delegates and received a total 94,699 votes. A staggering $1,246.05 per vote. On February 20, 2016, after a series of disappointing results in the Republican primaries, Bush announced that he was suspending his campaign. At that point Right to Rise refunded more than 12 million dollars to its donors, the only candidate PAC in the 2016 to manage its funds in a way to make possible a major refund of unspent contributions. Murphy refused to endorse or vote for Donald Trump after the latter's nomination as the Republican Party's candidate for the U.S. presidency, citing Trump's racism as a prohibiting factor.https://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/mike-murphy-vi/  Personal life  Murphy is a Republican and lives with his wife Tiffany Daniel, a Democrat whom he married in 2011, in Hancock Park, California and who also works as a writer and producer in the entertainment industry. He has a daughter as well as a brother who lives in Georgia.

It was part of the campaign to liberate the Philippines during World War II. The battle was waged to complete the recapture of the southernmost portions of the archipelago from the Imperial Japanese Army. Background The campaign for Mindanao posed the greatest challenge for the liberating Allied forces, primarily for three reasons: the island's inhospitable geography; the extended Japanese defenses; and the strength and condition of the Japanese forces, which contained the significantly remaining concentration of combat troops in the Philippines. Like most of the Philippine Islands and other similar places the U.S. Army operated elsewhere in the Pacific, the geographical conditions of Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines, offered very little inspiration for soldiers who would have to fight there. It boasted a long and irregular coastline, and the topography was generally characterized as rugged and mountainous. Rain forests and numerous crocodile-infested rivers covered the terrain, the rest by either lake, swamp or grassland. These grassland regions—along with dense groves of abacá trees, a source of hemp fiber—offer the worst obstacles, limiting vision and sapping the strength of soldiers. The few roads in Mindanao further complicated the problem of movement. The generously named Highway 1 cut across the southern portion of the island, from just south of Parang on Illana Bay in the west to Digos on the Davao Gulf in the east and then north to Davao. The other, Sayre Highway the main north- south road, started at Kabacan, midway between Illana Bay and Davao Gulf, then ran north through the mountains of Bukidnon and Macajalar Bay (off Misamis Oriental Province) on the northern coast. The strongest of the Japanese defenses were concentrated around the Davao Gulf area, which was heavily mined to counter an amphibious landing, and in Davao City, the island's largest and most important city. Artillery and anti-aircraft batteries extensively ringed the coastal shoreline defenses. Believing that the Americans would ultimately attack from Davao Gulf and also anticipating that they would be eventually driven from the city, the Japanese also prepared defensive bunkers inland behind its perimeter where they could retire and regroup, with the intention of prolonging the campaign as much as possible. =Operation VICTOR V= On 10 March 1945, the U.S. Eighth Army—under Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger—was formally ordered by General Douglas MacArthur to clear the rest of Mindanao, with the start of Operation VICTOR V, with expectations that the campaign would take four months. Eichelberger had misgivings about the projected timetable. His Eighth Army staff came up with a more effective plan. Instead of the expected headlong frontal assault on the Japanese defenses, the plan called for securing a beachhead at Illana Bay in the undefended west, then driving eastward more than through jungles and mountains to strike from the rear. The objective, which called for achieving surprise and pressing forward quickly and aggressively by the invading forces, Eichelberger deemed, could unhinge the Japanese both physically and psychologically. The key to success involved the beachhead performance of the landing force and the ability of units to maintain the momentum of their attack, preempting Japanese reactions, and hopefully before the rainy season started, which would impede movement. Ground operations were assigned to X Corps, under Major General Franklin C. Sibert,Smith, R.R., 2005, Triumph in the Philippines, Honolulu: University Press of the Pacific, with Major General Roscoe B. Woodruff's 24th Infantry Division and Major General Clarence A. Martin's 31st Infantry Division as the principal combat units. Amphibious Task Group 78.2 (TG 78.2), under Rear Admiral Albert G. Noble, was tasked to carry the 24th Division and X Corps headquarters to the assault beaches near Malabang by 17 April to secure a forward airfield. Five days later, the 31st Division was expected to be in Parang, south, located near Highway 1, the route to Davao. Battle =Capture of Zamboanga and Sulu= On the same day Eichelberger's forces were ordered to invade Mindanao, remnants of Major General Jens A. Doe's 41st Infantry Division carried out Operation VICTOR IV, the seizure of Zamboanga, the large peninsula that extended to the southwest, concurrent with the recapture of Palawan, dubbed Operation VICTOR III. A sizable force—numbering about 8,900 men of Lt. Gen. Tokichi Hojo's 54th Japanese Independent Mixed Brigade (IMB)—had established strong defensive positions around Zamboanga City at the southern tip of the peninsula. The slow construction of the airfield at Palawan posed a problem for tactical air support augmenting the Zamboanga operation. With the seizure of a makeshift airstrip at Dipolog, about to the northeast of Zamboanga City, the Americans rapidly exploited the opportunity, airlifting two reinforced companies from the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Division to ensure control of the airstrip. Soon thereafter, Marine Aircraft Groups Zamboanga (MAGSZAM) under Col. Clayton C. Jerome was flying sorties off the airstrip to cover naval bombardment and landing preparations off Zamboanga City. After the bombing of the landing areas by the 13th Air Force and a three-day bombardment by the U.S. Navy, the 162nd and 163rd Infantry Regiments landed west of Zamboanga City at San Mateo. Japanese opposition to the landings were minimal, and the 41st Division troops quickly captured the city, which was decimated by the pre-invasion bombardments. The next day, 11 March, the Americans encountered strong resistance when they attacked Japanese positions in the hills overlooking the coastal plain. For two weeks, American infantry—ably supported by Marine aviation and naval gunfire—fought the Japanese along a front, in terrain so rugged that tanks could not be used, and in positions heavily fortified with deep earthen emplacements, barbed wire, minefields, and booby traps. On 23 March, after heavy fighting, the center of the Japanese line finally broke, and in the next three days, the 162nd Infantry continued eliminating resistance in the central sector. The 186th Infantry replaced the 163rd and continued the attack. The 54th Japanese IMB was forced to pull out a week later, harried by guerrilla units, retreating through the peninsula and into the jungle. After some time, mopping-up operations resulted in 220 Americans killed, compared to 6,400 Japanese dead. Alongside the Zamboanga operation, smaller units of the 41st Division invaded the Sulu Archipelago, a long stretch of islands reaching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to north Borneo. Rapidly taken in succession were Basilan, Malamaui, Tawi-Tawi, Sanga Sanga and Bangao. On 15 April, strong resistance at Jolo was encountered. Anchoring their stubborn defense around Mount Daho, some 3,750 Japanese troops held off the 163rd Infantry, supported by Filipino guerrillas. By 22 April, the Allies took the position after hard fighting and the rest of the Japanese troops fled and held out in the west for another two months. The 163rd suffered 35 dead and 125 wounded by mid-June 1945, while some 2,000 Japanese perished. =Siege of Malabang= As Rear Admiral Noble's TG 78.2 moved toward Illana Bay to prepare the landings at Parang, Colonel Wendell Fertig—commander of guerrilla forces in Mindanao—sent word that his guerrillas controlled Malabang and its airstrip. Starting on 5 April, Colonel Jerome's Marine aviators from Dipolog moved to the Malabang airstrip, and with targeting information from the guerrillas, proceeded to bomb the Japanese positions. By 11 April, the remaining Japanese forces fled toward Parang, and friendly forces were in complete control of Malabang. Sibert, Woodruff, and Noble realized they had the opportunity to speed up the initial penetration of central Mindanao and quickly changed their plans to take advantage of the new developments. The 24th Division would come ashore at Parang, much closer to Highway 1, thus speeding up the operation. =Push to central Mindanao= While the Parang landings proceeded on 17 April and the 24th Division quickly heading inland, the Eighth Army planners assumed correctly that the Japanese might destroy the bridges along Highway 1, and they decided to use the 533rd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, 3rd Engineer Special Brigade to exploit the Mindanao River. This waterway ran roughly parallel to Highway 1 and was navigable for . A small fleet of gunboats—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Amputs—sailed upriver and seized Kabacan and the junction of Highway 1 and Sayre Highway on 22 April. This startled the nearby Japanese garrisons, and they fled north and west. The Mindanao River became the main line of supply, as troops and rations were disgorged far upriver. On 22 April, the 31st Division waded ashore, with Marine Aircraft Group 24 arriving at Malabang to provide air support for Mindanao ground operations. With both divisions ashore and ahead of schedule, General Sibert ordered the 24th to continue its advance up Highway 1 to Digos, then seize Davao City. The 31st would follow to Kabacan and then attack north up Sayre Highway toward Macajalar Bay. Tactically, the Japanese blundered in allowing the Americans to seize the key road junction of Kabacan so easily; the 30th and 100th Japanese Divisions were hopelessly separated with the American advance, while allowing X Corps to build up momentum and ultimately lead to their destruction. That Japanese error was the direct result of the surprise achieved by Eichelberger's decision to land at Illana Bay. With General Woodruff's 24th Division moving so rapidly, the Americans were almost on top of the Japanese around Davao before General Morozumi learned too late that the western landing was, in fact, not a diversion. Upon reaching Digos on 27 April, the Americans quickly overwhelmed the defending Japanese, who were prepared only to repel an assault from the sea, not from their rear. The 24th Division immediately turned north and headed toward Davao City. =Fighting in Davao City= On 3 May 1945, the first combat elements of the 24th Division entered Davao City against less opposition than had been expected. The Japanese had contented themselves with destroying the city as best they could before withdrawing inland. While it took just 15 days, despite severe heat and humidity and constant rain, with an entire division travelling and seizing the last major Philippine city under Japanese control, the real battle for Mindanao had begun. Up to this point, X Corps had deliberately bypassed the main Japanese defenses, which they planned to turn to eliminate them. A chronicler for the 24th Division wrote: > The soldiers of the 24th Infantry, considered the post-Davao operations to > be the hardest, bitterest and, most exhausting battle of the ten island > campaigns. In addition to the tenacious defense put up by the Japanese, > another punishing aspect of the subsequent combat was the proliferous fields > of abaca.

For the next two months, > in such an environment, the 24th Division fought the Japanese. While the > infantry sought out the Japanese defenses, platoons and squads worked > through the abaca and surrounding jungle to seek out enemy bunkers and > spider holes. In this way, fighting progressed slowly, but the Americans were making headway. At Libby Airdrome and the village of Mintal, some west of Davao City, the 21st Infantry Regiment was attacked on three sides by a numerically stronger enemy. Individual acts of heroism often spelled the difference between victory and defeat in the desperate fighting. On 14 May, posthumous Medal of Honor awardee, Private First Class James Diamond of D Company fell mortally wounded as he was leading a patrol to evacuate more casualties when came under heavy attack. He drew enemy fire while sprinting to an abandoned machinegun and was caught in a hail of bullets, but his sacrifice enabled his patrol to reach safety. By 17 May, exhausted and bloodied, the 24th Division renewed its offensive, and this time, the 19th Infantry Regiment, supported by Fertig's guerrillas, blew open the Japanese eastern flanks before capturing the villages of Tacunan, Ula, Matina Biao, Magtuod and Mandug on 29 May. The Japanese 100th Division collapsed and retreated. But soon fighting erupted into pursuit and mopping-up operations against bypassed Japanese pockets, which later claimed the life of the 19th Infantry's commander, Colonel Thomas \\"Jock\\" Clifford Jr.Col. Mang Thomas Edgar \\"Jock\\" Chupainguine (Dateline: 1944 – Ref. Col. Thomas Edgar \\"Jock\\" Clifford) The fighting around the fringes of Davao City cost the 24th Infantry Division some 350 dead and 1,615 wounded, while the Japanese 100th Division suffered about 4,500 casualties. =The end of the Japanese resistance= Meanwhile, the 31st Division had forged ahead to the town of Kibawe on Highway 1, some away, since 27 April, with the 124th Infantry Regiment of Colonel Edward M.Cullen at point, where the first monsoon rains started creating havoc on the advance. Running into a Japanese battalion hurrying south, Lieutenant Colonel Robert M. Fowler's 2nd Battalion, with Battery B, 149th Field Artillery attached, engaged the Japanese with much needed artillery fire, killing at least 50 and sending the rest fleeing. On 3 May, the 31st Division reached Kibawe, against stiffening Japanese resistance. The town led to a supposed Japanese supply trail that twisted and turned south, until it reached the ocean shore village of Talomo in Davao City. The treacherous terrain proved equally dangerous to both sides as they struggled in the ensuing battle for the Talomo trail on 11 May. About 1,000 Japanese held the trail, but jungle rain forests, torrential rains and abysmal trail conditions were the real factors. Airdropped supplies to the isolated infantrymen were common as the trail was impassable to motor vehicles. By 30 June, the 167th Infantry managed to move only beyond the Pulangi river, even with the assistance of Filipino guerrillas. It lost 80 men and 180 wounded to the Japanese, who themselves suffered about 400 dead. On 6 May, the 124th Infantry Regiment continued to move up Sayre Highway without the Talomo trail reconnaissance operation in full swing, and in doing so, it moved into its toughest fight of the Mindanao campaign. A Japanese battalion, ordered by Morozumi to delay the 124th at Maramag some south to enable the regrouping of his 30th Division, did so with such ferocity, that it took six days for the 124th to reach Maramag. The battle area from Talomo to Maramag was later renamed Colgan Woods by the troops in remembrance of Captain Thomas A. Colgan, an Army chaplain who was killed during one of his repeated efforts to aid wounded soldiers in the line of fire. The battle was one of the many brutal struggles in the Pacific theater that never made any headlines. Firing from dugout positions, camouflaged spider holes with connecting tunnels, and virtually invisible pillboxes, the defending Japanese chose to die in place rather than retreat. Banzai charges struck the 124th, fighting without supporting artillery, first on 7 May and then on the night of 14 May. The latter ended in a rout, as American automatic weapons stopped the attackers, killing 73 Japanese, marking the end of the battle. In the fighting for Colgan Woods and Maramag, the 124th Infantry lost 60 men and 120 wounded from 6 to 12 May. The final stages of the battle for Mindanao culminated with the 155th Infantry Regiment of Colonel Monaks J. Mungkamar occupying Malaybalay on 21 May and taking control of the Sayre Highway, together with the 108th Infantry Regiment of Colonel Maurice D. Stratta after a stiff fight with the Japanese. Morozumi's 30th Division continued their retreat up the Agusan Valley, after a vicious encounter with the pursuing 31st Division on 5 June, where they eventually made it into the jungle. Farther south on Mindanao, smaller X Corps units seized Sarangani and Balut islands, situated off its southern tip, and on 12 July, the 1st Battalion, 24th Division's 21st Infantry arrived at the northwest shore of Sarangani Bay to reinforce a reconnaissance patrol, which located a strong Japanese force in the interior and proceeded to pursue the Japanese through the jungle. Japanese forces retreated into Klaja Karst in the municipality of Buayan (now General Santos City), where they made their last stand against mixed American forces and Filipino guerrillas that were operating in the area. Operations in these areas continued until mid-August, when American planes heavily bombed the land, resulting in large Japanese casualties. Some Japanese who have survived the bombings escaped to the forest, but were hunted down by the soldiers. The Japanese resistance in Mindanao was finally over. Aftermath While mopping up operations by small American units and Filipino guerrillas continued for some time, General Eichelberger announced the end of organized Japanese resistance. Throughout Mindanao, pockets of Japanese troops, protected by the impenetrable terrain of the island's unexplored jungle expanses, survived until the end of the war, when some 22,250 troops and 11,900 civilians emerged to surrender. That signalled the total liberation of the Philippines. Some 12,865 Japanese troops were killed, and another 8,235 appeared to have succumbed to starvation and disease. The Americans lost only 820 men and 2,880 wounded for the entire campaign. The seemingly low cost in battlefield casualties for the Americans in the Mindanao campaign stemmed, aside from the overall brilliance and skill of the Eighth Army planners and leaders, from increasing assistance by Filipino guerrillas, which in military terms, constituted a valuable \\"force multiplier\\" for the Eighth Army units. Before landings, guerrillas harassed Japanese units, provided valuable intelligence about enemy dispositions and the relative suitability of landing beaches. And after each landing, the Filipinos fought alongside the Americans and pursued the Japanese through the island's interior.

Kabuga was also allegedly heavily involved in the founding and bankrolling of RTLM, as well as Kangura magazine. In 1993, at an RTLM fundraising meeting organised by the MRND, Félicien Kabuga allegedly publicly defined the purpose of RTLM as the defence of Hutu Power.ICTR Case No. 99-52-T; The Prosecutor against Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Amended Indictment, pg. 19, 6.4; Tribunal Pénal International pour le Rwanda; International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda PDF 5-12-2003 During the ICTR's so-called \\"media trial\\", former RTLM presenter Georges Ruggiu named Kabuga as the \\"Chairman Director-general\\" of the station, with duties such as \\"presiding over RTLM\\" and \\"representing RTLM.\\"ICTR-99-52-T Prosecution Exhibit P 91B; \\"A DOCUMENT TITLED RTLM ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE RUGGIUS REPRESENTATION.PDF\\" From January 1993 to March 1994, a total of 500,000 machetes were imported into Rwanda, statistically one for every three adult Hutus in the country.

Indictment by ICTR On 29 August 1998, the prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Carla Del Ponte, indicted Kabuga. In the amended indictment dated 1 October 2004, prosecutor Hassan Jallow charged Kabuga with: * Conspiracy to commit genocide * Genocide, or alternatively * Complicity in genocide * Direct and public incitement to commit genocide * Extermination as a crime against humanity. Life as a fugitive In June 1994, as Rwanda was being conquered by the RPF, Kabuga fled the country. He first attempted to enter Switzerland, but was ordered to leave. He went to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and was later believed to be residing in Nairobi, Kenya. In September 1995, before any indictment and before he was named as a suspected planner of the genocide, Kabuga registered and ran a business named 'Nshikabem Agency' in Nairobi, operating out of the Kilimani area located along Nairobi’s Lenana Road. In 2003, a young Kenyan businessman helping agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to track down Mr Kabuga was murdered by a hit squad. In a speech given on 28 August 2006 during his visit to Kenya, then US Senator Barack Obama accused Kenya of \\"allowing him [Kabuga] to purchase safe haven.\\" The Kenyan government denied these allegations and described Obama's allegation regarding Kabuga as \\"an insult to the people of this country.\\"RESPONSE TO AMERICAN SENATOR BARACK OBAMA’S POORLY INFORMED COMMENTS ABOUT TERRORISM, WANTED GENOCIDE CRIMINALS AND GOVERNANCE IN KENYA Kenyan Office of Public Communications, 31 August 2006 According to June 2008 reports by a Norwegian-based blogger calling himself African Press International (API), Kabuga was in hiding in Oslo, and might be seeking to turn himself in. Authorities dismissed this claim as a hoax. The United States State Department offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to Kabuga's arrest. KTN news network in Kenya reported on 14 June 2008 that Kabuga had been arrested by Kenya Police the day before and was being held at Gigiri Police Station in Nairobi. Later, the suspect was found to be a local university lecturer, not Kabuga as previously thought, and released. It was earlier suspected that Kabuga resided in Kenya, and was believed to be running businesses and enjoying protection from either the Kenyan government or some influential figures within the country.

Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, 2008. Web. 7 Apr. 2016. <> In 1890 the park was renamed again in honor of Charles Morgridge Loring, who was the first president of the park board in Minneapolis. Loring Park was purchased by the Minnesota Public Parks board on April 28, 1883. The land was purchased for $150,000 and contained 30 acres of land. A few more pieces of land were added to the park for a total cost of $350,000. This was the first plot of land that was purchased by the Minnesota Public Parks board. Shortly after purchasing the land, the Minneapolis Public Parks board hired George Brakett and Horace Cleveland to design the park and to drain the bog in the lake. They used plants that were brought in from nearby woods to complete the design for the park. They also decided at this time to make the park pedestrian only. In 1906 the first permanent building in any Minneapolis park was constructed in Loring Park. The heated two-story shelter was donated by Charles Loring and was used as a warming house, recreation center and kindergarten. In 1960, the park renovated the shelter to be used as a space for senior programs. It was the first Minneapolis park to provide senior activities. Loring Park was the first park in Minnesota to have electric lights. The lights were installed in fall of 1884 to be used to illuminate the pond during winter skating season. In 1916 the local General Mills Company provided the park with 91 electric lights.White, Robert F. \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" . www.friendsofloringpark.org.

Early life Jack Cole, born John Ewing Richter, made his professional dance debut with Denishawn at Lewisohn Stadium in New York City in August 1930. Only months earlier, he had begun his training as a modern dancer, studying with Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn. Cole was entranced by the Asian influences Denishawn utilized in its choreography and costuming. Cole also performed briefly with Humphrey-Weidman, and was influenced by the pioneering modernists, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman,\\"Jack Cole biography\\" filmreference.com, retrieved April 6, 2010. Eager to make a living as a dancer during the Depression, Cole soon left the modern dance world and opted for opportunities in nightclubs, where he partnered, first, Alice Dudley, and then for years danced as part of a trio with Anna Austin and Florence Lessing. Cole's career trajectory was a unique one for an American dance artist. He started at the very roots of modern dance, then segued into a blazing commercial career in nightclubs across the nation, first at Manhattan's Embassy Club, then opening the Rainbow Room on its inaugural evening in October 1934. His career spanned three major arenas: nightclub, Broadway stage, and Hollywood film.

Based on the TR-77-580, the TR-85 tank was developed from 1978 to 1985 and produced from 1986 until 1990. A modernization program was initiated in March 1994 in order to upgrade the TR-85 tanks to NATO standards. The result was the TR-85M1 main battle tank, currently the most modern tank in service with the Romanian Land Forces. Although a further development of the T-55, the TR-85M1 uses a T-block powerpack (similar to the one used in the Leopard 1) based on a V8 German 830 hp diesel engine, an improved turret, a locally-designed \\"Ciclop\\" fire control system (with cross-wind sensor, laser rangefinder and night vision), new 100 mm BM-412 Sg APFSDS-T projectiles and a completely redesigned suspension with 6 road wheels on each side, protected by metal side skirts. Combat weight is 50 tons. Predecessor: TR-580 After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Communist Romania adopted a new national defense doctrine. However, this new doctrine required a self-sustainable local defense industry. In April 1968 a preliminary report regarding the production of tanks in Romania was proposed to the National Defense Council of Romania. The report was ratified by the Defense Council on 13 October 1972. The development of a Romanian medium tank effectively started on 13 May 1974. The Romanian Defense Council wrote the specifications for the medium tank. The new vehicle would have a weight of approximately 40 tons, a 100 mm main gun and a 500 horse power engine. The next step taken was the production of 400 TR-580/TR-77 tank and even if the local arms industry lacked the experience required to design and produce a medium tank from scratch the Communist government did not buy the license for the T-55 tank. The initial batch (the prototype and the first 10 tanks), officially known as the TR-77 tank (Tanc românesc model 1977 Romanian Tank model 1977), was intended to use the Leopard 1 engine and, as a result, the hull was extended, having 6 instead of the usual 5 road wheels of the T-55 tank. However, because of the political need to reach the established production figures and the refusal of Krauss-Maffei to deliver technology to a Warsaw Pact member, the medium tank, known as the TR-77-580 or TR-580 (Tanc Românesc model 1977 cu motor de 580 cp - Romanian Tank with 580 hp engine), was built using the V-55 engine of the T-55 tank and the extended chassis. The TR-77-580 tank was developed between 1974 and 1980 and was produced between 1979 and 1985. It is often alleged that TR-77 was a copy of T-55 but only a very small portion of its equipment were carried over from the Soviet tank: night vision gunner' s periscope, ammo, coax MG and probably the main guns sight, the general shape of the turret and temporary the engine. However, the interior layout was different. Development TR-85 tank in Bucharest during the Romanian Revolution of 1989. While the TR-77 was developed, from 1974 the Romanian engineers continued work on a reverse engineered version of the 800-horsepower MTU Leopard 1 engine and transmission. The work came to a halt, as the engineers lacked the experience to reverse engineer such complex designs. By 1976 however, Institutul Naţional de Motoare Termice (National institute for thermal motors) stated that it could design an engine based on the Leopard 1 diesel engine model using available technology and solutions. Also, the hydromechanic transmission was designed by the ICSITEM research institute from Bucharest based on an available model and produced by Hidromecanica Braşov factory, thus completing the T-block powerpack. The engine and transmission were designed between 1974 and 1982, using foreign technology. Ion Mihai Pacepa, a two-star Romanian Securitate general and the highest-ranking intelligence official ever to have defected from the former Eastern Bloc, later asserted in his book Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief that the engine technology was obtained using spy rings and confidential assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany.Ion Mihai Pacepa, Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief (1987), , p. 37 The new tank was officially known as the TR-85-800 (Tanc Românesc model 1985 cu motor de 800cp - Romanian Tank model 1985 with 800 hp engine) and was designed between 1978 and 1986. The engine had a maximum output of 830 horse power. The suspension was redesigned and the turret, while bearing a strong resemblance to the T-55 series, was actually different.S. Zaloga, p. 15 Production TR-85 tank without side skirts. National Military Museum in Bucharest. The main tank factory was established by decree nr.514 in December 1978 at FMGS division (Fabrica De Maşini Grele Speciale - Special Heavy Machinery Factory) of the 23 August plant (now known as FAUR) in Bucharest. The construction of this tank factory was finalized in 1980. The factory was a militarized zone and was top secret, requiring a special permit to enter. By 1983, the FMGS tank factory could produce 210 tanks per year. The TR-85 tank was produced between 1986 and 1990 at rate of approximately 100 tanks per year. The TR-85 tank was soon found to be mechanically unreliable during early tests. Teething problems included high fuel and oil consumption, engine and transmission problems and chronic oil leakage. Furthermore, the Ciclop fire control system was unreliable because of the poor quality of electronics. The laser rangefinder was not integrated with the daylight aiming system and only a limited number of corrections could be inserted in the ballistic fire-control computer. Problems were made worse when Nicolae Ceaușescu decided to cancel in July 1982 all imports of special equipment for the arms industry. At one point, Ceaușescu threatened to stop tank production altogether because of the poor manufacturing quality. The initial teething problems were not corrected until after the fall of communism in Romania when the Romanian engineers used foreign parts to improve TR-85's reliability. Modernization program In March 1994, the Romanian General Staff initiated the modernization program of the TR-85 tanks by order no. 1429. On 14 April 1994, the upgrade program was approved by the Supreme Council of National Defense and development of the new tank, officially designated TR-85M1 Bizonul (The Bison), started in 1996 when two prototypes were built. The aim of the program was to upgrade the TR-85 to NATO standards by improving the firepower, protection, mobility, the communication systems and the reliability of the engine, transmission and the braking system. The modernization program involved both foreign companies (most of them from France), such as Aerospatiale Matra, Sagem, Kollmorgen-Artus, Racal, and local defense companies such as the ROMARM military consortium, METRA (Military Equipment and Technologies Research Agency), Electromagnetica, FAUR, Elprof, Aeroteh, IOR, Prooptica, Artego, Arsenal Reşiţa, Metav, Forsev, Anticorozivul, IEMI, Rolast, Aerostar and IOEL. The result of the modernization program, the TR-85M1 tank, is compliant with NATO standards. Design The six smoke grenades and four flares on the side of the turret. =Countermeasures= Concealment The turret is fitted with two six-barreled 81mm smoke grenade launchers and two four-barreled flare launchers. The system can create a thick smoke that blocks both vision and thermal imaging. The tank is also equipped with a smoke screen generator that is triggered by the driver. When activated, diesel fuel is injected into the hot exhaust, creating the thick smoke. The TR-85M1 is equipped with laser illumination warning sensors that can automatically trigger the GFM-76 smoke grenades and flares, thus disrupting the guidance systems of thermal and infrared guided missiles. The SAILR (Sistem de Avertizare la Iluminarea Laser și Radar, laser and radar illumination warning system) laser warning receiver can locate and identify the threat, warning the crew and triggering the DLC (Dispozitivul de Lansare Contramăsuri, Countermeasures Launching Device). Armour TR-85M1 with its factory single green paint scheme. The armour of the TR-85M1 tank has a maximum thickness of 200 mm (multilayered) for the hull and 320 + 20 mm add-on armour on the turret. However, the armour is sloped and gives a total of 580mm or RHAe. The 20 mm add-on armour on the front of the turret has a modular appearance with a triangular profile. Although it might look like bricks of explosive reactive armour, the add-on composite armour is designed this way for easy replacement after combat damage. The tank also has side skirts as a protection against shaped charges. The metal side skirts have three holes each that form steps for the crew to reach the roof hatches. On the sides of the turret there are ammunition boxes for the heavy antiaircraft DShK machine gun. The upper glacis plate has two track segments, while the lower glacis plate can be fitted with steel screens or a mine roller. The TR-85M1 tank also has NBC protection and an improved, rapid fire suppression system using non-toxic agents. The system, designed by L'Hotellier, protects both the crew and the engine compartment using halon. The modernized version adds an additional mine protection plate and a bar for the driver, which increases protection against mines and improvised explosive devices. Also, the older TR-85 tanks have a conventional driver's seat bolted on the floor of the tank, wherereas the M1 version has a parachute-harness like arrangement. In this way, the driver does not have any contact with the hull except on the pedals and is out of the shockwave area of exploding land mines or IEDs.Tancul TR-85 M1, lt. col. Dragoș Anghelache, Revista Forțelor Terestre, nr.2/2011, pag. 90-91 , =Armament= Primary armament A TR-85M1 of the 631st Tank Battalion fires at a target during a military exercise. The main armament of the TR-85M1 is the 100 mm A308 rifled tank gun (an adaptation of the M1977 towed anti-tank gun made by Arsenal Reşiţa) that was also fitted to the TR-77 tanks. The TR-85M1 has a rate of fire of about 4-7 rounds per minute and can carry up to 41 projectiles inside the tank. The gun barrel is fitted with a bore evacuator and has a thermal sleeve. The TR-85 tanks use a manual loader. The modernized version has a number of improvements to increase the reliability of the gun. The hydraulic buffer was improved by replacing the rubber sealing and the electroerosion of the chrome layer from the hydraulic buffer and recuperator has been removed by changing the design and manufacturing process. The gun can fire APFSDS-T (BM-421 Sg), shaped charge (BK-412R and BK-5M), high explosive (OF-412), armour piercing with tracer (ballistic-capped BR-412B and BR-412D) and target practice (PBR-412 and PBR-421B) rounds. There was also an APFSDS round that is no longer in production. In order to increase the firepower of the TR-85 tank, the BM-421 Sg round (known internationally as the M309 cartridge) was developed in cooperation with Israel as part of the modernization program started in 1996. Made by Aeroteh SA from Bucharest and marketed by ROMARM SA, the BM-421 Sg projectile can penetrate 444 mm of RHAe at 90° at 500 meters, 425 mm at 1000 meters and 328 mm at 4000 meters. Secondary armament The 12.7 mm DShKM machine gun and the MATIS thermal camera (above the gun barrel) The TR-85M1 tank has two machine guns: #A 12.7×108mm DShKM heavy machine gun in a pintle mount on the loader's hatch ring. The DShK machine gun is made by UM Cugir and can be used as a light antiaircraft weapon. To fire and reload the weapon manually, the gunner has to partially expose himself to suppressive fire. #A 7.62×54mmR PKM machine gun (also made by UM Cugir as the armoured vehicle machine gun version of the md. 66 machine gun) in a coaxial mount to the right of the main gun. The coaxial MG is aimed and fired with the same computer fire control system (Ciclop) used for the main gun. Aiming The TR-85M1 is equipped with the local-made Ciclop-M (Cyclops-M, M stands for Modernized) ballistic fire-control computer, a third generation FCS and an improvement of the previous, second generation, Ciclop FCS (used on the TR-85 version and equipped with an Intel 8080 microprocessor, 1 ko of RAM and 12 ko of system memory). According to the manual of the Ciclop-M fire control system, the ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95% for a target under 2000 meters and greater than 75% for a target between 2000 and 3000 meters. Also, the Ciclop-M can be used to aim a target located at up to 6 km away with the OF-421 high explosive round, up to 5 km away for the BM-421 Sg APFSDS-T round, 4 km for the AP-T rounds and up to 3 km for the HEAT projectiles. The coaxial machine gun can be aimed at a maximum distance of 2 km using the FCS of the tank. The gun is electrically stabilized on two axes by the EADS computer aided stabilization system. The new stabilization system improves the accuracy of the main gun and reduces the target engagement time, turret temperature, noise, fire hazard and maintenance. The turret has RKS roller bearings to ensure a better stabilisation of the A308 gun. The gunner's day sight telescopic periscope features an integrated laser rangefinder (200 m to 5.000 m measurement distance) and an electronic reticle. Above the gun barrel there is a SAGEM MATIS passive thermal viewer designed to operate at wavelengths between 3 and 5 μm in the spectral band. Initially, the TR-85 M1 tanks had an inferior SAGEM ALIS passive thermal viewer (8-12 μm in the spectral band) for the gunner, now present in export configurations. The driver has an AONP-I passive night sight, which is also the standard night vision device for the gunner on the older TR-85 tanks. The commander has a SFIM (Société Française des Instruments de Mesure) EC2−55R panoramic sight with a second generation SAGEM image intensification system that can be independently directed to the target. =Mobility= A TR-85M1 without the side skirts. The original TR-85 was powered by the 830 horsepower 8VS-A2T2, 4 stroke, 8-cylinder, liquid- cooled, turbo charged direct injection diesel engine, and a six speed (four forward, two reverse) THM-5800 hydromechanic transmission (engaging under load, one power flow in straight run and two power flows in turns with planetary final transmission), giving it a governed top speed of 50 km/h on paved roads. The TR-85M1 has an improved version of the original engine. The new 8VS-A2T2M provides 860 horsepower and has a top road speed of 60 km/h. However, because the weight of the tank increased from 42 tons to 50 tons, the power-to-weight ratio has been reduced from 19.7 to 17.2 hp/tonne. The tank has a maximum road range of about 400 km and can be fitted with two optional 200-liter drum-type fuel tanks at the rear of the vehicle for an increased operational range. Like the T-54/55 series, the TR-85 has an unditching beam and a snorkel (to allow river crossings) mounted at the rear of the hull. To meet the power demands of the new equipment, a Kollmorgen generating set has been installed. The new power generation system provides 20 kW of stable voltage. The TR-85 tanks have a torsion bar suspension. The modernized version also has eight telescopic hydro-gas shock-absorbers to increase the overall speed. The running gear consists of six dual rubber-tyred road wheels and four return rollers per side, with the idler wheel at the front and drive sprocket at the rear. The first two road wheels have characteristic, prominent gaps between them and the rest of the road wheels. The tank has two bolt tracks with metal-rubber articulations. The M1 version has aluminum alloy road wheels. The braking system has been improved by replacing the old wet multi- disc brakes with dry multi-disc brakes and the old hydraulic system with a new servomechanism. =Interior= The TR-85 has a typical tank layout: driver's compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the center and engine compartment in the rear. The four-man crew consists of the commander, driver, gunner and loader. The driver's hatch is on the front left of the hull roof. The commander is seated on the left side of the turret, with the gunner to his front and the loader on the right. The TR-85 has a cramped crew compartment, a characteristic of the T-54/55 series. Although it has an extended chassis, the extra space is used by the larger engine. The TR-85M1 also has a turret bustle, but this does not alleviate the crew comfort because of the additional equipment of the modernized version. Although there are no height limits for tank recruits in the Romanian Army, the recommended maximum height is 1.68m as in practice anyone taller will have to sit in an uncomfortable position with limited physical movement. The communication system consists of HF and UHF transceivers with intelligent frequency hopping and encryption. The crew has an intercom with 4+1 stations.

The commander has a cupola with RWS. Five were built between 2007 and 2009. The TR-85 tank has been referred to in Western sources as the TM-800, M1978 or Model 1978 and TR-800. The Romanian Army currently uses only the TR-85 and TR-85M1 designations. However, the early prototypes of the TR-85M1 were known as the TR-85M or TR-85M1A. The add-on armour of these tanks had a different shape and was welded. Additionally, the turret bustle had a different shape and the bore evacuator had a different position. A TR-85M1A variant is currently on display at the National Military Museum in Bucharest. In 2002, a TR-85M1 tank was tested with a V12 Iveco 1200 hp engine, but did not enter production. The prototype was referred to as the TR-85M2 tank in some sources, however there is no proof that the Romanian Army ever used this designation. In 2007, when the DMT-85M1 was developed, there were also plans for other derivative vehicles based on the TR-85M1 chassis, including an armored recovery vehicle version and an armoured vehicle-launched bridge. These variants are currently in development.  Operators  * - The Romanian Land Forces operated 249 TR-85 and 54 TR-85M1 tanks in 2014, falling to 227 TR-85 and 54-TR85M1 tanks in 2017.

The city of Norwich lies approximately 30 km to the north. The village name originates from roughly 1704 when naturally occurring 'Wort' was found to spring from a well fed by a water source near to the local river Waveney. When the local brewer was satisfied with the beer brewed from the 'Wortwell' he would ring a bell to let the local residents know it was ready for drinking, which also gave the local drinking establishment its name, established as a pub in 1836. The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 574 in 243 households, the population decreasing to 561 at the 2011 census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of South Norfolk. The village of Wortwell is one of the few in Norfolk not to be listed in the Domesday Book. Until the end of the 19th century Wortwell was a hamlet within the parish of Mendham-in-Norfolk, (the modern village of Mendham is south of the River Waveney in Suffolk) becoming a parish in the 1885 boundary alterations. Ezekiel Blomfield (1778–1818), a Congregational minister, author and compiler of religious works and works on natural history, was buried on 21 July 1818 in the grounds of the Meeting House at Wortwell.

History Justin Orvis and Robert Wynn founded this railroad. They originally envisioned a 75-mile (120-kilometer) electric route throughout Lake and McHenry counties, but this was the only stretch developed. The route delivered freight and commuters to these communities, as well as vacationers to Dr. Wilson's Deer Grove Park picnic grounds (now Deer Grove Forest Preserve). The railroad had many problems due to secondhand equipment and the steep trestle built to cross the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern in Lake Zurich. The most famous engine on this route was nicknamed 'Old Maud' and was purchased from the Chicago and North Western Railway. Invitation to opening The railroad opened on 25 August 1912 and closed in 1924. Financial mismanagement, the improvement of local roads and the rise of the automobile helped bring down this route. Post closure Richard Whitney researched the railroad for 30 years and wrote the book Old Maud: The Story of the Palatine, Lake Zurich & Wauconda Railroad, published by Transportation Trails in 1992. In the Spring of 2014 in the railroad magazine \\"First and Fastest\\", William R. Coulson wrote an article entitled \\"No Good Deeds Go Unpunished: The Sad Story of the Waukegan, Rockford & Elgin Traction Company\\", \\"First and Fastest\\", Spring 2014, PP. 52–64; which reports on the discovery in a Waukegan basement of the 100-year-old original land deeds for the railroad's right-of-way. The article also posits that the nickname \\"Old Maud\\" of both the engine and the railroad itself originated from the name of railroad founder and attorney Claire Edwards' sister - whose name was Maud. The deeds attached detailed plats showing the exact location of the entire right-of-way. The deeds are being donated to the Lake County Discovery Museum. Portions of the PLZ&W; right-of- way are still visible, especially along the Palatine Bike Path south of Dundee Road and just north of Dundee Road in the Deer Grove Forest Preserve, where you can still find the pilings for the bridge that crossed the creek. Remains of Trestle over Salt Creek in Deer Grove Forest Preserve Wooden ties and spikes were found in these areas in 2006. Another relatively undisturbed section is in the wooded area just north of Cuba Road and east of Rand Road. A beautiful section of canopy trees over the old rail bed was found there in 2007. Farther north in Lake Zurich along the east side of Old Rand Road and just south of Kitts the raised bed is clearly seen from Old Rand Road during the winter. Other sections west of Quentin Road are visible but difficult to get to because of the thick brush.

Located just outside the village of Brynsiencyn, Anglesey Sea Zoo claims to be the largest aquarium in Wales and displays over 150 native species. History The Anglesey Sea Zoo was opened in 1983 when the owners of a lobster shop wholesale business realized lobster tanks had become attractions in themselves. In 2007 the attraction was sold to research ecologists who have since gone on to develop research and conservation projects based at the aquarium, as well as several community conservation initiatives. Animals The zoo hosts a conger eel, a shark pool, a kelp forest, and runs the Lobster Hatchery of Wales. the zoo currently has two species of sea horses--the short snouted seahorse found around the UK and Mediterranean, and the drab seahorse found in the Red Sea. Conservation and Animal Rescue The Anglesey Sea Zoo is a conservation zoo and tourist activity centre, involved in captive breeding programs and national and international consultancy. The zoo is one of the few places in the world that has been able to successfully breed and sustain native short-snouted seahorse. Started in 1995 when a stranded striped dolphin was successfully rescued, the zoo now contains a rescue center for sick or stranded marine animals, including dolphins, whales, porpoises, seals, turtles, and seabirds. The rescue center is part of a network being created in the British Isles by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR). Eating and shopping The aquarium also houses one of the only shops and bistros that sell almost exclusively fair trade and locally sourced products.

Description Such encounters normally occur by chance in small unit operations, typically when two moving forces collide unexpectedly. Engagements involving larger units may occur when intelligence, surveillance, or reconnaissance operations have been ineffective. Meeting engagements can also occur when opposing forces are aware of the general presence but not the exact location of each other and both decide to attack immediately. On contact, commanders quickly act to gain the advantage. Speed of action and movement, coupled with both direct and indirect fire, are essential. To maintain momentum, lead elements quickly bypass or fight through light resistance. Freedom to maneuver is always advantageous; however, commanders may choose to establish a hasty defense if the enemy force is larger or the terrain offers a significant benefit. In general, the force that gains and retains the initiative in a meeting engagement wins. If both sides choose to reinforce their position instead of disengaging, then what started out as a skirmish may turn into a pitched battle, as happened at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War and the Battle of Mars-la- Tour during the Franco-Prussian War.

He attended the Curtis Institute of Music as well as Juilliard. Langstaff's lifelong project, the Christmas Revels, began in 1957 with a show in New York. In 1971 began the longest-running Revels, at Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Revels, an eclectic mix of medieval and modern music and dance (primarily English in basis), involves the audience and the community in a continuation of pagan and older Christian traditions. Revels shows, now spread over the USA and the world, draw on local talent. Morris dancing, mummers, bagpipers and large choruses of men, women and children celebrate the turning of the Winter Solstice in a cheerful fashion. Throughout his adult life, Langstaff was a dedicated music educator. In 1955 he became the music director at The Potomac School in Washington, DC, and later taught at Shady Hill School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He wrote twenty-five books, including the Caldecott Medal- winning Frog Went A-Courtin'. He hosted the BBC-TV Schools programme Making Music for five years, and produced a series of videos called Making Music with John Langstaff for parents and teachers. He also published songbooks, teacher's guides, and production guides for the Revels. In the later 1970s and early 1980s, Jack, as he was addressed by some, was associated with the Young Audiences organization in the United States, which creates and presents performance arts in educational settings. Langstaff was Executive Director of Young Audiences of Massachusetts, and collaborated with many cultural, educational, health and community organizations in the Greater Boston area and New England. Langstaff's recording career was varied and long. Beginning with English traditional music in the 1950s, he continued with the founding of Revels Records, recording primarily children's and traditional music. Several of his early recordings were made in London with noted producer George Martin. In 1943 Langstaff married Diane Hamilton. They divorced in 1947. He was later married to Nancy Woodbridge, a pianist. On May 17, 2006 David Nath's documentary film To Drive The Dark Away, which chronicles Langstaff's life and work with the Christmas Revels, had its world premiere in Arlington, Massachusetts.

It was most significant in the early to mid-19th century, when historians estimate one million slaves were taken in a forced migration from the Upper South: Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia, to the territories and newly admitted states of the Deep South and the West Territories: Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. Economists say that transactions in the inter-regional slave market were driven primarily by differences in the marginal productivity of labor, which were based in the relative advantage between climates for the production of staple goods. The trade was strongly influenced by the invention of the cotton gin, which made short-staple cotton profitable for cultivation across large swathes of the upland Deep South (the Black Belt). Previously the commodity was based on long-staple cotton cultivated in coastal areas and the Sea Islands. The disparity in productivity created arbitrage opportunities for traders to exploit, and it facilitated regional specialization in labor production. Due to a lack of data, particularly with regard to slave prices, land values, and export totals for slaves, the true effects of the domestic slave trade, on both the economy of the Old South and general migration patterns of slaves into southwest territories, remain uncertain. These have served as points of contention among economic historians.  Economics of the interregional slave trade  The internal slave trade among colonies emerged in 1760 as a source of labor in early America. In the early years, some colonists traded in Native Americans, but began to favor the use of imported slaves from Africa. Following the American Revolutionary War, expansion of settlement into areas west of the Appalachians, and the abolition of transatlantic slave trade in 1808, the domestic trade became increasingly important, especially as settlers flowed into the Deep South in the 19th century. Some people already established as planters took droves of slaves with them when they moved. Others bought slaves from regional markets to develop and staff plantations. It is estimated that between 1790 and 1860 approximately 835,000 slaves were relocated to the American South (economists describe them as being \\"imported\\" from the Upper South, but they were being relocated US territories.) Historians most widely use the figure of one million slaves relocated during this Middle Passage. Analysis by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engelman suggested that 16 percent of the total migration of slaves was due to sale of slaves through domestic trade. Their conclusions were strongly criticized by other economists. The biggest sources for the domestic slave trade were \\"exporting\\" states in the Upper South such as Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, and Kentucky. From these states most slaves were imported into South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Fogel and Engelman attribute the larger proportion of interregional slave migration (i.e. migration not due to slave trade) to movement as planters relocated their entire slave populations to the Deep South to develop new plantations or take over existing ones (in later years). The new lands in the South attracted many land hungry settlers. =Contributors to the growth of inter-regional slave trade= Historians who argue in favor of soil exhaustion as an explanation for slave importation into the Deep South posit that exporting states emerged as slave producers because of the transformation of agriculture in the Upper South. By the late 18th century, the coastal and Piedmont tobacco areas were being converted to mixed crops because of soil exhaustion and changing markets. Because of the deterioration of soil and an increase in demand for food products, states in the upper south shifted crop emphasis from tobacco to grain which required less slave labor. This decreased demand left states in the Upper South with an excess supply of labor. With the forced Indian Removal by the US making new lands available in the Deep South, there was much higher demand there for workers to cultivate the labor-intensive sugar cane and cotton crops. The extensive development of cotton plantations created the highest demand for labor in the Deep South. At the same time, the invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century transformed short-staple cotton into a profitable crop that could be grown inland in the Deep South. Settlers pushed into the South, displacing the Five Civilized Tribes and other Native American groups. The cotton market had previously been dominated by the long-staple cotton cultivated primarily on the Sea Islands and in the coastal Lowcountry. The consequent boom in the cotton industry, coupled with the labor-intensive nature of the crop, created a need for slave labor in the Deep South that could be satisfied by excess supply further north. The increased demand for labor in the Deep South pushed up the price of slaves in markets such as New Orleans, which became the fourth-largest city in the country based in part on profits from the slave trade and related businesses. The price differences between the Upper and Deep South created demand. Slave traders took advantage of this arbitrage opportunity by buying at lower prices in the Upper South and then selling slaves at a profit after taking or transporting them further south. Some scholars believe there was an increasing prevalence in the Upper South of \\"breeding\\" slaves for export. The proven reproductive capacity of enslaved women was advertised as selling point and a feature that increased value. Although not as significant as the exportation of slaves to Deep South, farmers and land owners who needed to pay off loans increasingly used slaves as a cash substitute. This also contributed to the growth of the internal slave trade. =Estimates of slave prices, trader income, and alternative labor comparisons= Using an admittedly limited set of data from Ulrich Phillips (includes market data from Richmond, Charleston, mid-Georgia, and Louisiana), Robert Evans Jr. estimates that the average differential between slave prices in the Upper South and Deep South markets from 1830–1835 was $232. Although this differential deals only with price and does not account for transport costs and other operating costs (e.g. clothing, medical costs), the price gap displays a potential arbitrage opportunity (assuming costs were low enough). Evans suggests that interstate slave traders earned a wage greater than that of an alternative profession in skilled mechanical trades. If skilled mechanical trades can be considered a reasonable alternative occupation for slave traders, then it appears that inter-regional slave traders are made better off, at least in monetary terms. However, if slave traders possessed skills similar to those used in supervisory mechanics (e.g. skills used by a chief engineer), then slave traders received an income that was not greater than the one they would have received had they entered in an alternative profession. But most traders likely did not possess the skills of a railroad president or chief engineer. =Economic implications of the inter- regional slave trade on the Old South= Irish economic theorist John Elliot Cairnes suggested in his work The Slave Power that the inter-regional slave trade was a major component in ensuring the economic vitality of the Old South. Many economic historians, however, have since refuted the validity of this point. The general consensus seems to support Professor William L. Miller's claim that the inter-regional slave trade \\"did not provide the major part of the income of planters in the older states during any period.\\" The returns gained by traders from the sale price of slaves were offset by both the fall in the value of land, that resulted from the subsequent decrease in the marginal productivity of land, and the fall in the price of output, which occurred due to the increase in market size as given by westward expansion. Kotlikoff suggested that the net effect of the inter-regional slave trade on the economy of the Old South was negligible, if not negative. Speculators created slave trading companies which operated on both ends of the market, with firms such as Franklin and Armfield, based in Alexandria, Virginia, with offices in Louisiana, enjoying immense profits. The profits realized through the sale and shipment of enslaved people were in turn reinvested in banking, railroads, and even colleges. A striking example of the connection between the domestic slave trade and higher education can be found in the 1838 sale of 272 slaves by Jesuits to Louisiana when Georgetown University was facing financial instability. The flow of slaves from the upper to lower south continued to run until the outbreak of the Civil War. Slaves were sold south even during the hostilities, as plantations, businesses and households continued to operate. Economic historians have offered estimates for the annual revenue generated by the inter-regional slave trade for exporters that range from $3.75 to $6.7 million. =Effect of the inter-regional slave trade on westward migration= The primary issue that faces such analysis is determining the westward migration of the inter-regional slave trade from that incidental to the relocation of a slave's master. Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman estimated that the slave trade accounted for 16 percent of the relocation of enslaved African Americans, in their work Time on the Cross. This estimate, however, was severely criticized for the extreme sensitivity of the linear function used to gather this approximation. A more recent estimate, given by Jonathan B. Pritchett, has this figure at about 50 percent, or about 835,000 slaves total between 1790-1850. Without the inter-regional slave trade, it is possible that forced migration of slaves would have occurred naturally due to natural population pressures and the subsequent increase in land prices. Professor Miller contends that, \\"it is even doubtful whether the interstate slave traffic made a net contribution to the westward flow of the population.\\" =The nature of the market= The argument has been made that the inter- regional slave trade was one that resulted in \\"superprofits\\" for traders. But Jonathan Pritchett points to evidence that there were a significant number of firms engaged in the market, a relatively dense concentration of these firms, and low barriers to entry. He says that traders who were exporting slaves from the Upper South were price-taking, profit-maximizers acting in a market that achieved a long-run competitive equilibrium. Within this market, the demand for prime-aged slaves, given by the ages 15–30, accounted for 70 percent of the slave population relocated to the Deep South. However, due to the fact that the ages of slaves were often unknown by the traders themselves, physical attributes such as height often dictated demand in order to minimize asymmetric information. With slaves moving further south through the slave trade, conditions and treatment of slaves were understood to decline as they moved further south. In comparison to working in relatively small groups and perhaps alongside some farming families in the Upper South, they were forced to do field work in large gangs under close white supervision, and had less control over their time. The dense trees and underbrush of many riverfront areas in Louisiana and Mississippi were being cleared for the first time to develop plantations, adding to their struggles. Slaves most feared being sold to planters in Louisiana. The state's grueling climate, with high heat and humidity, as well as the pressures of cultivating and processing the labor- intensive crops of sugar cane and cotton, resulted in harsh conditions for labor. With demand high for both commodity crops, planters and overseers were known to be physically abusive to slaves. The slaves feared being sent to Louisiana as a \\"Death sentence\\".

Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of typhlitis may include diarrhea, a distended abdomen, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain or tenderness. Cause The condition is usually caused by Gram-positive enteric commensal bacteria of the gut (gut flora). Clostridium difficile is a species of Gram-positive bacteria that commonly causes severe diarrhea and other intestinal diseases when competing bacteria are wiped out by antibiotics, causing pseudomembranous colitis, whereas Clostridium septicum is responsible for most cases of neutropenic enterocolitis. Typhlitis most commonly occurs in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, patients with AIDS, kidney transplant patients, or the elderly.  Diagnosis  Typhlitis is diagnosed with a radiograph CT scan showing thickening of the cecum and \\"fat stranding\\".  Treatment  Typhlitis is a medical emergency and requires prompt management. Untreated typhlitis has a poor prognosis, particularly if associated with pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the bowel wall) and/or bowel perforation, and has significant morbidity unless promptly recognized and aggressively treated. Successful treatment hinges on: # Early diagnosis provided by a high index of suspicion and the use of CT scanning # Nonoperative treatment for uncomplicated cases # Empiric antibiotics, particularly if the patient is neutropenic or at other risk of infection. In rare cases of prolonged neutropenia and complications such as bowel perforation, neutrophil transfusions can be considered but have not been studied in a randomized control trial. Elective right hemicolectomy may be used to prevent recurrence but is generally not recommended \\"...The authors have found nonoperative treatment highly effective in patients who do not manifest signs of peritonitis, perforation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or clinical deterioration. Recurrent typhlitis was frequent after conservative therapy (recurrence rate, 67 percent), however,\\" as based on studies from the 1980s Prognosis Inflammation can spread to other parts of the gut in patients with typhlitis. The condition can also cause the cecum to become distended and can cut off its blood supply. This and other factors can result in necrosis and perforation of the bowel, which can cause peritonitis and sepsis. Historically, the mortality rate for typhlitis was as high as 50%, mostly because it is frequently associated with bowel perforation. More recent studies have demonstrated better outcomes with prompt medical management, generally with resolution of symptoms with neutrophil recovery without death .

She was named for Edward Stack. History Stack was laid down on 25 June 1937 by the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia; launched on 5 May 1938; sponsored by Miss Mary Teresa Stack; and commissioned on 20 November 1939, Lieutenant Commander Isaiah Olch in command. Following shakedown which lasted until 4 April 1940, including a cruise to the West Indies and Rio de Janeiro, Stack proceeded to the west coast and thence to Pearl Harbor where she operated with the Pacific Fleet until June 1941. She then returned to the east coast for an overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Stack began patrolling off Bermuda late in November with the Neutrality Patrol. After the United States entered World War II, Stack continued to patrol in the Caribbean until 22 December when she was assigned to escort from Bermuda to Norfolk, Virginia. On the 28th, she sailed from Norfolk as screen for , She arrived at Casco Bay, Maine, two days later. She refueled and got underway for Argentina in the screen for Long Island and . =1942= Arriving in Argentia on New Year's Day 1942, she was assigned to patrol duty. On 15 January 1942, she picked up two survivors from SS Bay Rose which had been torpedoed the night before off Cape Race. From 17 to 24 January, Stack escorted a convoy which was transporting the first American Expeditionary Force troops to Ireland. En route from Hvalfjörður to Reykjavík, Iceland, on 29 January, she was ordered on a submarine sweep after the , operating with Task Force (TF) 15, was torpedoed. Steaming at 25 knots on a night sweep, Stack sighted a submarine close aboard. She returned to the point where it had been seen and made two depth charge attacks on sound contact. came to assist and also made two attacks. The submarine, U-132, suffered damage to a diesel compressor and was forced to return to France for repairs. Stack departed Iceland on 31 January and operated out of Casco Bay until 17 March. That morning, patrolling with zero visibility, she collided with Wasp. Since her number one fireroom was completely flooded, she steamed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard and underwent repairs until May. On 5 June, Stack joined TF 37 consisting of Wasp, , , , , , and and headed for San Diego, California. The force arrived there on 19 June, was redesignated TF 18, and ordered to Nukualofa, Tongatapu Island, on the 25th. Arriving on 18 July, the ships spent five days preparing for battle, and sailed for the invasion of Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. =1943= Stack covered the Guadalcanal-Tulagi landings with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 12 and was then assigned independent escort and patrol duty in the Guadalcanal area. On 16 January 1943, she was ordered to return to the west coast, via Pearl Harbor, for yard availability. Stack entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on 2 February. Following repair, overhaul and sea trials, she sailed on the 23d to escort SS Matsonia to Pearl Harbor and continue on to Efate, New Hebrides Islands. Stack operated out of Efate from 20 April until late May. During this time, she made several patrols off Guadalcanal. She then screened covering the southern supply routes. Assigned to TF 31 in July and August, she had her first opportunity to \\"slug it out\\" with the enemy. Stack was under attack by Japanese aircraft on 17 and 18 July near New Georgia Island. On the night of 6 and 7 August, in what would be known as the Battle of Vella Gulf, Stack, with other units of Task Group (TG) 31.2, was searching for enemy traffic along Gizo and Kolombangara island. At 2335, reported that she had made radar contact at 19,000 yards. The group tracked the enemy and identified them as four ships in column. The American ships opened the battle with a successful torpedo attack, followed by gunfire and more torpedoes. This resulted in the sinking of three Japanese destroyers, Arashi, Hagikaze, and Kawakaze, and damage to the fourth. The destroyers were loaded with troops who were to have been landed at Kolombangara as reinforcements for the Japanese garrison there. There were no American losses, and the task group retired to Tulagi. Stack joined TF 38 to participate in raids against Rabaul during November. On the 11th, two carrier attacks had already been launched when radar picked up a flight of incoming bogies. The actual attack began at 1355 when Stack commenced firing on a group of 20 Vals coming in on her starboard bow. Thereafter, antiaircraft fire was continuous from the task force against all types of Japanese planes. The attacking force numbered about 90 planes. Stack downed one and had two more probable kills. Stack then operated with TG 50.4 during the assault and landings on Tarawa and Makin Island in the Gilberts. She was a unit of the group screening the carriers which were providing fighter cover to the landing forces, when it was attacked by enemy bombers on 20 November, the day of the landings. Stack then steamed west of the Gilberts to participate in the combined aerial and shore bombardment of Nauru Island on 8 December 1943. =1944= In late January and early February 1944, Stack, as part of TF 58, participated in the bombardment and assault on Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls in the Marshalls. She was one of five destroyers in the Bombardment Support Group, which included three battleships, that shelled Roi-Namur and adjacent islands. On 17 and 18 February, the task force, now including nine carriers, carried out raids against the Japanese bastion at Truk and, on the 20th, against Jaluit Atoll. Stack then departed the Central Pacific for Pearl Harbor and for the west coast of the United States. She was overhauled and held sea trials from 11 March to 22 June when she weighed anchor for Pearl Harbor and Milne Bay. Stack arrived at Milne Bay on 15 July and began operations as a unit of TG 76.7. She laid a mine field off Wewak, New Guinea, and, on the night of 31 August and 1 September, shelled Kairiru Island in the Wewak area. Stack was part of the assault force that landed troops on Morotai, North Moluccas, on 15 September. Stack was attached to TG 78.4 which entered Leyte Gulf on 17 October. She spent the next two days performing pin-point fire support in the Dinagat Island landing area. On the 20th, she, in company with Lang and five YM's, performed mine sweeping operations and provided antiaircraft support for landings in the Philippines on Pinaon Island. =1945= Stack, with TG 78.5, sortied from Sansapor, New Guinea, on 30 December 1944 bound for Lingayen Gulf to support the assault and landing at \\"Blue Beach\\", Luzon. During the period from 5 to 12 January 1945, she provided antisubmarine and antiaircraft cover for various units and call fire on the beaches. Stack spent the next three weeks escorting convoys between Leyte and Lingayen Gulfs. On 8 February 1945, Stack departed San Pedro for the Solomon Islands and a period of upkeep, training, logistics, and exercises which were to last until mid-March. She sailed from Purvis Bay on the 15th; moored at Ulithi for a week; and, on 27 March, steamed for the Ryūkyūs with TF 53. Stack arrived off Okinawa on 1 April, \\"L-Day\\", and began her assigned duties as an antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrol ship. There were numerous enemy planes the next two days, and she fired on several. On the 5th, she was ordered to Saipan and thence to Ulithi where she joined TU 94.18.12 on 13 April for the return voyage to Okinawa. Arriving at Hagushi on the 21st, Stack was assigned to patrol duty west of Zampa Misaki for the remainder of the month. She then patrolled southeast of Okinawa to cover the Sakashima Group during May and early June. Stack reported to on 15 June 1945 and was directed to screen that vessel to Pearl Harbor. Stack had boiler trouble en route which forced her to undergo tender availability at Pearl Harbor until late July. She stood out of Pearl on the 27th underway for Eniwetok, Saipan, Okinawa, and Guam. On 28 August, she was en route from Guam to Truk Atoll with Brigadier General Leo D. Hermle, USMC, and various other Navy and Marine Corps officers on board for a preliminary conference with Japanese military authorities regarding the surrender of their forces. The conference was held on 30 August, and Stack returned to Guam. She remained in the Marianas until ordered to Iwo Jima on 16 September. Stack relieved on 19 September, at Haha Jima, as Commander, Naval Occupation Forces. She returned to the Marianas and remained in the area until 15 December when she weighed anchor for Pearl Harbor and the west coast. Fate Stack arrived at San Diego on 30 December 1945 for stripping and reduction of her personnel. She sailed two weeks later for Pearl Harbor and ultimate disposal. She was assigned to Joint Task Force 1 as a target for Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests to be held in the Marshall Islands. Stack arrived at Bikini Atoll on 29 May 1946. She survived the bomb tests of July and August and was decommissioned in the Marshalls on 29 August 1946. Stack was sunk by gunfire near Kwajalein on 24 April 1948 and struck from the Navy List on 28 May. Honors Stack received 12 battle stars for World War II service.

Locally, it is referred to as The Settlement or The Village.Saint Helena Independent 25 March 2011 p. 3 Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is regarded as the most remote permanent settlement on Earth, being from the nearest other human settlement, on Saint Helena. History The settlement was founded on the island of Tristan da Cunha in 1816 by a Sergeant William Glass from Kelso, Scottish Borders after the UK annexed Tristan da Cunha. A military garrison was maintained on the islands as a guard against any French attempts to rescue Napoleon, who was imprisoned on Saint Helena. The military garrison remained until the end of World War II. It is named after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria, in honour of his visit to the island in 1867.Courtney, Nicholas (2004). The Queen's Stamps. , page 28. The visit took place during the circumnavigation the Duke of Edinburgh did while commanding HMS Galatea. Tristan da Cunha post office issued four stamps in 1967 to celebrate the centenary of this visit. Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is the only major settlement of Tristan da Cunha, and contains a small port, the Administrator's residence, and the post office. It was damaged in a volcanic eruption on the island in 1961, which forced the entire population to abandon the settlement and evacuate to Calshot, Hampshire in the UK. The eruption destroyed the settlement's crayfish factory. After the return of most of the islanders in 1963, the settlement was rebuilt. The harbour at Edinburgh was named Calshot Harbour, after their temporary home during the eruption. Geography =Climate= The archipelago has a wet oceanic climate under the Köppen system with mild temperatures, but consistent moderate to heavy rainfall and very limited sunshine, due to the persistent westerly winds. Under the Trewartha classification, Tristan da Cunha is a humid subtropical climate due to the lack of cold weather. The number of rainy days is comparable to the Aleutian Islands at a much higher latitude in the northern hemisphere, while sunshine hours are comparable to Juneau, Alaska, 20° farther from the equator. Frost is unknown below elevations of and summer temperatures are similarly mild, never reaching . Sandy Point on the east coast is reputed to be the warmest and driest place on the island, being in the lee of the prevailing winds. Transport There is one road, M1, which connects the town with The Patches, the primary agricultural area, and is used by the few private cars on the island. Paved paths provide walking access to buildings around town. A bus service called Potato Patches Flier (using a 24-seat Isuzu mini school bus from South Africa) is available to pensioners in town to travel to places around the island. All motor vehicles on the island have Tristan da Cunha plates consisting of letters TDC and 2 or 3 numbers. The town has a small harbour with berths accessible by small vessels only.

TRN consists of a number of associated companies, which have launched or re-built some of the United States' highest-ranked talk radio shows, including The Savage Nation, Coast to Coast AM, and The Jerry Doyle Show. TRN was founded in 1993 and was managed by CEO Mark Masters. In 2007, Bear Stearns reported that TRN was the second-largest provider of nationally syndicated radio talk shows in the country, ahead of competitors ABC Radio and then-CBS-controlled Westwood One. The company thereafter went into decline amid contract disputes with its most successful talents and an ongoing feud with its satellite provider. In December 2017, affiliate radio stations reported that Talk Radio Network's programming feed had ceased without notice. History Talk Radio Network has had longstanding ties to the Foundation for Human Understanding, a nonprofit organization run by Roy Masters. The elder Masters has hosted a syndicated radio program Advice Line since 1961; it was carried by TRN throughout the network's existence. Mark Masters, the CEO of Talk Radio Network, is Roy Masters's son. Among the network's earliest offerings other than Masters's program was Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM. In 1998, the original Talk Radio Network Inc. company and all of its programs was acquired by Premiere Radio Networks for the syndication rights of Coast to Coast AM. At that time, TRN's programs were broadcast nationally by more than 300 radio stations. Actor Jerry Doyle was introduced to Mark Masters by Mancow Muller, who at the time hosted The Mancow Experience on TRN. Before starting his own show, Doyle was invited to guest-host for Rusty Humphries' TRN-syndicated Saturday Night America, which was broadcast to over two hundred stations. Based on the broadcast, TRN offered Doyle a regular show that became The Jerry Doyle Show. Doyle hosted the show for TRN until his sudden death in 2016. TRN has been responsible for syndicating and producing other notable talk radio programs including The Sam Sorbo Show, Science Fantastic with Michio Kaku, The Laura Ingraham Show (from 2004 to 2012), The Andrea Tantaros Show, Monica Crowley, and The Phil Hendrie Show. In June 2009, TRN partnered with The Washington Times to debut America's Morning News (AMN) with a focus on investigative reporting and live news and commentary from Washington, D.C. At its launch, AMN was hosted by Melanie Morgan and John McCaslin.TRN press release . Accessed 2009-05-28. TRN rolled out America's Radio News Network (ARNN) in January 2011 as an all news network service for stations, which ran for 15 hours every weekday. TRN (permanently) suspended ARNN operations on September 6, 2013. TRN effectively ceased regular operations on December 22, 2017 when its programming stopped being delivered via satellite to radio stations. = Contract disputes = Michael Savage TRN syndicated The Michael Savage Show from 1999 until 2012. In 2006, Michael Savage was accused of Islamophobia based on comments he made on-air. Mark Masters defended Savage's free speech rights and said, \\"CAIR threw the kitchen sink at us with the goal of getting Savage fired, but we weren't intimidated. His audience supports him and so do his sponsors who have renewed... [Savage is] just a guy with an opinion venting his heartfelt feelings to his audience, and they support him.\\" In 2010, a dispute arose when TRN attempted to exercise a \\"right to match\\" provision in Savage's contract at the end of its term.Shock Jock Savage Wants out of Contract. Courthouse News Service. Retrieved 2010-12-22. Savage argued against going into arbitration with TRN but was shot down.

TRN told the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that, through ex parte letters, Savage had threatened the AAA with a negative public relations campaign during proceedings, which interfered with the arbitrator's decision-making. The Ninth Circuit refused to allow the evidence. The Supreme Court later denied TRN's request for writ of certiorari in 2016. Laura Ingraham The Laura Ingraham Show moved from Westwood One to Talk Radio Network in 2004. In June 2008, Ingraham walked away from the program in a contract dispute.Ingraham Speaks Up About Her Silencing on Talk Radio She eventually returned to the show a month later. Immediately after Savage won his case against the network, Ingraham's contract also expired; in addition to leaving the network, she also won rights to her entire show's archive from TRN. Ingraham joined Norman Pattiz's Courtside Entertainment Group in January 2013.

Actions against Dial Global and Cumulus Media  In August 2011, TRN, representing the three largest privately held syndicators, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Dial Global after it merged with Westwood One. TRN also said that \\"Dial Global/Westwood One has been collecting our advertising revenues, but refusing to pay them over to us or to account for them.\\" In 2013, Cumulus Media acquired Dial Global (renamed Westwood One) for $260 million, to which TRN publicly opposed. Shortly after, TRN scaled back its operations resulting in the sudden suspension of America's Radio News Network.\\"Changes At Talk Radio Network: ARNN Closes, Other Programming Continues\\". All Access. In March 2014, TRN and Cumulus Media announced a settlement of TRN's lawsuit over claims of unpaid advertising revenues and unfair competition against Dial Global. Regarding the settlement, Cumulus Media President/CEO Lew Dickey said, \\"While Cumulus Media had no role in the lawsuits filed by TRN Companies, we are pleased to resolve these claims and move forward together.\\" In April 2016, TRN launched a new federal antitrust lawsuit against Cumulus Media, Westwood One, Compass Media Networks, Ron Hartenbaum's WYD Media Management & WYM Media Management, former Cumulus Media CEO Lew Dickey and Westwood One COO Charles Steinhauer. TRN said in its lawsuit that Westwood One uses its monopoly power to conceal and misrepresent its accounting of advertising revenue allocations and advantage its own programming at the expense of programs of independent radio syndicators.Talk Radio Network Enterprises, LLC et al v.

While Cumulus Media sorted through its bankruptcy, an automatic stay of the TRN appeal was in effect. Upon Cumulus Media's exit from bankruptcy on June 4, 2018, TRN asked the bankruptcy judge to terminate the automatic stay and allow it to proceed with its appeal. On July 3, 2018, the New York-based court cancelled the stay, allowing TRN's appeal to proceed. In a two-page filing on August, 10, 2018, TRN made a plaintiff’s motion for “voluntary dismissal.” It stated, “Plaintiffs hereby respectfully move to dismiss the appeal in this matter with prejudice, with an order that each party bear its own costs and attorney’s fees.” And added, “Defendants have authorized us to represent that they consent to this Motion.” The court record reflects the dismissal with prejudice on August 23, 2018.

Life In 1791, Gergonne enlisted in the French army as a captain. That army was undergoing rapid expansion because the French government feared a foreign invasion intended to undo the French Revolution and restore Louis XVI to the throne of France. He saw action in the major battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792. He then returned to civilian life but soon was called up again and took part in the French invasion of Spain in 1794. In 1795, Gergonne and his regiment were sent to Nîmes. At this point, he made a definitive transition to civilian life by taking up the chair of \\"transcendental mathematics\\" at the new École centrale. He came under the influence of Gaspard Monge, the Director of the new École polytechnique in Paris. In 1810, in response to difficulties he encountered in trying to publish his work, Gergonne founded his own mathematics journal, officially named the Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées but generally referred to as the Annales de Gergonne. The most common subject of articles in his journal was geometry, Gergonne's specialty. Over a period of 22 years, the Annales de Gergonne published about 200 articles by Gergonne himself, and other articles by many distinguished mathematicians, including Poncelet, Servois, Bobillier, Steiner, Plücker, Chasles, Brianchon, Dupin, Lamé, even Galois. Gergonne was appointed to the chair of astronomy at the University of Montpellier in 1816. In 1830, he was appointed Rector of the University of Montpellier, at which time he ceased publishing his journal. He retired in 1844. Work Gergonne was among the first mathematicians to employ the word polar. In a series of papers beginning in 1810, he contributed to elaborating the principle of duality in projective geometry, by noticing that every theorem in the plane connecting points and lines corresponds to another theorem in which points and lines are interchanged, provided that the theorem embodied no metrical notions. Gergonne was an early proponent of the techniques of analytical geometry and in 1816, he devised an elegant coordinate solution to the classical problem of Apollonius: to find a circle which touches three given circles, thus demonstrating the power of the new methods. In 1813, Gergonne wrote the prize- winning essay for the Bordeaux Academy, Methods of synthesis and analysis in mathematics, unpublished to this day and known only via a summary. The essay is very revealing of Gergonne's philosophical ideas. He called for the abandonment of the words analysis and synthesis, claiming they lacked clear meanings. Surprisingly for a geometer, he suggested that algebra is more important than geometry at a time when algebra consisted almost entirely of the elementary algebra of the real field. He predicted that one day quasi- mechanical methods would be used to discover new results. In 1815, Gergonne wrote the first paper on the optimal design of experiments for polynomial regression. According to S. M. Stigler, Gergonne is the pioneer of optimal design as well as response surface methodology. He published his \\"Essai sur la théorie des définitions\\" (An essay on the theory of definition) in his Annales in 1818. This essay is generally credited for first recognizing and naming the construct of implicit definition.W. V. O.

The current chairman is Thevendrie Brewer. History Netcare was established in 1996, and was listed on the JSE Limited (Johannesburg Stock Exchange) the same year.Netcare, Group History It initially expanded into the UK in 2001. In 2002 it won The Ophthalmic Chain contract in Kent, Merseyside, Cumbria, Lancashire, Hampshire, and Thames Valley, to carry out 44,500 cataract removals over a 5-year period and the £2.5bn contract for the Greater Manchester Surgical Centre, a 48-bed facility at Trafford General Hospital to provide 44,863 elective procedures over 5 years with a diagnostics programme valued at £1bn. In 2004 it signed a contract to carry out 41,600 cataract operations for the NHS at sites throughout the UK including Cumberland Infirmary. The company acquired a controlling stake in General Healthcare Group, the UK's largest private hospital group with 50 hospitals, in 2006 for £2.2 billion. This brought Netcare's total number of hospitals to 120 with over 11,000 beds, 510 operating theatres, and 37 pharmacies. GHG had a subsidiary company, Amicus Health which tendered for NHS contracts. It had contracts with Stracathro Hospital for 8000 episodes of elective surgery in orthopaedics, urology, general surgery and gastroenterology from 2006–9. The company used Vanguard Healthcare mobile units to treat NHS cataract patients across the UK. The mobile cataract units in Cumbria had failure rates 6 times that of local NHS facilities. 6 patients who were treated at the Royal Hospital Haslar in Portsmouth in 2006 sued after faulty hip operations. Netcare blamed a single rogue surgeon who had since been excluded from operating and said this was ‘an isolated incident’. In 2010 five doctors from Netcare, two transplant unit staff, and the chief executive officer were charged for allegedly participating in an international kidney trading syndicate in which poor Brazilians and Romanians were paid to donate kidneys to wealthy Israelis.

Her mother may have been Rigrawst.Brian Daniel Starr, Ascent of the Saints: Whose Lineage Is Known (Google eBook)(Brian Daniel Starr, 2009) page 73. Dwynwen lived in Anglesey, and her name is still recalled in place names such as Ynys Llanddwyn and Porthddwyn in Wales and the church of Sen Adhwynn in Advent, Cornwall. In the tale told of her, Dwynwen falls in love with a young man named Maelon, but rejects his advances. Stories differ substantially on the events that follow but the outcome remains the same. Either she is raped by Maelon and prays for assistance, or she is unable to marry him due to her father's refusal and prays to forget her love for him. An angel provides her with a potion. Maelon drinks it and turns into ice. Dwynwen then prays for three requests (either given as a result of drinking the potion, or prayed for when she sees what happens to Maelon). These three requests are that Maelon be released; that, through her, God look after all true lovers; and that she remain unmarried.

Those pilgrims who still came to pray in the area visited Saint Elian's Well instead.Santes Dwynwen / Saint Dwynwen, bilingual book by Catrin Stevens, 2005, Gomer Press During the nineteenth century, the Anglican Church rediscovered traditional devotions, in the course of which in the 'sixtieth year of Queen Victoria', probably 1879, a plain cross about fourteen feet (4.2m) high was erected in memory of Dwynwen.'St Dwynwen's Cross', wales_picture.cfm?p=3829 at blacklisted Stay In Wales website, accessed 10 February 2012 In 1903, a Celtic cross was erected near the ruins of the church by the Hon.

The Celtic Cross erected in 1903, with the older cross in the background Calendars from the fifteenth century and later give 25 January as the day commemorating St Dwynwen in Wales. Nicolas Roscarrok, however, gives as her day 13 July, and opines that 'St Dwin' is the same as 'Dwinwen'. In his Calendar he gives 25 January as the day of 'Dwinwent' or 'Damwent'. During the 1960s, a student at University College, Bangor, Vera Williams, sought to revive the observance of St Dwynwen's Day by commissioning four designs for St Dwynwen's Day cards, in the style of a \\"Welsh Valentine's Day\\". Another local press adopted the idea, and by 2004 the celebration of 25 January as a festival for Welsh lovers was so well established that even Gwynedd Council was promoting it. St Dwynwen is not officially commemorated in the liturgies of the Catholic or Anglican Churches; she does not appear in the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology,Martyrologium Romanum, 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis). nor the Roman Catholic calendar for Wales,National Calendar for Wales, accessed 6 February 2012 nor the 1995 revision of the Church in Wales calendar.The Alternative Calendar and Lectionary of the Church in Wales, accessed 10 February 2012 She is also the patron saint of sick animals.

It is part of Bolivia, and specifically part of the La Paz Department. Geographically, the terrain is harsh; it is a rocky, hilly island with many eucalyptus trees. There are no motor vehicles or paved roads on the island. The main economic activity of the approximately 800 families on the island is farming, with fishing and tourism augmenting the subsistence economy. Of the several villages, Yumani and Challapampa are the largest.p209 Lonely Planet South America on a Shoestring 2008 There are over 80 ruins on the island. Most of these date to the Inca period circa the 15th century AD. Archaeologists have discovered evidence that people lived on the island as far back as the third millennium BC. Many hills on the island contain agricultural terraces, which adapt steep and rocky terrain to agriculture. Among the ruins on the island are Titi Qala (Aymara titi Andean mountain cat; lead, lead-colored, qala stone, \\"mountain cat stone\\" or \\"lead stone\\", also spelled Titikala), a labyrinth-like building called Chinkana, Q'asa Pata, and Pillkukayna. In the religion of the Incas, it was believed that the sun god was born here. Etymology Drawing of Templo del Sol on the Isla del Sol. The Aymara name for the island is Titi'kaka. The original meaning of this word is not known. Some linguists and archaeologists believe the name to be a corruption of titi (Andean mountain cat; lead, lead-colored) and qala (rock). In the 1612 Aymara-Spanish dictionary of Ludovico Bertonio, the phrase Tahksi kala is listed as \\"piedra fundamental\\" or \\"foundation stone\\" possibly alluding to the origin story of the Inca that the Sun and Moon were born in the lake.Stanish, Charles 2003 Ancient Titicaca. University of California Press History Inca stairs in Yumani, Isla del Sol The chronicler Bernabé Cobo documented two versions of an Inca origin myth that took place on the northern part of this island.Cobo, Bernabé 1990[1653] History of the Inca Empire. University of Texas, Austin. The first Inca Manco Cápac is said to have emerged from a prominent crag in a large sandstone outcrop known as Titi Qala. Manco Cápac is the son of Inti the Andean deity identified as the sun. In one version of the myth, the ancient people of the province were without light in the sky for many days and grew frightened of the darkness. Finally, the people saw the Sun emerge from the crag and believed it was the Sun's dwelling place. In another version related by Cobo, others believed the crag was dedicated to the Sun because it hid under the crag during a great Flood. Isla del Sol was the first land that appeared after the flood waters began to recede and the Sun emerged from Titi Qala to illuminate the sky once again. A temple was built at this rock and later expanded by the 10th Inca Tupac Inca Yupanqui. He built a convent for mamaconas (chosen women) and a tambo (inn) for visiting pilgrims. Archaeology Inca fountain in Yumani, Isla del Sol Excavations at the archaeological site of Ch'uxu Qullu, located on a small peak above the Bay of Challa, led to the recovery of Archaic Preceramic remains that radiocarbon dated to about 2200 BC. Eight obsidian flakes were recovered from this context, and Neutron Activation Analysis of three of the flakes revealed that all of them were from the Chivay obsidian source which is located in the Colca Canyon, Department of Arequipa. The presence of Chivay obsidian is clear evidence that inhabitants of the island were participating in a wider network of exchange. Chivay obsidian has also been used at a nearby archaeological site, Jisk'a Iru Muqu, located on Peruvian territory. This indicates cultural continuity between these two sites in the same preceramic time frame. =Geological studies= According to one bathymetric model, there is no path between the shore edge and the Island of the Sun that does not pass over areas where the lake bottom reaches a depth of or greater. Paleoclimate studies indicate that around 3100 BC the level of Lake Titicaca would have been as much as lower than modern conditions, but that it had reached near modern levels by about 2000 BC. Thus, at 2200 BC lake levels were probably lower than at present but still high enough that the island was separated by water from the mainland. Data from Ch'uxuqullu therefore indicates that the lake shore cultures were using well-developed watercraft technology during the Archaic period. =Occupation history= The island was continually occupied from at least 2200 BC up to the present day. There is a significant Early Formative occupation (1800-1100 BC), Middle Formative (1100-500 BC) and Upper Formative (500 BC - AD 500). The earliest recorded pottery on the island dates to between 1426 and 1316 B.C. Most significantly, there is a major Tiwanaku (Tiahuanaco) settlement on the island. The site of Chucaripupata was a major Tiwanaku ritual site located above the Titi Qala, that the Incas made famous. All these sites are located on the western side of the island. Titi Qala, the island location sacred to the Incas Chucaripupata is only a few hundred meters from Titi Qala, and immediately above them is a rock outcrop known as Murokata. It is therefore possible that Murokata was the \\"sacred rock\\" of the Tiwanaku culture.Bauer, Brian and Charles Stanish 2001 \\"Ritual and Pilgrimage in the Ancient Andes\\" University of Texas press, Austin The archaeological evidence indicates that neither Murokata nor Titi Qala were used during the Late Intermediate Period (ca AD 1000-1450). With the conquest of the southern Titicaca region by the Inca, the Titi Qala zone was converted into one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in the Inca state on par with the famous oracle at Pachacamac on the coast just south of Lima. Underwater archaeological investigations conducted off the Island of the Sun from 1989-92 led to the discovery of both Inca and Tiahuanaco artifacts. These are now on display at a site museum in Challapampa.Reinhard, Johan \\"Underwater Archaeological Research in Lake Titicaca, Bolivia\\" in Ancient America: Contributions to New World Archaeology, 1992. N. Saunders (ed.), Oxford: Oxbow Books, pp. 117-143 Today the economy of the island is mainly driven by tourism revenues, but subsistence agriculture and fishing are widely practiced.

He was also a polo player and the owner of a significant stable of Thoroughbred racehorses. Early life Born in Old Westbury, New York, he was the only son of the wealthy and socially prominent Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1932) and his wife, Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942). He had a younger sister, Barbara Whitney, and an elder sister, Flora Payne Whitney (1897–1986). As a member of both the Whitney and Vanderbilt families, he inherited a substantial fortune. He also proved to be a very capable businessman in his own right. Career After graduating from Yale University in 1922, he went to work at a Nevada mine owned by his father. Whitney's paternal grandfather, William Collins Whitney, was a co-founder and director of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, and in 1926, Whitney was appointed a director, serving on the bank's board until 1940. In 1927, Whitney joined with William Avery Rockefeller III and other investors to back Juan Trippe in establishing the Aviation Corporation of America, which a year later would become Pan American World Airways. In 1931, Whitney founded the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited in Canada. The company became a major zinc mining operation, and Whitney served as chairman of the board until 1964. =Equine sports= His father, Harry Payne Whitney, had been an avid polo player and thoroughbred racehorse owner, and C.V. Whitney followed in his footsteps, winning the U.S. Open polo title three times. Since 1979, the Greenwich Polo Club at Conyers Farm in Greenwich, Connecticut, has awarded the C.V. Whitney Cup to the winner of an annual polo tournament. He was the third generation of Whitneys to be heavily involved in thoroughbred horse racing. The Grade 1 Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Race Course was inaugurated in his family's honor in 1928. C.V. Whitney acquired his father's stable in 1930 and on May 17, his two-year-old colt Equipoise gave him his first stakes race victory when he won the Keene' Memorial Stakes at Belmont Park. Equipoise would go on to become a success on the racetrack and as a leading sire, and would be inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1957. Among Whitney's other outstanding horses, Top Flight was the 1931 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly and the 1932 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, and was also voted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. Although he had fifteen horses compete in the Kentucky Derby, Whitney never won the prestigious race. Silver Spoon was the only filly entered in the Derby between the years 1945 and 1980, coming in a credible fifth in 1959. Ridden by jockey Eddie Arcaro and trained by Sylvester Veitch, Whitney's horse Phalanx won the first division of the 1947 Wood Memorial Stakes, finished second in the 1947 Kentucky Derby, took third in the ensuing Preakness Stakes, then won the Belmont Stakes. In the 1951 Kentucky Derby, Whitney's Veitch-trained colt Counterpoint was still developing after an injury as a yearling that almost ended his career and tired badly, finishing 11th. However, Counterpoint came back to take second place in the Preakness Stakes and subsequently gave Whitney his second win in the Belmont Stakes and then went on to earn 1951 Horse of the Year honors. Among other successful horses from his stables, Career Boy won the United Nations Handicap and was voted the Eclipse Award champion Grass Horse for 1956. And First Flight was one of his best fillies, winning the Matron Stakes and beating males in Belmont's Futurity Stakes in 1946. =Film production= Whitney became involved in the motion picture industry, notably with his cousin John Hay Whitney as a major shareholder backing the Technicolor Corporation. The two were also financiers for the 1939 film classic Gone with the Wind. Seventeen years later, C. V. Whitney served as a producer through his own \\"C.V. Whitney Pictures\\". His company made three films, the first being the acclaimed 1956 production, The Searchers, directed by John Ford. The second was The Missouri Traveler in 1958 with Brandon deWilde and Lee Marvin, and the third was The Young Land in 1959 with Patrick Wayne and Dennis Hopper. Whitney was a major financial partner in the development of Marine Studios, designed as an underwater motion picture studio located on the ocean south of St. Augustine, Florida. The Studios opened on June 23, 1938, with an estimated 30,000 visitors and eventually evolved into a major marine attraction. It was billed as \\"the world's original marine attraction\\". Whitney sold the attraction and its amenities to a group of St. Augustine businessmen, and Whitney's legacy continues at the Whitney Laboratory nearby. =Government and military service= Having spent considerable time in France, Whitney's mother Gertrude became involved supporting the Allied forces during World War I. She dedicated a great deal of her time and money to various relief efforts, establishing and maintaining a hospital in France for wounded soldiers. Eighteen-year-old C. V. Whitney joined the United States Army, serving as an aviation cadet in the Signal Corps, rising to the rank of second lieutenant and becoming a military pilot. During the first World War, Whitney served as a flight instructor in Texas. With the onset of American involvement in World War II, Whitney volunteered again for service, rising to the rank of colonel with the United States Army Air Forces. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and Legion of Merit. At the end of the war, Whitney served under U.S. President Harry S. Truman as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force from 1947 to 1949, and United States Under Secretary of Commerce from 1949 to 1950. He was also appointed President Truman's special envoy to the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Spain and Italy in 1950. Estates One of Whitney's homes was the \\"Cady Hill\\" estate at Saratoga Springs, New York, not far from the Saratoga Race Course. It was there in 1950 that he founded the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and served as its first president. A former director of Churchill Downs, he was given an Eclipse Special Award in 1984 in recognition of his lifetime contribution to thoroughbred horse racing in the United States. The C. V. Whitney Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, bred more than 175 stakes winners until age forced him to sell off a large part of the property in the 1980s to Gainesway Farm. After his death in 1992, his widow, Marylou Whitney, continued breeding and racing operations on a smaller scale. A much respected figure in racing, her \\"Marylou Whitney Stables\\" owned Birdstone, the 2004 Belmont Stakes winner. Upon his death, Whitney owned over 51,000 acres (210 km²) in the Adirondacks along with a great camp called Deerlands. Located within the Oswegatchie Great Forest, the Whitney estate is home to more than 40 lakes and ponds, as well as the headwaters of the Beaver, Raquette and Bog rivers. In 1997, New York State bought 14,700 acres (59 km²) of the 51,000 acre (210 km²) Whitney tract from Marylou Whitney's \\"Whitney Industries\\" for $17.1 million. Personal life Whitney's fourth wife, Marylou Whitney, with children, 1959 On March 5, 1923, Whitney married for the first of an eventual four times to Marie Norton (1903–1970), daughter of Sheridan Nook Norton, an attorney, and Beulah Sanfield Einstein, in Paris. They were married from 1923 until 1929, when they divorced. Marie later married New York Governor and diplomat Averell Harriman, and she was First Lady of New York from January 1, 1955, to December 31, 1958. She and Whitney had two children together: * Harry Payne Whitney II (1924-1985), who married Alexandra Ewing (1927–2014), daughter of Gifford Cochran Ewing and Frances Riker,http://www.socialregisteronline.com/#!alexandra-ewing-whitney/c22j5 and later Andrea R. Whitney * Nancy Marie Whitney (1926-2006), who married four times and divorced three times:  in 1949 to Edwin Denison Morgan III (1921–2001), by whom she had two children: * Alida Morgan * Pamela Morgan  on August 26, 1957, to (Charles) Russell Hurd  on July 1, 1958, to his widowed elder brother, Edward Augustus Hurd Jr.  and finally, to well known water colorist Pierre Lutz (1923-1991). Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney's second marriage was to Gwladys Crosby \\"Gee\\" Hopkins, from 1931 to 1940. They had one daughter: * Gail Whitney (1939-1963), who married Richard Cox Cowell in 1958. They were divorced a year later. In 1961, she married Louis S. Stur. Gail died at the age of 24. In 1941, in Plymouth, Ohio, he married for the third time to Eleanor Searle (c. 1908-2002), daughter of Dr. and Mrs. George James Searle. Before their divorce in 1957, they had one son: * Cornelius Searle Whitney (1944–2015), an economist, psychologist and philanthropist. On January 25, 1958, he married for the fourth, and final, time to Marie Louise Schroeder (1925–2019). She was an actress in a movie he produced, called The Missouri Traveler. They remained married until his death. Together, they had one daughter: * Cornelia Whitney, an art instructor and divorced mother of one who lives in Ithaca, New York. Over the 1920s, Whitney successfully fended off several million-dollar lawsuits filed by former Ziegfeld Follies dancer Evan- Burrows Fontaine charging him with breach of promise and paternity of her son.New York Times – August 13, 1922 Whitney died in 1992 in Saratoga Springs, New York, at the age of 93 and is buried there in the Greenridge Cemetery. In 1994, a portion of New York State Route 50 in the City of Saratoga Springs was designated \\"C.V. Whitney Memorial Highway.\\" =Philanthropy and arts patronage= Henri II de Lorraine by Anthony van Dyck, 1634, which Whitney donated to the National Gallery of Art Whitney was raised in an artistic environment. His mother, Gertrude, was an accomplished sculptor who studied in Paris under Auguste Rodin. She was also the founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. As an adult, C. V. Whitney played a role in establishing the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York, was a supporter of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and was a founder of the Whitney Gallery of Western Art in Cody, Wyoming. The \\"Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame\\" collection was provided in 1987 to the National Museum of Dance in Saratoga Springs, New York. It is the only museum in the world dedicated to professional dance. Whitney donated important artworks to various museums. Notable donations include the gift of a 1634 Anthony van Dyck painting of Henri II de Lorraine, 5e Duc de Guise, which had been in the Whitney family for three generations, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. In 1953, Whitney donated the 1872 Thomas Eakins painting, The Biglin Brothers Racing, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Whitney's interest in the natural history of marine animals resulted in the 1938 founding of the world's first oceanarium. Marineland, near St. Augustine, Florida, included a small research laboratory that drew academic biologists. Eventually, Whitney provided the University of Florida with an adjacent parcel of land plus half of the construction capital required to build a full-scale academic center, the C.V. Whitney Laboratory for Experimental Marine Biology and Medicine (now called The Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience).Gulfbase.org Info In addition, he donated Whitney Hall to the university, a building that serves as a conference center and contains dormitories and apartments. In 1963, his estate at Old Westbury, New York, was subdivided and offered to the New York Institute of Technology for use as part of its Long Island campus. In 2000, his widow helped finance the publication of Legend of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney by Jeffrey L. Rodengen.

Joppa was founded as a British settlement on the Gunpowder River in 1707 and designated as the third county seat of Baltimore County in 1712. The original boundaries of Baltimore County were defined in 1659 and contained all of modern day Baltimore County, Baltimore City, Harford and Cecil counties and parts of Howard, Carroll, Anne Arundel and Kent counties. The settlement was named for the Biblical town of Jaffa in the ancient Holy Land of modern day Israel. Joppa's harbor began to silt in due to clearcutting and farming upriver and coupled with multiple outbreaks of diseases such as smallpox and malaria, the county seat was moved to the growing, deep water port of Baltimore in 1768. Joppa's population would decline rapidly thereafter and businesses left for more prosperous environments in the new Baltimore Town. History The town of Joppa near the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay was designated as a \\"Port of Entry\\" by the colonial legislature, the Maryland General Assembly. It traded internationally in agricultural products, primarily tobacco; the chief commodity crop and currency throughout much of its colonial era. At its peak, the port was home to about 50 or more homes, the courthouse, two prisons, a church, several inns, shops, and warehouses. In 1768, the Maryland General Assembly moved the county seat of Baltimore County from Joppa to Baltimore Town, which was developing as a major port. A new courthouse was built in the center of town that year. With court and related trade business diverted to Baltimore, much of the population followed. By 1815, all that remained of Joppa were the church and a few ruins of one stately homes, shops and warehouses. The Rumsey Mansion, home to Maryland's first and longest serving Chief Judge of the Maryland Supreme Court, Benjamin Rumsey, is the only remaining structure from that period. The McComas Institute was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Olney was listed in 1987, and Whitaker's Mill Historic District in 1990. Film location: Joppa is the site of large film sound-stages constructed for use in interior scenes of the US television series House of Cards. Sets include the full-scale reconstruction of the West Wing of the White House and Congressional offices.https://visitharford.com/files/travel_ideas/House_of_Cards_Tour.pdf Education: Harford County Public Schools operates the public schools. Trinity Lutheran Christian School, a PreK-12 Christian school, is located in Joppa. Joppa as it is known today is a planning region within Harford County and a federal zip code designation that includes modern day Joppatowne.

Sarafian, and stars Gary Busey, Yaphet Kotto, Denise Galik, Seymour Cassel, William Smith and Judith Barsi. Plot summary After serving time in prison, Buck Matthews (Gary Busey), a Vietnam War veteran, returns to his hometown to start his life over with his wife Christie (Denise Galik) and their five-year- old daughter Jennifer (Judith Barsi). However, he learns that the small town where he grew up is overrun by a large motorcycle gang which rides through the town in large numbers, harassing various citizens. On his first night back to his old job at a construction yard, Buck hears a woman screaming in the distance. He follows the screams to discover a large group of bikers attacking and attempting to rape a local nurse. Buck manages to chase the gang off using his truck, saving the nurse. The leader of the biker gang, Blade (William Smith), takes Buck's actions personally and begins to terrorize Buck and his family. The gang attacks the Matthews' home, beating Buck and killing his wife. This leaves Jennifer, his young daughter, in shock as she witnessed the entire event. The local sheriff (Seymour Cassel) refuses to help Buck, leaving Buck with no other option but to take justice into his own hands. Buck then calls in a favor from Jamie (Jorge Gil), a friend from prison. Jamie is a Miami-based Colombian drug kingpin whom Buck saved during a prison riot and who was also paroled with Buck in the opening scene. Buck receives a high tech truck, equipped with machine guns and mortars. Buck's friend, J.B. Deveraux (Yaphet Kotto), a local deputy who is also a Vietnam veteran, provides Buck with a history of the motorcycle gang. The sheriff is shown to be colluding with the motorcycle gang as Blade and his men give the sheriff bribes of cash to ignore their activities. Buck and J.B. begin to retaliate against the bikers through various means. Buck uses a wire to string out onto a road to decapitate at least two of the bikers. He lures another small group to their deaths by exploding his old truck when they attack it. He shoots other gang members whom they are seen committing crimes in and around the town. Eventually the bikers kidnap Buck's daughter Jennifer from the hospital, forcing Buck to go to their camp in the desert outside of town. With the help of J.B., flying a bomb-dropping crop duster airplane, Buck, successfully defeats the gang and rescues his daughter. The Sheriff tries to have Buck arrested, however the deputies, having enough of his corruption rebel against him and willingly let Buck deal with him. In an explosive climax, Buck has the local sheriff killed (it seems the sheriff framed Buck for a murder committed years earlier) by offering him as a target for the gang, and then has a one- on-one fistfight with Blade, which ends with the death of the villain when he accidentally ingests cocaine the gang is manufacturing. With their leader dead, the surviving motorcycle gang members ride away. Buck catches up with J.B. and the other deputies and they celebrate their victory for saving the town. Production notes The film begins and ends with the 1982 song \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" by Survivor played over the credits. The song had previously been heard in the 1982 film Rocky III, for which it was specifically written, earning it an Oscar and Grammy nomination. Reception Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the performances of stars Busey, Cassel, Remsen, Smith, and Kotto, but characterized Eye of the Tiger as \\"just another routine vengeance exploitation picture\\".

Description Aerial view of Back Bay, showing Esplanade at near bank of the Charles River, 2009 (with Longfellow Bridge and Kendall Square, Cambridge, in distance) The limited-access parkway Storrow Drive forms the southern boundary of the park, with the Charles River marking the northern edge. In the park are walkways, statuary, the Hatch Memorial Shell performance stage, playgrounds, ballfields, and Community Boating. The Esplanade comprises part of the Charles River Reservation state park. The Esplanade was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 2009. History The Esplanade was originally dedicated as the Boston Embankment in 1910. The Embankment was created as part of the construction of the 1910 Charles River Dam Bridge (today the site of the Museum of Science). The parkland was criticized for its lack of shade trees, refreshment stands, recreation facilities, transportation utility, and visitors. It extended to Charlesgate (upstream of the Harvard Bridge) and connected with Frederick Law Olmsted's Emerald Necklace system of parks and open spaces. To address criticism, trees, a refreshment pavilion, and concerts were brought to the park. The Esplanade went through a major expansion from 1928 to 1936, widening and lengthening the park land. These improvements were aided by a $1 million donation from Helen Osborne Storrow, in memory of her husband James. The Storrow Memorial Embankment, designed by Arthur Shurcliff, added the first lagoon, boat landings, plazas, playgrounds, and the Music Oval, where a temporary bandshell was placed. The summer of 1929 was the first year Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops performed on the Esplanade. In 1941, the construction of the Hatch Memorial Shell gave the Pops, and a wide range of other artists and performers, a first-class stage for popular summer events. In the 2000s, half a million people attend the Boston Pops concert and fireworks display held there every Independence Day. The Hatch Shell also hosts free public concerts and movies, and special events -— walkathons, races, and festivals such as Earth Day -— that draw hundreds of thousands of additional spectators each year. Sailing on the Charles began in the 1930s, and the boathouse on the Esplanade was built in 1941. Organized in 1946, Community Boating was the country's first public boating program. For a modest fee, thousands of people have learned to sail on the Charles River. The next major change to the Esplanade began in 1949, with the construction of Storrow Drive. To make up for park land lost to the new road, additional islands including multiple paths were built along the Esplanade, also designed by Arthur Shurcliff and his son Sydney. In the 1960s, the Esplanade was linked to Herter Park in Brighton, and other upstream parks, with the construction of the Dr. Paul Dudley White Bike Path. This loop travels along the entire basin on both the north and south banks of the river, and makes it especially suitable for biking, inline skating, and running. Access Detail of 1921 map of Boston, showing Charles River Embankment The Esplanade is isolated from the nearby Boston neighborhoods by Storrow Drive, a high-speed limited-access road protected by perimeter fencing. A series of eight pedestrian overpasses has been built to connect to the rest of the city, plus two additional bridges at the extreme ends of the park.

The English term comes from a perceived resemblance to the rich tapestry patterns of damask silk. Background The technique, while also being used on firearms, has a long history in Japan, where it was used to decorate katana fittings, particularly tsuba. Known as zougan (象嵌) in Japanese, it has developed its own subset of terms to describe the particular patterns, although \\"shippou-zougan\\" is an enamelling technique which most Westerners would consider closer to champlevé. Damascened-inlay jewelry, especially of Japanese origin, is sometimes referred to as shakudo from the use of that alloy as the dark background. The technique of niello is also famously attested in prehistoric Greece. The earliest occurrence of damascening in the Aegean, from the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, dates to the latest Middle Bronze Age/Middle Helladic IIIB period (dagger Nu-304). Ultimately of Near Eastern provenance, the technique of inlaying silver/gold was adapted to suit Aegean taste and style. Cities that are known for a rich history in Damascening where the technique is still practiced are Malaysia; Indonesia; Toledo, Spain; Eibar, Basque Country (Spain); and Kyoto, Japan.  Eibar, Spain  Iron cassone by Plácido Zuloaga, 1871 The Zuloaga family workshop at Eibar was the centre of Spanish damascening from the 19th century to the Spanish Civil War.Khalili, Nasser D. \\"Foreword\\" in , p. 8 Eusebio Zuloaga was a gunsmith and director of the Spanish Royal Armoury. A metalwork prodigy, Zuloaga undertook to restore damaged items in the armoury, and in the process studied and replicated decorative techniques of centuries past. This led to the establishment of Spain's damascene industry. Eusebio's eldest son Plácido Zuloaga eventually took over the workshop and directed its work away from armaments to the production of intricate decorative art works. In the process, he mastered and improved the techniques of damasceningLarrañaga, Ramiro \\"Damascene as part of the Engraver's Art\\" in , p. 37 and trained more than two hundred artists. His works were exhibited at many national and international fairs, winning multiple gold and silver medals and extremely positive reviews from critics.Blair, Claude \\"Introduction\\" in , p. 9 The British-Iranian scholar and collector Nasser D. Khalili has assembled, published, and exhibited more than a hundred items of Spanish damascened metalwork from this period, forming the Khalili Collection of Spanish Damascene Metalwork. Toledo, Spain Detail of damascening, in this case gold inlaid into oxidized steel, in a hairclasp from Toledo, Spain. Ding bronze vessel with gold and silver inlay (Damascening) from the Warring States period (403-221 BC) of ancient China. (c. 300 BC) Toledo has long been the major European centre, although most modern production is machine made, sometimes on tin rather than steel. Nevertheless, the art has long been practised in Persia, Japan and China. Some of these reproductions are \\"so expertly produced that even knowledgeable Toledeans admit the difficulty of recognizing them as such.\\" Damascene work has kept to traditional designs with few changes over the years, but there are a few artists who design innovative pieces of jewellery. Because of these reasons the use of this technique has been most popular in Spain.  Fujii, Japan  One of the most important Damascene creators was Fujii Yoshitoyo from Kyoto. He was born in 1868 and invented new techniques for the art of damascening. His designs were drawn by Bisei Unno of the Tokyo Fine Art School. He operated the Fujii Damascene Company from about 1925 through the mid 20th Century. In many exhibitions of this kind, Fujii was awarded first class medals for his exhibits, and his works have been purchased by the Imperial Household. Although Fujii's works are extremely detailed and very similar to the, for example, Komai's works, they are done in the etching technique and not in Zogan. Because Fujii's company was called \\"Fujii Damascene Co\\" or \\"Fujii Zogan Co\\" there should be arts he made in a Zogan technique, but until now, none of these were discovered.

Early life Baixeras was born in Barcelona in 1862. Career Baixeras began studying at an early age at the La Lonja School of Fine Arts, where he was a pupil of Catalan painters such as Agustín Rigalt (1836-1899), Martí Alsina (1826-1894) and Antonio Caba (1838-1907). He and his brothers, Juan and Jose Llimonas, were members of a group, which included painters and sculptors, known as the Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc (Artistic Circle of San Lluc); an arts society formed in Barcelona in the early 1890s by brothers, Joan Llimona and Josep Llimona; Antoni Utrillo, Alexandre de Riquer and a group of artists who were followers of bishop Josep Torras i Bages.

The inlet of water sheltered to the south of it is called Foul Bay, at the head of which sits the ancient port of Berenice. It is believed that Mukawwa Island to the south of the tip of the peninsula, may have been connected to the peninsula at some point in the past however little or no research has been conducted to support this claim. History Ras Banas has a detailed military history. What was then only a small military airport is used to fold the Egyptian air force base housing a part of the 9th light bomber squadron equipped with Ilyushin Il-28 is bombarded by four Sud Aviation Vautour of Israeli air force during the Six Day War on 5 June 1967. The 29 Egyptian Il-28 are destroyed in this conflict except the only two in air combat. It served as a Soviet military base until they moved out. The Soviets were allowed to construct the base following the 1964 USSR-United Arab Republic (Egypt) fishing agreement. The Soviets commenced the construction of the base in 1970, becoming their first base in Egypt, although the construction of the base was kept secret until 1972 when an Israeli newspaper published details of the base. The Egyptian government continued to try to cover up the base by alleging that a new port was being constructed at Berenice with a road being constructed from there to Aswan, although through treacherously difficult terrain. This new road would allow produce from the area to travel to Aswan and also allow for pilgrims to travel from Egypt to Saudi Arabia. These claims by the Egyptian government were later proven incorrect following international investigation. In July 1972, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, seeking to establish good relations with the United States, ordered the Soviets to leave. In February 1979, Anwar El Sadat encouraged Harold Brown, the United States Secretary of Defense of the time, to consider using the peninsula as a US naval and air facility. Initially, the United States showed no interest in the site however the offer became increasingly attractive. To obtain a congressional appropriation for rehabilitating the military facilities on Ras Banas, the US required a written agreement from Egypt allowing the US to use the facilities. Sadat was reluctant to give his written agreement and insisted that his oral commitment would be appropriate. However, on his last visit to Washington, D.C., in 1981, he signed a letter allowing the US to use Ras Banas. The location of Ras Banas allowed it to potentially serve as a staging area for Persian Gulf operations and for other Middle Eastern and North African contingencies. The initial plans produced by The Pentagon included making it a facility for CENTCOM troops and for staging B-52 bombers and C-5 transport aircraft. However, due to the absence of a written agreement by Egypt and the subsequent lack of approval for funding of the project at the time, the plans were dropped. The plans were resurrected after Egypt's written agreement, although were scaled down. The new plans scaled down the importance of the CENTCOM facility by constructing POL facilities. The proposals also included the construction of a water desalination plant with a water distribution network, improvements to the airfield (including the construction of a new runway), the construction of warehouses, fuel storage depots and barracks capable of holding 25,000 US troops. Egypt had reservations over the construction of a formal CENTCOM base on the site due to worries that this may form the subject of violence from radical Arabs. This was further reinforced following the assassination of Sadat in 1981. In May 1981, the plans were denounced by the Cairo-based newspaper Ash-Sha'b as \\"a threat to our independence and sovereignty.\\" In 1982, Hosni Mubarak refused the construction of a permanent US airbase on Ras Banas although made it clear that Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force could use the military facilities on Ras Banas in the case of an actual emergency. The cost of construction of the US military facilities was estimated to cost $522 million, making it the second most expensive project in Washington's Southwest Asia strategic network, only being surpassed by Diego Garcia. However, it was believed that costs could rise to as much as $1.6 billion. Of the costs being put forward for the development of Ras Banas, these included $7 million being given from the Secretary of Defense's contingency funds to establish construction mobilisation activities in 1982. However, in 1983, Egypt announced that it would develop Ras Banas without US aid after talks between the two countries broke down over the use of Ras Banas. However, talks recommenced resulting in an agreement that the base would be run jointly. However, by 1985, when Europe refused to fund Egypt's regeneration of Ras Banas as a military base, the United States decided to abandon their ambitious project altogether. Despite this, the base is used by the United States for some military operations. For example, it was used as a port of call by the United States Sixth Fleet in the early months of the Gulf War. Climate Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Features Ras Banas hosts a large airport with three asphalt runways, , and in length.

Description  Production sharing agreements were first used in Bolivia in the early 1950s, although their first implementation similar to today's was in Indonesia in the 1960s.Russian-Ukrainian Legal Group The Concept of Production Sharing Today they are often used in the Middle East and Central Asia. In production sharing agreements the country's government awards the execution of exploration and production activities to an oil company. The oil company bears the mineral and financial risk of the initiative and explores, develops and ultimately produces the field as required. When successful, the company is permitted to use the money from produced oil to recover capital and operational expenditures, known as \\"cost oil\\". The remaining money is known as \\"profit oil\\", and is split between the government and the company. In most of the production sharing agreements, changes in international oil prices or production rate affect the company's share of production. Production sharing agreements can be beneficial to governments of countries that lack the expertise and/or capital to develop their resources and wish to attract foreign companies to do so. They can be very profitable agreements for the oil companies involved, but often involve considerable risk. Cost stop and excess oil The amount of costs recoverable is often limited to an amount called \\"cost stop\\". If the costs incurred by the company are bigger than the cost stop, the company is entitled to recover only the costs limited to the cost stop. When the costs incurred are smaller than the cost stop, the difference between the costs and the cost stop is called \\"excess oil\\". Usually, but not necessarily, the excess oil is shared between the government and the company according to the same rules of the profit oil. If the recoverable costs are higher than the cost stop the contract is defined as saturated. The cost stop gives to the government the guarantee to recover part of the production (as long the price of the crude produced is higher than the cost stop), especially during the first years of production when the costs are higher. Since the beginning of the 80s all major contracts include invariable a clause of cost stop. The cost stop can be a fixed amount, but in most case it is a percentage of the cost of the crude. Risk sharing contracts First implemented in Malaysia, the risk sharing contracts (RSC) departs from the production sharing contract (PSC) first introduced in 1976 and most recently revised last year as the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) PSC which ramps up recovery rate from 26% to 40%. As a performance-based agreement, it is developed in Malaysia for the Malaysian people and private partners to both benefit from successfully and viably monetizing these marginal fields. At the Center for Energy Sustainability and Economics' Production Optimisation Week Asia Forum in Malaysia on 27 July 2011, Finance Deputy Minister YB. Sen. Dato' Ir. Donald Lim Siang Chai expounded that the trail-blazing RSC calls for optimal delivery of production targets and allows for knowledge transfer from joint ventures between foreign and local players in the development of Malaysia’s 106 marginal fields, which cumulatively contain 580 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in today’s high-demand, low-resource energy market.DEPUTY MINISTER YB. SEN. DATO’ IR. DONALD LIM SIANG CHAI, \\"Opening Speech by DEPUTY MINISTER YB. SEN. DATO’ IR. DONALD LIM SIANG CHAI\\" , Opening Ceremony Speech, Center for Energy Sustainability and Economics, July 27, 2011. =Framework for Marginal Fields Risk Service Contracts= Performance- based agreements like the Berantai RSC have a tighter focus on production and recovery rates as compared with production sharing contracts favoured by oil majors. This emphasis on optimising production capacities in marginal fields can be extended to contracts governing recovery of main oilfields in an industry of rapidly depleting resources. Currently, Petronas’ recovery factor is about 26% for main oilfields, which can be further improved with optimised production techniques and knowledge exchange.\\"Risk Service Contract Framework\\", web, Worldvest Asia Pacific, 2012. * Marginal Fields are located within a producing block and its main product is oil; * The IOC provides technical, financial, managerial or commercial services to the state from exploration through production; * Risk service contracts – the IOC bears all the exploration costs; * Petronas retains ownership of oil; * The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is estimated at between 7% – 20% subject to terms and conditions – more attractive ROI than a PSC regime; * Contractor receives fee payment commencing from first production and throughout the duration of the contract * Fee is subject to taxes – but to incentivise investment in marginal fields Malaysia has reduced tax for from 38% to 25%, to improve commercial viability of investment projects; According to think tank, Arc Media Global, while efficient, the RSC is essentially a contract that significantly increases an operator’s risks of exposure.

The armies of France and Germany had completed their mobilisation, the French with Plan XVII, to conduct an offensive through Lorraine and Alsace into Germany and the Germans with Aufmarsch II West, for an offensive in the north through Luxembourg and Belgium into France, supplemented with attacks in the south to prevent the French from transferring troops to the greater threat in the north.  Background  =Belgium= Belgian military planning was based on the assumption that other powers would uphold Belgian neutrality by expelling an invader. The likelihood of a German invasion did not lead the Belgian government to see France and Britain as potential allies nor did it intend to do more than protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904) had led the Belgians to perceive that the British attitude to Belgium had changed and that they would fight to protect Belgian independence. A General Staff was formed in 1910 but the , Lieutenant-Général Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced by Lieutenant-General Chevalier de Selliers de Moranville until May 1914. Moranville began planning for the concentration of the army and met railway officials on 29 July. Belgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the National redoubt of Belgium ready to face any border, while the Fortified Position of Liège and Fortified Position of Namur were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan, the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment, in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river, with two divisions forward at Liège and Namur. =Aufmarsch II West= German strategy had given priority to offensive operations against France and a defensive posture against Russia since 1891. German planning was determined by numerical inferiority, the speed of mobilisation and concentration and the effect of the vast increase of the power of modern weapons. Frontal attacks were expected to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised their fortifications on the frontiers with Germany. Alfred von Schlieffen Chief of the Imperial German General Staff (Oberste Heeresleitung, OHL) from devised a plan to evade the French frontier fortifications with an offensive on the northern flank with a local numerical superiority. By 1898–1899, such a manoeuvre was intended to rapidly pass through Belgium, between Antwerp and Namur and threaten Paris from the north. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan, to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants to the plan, by adding divisions to the left flank opposite the French frontier, from the expected to be mobilised in the (Western Army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium and attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on the left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine, unable to withdraw into central France. The French would either be annihilated or the manoeuvre from the north would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine on the common border. =Plan XVII= Under Plan XVII, the French peacetime army was to form five field armies of with groups of Reserve divisions attached to each army and a group of reserve divisions on the flanks. The armies were to concentrate opposite the German frontier around Épinal, Nancy and Verdun–Mezières, with an army in reserve around Ste. Ménéhould and Commercy. Since 1871, railway building had given the French General staff sixteen lines to the German frontier against thirteen available to the German army and the French could wait until German intentions were clear. The French deployment was intended to be ready for a German offensive in Lorraine or through Belgium. It was anticipated that the Germans would use reserve troops but also expected that a large German army would be mobilised on the border with Russia, leaving the western army with sufficient troops only to advance through Belgium, south of the Meuse and the Sambre rivers. French intelligence had obtained a 1905 map exercise of the German general staff, in which German troops had gone no further north than Namur and assumed that plans to besiege Belgian forts were a defensive measure against the Belgian army. A German attack from south-eastern Belgium towards Mézières and a possible offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and St. Dié was anticipated; the plan was a development of Plan XVI and made more provision for the possibility of a German offensive through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between Épinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from Montmédy to Sedan and Mézières and the Fourth Army was to be held back west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or south against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but joint arrangements had been made and during the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, the French had been told that six divisions could be expected to operate around Maubeuge. =Declarations of war= At midnight on the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of during the day; the Turkish government ordered mobilisation and the London Stock Exchange closed. On 1 August, the British government ordered the mobilisation of the navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier, the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding passage through Belgian territory and German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, Libau was bombarded by the German light cruiser and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August, the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British Government guaranteed military support to Belgium, should Germany invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August, the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany which expired at midnight on Central European Time. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops crossed the Belgian frontier and attacked Liège. Prelude =German offensive preparations= The 6th Army deployed in the XXI and XVI corps areas from the Vosges north to Metz, the III Corps arriving from and moving to the border from Beux to Béchy and Rémilly, the II Bavarian Corps deployed from from Lucy to Château Salins and Moerchingen and the XXI Corps mobilised around Dieuze on 10 August and moved a brigade of the 42nd Division to Igney, as a flank guard for the I Bavarian Corps. On 11 August a French night attack was repulsed but events in the Vosges led to the I Bavarian Corps moving quickly to Eyweiler and Sieweiler. Battle The main French offensive in the south began on 14 August, when the First Army (General Auguste Dubail) advanced with two corps into the Vosges and two corps north-east towards Sarrebourg, as the two right-flank corps of the Second Army (General de Castelnau) advanced on the left of the First Army. One corps and the Second Group of Reserve Divisions advanced slowly towards Morhange in echelon, as a flank guard against a German attack from Metz. The First Army had captured several passes further south since 8 August, to protect the southern flank as the army advanced to Donon and Sarrebourg. Despite warnings from Joffre against divergence, the army was required to advance towards the Vosges passes to the south-east, eastwards towards Donon and north-east towards Sarrebourg. German troops withdrew during the day, Donon was captured and on the left flank, an advance of was made. At dusk the 26th Division of the XIII Corps attacked Cirey and was engaged by artillery and machine-guns, which repulsed the French with many casualties. On 15 August, the Second Army reported that German long-range artillery had been able to bombard the French artillery and infantry undisturbed and that dug-in German infantry had inflicted many casualties on the French as they attacked. The Second Army had to attack methodically after artillery preparation but managed to push back the Germans. Intelligence reports identified a main line of resistance of the German 6th Army and 7th Army (combined under Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria) close to the advanced French troops and that a counter- offensive was imminent. On 16 August, the Germans opposed the advance with long-range artillery-fire and on 17 August, the First Army reinforced the advance on Sarrebourg. When the Germans were found to have left the city, Joffre ordered the Second Army to incline further to the north, which had the effect of increasing the divergence of the French armies. A German counter- attack on 20 August, forced separate battles on the French armies, which were defeated and retreated in disorder. The German pursuit was slow and Castelnau was able to occupy positions east of Nancy and extend the right wing towards the south, to regain touch with the First Army. During 22 August, the right flank was attacked and driven back from the position that the offensive had begun on 14 August.

United States Senator William Proxmire, a Democrat from Wisconsin, began to issue the Golden Fleece Award in 1975 in monthly press releases. The Washington Post once referred to the award as \\"the most successful public relations device in politics today.\\" Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, referred to the award as being \\"as much a part of the Senate as quorum calls and filibusters.\\" Award William Proxmire, a United States Senator who represented the Democratic Party from Wisconsin, issued the award monthly from 1975 until 1988, his Senate retirement. In total, he issued 168 Golden Fleece Awards. Though some members of the United States House of Representatives asked Proxmire's permission to continue the award, he declined, saying he might continue to issue them as a private citizen. Other organizations patterned their own \\"Golden Fleece Awards\\" after Proxmire's. The Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan federal budget watchdog organization, gave Proxmire their lifetime achievement award in 1999, and revived the Golden Fleece Award in 2000. Proxmire served as an honorary chairman of the organization. One winner of the Golden Fleece Award, behavioral scientist Ronald Hutchinson, sued Proxmire for libel, requesting $8 million in damages, in 1976. Proxmire claimed that his statements about Hutchinson's research were protected by the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled, in Hutchinson v. Proxmire,, 61 L.Ed. 2d 411, 99 S.Ct. 2675 (1979). that the protection of speech and debate of lawmakers in the Constitution did not shield Proxmire from liability for defamatory statements made outside of formal congressional proceedings. The case was later settled out of court. Proxmire continued to present the award following the suit. Criticism In his 2014 book Creativity, Inc., Pixar President Ed Catmull spoke of the \\"chilling effect on research\\" The Golden Fleece Award exerts. He argues that when you fund thousands of research projects, some have measurable, positive impacts and that others don't. It is not possible to predict what the results of every research project would be or whether they would have value. He further argues that failure in research is essential and that fear of failure would distort the way researchers choose projects, which would ultimately impede progress. Award winners Winners of the Golden Fleece Award included governmental organizations like the United States Department of Defense, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service; research projects have been particularly well represented. The National Science Foundation (NSF) won the first Golden Fleece Award for spending $84,000 on a study on love. Proxmire reasoned that: The Federal Aviation Administration was named for spending $57,800 on a study of the physical measurements of 432 airline stewardesses, that included the \\"distance from knee to knee while sitting\\", and \\"the politeal [sic] length of the buttocks.\\" He also gave the award to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for their Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) program, supporting the scientific search for extraterrestrial civilizations. Proxmire later withdrew his opposition to the SETI program. It is widely believed he gave the award to a study of the sex life of the screwworm fly, the results of which led scientists to create sterile screwworms that were released into the wild and eliminated this major cattle parasite from North and Central America, and reduced the cost of beef and dairy products across the globe. However, there is no evidence for this claim in the archives of the Award held by the Wisconsin Historical Society. Furthermore, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-funded research on the sex life of the screwworm fly took place in the 1930s through 1950s, long before the Golden Fleece era of the 1970s and 80s, when Proxmire largely targeted contemporary research. The erroneous claim seems to stem from a speech by a former Director of the National Science Foundation, who stated that Proxmire gave the award to an NSF grant entitled, \\"The Sexual Behavior of the Screwworm Fly,\\" and later \\"freely admitted that the study of the sex life of the screwworm fly had been of major significance to progress in this important field.\\" Other award winners included: * Paul Ekman's research that led to the development of the controversial Facial Action Coding System * National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) funded project by psychologist Harris Rubin for $121,000, on developing \\"some objective evidence concerning marijuana's effect on sexual arousal by exposing groups of male pot-smokers to pornographic films and measuring their responses by means of sensors attached to their penises * National Science Foundation for spending $103,000 to compare aggressiveness in sun fish that drink tequila as opposed to gin * National Institute for Mental Health for spending $97,000 to study, among other things, what went on in a Peruvian brothel; the researchers said they made repeated visits in the interests of accuracy * Office of Education for spending $219,592 in a \\"curriculum package\\" to teach college students how to watch television * United States Department of the Army for a 1981 study on how to buy Worcestershire sauce * United States Department of Commerce (Economic Development Administration) for spending $20,000 to build a 10-story replica of the Great Wall of China in Bedford, Indiana.

Although it was never released as a single, it has become a fan favorite and a song that Joel plays regularly in concert. Joel famously played the song at The Concert for New York City, the October 2001 benefit concert for the New York City Fire and Police Departments and the loved ones of families of first responders lost during the terrorist attack on New York City on 9/11. He reprised that theme, playing it during his set at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden in New York City on December 12, 2012, where he changed lyrics to include the likes of \\"Breezy Point\\". Inspiration Joel wrote the song after returning to the East Coast from Los Angeles, where he had spent the previous three years. In fact, most of Turnstiles deals with Joel's cross-country relocation, including \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", \\"I've Loved These Days\\", \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\", and \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway).\\" The inspiration for the song came from his pride in returning home to New York. Joel was literally \\"takin' a Greyhound [bus] on the Hudson River Line [route]\\" when the idea for the song came to him, and the song was written as soon as Joel arrived home. Different sax solos There are three studio versions of the song. The original version featured Richie Cannata on saxophone and appeared on the original Turnstiles album. Contrary to some sources, the sax solo on \\"New York State of Mind\\" was never re-recorded by Phil Woods for the release of Greatest Hits. The only time that Phil Woods performed on a Billy Joel recording was the song \\"Just the Way You Are\\" in 1977. The Quadrophonic LP release differs from both the original release & Greatest Hits version. Personnel *Billy Joel – piano, vocals *Ken Ascher – orchestral arrangements *Richie Cannata – saxophone *Liberty DeVitto – drums *Doug Stegmeyer – bass Covers Since Joel first recorded and released the song in 1976, it has become a pop standard that has been covered by numerous artists, including Barbra Streisand, Lea Michele and Melissa Benoist, Joanna Wang, Elton John, Ramin Karimloo, Shirley Bassey, Oleta Adams, Carmen McRae, Mark-Almond, Diane Schuur, Ben Sidran, Leslie West, RWB Ralph Williams Band, Mel Tormé, Frank Sinatra, Adam Pascal, and Tony Bennett. Joel also said in an interview with Rolling Stone that he had wanted Ray Charles to record the song.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/billy-joel-is-angry-236693/ Bennett and Joel recorded a duet of the song for Bennett's 2001 album Playin' with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues and received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2002 Grammy Awards. The two performed the song on the award telecast that night. They performed the song again at Shea Stadium during Joel's concert in 2008 to commemorate the closing of the stadium. Joel has also performed duets of the song with Elton John during their collaborative Face-To-Face Tour, with the country singer Garth Brooks during Brooks' Central Park Concert in 1997, and with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band as one of Springsteen's special guests during his performance at the \\"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary Concert\\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City on October 29, 2009. The song was played in Boston by Emma Stanganelli, most notably in a duet with Billy Joel in Fenway Park during his 2014 tour. In 2014, Joel re-recorded the song as a duet with Barbra Streisand - who had previously covered the song in 1977 - for her album Partners. Deana Martin recorded “New York State Of Mind” on her 2016 album Swing Street.  In popular culture  =On television shows= The Muppets' Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem performed the song on episode 2.9 of The Muppet Show featuring Madeline Kahn, for use as a UK spot. Floyd Pepper performed the lead vocals and played his bass guitar, with backup from Zoot on saxophone and Dr. Teeth on piano. They sang it again on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson episode on April 2, 1979, when Kermit guest hosted the show. It was also recorded by Muppet Rowlf the Dog in 1984 and released on this album Ol' Brown Ears is Back in 1993. Lea Michele and Melissa Benoist performed the song during the first episode of season 4 of the TV show Glee. It reached twenty-four on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The song was also performed by Bernadette Peters in the final episode of the first season of the TV show Katy Keene. =In movies= In the 2004 film Garfield: The Movie, Garfield sings a parody of the song entitled, \\"New Dog State of Mind\\" after he is kicked out of the house for one night by his owner Jon for making a big mess in the house. Instead, he favors Odie more than Garfield. = In books= In 2004, it was announced that Joel had agreed to write two children's books for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher. The first book was entitled Goodnight, My Angel (A Lullabye). The second book was entitled New York State of Mind and is illustrated by the artist Izak. The large picture book comes with a CD of the song, the disc is illustrated with a picture of the Empire State Building by Izak. =Sports= This song is played after every New York Boulders home loss at Palisades Credit Union Park and at the conclusion of the live racing day at Saratoga Race Course. It was previously played after New York Mets games at Shea Stadium.

This is done to increase fuel efficiency while under varying loads. Variable compression engines allow the volume above the piston at top dead centre to be changed. Higher loads require lower ratios to increase power, while lower loads need higher ratios to increase efficiency, i.e. to lower fuel consumption. For automotive use this needs to be done as the engine is running in response to the load and driving demands. The 2019 Infiniti QX50 is the first commercially available vehicle that uses a variable compression ratio engine.  Advantages  Gasoline engines have a limit on the maximum pressure during the compression stroke, after which the fuel/air mixture detonates rather than burns. To achieve higher power outputs at the same speed, more fuel must be burned and therefore more air is needed. To achieve this, turbochargers or superchargers are used to increase the inlet pressure. This would result in detonation of the fuel/air mixture unless the compression ratio was decreased, i.e. the volume above the piston made greater. This can be done to a greater or lesser extent with massive increases in power being possible. The down side of this is that under light loading, the engine can lack power and torque. The solution is to be able to vary the inlet pressure and adjust the compression ratio to suit. This gives the best of both worlds, a small efficient engine capable of great power on demand. In addition, VCR allows free use of different fuels besides petrol e.g. LPG or ethanol. Cylinder displacement is altered by using a hydraulic system connected to the crank shaft, and adjusted according to the load and acceleration required.  Production  Variable compression engines have existed for decades but only in laboratories for the purposes of studying combustion processes. These designs usually have a second adjustable piston set in the head opposing the working piston. In 2018 Infiniti began production of their variable compression turbo engine, which uses a mechanical linkage to achieve the variability. It was installed in their QX50 SUV. The engine can produce any compression ratio from 8:1 to 14:1. The highest torque is achieved at 8:1, giving high acceleration, while the best gas mileage (fuel efficiency) is achieved at 14:1. The electronic engine controller responds to the pressure on the gas pedal, in real-time, altering the compression ratio seamlessly. Although this engine has a displacement of 2.0 L, and is an inline-four engine, it does not use balance shafts to eliminate the secondary vibrations. It is inherently balanced by the mechanical linkage.  Two-stroke engines  Due to the comparative simplicity of cylinderhead design (lacking intake valves) it is somewhat easier to implement in two-stroke engines. From the late 90s on up models which expand on this idea have been available, such as from Yamaha, which dynamically vary the size of the combustion chamber. As of late (in the 2000s) this technology has seen some renewed interest, due it being able to burn a wide range of fuels (e.g. including alcohols) such as the Lotus Omnivore.Green Car Congress: Lotus, QUB and Jaguar to Develop Variable Compression Ratio, 2-Stroke OMNIVORE Research Engine Lotus Engineering Omnivore Variable Compression Ratio Engine to Debut in Geneva Engine designs The first VCR engine built and tested was by Harry Ricardo in the 1920s. This work led to him devising the octane rating system that is still in use today. Many companies have been undertaking their own research into VCR Engines, including Saab, Nissan, Volvo, PSA/Peugeot-Citroën and Renault.Variable compression ratio engines The 2018 Infiniti QX50 will be available with a production version turbocharged variable compression engine.http://www.autonews.com/article/20171121/BLOG06/171129932/a-look- inside-the-infiniti-vc-turbo- enginehttps://www.infinitiusa.com/now/technology/vc-turbo-engine =Peugeot MCE-5= Principle of the MCE-5 (\\"Multi Cycle Engine - 5 parameters\\"), the variable compression ratio engine made by Peugeot. The Peugeot design works by varying the effective length of the con-rods connecting the piston to the crank. When the con-rod is shorter, the compression ratio is lower and vice versa. On the left hand-side of the diagram is the conventional piston of an internal combustion engine. On the right is an hydraulic cylinder with double- acting piston. This acts through a rod-crank system with a gear wheel, whose movement adjusts the effective con-rod length and thus the compression ratio in the left cylinder.Motortrend.com, February 25, 2009 . =Saab SVC= SAAB Automobile rekindled interest in variable compression when they introduced their SVC engine to the world at the Geneva motor show in 2000. SAAB had been involved in working with the 'Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies', to produce a modern petrol VCR engine that showed an efficiency comparable with that of a Diesel. The SAAB SVC was an advanced and workable addition to the world of VCR engines, but it never reached production due to the company's bankruptcy. The design, an implementation of the Larsen VCR engine, consisted of a monobloc head, which contained all of the valve gear, and the crankshaft/crankcase assembly. These parts were connected by a pivot which allowed 4 degrees of movement controlled by a hydraulic actuator. This mechanism allows the distance between the crankshaft centre line and the cylinder crown to be varied. Unlike the Peugeot design, the effective con-rod length is fixed. A supercharger was chosen in preference to a turbocharger to achieve the necessary response time and high boost pressure. To alter Vc, the SVC 'lowers' the cylinder head closer to the crankshaft. It does this by replacing the typical one-part engine block with a two-part unit, with the crankshaft in the lower block and the cylinders in the upper portion. The two blocks are hinged together at one side (imagine a book, lying flat on a table, with the front cover held an inch or so above the title page). By pivoting the upper block around the hinge point, the Vc (imagine the air between the front cover of the book and the title page) can be modified. In practice, the SVC adjusts the upper block through a small range of motion, using a hydraulic actuator. =Gomecsys VCR Technology (state of 2012) = Gomecsys Gen4 VCR crankshaft for a 4-inline engine Gomecsys is a Dutch Engineering company that has developed its own variable compression ratio technology. Strong improvements have been made over the last 5 years and currently the company has its 4th generation VCR engines running on the dyno. One of the big advantages of the system is the simplicity. The complete VCR system is integrated on the crankshaft and every 4 stroke engine can be upgraded by replacing a normal crankshaft with a Gomecsys VCR crankshaft. Additional fuel saving technologies incorporated in the system boost the overall CO2 reduction to 18%, and that's without downsizing. =Infiniti VC-Turbo= The Infiniti VC-Turbo is an in-line four-cylinder turbocharged engine which uses a mechanical linkage to alter the compression ratio. The linkage is actuated by an electric stepping motor, which rotates a lower camshaft. The camshaft moves a linkage-rod that attaches to and rotates a three-hole lever arm. The center hole contains the crankshaft, and the final hole attaches to the connecting rod. Moving the linkage-rod up, lowers the connecting rod, making the compression ratio greater. here,due to opposite direction of force acted on lower cam shaft and from connecting rod it reduce the vibration.so, counter shaft is reduced and mass of lower camshaft and electric motor camshaft rod adding mass into the engine.

The North American Carbon Program (NACP) is one of the major elements of the Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. The central objective of NACP is to measure and understand carbon stocks and sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) in North America and adjacent ocean regions. This program consists of multiple agencies that focus on changes to the carbon cycle. Not only does this program rely on research conducted by multiple agencies, but it is also supported by federal agencies that assist in the funding of this program. To ensure the plan is effective, the Science Leadership Group (SLG) works to communicate among government program managers, independent research groups, and multiple institutions not affiliated to the government as well. Alongside the SLG, there is the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group (CCIWG), which interacts across agencies and ensures the efficiency of research about the carbon cycle in the United States. It works with 11 federal agencies like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The CCIWG specializes in communicating among agencies for the proposal of new projects, secures resources for the various research programs available, and reports results to the public.  Program Goals  The specific program goals are as followed: Develop quantitative scientific knowledge, robust observations, and models to determine the emissions and uptake of CO2, CH4, and CO, changes in carbon stocks, and the factors regulating these processes for North America and adjacent ocean basins. Develop the scientific basis to implement full carbon accounting on regional and continental scales. This is the knowledge base needed to design monitoring programs for natural and managed CO2 sinks and emissions of CH4. Support long-term quantitative measurements of fluxes, sources, and sinks of atmospheric CO2 and CH4, and develop forecasts for future trends. The North American Carbon Program was designed to help with the process of providing data needed to model the synthesis activities.  The Carbon Cycle  This diagram simplifies the carbon cycle, a complex cycle that the North American Carbon Program focuses on. The carbon cycle is subdivided into two sections, the rapid carbon exchange, and long-term cycling of carbon through the various geological processes. = Rapid exchange = This carbon cycle occurs in our biological processes, including respiration, photosynthesis, and is generated by autotrophs. Autotrophs (usually photosynthetic) are plants or algae, which capture the carbon dioxide from the air. In water, the compounds removed are bicarbonate ions. They are converted into organic compounds like glucose. Heterotrophs consume the glucose, which further breaks down the compounds and passes them through webs (this process is called cellular respiration). Living systems and decomposers release the carbons as carbon dioxide. This carbon is cycled quickly, with estimates of 1,000 to 1000,000 million metric tons of carbon cycling through these pathways in a single year. = Long-term exchange = Like its name implies, this pathway takes longer than the pathway above, sometimes lasting millions of years. This form of carbon is found in rocks, in the ocean and other bodies of water, inside the core, and in fossil fuels. It is also found in the atmosphere, where it reacts with water and forms calcium carbonate- found in the shells of marine organisms which later become part of the sediment on the ocean floor. Over time, the remains of shells, plants, and animals form fossils that are later decomposed and released once again as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Through volcanoes and eruptions, as well as hydrothermal vents, carbon dioxide is released.

The French were planning an attack across the Sambre River, when the Germans attacked first, forced back the French from the river and nearly cut off the French retreat by crossing the Meuse around Dinant and getting behind the French right flank. The French were saved by a counter-attack at Dinant and the re-direction of the 3rd Army to the north- west in support of the 2nd Army, rather than south-west. Battle By 20 August, the Fifth Army (General Charles Lanrezac) had begun to concentrate on a front along the Sambre, centred on Charleroi and extending east to the Belgian fortress of Namur. The Cavalry Corps (General André Sordet) covered the Fifth Army's left flank and the concentration of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) at Mons. The French had 15 divisions, after transfers of troops to Lorraine, facing 18 German divisions from the 2nd Army (General Karl von Bülow) and 3rd Army (Colonel-General Max von Hausen) moving south-west from Luxembourg towards the Meuse. =21 August= On the morning of the 21st, French Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre reported to Lanrezac (and to the BEF) that German troops were moving west. In accordance with Plan XVII, the Third and Fourth armies further south were to move towards, respectively, Arlon and Neufchâteau, then seek to attack enemy forces in Belgian Luxembourg. The Fifth Army was ordered to cover the Meuse up to Namur, and the British were to cooperate in this action by moving in the general direction of Soignies, north-east of Mons. In accordance with this, Lanrezac positioned the Fifth Army on the Sambre, and reported his actions to Joffre later in the day, around 12:30. Unbeknownst to him at the time, German elements had clashed with his vanguards, between Namur and Charleroi. Lanrezac was made aware of this by a report from General Augustin Michel, commander at Namur, received at 14:00. Lanrezac was told by General Headquarters around 16:00 that the Germans were still moving west, and in consequence ordered his aviation to reconnoitre enemy troop movements and informed his subordinates that they should \\"be ready to launch an attack [...] by crossing the Sambre, towards Namur and Nivelles.\\" At 20:00, having reported only minor action on the 10th Corps front to Joffre at 19:00, Lanrezac was instructed by the latter that he had total discretion to decide of the appropriate moment to start his offensive. By the evening, vanguards from the 19th Division, between Floriffoux and Jemeppe-sur-Sambre, had pushed back German assaults. However, reports from prisoners indicated that there was a strong German presence. Further west, Arsimont, guarded initially by a battalion and then reinforced by a regiment from the 20th Division, was abandoned by 21:00 and the easternmost elements were ordered to retreat by the corps commander, Defforges, who organized positions around Fosse in coordination with the 1st and the 3rd Corps. This meant the Germans had succeeded in crossing the Sambre. On the 3rd Corps front, outposts of the 5th Division were attacked around 15:00. Despite initial failures, the Germans continued with their attacks and forced a passage at Tamines, Roselies and Aiseau. A French counter-attack retook Aiseau, but failed in pushing the Germans back from any other bridgehead. At 23:00, corps commander Sauret reported to Lanrezac that the 5th Division was continuing efforts to retake the bridges. =22 August= In a report the following morning, Lanrezac confirmed to Joffre the violence on the German attack on Namur. Reporting the actions of the 10th and 3rd Corps, he requested that the Fourth Army \\"makes itself felt as soon as possible\\". On the French right flank, General d'Espèrey ordered the 1st Corps troops to make movements in preparation of an offensive action. At the same time, he hastened the relief of the 2nd Division by the 51st Reserve Division. The offensive movements were stopped by an attack of the XII Saxon Corps, which attacked advanced elements of the Dinant and Anseremme bridges. Although this attack did not prevent the relief of his own troops, Espèrey reported that he would be unable to reinforce the Sambre because of it around 13:00. Authorization to blow all Meuse bridges except those at Givet, Hastière and Dinant was asked for and granted by Lanrezac at 14:15. Attacks were also launched by the Germans on the remainder of the Fifth Army front. =23 August= Fighting continued on 23 August when the French centre around Charleroi began to fall back. The 3rd Army crossed the Meuse and attacked the French right flank, held by I Corps. The attack threatened to cut the line of retreat of the Fifth Army but I Corps stopped the German advance with a counter-attack. With the evacuation of Namur and news of the Fourth Army retreat from the Ardennes, Lanrezac ordered the Fifth Army to withdraw, lest he be encircled and cut off from the rest of the French army. The German army was victorious. Aftermath =Analysis= German advance through Belgium, August 1914 The Fifth Army retreat after the Battle of Charleroi, arguably saved the French army from decisive defeat, as it prevented the much sought envelopment of the Schlieffen plan. After fighting another defensive action in the Battle of St. Quentin, the French were pushed to within miles of Paris. Lanrezac was sacked by Joffre on 3 September (four days after General Pierre Ruffey, the Third Army commander) and replaced by d'Espèrey. The 1934 work by the French Fascist and writer Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, The Comedy of Charleroi, explores the author's role in the battle. =Casualties= In 2001 Brose recorded Army losses and Edward Spears in the 1999 edition of Liaison 1914 (1930) recorded 11,000 casualties in the German 2nd Army which took 4,000 French prisoners and 35 guns.

Wine fraud relates to the commercial aspects of wine. The most prevalent type of fraud is one where wines are adulterated, usually with the addition of cheaper products (e.g. juices) and sometimes with harmful chemicals and sweeteners (compensating for color or flavor). Counterfeiting and the relabelling of inferior and cheaper wines to more expensive brands is another common type of wine fraud. A third category of wine fraud relates to the investment wine industry. An example of this is when wines are offered to investors at excessively high prices by a company who then go into planned liquidation. In some cases the wine is never bought for the investor. Losses in the UK have been high, prompting the Department of Trade and Industry and Police to act. In the US, investors have been duped by fraudulent investment wine firms. Independent guidelines to potential wine investors are now available. In wine production, as wine is technically defined as fermented grape juice, the term \\"wine fraud\\" can be used to describe the adulteration of wine by substances that are not related to grapes. In the retailing of wine, as wine is comparable with any other commodity, the term \\"wine fraud\\" can be used to describe the mis-selling of wine (either as an investment or in its deceitful misrepresentation) in general. Fraud in wine production refers to the use of additives in order to deceive. This may include coloring agents such as elderberry juice, and flavorings such as cinnamon at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark color and flavor notes of spices due to the presence of various phenolic compounds found in the skin of the grapes. Fraudsters will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine has seen much attention focused on label fraud and the investment wine market. Counterfeit labelling of rare, expensive, and cult wines, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. Wine Spectator noted as much as 5% of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeitM. Frank, Wine Spectator ( January 31-February 28, 2007). \\"Counterfeit bottles multiply as global demand for collectible wine surges\\", p.14 and the DTI (UK) believes losses by investors to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. History During the classical period, wine was so often adulterated and counterfeited that Pliny the Elder complained that not even the nobility could be assured that their wine was genuine. For as long as wine has been made, it has been manipulated, adulterated, and counterfeited. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder complained about the abundance of fraudulent Roman wine which was so great that even the nobility could not be assured that the wine they were pouring on their table was genuine. For the poor and middle class of Rome, local bar establishments seemed to have an unlimited supply of the prestigious Falernian wine for unusually low prices.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 4 & 26-27 Oxford University Press 2006 During the Middle Ages, wines from questionable origins were often passed off as wines from more prestigious regions. In London, local authorities established laws for tavern owners prohibiting French, Spanish, and German wines from being cellared together so as to prevent the potential for mixing the wines or falsely representing them to the consumer. If a producer or merchant was found selling fraudulent or \\"corrupt wine\\", they were forced to drink all of it. In medieval Germany, the penalty for selling fraudulent wine ranged from branding to beating to death by hanging. During the Age of Enlightenment, advancements in science ushered in a new occupation of \\"wine doctors\\" who could fashion examples of wines from obscure items and chemicals. Writers like Joseph Addison wrote of this \\"fraternity of chymical operators (sic)\\" who would use apples to make Champagne and sloe to make Bordeaux and then sell these wines fraudulently on the market. Following the Phylloxera epidemic, when true wine was scarce, wine fraud rose. Some merchants would take dried raisins grown from other species of grapevines and make wine that they passed off as being from a more prestigious provenance such as the more well known wines from France or Italy. In the early 19th century, several European writers wrote about the risk and prevalence of wine fraud. In 1820, German chemist Friedrich Accum noted that wine was one of the commodities most at risk for being fraudulently manipulated and misrepresented. In 1833, the British wine writer Cyrus Redding echoed the alarm over the unchecked operations of these \\"wine doctors\\". Eventually the concern over wine fraud grew enough that provisions against the adulteration and misrepresentation of wine was included in British Parliament's Adulteration of Food and Drink Act 1860. Several European governments also enacted legislation defining what exactly constitutes \\"wine\\" so as to distinguish authentic winemaking from the workings of these wine counterfeiters. The French government first legally defined wine as the product of fermented grape juice in 1889, followed by the German government in 1892 (later expanded in 1909) and the Italian government in 1904. Fraud of a different nature occurred during prohibition in the United States, when wine production was illegal, as grape merchants would sell \\"bricks\\" of grape concentrate across the United States along with a packet of dried yeast. The bricks would come with a \\"warning label\\" cautioning people not to mix the contents of the brick, yeast, water, and sugar in a pot and then seal such pot for seven days, or else \\"an illegal alcoholic beverage will result\\".K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 630-631 Workman Publishing 2001 =Practices that were once considered fraudulent= The practice of adding grape spirits to wine was once considered manipulative and fraudulent, but today is accepted practice for the production of all fortified wines, like Port. Over the years, winemaking techniques have evolved. The first, primitive \\"natural wine\\" or \\"authentic wine\\" was most likely the result of crushed grapes being forgotten while stored in a container. The process of allowing wild yeast found on the surface of the grape conduct fermentation in an uncontrolled environment creates a very crude style of wine that may not be palatable to many people, hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as \\"manipulating\\" or \\"adulterating\\" the wine from its natural or \\"authentic state\\". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered “too much” manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as \\"fraud\\". However as these techniques became more common place in the wine industry, they gained an air of acceptability and eventually became just another tool in the winemaker's tool box to help craft good-quality wine.D. Bird Understanding Wine Technology pgs 1-7, 223-233 DBQA Publishing 2005 Most techniques of manipulation arose from need. Early wine had many wine faults that caused a wine to spoil quickly. Classical writings from the Greeks and Romans detailed recipes that could cure \\"sick wines\\". These include adding various items like milk, ground mustard, ashes, nettles, and lead. Another example of early \\"manipulation\\" that became accepted, common practice was the process of adding grape spirit to wine made in the Douro region of Portugal. This process of fortification gave the wine chemical stability for long sea voyages and, when added during the fermentation process, left the wine with a balance of residual sugar and alcohol content that gave the wine a unique taste. This style of wine became very popular on the world wine market. Today the accepted way to make Port is to \\"manipulate\\" it by adding brandy during the fermentation process. Other winemaking techniques that have been at various times considered fraudulent or too manipulative of the wine include chaptalization, fermenting and aging in oak barrels, using oak chips, stirring lees, racking, clarification and filtration, reverse osmosis, cold maceration, the use of cultured instead of wild yeast, cryo-extraction, micro-oxygenation, and the addition of enzymes, anti-oxidant agents, acids or other sugars that may be used to \\"balance\\" the wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 424-425 Oxford University Press 2006 Adding water to wine While some winemaking techniques once considered fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices have gone in the opposite direction. One of the most controversial is adding water to wine in a technique known today as humidification. Master of wine Jancis Robinson calls the act of adding water to \\"stretch out\\" or dilute wine \\"possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book.\\"J. Robinson \\"Adding water to wine\\" Purple Pages, December 31st 2002 There is a long history of adding water to dilute wine in order to make it more palatable. The ancient Greeks thought it was \\"barbaric\\" to drink undiluted wine. They further believed that undiluted wine was unhealthy and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 762 Oxford University Press 2006 Today water is used to help balance extremely ripe grapes that would have a concentration of sugars and phenolic compounds. Modern winemaking has begun to promote higher levels of ripeness and longer \\"hang time\\" on the vine before harvesting. This increased emphasis on ripeness has had the effect of producing wines with higher alcohol levels (often over 15%). In many countries, such high alcohol levels qualify the wines for higher levels of duties and taxes. Adding water to grape must can dilute the wine to such a degree that the overall alcohol by volume drops below the percentage threshold for these higher taxes. The deliberate act of diluting a wine with water in order to pay lower duties and taxes is illegal in several countries. The gray area between accepted practice and fraud is where water is added to the winemaking process as a means of \\"quality preservation\\". Water is often used during the winemaking process to help pump grapes through equipment and to \\"rehydrate\\" the grapes that have begun to shrivel from the extended hang time. This rehydration is used to help balance the wine and, it is hoped, to prevent \\"dried fruit\\" flavors that may be unpalatable to the consumer. In the United States, the California Wine Institute has developed guidelines that allow for the addition of a certain amount of water to compensate for the loss of natural water in the vineyard from dehydration. The addition of water has been argued by its proponents as necessary to prevent stuck fermentations. Despite being allowed limited legal use, the practice of adding water to wine is still shrouded in controversy, and few winemakers willingly admit to it. A \\"code word\\" for the practice in the wine industry is adding \\"Jesus units\\" in a play on words about the Biblical story of the miracle performed at the Marriage at Cana where Jesus turned water into wine.J. Googe Too much of a good thing\\" Wine Business International April 6th, 2007B. Hewitt \\"Sere Grapes\\" The New York Times April 20th, 2008The Uncorker \\"Why It Matters Glossary #19, Accessed: December 8th, 2009 Label fraud Several European countries developed appellation systems, with their own unique labels and seals, to try to combat label fraud that misrepresented a wine's true origins. One form of fraud involves affixing counterfeit labels of expensive wines to bottles of less expensive wine. This practice became particularly prominent following the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as Southwest France or Calabria in Italy) and then labeling the wine as if it came from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or Tuscany. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive appellation systems and Protected Designation of Origin or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect the name of a wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of Chianti, Oporto and Tokaji. Today most major European wine producing countries have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well known systems include the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, and the Denominación de Origen (DO) system used in Spain. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities. As it became more difficult to fraudulently label wines with the wrong provenance, label fraud soon evolved to the pilfering of the identities of wine estates themselves. Merchants would take the bottles of lesser priced wines and label them with the names of the finest classified Bordeaux estates or Grand crus of Burgundy. Label fraud, to be done well, requires bottles, corks, and packaging to be similarly manipulated. Reporter \\"disclosed that many famous Champagne houses, when short on stock, bought bottled but unlabeled wine from cooperatives or one of the big private-label producers in the region, then sold it as their own\\".Prial, Frank. J, Decantations. NY: St. Martin's Griffin, 2001. Pp. 23-25. A high-profile instance of alleged wine fraud was disclosed in early 2007, when it was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened an investigation into the counterfeiting of old and rare vintages.Wilke, John, The Wall Street Journal (March 6, 2007). \\"U.S. Investigates Counterfeiting of Rare Wines\\"McCoy, Elin, Bloomberg.com (March 20, 2007). \\"Trophy Status and History Trump Taste in Fuss Over Old Wines\\" =Examples of label fraud= One of the most famous, alleged purveyors of label fraud is wine collector Hardy Rodenstock. In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, Robert M. Parker, Jr. and Michael Broadbent who at the time was a director at the London auction house Christie's and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of Château d'Yquem, including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare \\"Jefferson bottles\\", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the American president, Thomas Jefferson. American businessman Bill Koch bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.P. Keefe The Jefferson Bottles, The New Yorker pages 1-10, September 3, 2007Jancisrobinson.com, March 17, 2007: Flushing out wine fraud and fakes Another well-publicized example of label fraud is the case of Rudy Kurniawan; he was arrested on March 8, 2012 and indicted for fraud. Allegedly, Kurniwan was buying large stocks of negociant Burgundy and re-labeling them as more expensive wines, such as Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. He famously consigned several lots of Clos St. Denis from Domaine Ponsot from vintages long prior to any recorded production of Ponsot wines from that vineyard; the auction lots were withdrawn prior to bidding. In 2002, bottles of the weaker 1991 vintage of Château Lafite Rothschild were relabeled and sold as the acclaimed 1982 vintage in China. In 2000, Italian authorities uncovered a warehouse with nearly twenty thousand bottles of fake \\"Super Tuscan\\" 1995 Sassicaia and arrested a number of people including the group's salesperson, who was selling the fake wine out of the back of a Peugeot hatchback. =Preventive actions= Federal governments and individual producers have taken many efforts in order to curb the prevalence of wine fraud. One of the earliest such preventive measures was the founding of the Service de la Répression des Fraudes by the French government to detect and stamp out fraud among France's AOC wines. Some major producers are taking actions to prevent fraud of future vintages including marking bottles with engraved serial numbers on the glass and taking more control of the distribution process of their wines. However, for older vintages, the threat of fraud persists, although new techniques, like stable isotope analysis and isoscapes are likely to grow in importance. Wine blending The rumors that grapes other than Sangiovese (pictured) was being used in the production of Brunello di Montalcino triggered an investigation into the potential wine fraud. Some practices of manipulation and adulteration have gone through stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted as common practice. One of these is the practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that is lacking in the original wine. This most often occurred in the case of a wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often associated with being of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a teinturier) into a lighter wine could enhance the marketability of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular appellation (such as the controversy over the Brunellopoli scandal in Brunello di Montalcino). The gray area comes when inferior wine is being blended in with more expensive, higher quality wine in order to increase the total quantity of wine available to be sold at higher prices. This is a process known as \\"stretching\\" or \\"cutting in\\" the wine. During the 18th century, Bordeaux wine producers would often import wine from Spain, Rhone or the Languedoc to blend and stretch out their wine which they sold to the English as claret. While this practice would be frowned upon today by Bordeaux authorities, the French wine writer André Jullien noted that some merchants believed this practice was necessary in order for the claret to be agreeable with English tastes—a practice he describes as \\"travail à l'anglaise\\". =Examples of illegal blending= Reporter Doutrelant reported the comments of \\"a government inspector on the illegal use of sugar to boost the alcoholic content of Beaujolais-Villages: 'If the law had been enforced in 1973 and 1974, at least a thousand producers would have been put out of business'\\". The same writer explained how growers \\"planted Mourvèdre and Syrah, two low-yield grapes that give the wine finesse, strictly for the benefit of the government inspectors. Then, when the inspectors left, they grafted cheap, high-yield vines, Grenache and Carignan, back onto the vines\\". In March 2008, allegations were made against producers of Brunello di Montalcino that there were illegally blended other types of grape varieties into wine stipulated to be of 100% Sangiovese, allegedly to inflate production and increase profit, in a scandal termed \\"Brunellopoli\\". Many Burgundy wine shippers have been found guilty of blending inexpensive wine with red Burgundies and exporting them at exorbitant prices. The Vins Georges Duboeuf company was found guilty and fined in 2006 for illegally mixing Gamay from Beaujolais Villages with Beaujolais Cru grapes from Brouilly, and Moulin-à-Vent in the 2005 vintage. The issue was confined to a small percentage of the wine produced by Duboeuf; the affected wines that were wrongly labeled as Cru Beaujolais were declassified to Beaujolais Villages. Hazardous materials A dangerous form of wine fraud is the use of hazardous materials in the wine making. Ancient Romans and others used to blend lead acetate into their wine in order to add sweetness. One of the most dangerous forms of wine fraud is when producers add hazardous materials such as lead(II) acetate (\\"sugar of lead\\"), diethylene glycol, and methanol to wine in order to increase sweetness. Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the European Union and the American Food and Drug Administration, across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued certain wine producing countries in the 20th century. In 1985, diethylene glycol was added as an adulterant by some Austrian producers of white wines to make them sweeter and upgrade the dry wines to sweet wines; production of sweet wines is expensive and addition of sugar is easy to detect. In 1986, twenty-three people died because a fraudulent winemaker in Italy blended toxic methyl alcohol into his low-alcohol wine to increase its alcohol content.Poisoning Scandal Rocks Italian Wine Export Business Loren Jenkins, Washington Post, April 9, 1986TOP 10 WINE SCANDALS Rupert Millar, 17 August 2011ITALY ACTING TO END THE SALE OF METHANOL-TAINTED WINE ROBERTO SURO, New York Times, April 9, 1986How Italian Wine Was Contaminated DANIEL P.

He was a principal founding member of Dial Square F.C., later renamed Royal Arsenal, the team that are today known as Arsenal. Born in Burntisland, Fife, Danskin grew up in Kirkcaldy. He played as an amateur for Kirkcaldy Wanderers, and among their players were Jack McBean and Peter Connolly, two players who would later join Danskin at Royal Arsenal. In 1885 Danskin moved to London to find work, and took a job at the Dial Square workshop at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. There he met several football enthusiasts, amongst them Jack Humble and former Nottingham Forest players Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates. Together with Humble, Danskin is generally credited as the driving force behind the formation of a works football team, Dial Square FC. Danskin organised a whip-round amongst his fellow enthusiasts and purchased Dial Square's first football, and captained the team in their very first match against Eastern Wanderers on 11 December 1886; Dial Square won 6–0. Danskin continued to play for Royal Arsenal, as the club were soon renamed afterwards, for the next two years. However, after an injury incurred in a match against Clapton in January 1889, Danskin elected to step down from the side and only played a few more rare occasions after that. Arsenal turned professional in 1891, and although Danskin stood for election to the club's committee in 1892, he did not succeed in getting elected. He ended his official association with Arsenal and later became associated with a new works team from the area, Royal Ordnance Factories, which folded in circa 1896. He also officiated as a referee in local matches. He was still fond enough of Arsenal to attend their games, and his son Billy used to sell programmes at their Manor Ground as a child. 1888–89 season. Danskin is seated on the right hand end of the bench. He later started up his own bicycle manufacturing business in Plumstead, before moving to Coventry in 1907 to work for the Standard Motor Company. In his later life he was troubled by ill-health, caused by injuries to his legs in his footballing days, and took early retirement. Nevertheless, he was one of the few founding members of Arsenal to live to see the club's rise to success in the 1930s; he reportedly cheered the side's 1936 FA Cup win from his sickbed, while listening to the radio commentary.

In music, alternate bass is a performance technique on many instruments where the bass alternates between two notes, most often the root and the fifth of a triad or chord. The perfect fifth is often, but not always, played below the root, transposed down an octave creating a fourth interval. The alternation between the root note and the fifth scale degree below it creates the characteristic sound of the alternate bass. On the guitar and bass guitar this is accomplished with the right hand alternating between two or more strings, often the bottom two on the guitar. In the following example in the C major chord C is located on the fifth string while G is located on the adjacent sixth (lowest) string and in the F major chord F is located on the adjacent fourth string: Carter Family picking with alternate bass within and walking bass, in blue, between C and F major chords . Alternate bass lines are also used on the double bass in country music, bluegrass music and related genres. On the Stradella bass system commonly found on accordions, the left-hand bass- note buttons are arranged according to the circle of fifths. The bass button for the fifth is directly above the bass button for the root.

The institute provides legal services in the field of civil and human rights, and runs public campaigns, and legal, educational and legislative activities to promote democratic and liberal values, public accountability, control mechanisms and support the development of democratic institutions in Georgia. History The Liberty Institute was founded in 1996, shortly after the events related to Rustavi 2, an independent TV station which had had its broadcast licence revoked about a month earlier by the Georgian Ministry of Communications. This move was criticized as a violation of freedom of speech and threat to independent media. At the time, the non-governmental sector in Georgia was in early stages of development, with only a few civil rights organizations active, so the idea of an NGO focusing on defence of civil rights, particularly freedom of speech, was formed. The Liberty Institute has frequently been attacked by political opponents in government and extremist groups. On July 10, 2002, a group of 20 well-trained aggressors entered the office of the Liberty Institute and physically injured organization members Levan Ramishvili, Sozar Subari, David Zurabishvili, Giga Phrangishvili and Dali Tskitishvili, and ransacked the office. By chance, experts from the Council of Europe were present, and the incident received wide coverage in local and international media. Liberty Institute played an important role in the Rose Revolution in November 2003. After the revolution, most of its founders were elected to the Parliament of Georgia. Giga Bokeria became Deputy chairman of the Committee on Legal Issues, Member of Committee on Defense and Security, one of the leaders of United National Movement. He has authored many laws to strengthen human rights in Georgia. Givi Targamadze, became Chair of Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security. Together with some other members of Liberty Institute and Kmara was consulting Ukrainian opposition leaders on technique of non- violent struggle. Later on he also advised the leaders of the Kyrgyz opposition during the Tulip Revolution. David Zurabishvili in 2005 defected from United National Movement and now is member of opposition Republican Party of Georgia. In 2004 member of Liberty Institute Sozar Subari, was elected by Parliament of Georgia as Public Defender (Ombudsman) for 5 years term. Former member of Liberty Institute Gigi Ugulava became Mayor of Tbilisi. Former member of Liberty Institute Zurab Tchiaberashvili is Georgian Ambassador to Council of Europe. In 2005 member of Liberty Institute Tamar Kintsurashvili was elected by the Board Governors of Georgian Public Broadcaster as its first Director General. Konstantine Vardzelashvili became in 2004 firstly deputy minister of Justice, lately in 2006 - deputy chair of Constitutional Court of Georgia. Anna Zhvania was appointed initially as adviser to President, in 2006 she became first female head of Foreign Intelligence Special Service of Georgia. Now she serves as 1st deputy Minister of Educations and Science. Former Executive Director of Liberty Institute Akaki Minashvili was elected to Parliament of Georgia and in December 2008 he was elected as Chairman of Committee on Foreign Affairs. Before that he was Deputy Chairman of Committee on Legal Issues. Among its founders, only Levan Ramishvili stayed at Liberty Institute. He continues to work together with a new generation of civic activists, most of them leaders of Kmara movement. Activities In February 2003, following an extended campaign by the Liberty Institute, a constitutional amendment was adopted to introduce trial by jury in Georgia. 11 laws drafted by LI have been adopted by the Georgian Parliament. In 1999, the Parliament of Georgia adopted the General Administrative Code of Georgia, drafted by the Liberty Institute. This law provides for public access to public information and governmental meetings and lays down the legislative grounds for transparency and accountability of public institutions. Drafted with Liberty Institute's active involvement, the Laws on Higher Education and General Education adopted by parliament in 2004 and 2005 provide for guarantees of academic freedom and student rights. Two media and free speech laws adopted by parliament were also drafted by the institute: the Law on the Freedom of Speech and Expression and the Law on Broadcasting, which created one of the most liberal legal regimes for freedom of speech and expression. In addition, several policy concepts developed by the Liberty Institute have been adopted by the government, among them the Anti-Corruption Strategy and the Educational Reform Concept. The Liberty Institute is frequently quoted by Georgia's broadcasting and print media. LI experts have published 15 books, and the institute produces an annual report on human rights in Georgia. It produces a monthly magazine, Liberty. Apart from the Tbilisi head office, Liberty Institute operates five regional offices in Georgia, to provide citizens with legal consultancies. Other campaigns Aside from human rights advocacy, the institute has extended its focus to various other fields: *The Liberty Institute has worked to support investigative journalism in Georgia. Givi Targamadze, Chief Coordinator of the Journalistic Investigations Program of the Institute conducted a number of investigations that were published in newspapers, contributing to the dismissal of the Ministers of Communications, Agriculture, and Energy, in 1998-2000. In the context of anti-corruption campaigns, the Liberty Institute has frequently uncovered corruption and legal violations in government. In 1998-2000, anti-corruption campaigns by the Institute and its members included: the criminal activities of David Bezhuashvli MP and Levan Mamaladze, governor of the Kvemo-Kartli region; corruption and legal violations at the Ministries of Agriculture and Communications; involvement of the Ministries of Interior and Security in smuggling tobacco, petroleum and alcohol; and the criminal interests and illegal business activities of President Eduard Shevardnadze's family. *Since 2001 together with the students' movement the LI carried out the anticorruption campaign at the Tbilisi Ivane Javakhishvili State University. In the frame of the campaign the survey was held and the corrupt faculties and lecturers were publicly named. The members of the movement investigated the facts of misuse of University funds and multiple financial abuses. Materials found by the LI were handed to Anticorruption Council and Prosecutor's Office. *First protest to denounce religious violence was carried out by the Institute on October 19, 1999. Liberty Institute protested against religious extremism and of violence against religious minorities. Liberty Institute made these problems discussed by the public. Since 1998 Liberty Institute protested against religious extremism existed in the Orthodox Church of Georgia, the Liberty Institute always strictly reacted on every fact of violation of religious freedom and carried 2 cases in the constitutional court. The Liberty Institute strictly reacted and denounced attack on the Baptist Church by the Police in Tianeti region; Attack on congregation of the Evangelist Church \\"Madli\\" in the Gldani District of Tbilisi; Illegal arrest of religious literature on the border by the State. It always protected rights of Jehovah's Witnesses, when Basil Mkalavishvili and his supporters were attacking them and protested the cessation of registration of Jehovah's Witnesses by court; Liberty Institute was fighting against the trend of transferring churches belonging to the Catholics to the Orthodox Church by the state and protected the rights of Orthodox congregations that do not belong to the Georgian Orthodox Patriarchate. Religious extremism became the subject of active public debates in Georgia following Liberty Institute’s campaigns against violations of religious rights. Liberty Institute also initiated two cases defending the rights of religious minorities at the Constitutional Court. *One of the main directions of the Institute's activism has been prevention and aversion of facts of illegal arrest, torture during the pre-trial detention and prevention of the illegal actions and violation of the human rights in the law enforcement agencies. In 1998, the Liberty Institute carried out a special project, which aimed to monitor the Police raids. As a result of which a lot of fact of illegalness and torture was found. In 2000, based on the initiative of the Liberty Institute, a Public Review Board was established at the Ministry of Justice. The council has been a major mechanism of civil control of the penitentiary system. In 2004 Liberty Institute together with Ombudsman's office created Public Councils, the members of which have a right to enter and carry the monitoring over the pre-trial detention and police stations at any time without restrictions. *Liberty Institute supported the youth movements in Georgia. Liberty Institute encouraged the development of youth movements such as independent student's self-governing bodies within the Universities and created civil liberties youth network throughout the country; Due to Liberty Institute activities the first active youth movement Kmara emerged in Georgia in 2003 and has already played a crucial role in defending and promoting civil and political rights in Georgia. Liberty Institute provided 800 activists with practical trainings. Currently, within the framework of the Civil Liberties Youth Network, Liberty Institute leads a series of youth debates in Georgia’s regions aimed at promoting civic values and anti-corruption ethics among high school and local university students through discussions on the history and philosophy of constitutional rights among youth. The goal of the debates is also to foster critical thinking and leadership skills among youth. *Liberty Institute prepared the first Professional Standards of Media in Georgia in 2003, which was adopted by the major national and regional TV Companies and newspapers. *Liberty Institute is also active in terms of legal initiatives and has an experience of legal drafting. The Law on the Freedom of Speech and Expression adopted by the Parliament of Georgia in 2004 was prepared by the LI. This law was estimated by the Georgian and international experts as the most democratic law in the post-communistic area. In 2004 the Parliament of Georgia adopted the Law on Broadcasting also prepared by the Liberty Institute. According this law on the basis of the state TV the Public Broadcasting Service will be developed. Liberty Institute proposed constitutional amendment to introduce the jury system and now works on drafting of criminal procedural code. The Parliament of Georgia accepted this proposal in 2004. In 2003 The Parliament of Georgia adopted the Law about confiscation of illegally earned property. In 1997 prepared the Freedom of Information chapter of the General Administrative Code, which was adopted in 1999 by the Parliament. *The liberty Institute has campaigned for the establishment of effective civil control over the human rights; LI provides practical help to local communities to defend their rights. These activities include individual legal consultation, Court representational activities and civil campaigns to make the society mobilized over the specific facts of violation of human rights. *Liberty Institute has always participated and supported the educational reform in Georgia. The part of the law of the education accepted by the parliament of Georgia in 2004 was created in the LI. The part covers the rights of students and academic freedom. According to the LI initiative the School boards in public schools was created in Georgia since 2003. The Liberty Institute provides resources and training for various social and professional groups about enhancing effectiveness, professionalism, active citizenship, principles of civil responsibility, accountability and transparency within society.

Nash (born February 5, 1967), previously known by his stage name Pete Nice, is an American baseball historian, a member of the Society for American Baseball Research and a former rapper/record producer, who was most noted as the one-third of the hip hop group 3rd Bass. Music career Peter Nash was born on February 5, 1967 in Floral Park, Long Island, New York to Carole and Raymond Nash. After graduating from Bishop Ford High School in 1985, he majored in English at Columbia University, where he hosted a hip hop radio show. This led to the creation of the hip hop group 3 the Hard Way with Richard Lawson and Michael Berrin, which later changed its name to 3rd Bass, where he adopted the stage name Prime Minister Pete Nice. The group released two gold-selling albums before disbanding in 1992. Nice teamed up with his former bandmate Daddy Rich, and the pair released their only collaboration, Dust to Dust, in 1993. Pete Nice and author-radio jock Bobbito Garcia started their own label, Hoppoh Records, under the aegis of Columbia Records. The first release was Kurious's 1994 album A Constipated Monkey; Nice co-produced the album and the single \\"I'm Kurious\\". Nashville artist Count Bass D's debut Pre-Life Crisis followed in 1995, distributed by Columbia sister label Chaos Recordings, but those would be the only records released before the label folded because of creative differences with Columbia. Business ventures Nash quit the music business and devoted his time to baseball history. He owned a memorabilia shop in Cooperstown, New York. In 2003, he published his first book, Baseball Legends of Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery, under his real name. He has also been working to secure some property for an official grave site of Negro League players. His younger brother Brian was the Head Men's Basketball Coach at St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights. In early 2008, Nash opened McGreevy's 3rd Base Bar (named in honor of legendary Boston publican Michael T. \\"Nuf Ced\\" McGreevy's establishment), a sports bar in Boston with Dropkick Murphys' band member Ken Casey. The bar was named Best Sports Bar In Boston by Citysearch in 2009. Legal troubles Commencing in 2007 and concluding in 2009, Nash was involved in litigation with an auction house relating to the authenticity of baseball memorabilia he consigned for sale. When deposed under oath, Nash invoked the Fifth Amendment dozens of times in response to questions about the origins of specific pieces of memorabilia. The court found in favor of the auction house owner (who later, was found guilty by a jury of committing his own fraud against another collector), and Nash signed a court order in which he admitted to having committed fraud. On July 1, 2014, after having plead guilty to misdemeanor tax fraud, Nash was sentenced in Albany County court for not paying taxes from 2009 through 2011. As a result, Nash paid $13,101 to the state in back taxes, penalties and interest.

He was an American heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Amateur career Robert Roop began wrestling in the eighth grade in East Lansing, Michigan. In High School, Roop was varsity heavyweight as a freshman, with an inauspicious 0-22-1 record. With the guidance of coach Joe Dibello, his record improved in ensuing years, with a 27-0-0 record his senior year, in which he also took State Championship. He entered Michigan State University on a football scholarship. After a year and a half, he left school to join the Army. He received paratrooper training, and signed on to become a Special Forces medic. He competed on the All-Army wrestling team and, later, the All- Services wrestling team. There was one other heavyweight on the All-Services team, Jim Rasher, who had won a bronze medal as the U.S. Greco-Roman Heavyweight at the World Games prior to entering the Army. Rasher was influential in Roop's decision to pursue an amateur wrestling. After his three-year stint in the service, he entered Southern Illinois University, and began pursuing amateur wrestling. He attended from 1965 through 1969, majoring in political science, and was a collegiate wrestling standout with a win-loss record of 66-18, including a 16-3 record during his senior year. While in college he won four National Amateur Athletic Union All-American rankings, earned by placing in the top four spots in the national tournament, and an NAAU Championship as a light-heavyweight. During his last year of college, his coach at Southern Illinois convinced him to train down to a lighter weight of 220 pounds. Roop was 25 years old, tall and weighed entering the Games in Mexico City in 1968. The team was coached by legendary wrestling coach Henry Wittenberg. Roop finished in seventh place, losing to Aleksandr Medved, who went on to win the gold medal. Professional career Roop began his professional career in 1969 after a meeting with his long-time friend Larry Heiniemi, better known as Lars Anderson. Heiniemi's tales of global travel and financial success appealed to Roop who began working for Eddie Graham, the promoter of Championship Wrestling from Florida. Working as an arrogant villain and flaunting his genuine amateur wrestling credentials, Roop challenged for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on five occasions. In 1976, Bob Roop received a possible career ending knee injury while wrestling Eddie Graham. The move which supposedly caused the injury, the figure-four, was banned as a crippling hold. While Roop was supposedly recovering, a new wrestler, The Gladiator, appeared on the Florida wrestling scene. The masked Gladiator used the shoulderbreaker, Roop's signature finishing move, and crowds shouted Roop's name when he appeared in the ring. During a Gladiator match on the Championship Wrestling from Florida TV program, Eddie and Mike Graham ran in on the match and removed the mask. The Gladiator was revealed as Roop. This incident is listed as number 24 in the CWF's \\"The Twenty-Five Greatest Angles In CWF History\\". After the unmasking, the figure-four was reinstated. This angle was used in 1977 in Roy Shire San Francisco NWA territory as Roop was \\"injured\\" by Kevin Sullivan and then a masked wrestler named The Star Warrior showed up around the same time Roop was injured; later, Sullivan unmasked Star Warrior, who was Roop. Roop also wrestled and sporadically commentated for a time in Mid-South Wrestling, and he is often incorrectly credited for being the man who created the reversal to the figure four leg lock, the hold that \\"injured\\" him in Florida. “Cowboy” Bob Ellis used the maneuver against Buddy Rogers back in the early 1960s. In the 1980s, Roop wrestled in Angelo Poffo's International Championship Wrestling (ICW) promotion out of Lexington, Kentucky.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w-tyiRl8w0 The promotion at the time featured such future wrestling superstars as 'The Macho Man' Randy Savage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYOGKXCxwwg 'The Genius' Lanny Poffo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsUF3J7WtVQ 'Cowboy' Bob Orton Jr.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSLpz9Ri-r4 and Ronnie 'Hands of Stone' Garvin. Roop later became part of the Army of Darkness stable which included Kevin Sullivan, Purple Haze, Luna Vachon and Lock, Kharma/Molokai and Fallen Angel. Roop adopted the ring name Mayha Singh, shaving off the hair and beard on half his head and putting face paint on the shaved side. Later years Roop retired from wrestling in 1988 due to a neck injury suffered in a car crash. At the time he also handled booking duties and trained wrestlers at a school in Davie, Florida. An early student of his was Lawrence Pfohl, the future Lex Luger, who Roop broke into the business before turned over training duties to Hiro Matsuda. Looking back on his career in 2000, Roop stated \\"I had a hell of a lot of fun doing it, and it was quite an education.\\" Since retirement, Roop has lived in Michigan and worked as a Boy Scouts troop leader. On July 15, 2006, Bob Roop was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. The ceremony was held at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum then in Newton, Iowa (now in Waterloo, Iowa).

He has had public debates with Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Steven Pinker, Roger Cohen, Richard Dawkins, Matt Ridley, Bishop Barron,\\"LIVE VIDEO TONIGHT: A Dialogue with Roger Cohen and the Iranian Jewish Community.\\" and Indian yogi and mystic Sadhguru, among others. Wolpe is the model for Jacob Kappelmacher, the rabbi detective in J. M. Appel's best-selling mystery novel, Wedding Wipeout (2012).Encyclopedia of Jewish Fiction (rev. 2014), Pp. 34-5 Wolpe is the Max Webb Senior Rabbi of Sinai Temple.David Suissa, Max Webb, one second at a time, The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, October 14, 2014 Missions to Israel Wolpe has led numerous missions to Israel. The first, in June 2002, was a solidarity mission at the height of the Second Intifada that broke out after the Camp David peace talks. The second, in May 2005, was a mission of gratitude to pick up the Torah commissioned in honor of his recovery from brain surgery.http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/searchview.php?id=11757 The third, in July 2006, at the height of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, was another solidarity mission that covered Jerusalem, Haifa, and Sderot. In the midst of the second intifada, Wolpe raised three million dollars for victims of terror in a single morning at his synagogue. Wolpe also led the largest American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) delegation ever assembled from one synagogue to the AIPAC conference in Washington in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 with numbers ranging from 230-300 delegates. Wolpe also traveled to Haiti to help his friend Mitch Albom (Tuesdays with Morrie) rebuild an orphanage.http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/christian_charity_in_haiti_is_the_jewish_thing_to_do_20110119/ Historicity of the Exodus On Passover 2001, Wolpe told his congregation that \\"the way the Bible describes the Exodus is not the way it happened, if it happened at all.\\" Casting doubt on the historicity of the Exodus during the holiday that commemorates it brought condemnation from congregants and several rabbis (especially Orthodox Rabbis). The ensuing theological debate included whole issues of Jewish newspapers such as the Jewish Journal in Los Angeles and editorials in The Jerusalem Post, as well as an article in the Los Angeles Times. Critics asserted that Wolpe was attacking Jewish oral history, the significance of Passover and even the First Commandment. Wolpe asserted that he was arguing that the historicity of the events should not matter, since he believes faith is not determined by the same criteria as empirical truth. Wolpe argues that his views are based on the fact that no archeological digs have produced evidence of the Jews wandering the Sinai Desert for forty years, and that excavations in Israel consistently show settlement patterns at variance with the Biblical account of a sudden influx of Jews from Egypt. In March 2010, Wolpe expounded on his views saying that it was possible that a small group of people left Egypt, came to Canaan, and influenced the native Canaanites with their traditions. He added that the controversy of 2001 stemmed from the fact that Conservative Jewish congregations have been slow to accept and embrace biblical criticism. Conservative rabbis, on the other hand, are taught biblical criticism in rabbinical school.Q&A; following a lecture on the Exodus given at Sinai Temple, March 17, 2010.

L. M. Barreto as an entrant in the NESSIE project, a former research program initiated by the European Commission in 2000 for the identification of new cryptographic algorithms. Although the cipher has not been included in the final NESSIE portfolio, its design is considered very strong, and no attacks have been found by 2004 after the project had been concluded. The cipher is not patented and has been released by the designers for free public use. Anubis operates on data blocks of 128 bits, accepting keys of length 32N bits (N = 4, ..., 10). It is designed as a substitution–permutation network, which bears large similarity to Rijndael. Like KHAZAD, designed by the same authors and also submitted to NESSIE, it uses involutions for the various operations. An involution is an operation whose inverse is the same as the forward operation. In other words, when an involution is run twice, it is the same as performing no operation. This allows low-cost hardware and compact software implementations to use the same operations for both encryption and decryption. Both the S-box and the mix columns operations are involutions. Although many involutional components can make a cipher more susceptible to distinguishing attacks exploiting the cycle structure of permutations within the cipher, no attack strategy for the Anubis cipher has been presented. There are two versions of the Anubis cipher; the original implementation uses a pseudo- random S-box. Subsequently, the S-box was modified to be more efficient to implement in hardware; the newer version of Anubis is called the \\"tweaked\\" version. The authors claim the algorithm to be secure against a number of attacks, including four-round differential and linear analysis, as well as related-key, interpolation, boomerang, truncated differential, impossible differential, and saturation attacks. Nonetheless, because of the cipher's similarity with Rijndael it was not considered to offer any convincing advantages and thus was not included in the second evaluation phase of the NESSIE project. Anubis is named after the Egyptian god of entombing and embalming, which the designers interpreted to include encryption. They claim that violators of the cipher will be cursed.

Cutting may be accomplished by single-point or multipoint tools. Single-point tools are used in turning, shaping, planing and similar operations, and remove material by means of one cutting edge. Milling and drilling tools are often multipoint tools. It is a body having teeth or cutting edges on it. Grinding tools are also multipoint tools.Explain Cutting Tools , https://mechanicalsite.com, retrieved 2019-05-12. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle), and shears a tiny chip. Cutting tool materials must be harder than the material which is to be cut, and the tool must be able to withstand the heat and force generated in the metal-cutting process. Also, the tool must have a specific geometry, with clearance angles designed so that the cutting edge can contact the workpiece without the rest of the tool dragging on the workpiece surface. The angle of the cutting face is also important, as is the flute width, number of flutes or teeth, and margin size. In order to have a long working life, all of the above must be optimized, plus the speeds and feeds at which the tool is run. Types Linear cutting tools include tool bits (single-point cutting tools) and broaches. Rotary cutting tools include drill bits, countersinks and counterbores, taps and dies, milling cutters, reamers, and cold saw blades. Other cutting tools, such as bandsaw blades, hacksaw blades, and fly cutters, combine aspects of linear and rotary motion =Cutting tools with inserts (indexable tools)= Cutting tools are often designed with inserts or replaceable tips (tipped tools). In these, the cutting edge consists of a separate piece of material, either brazed, welded or clamped on to the tool body. Common materials for tips include cemented carbide, polycrystalline diamond, and cubic boron nitride. Tools using inserts include milling cutters (endmills, fly cutters), tool bits, and saw blades. =Holder= =Tool setup= The detailed instruction how to combine the tool assembly out of basic holder, tool and insert can be stored in a tool management solution.  Cutting edge  The cutting edge of a cutting tool is a very important for the performance of the cutting process. The main features of the cutting edge are: * form of the cutting edge: radius or waterfall or trumpet. * cutting edge angles (eat a child) * form and size of the chamfers The measurement of the cutting edge is performed using a tactile instrument or an instrument using focus variation. To quantify a cutting edge the following parameters are used: * cutting edge radius for symmetric edges * cutting edge ellipse axis for asymmetric edges. * factor K, this is the relation between Sγ and Sα. This can also be calculated by the ratio of the two axis of the ellipse. This factor describes the form of the cutting edge. * 3 angles: clearance angle, wedge angle, rake (chipping) angle * Δr * length and orientation of the bevel cutting edge profile with parameters One of the most important cutting edge parameters is the K factor. It specify the form of the cutting edge. 1 means a symmetric cutting edge. If the value is smaller the form is called a waterfall. If the value is larger than 1 it is called a trompete. Depending on the cutting material, feed rate and other influence factors a cutting tool with the optimum K factor should be used.

The office was abolished with the introduction of administrative reforms during the Napoleonic period. \\"Schout en scheepenen van Alkemade\\" as printed on an 1806 Dutch marriage document Functions The exact nature of the office varied from place to place and changed over the course of time. In general, a schout was appointed by the lord (heer) of a domain (heerlijkheid) and acted in the lord's name in the local day-to-day administration of the domain, especially the administration of justice. A schout had three main functions: administration, law enforcement and criminal prosecution.As a specific example of how a schout functioned in a specific town, see the description of the office of schout in Leiden in R.C.J. van Maanen, ed., Leiden tot 1574, p. 75 (written in Dutch) First, the schout was responsible for many local administrative matters in the town or heerlijkheid. The schout presided in the meetings of the schepenen. Together, the schout and schepenen made up what we would call the \\"town council\\" today. He ensured decrees were published. He sometimes represented the town or heerlijkheid in business matters or in negotiations with other towns. In these functions, a schout was somewhat like a modern-day mayor. The phrase schout en schepenen appears in many legal documents from before the Napoleonic period, including the civil registration of marriages. Depending on the context and in what capacity they were acting, this phrase could mean something like the \\"mayor and aldermen\\" (i.e. the town council) or it could mean \\"the sheriff and magistrates\\". Second, the schout was responsible for public order and policing. He was responsible for investigating a crime, apprehending a criminal and presenting the criminal to the court of magistrates (schepenen) for judgment. He or his men checked the drinking houses, carried out conscription orders, made sure taxes were paid and enforced the law. After a criminal verdict was given, the schout was responsible for carrying out the sentence. In these functions, he was somewhat like a modern-day chief of police. Third, a schout prosecuted suspected criminals and presided over the sessions of the magistrates (schepenen) when they sat as a court. The schout was not the judge, but directed the court proceedings. In this function, he was somewhat like a modern-day prosecutor.  New Amsterdam  The office was brought with the Dutch to the American colony of New Netherland. The first schout (sometimes called the schout- fiscal) in New Amsterdam after it was granted the authority to form its own local government in 1652 was Cornelis van Tienhoven, although officers were appointed to the post from at least 1626 when Jan Lampo was appointed. The schout had a seat on the Executive Council, but no vote, and would step down from the bench when acting as prosecutor, at which time the remaining members of the Council would function as the Court of Justice. The final schout was William Knyff, who held the office in 1674 when the English were returned the colony. The origins of the American public prosecutor (attorney general) have been traced to the schout in New Amsterdam.NCJRSThe changing role of the American prosecutor  Related titles  Schout is the word usually used in Dutch, but there were a number of other terms used for this or similar offices in Dutch-speaking lands. The terms used included schout, baljuw, drost, drossaard, amman and meier. Perhaps the most common alternative name for this office in Dutch was baljuw.I.M. Calisch and N.S. Calisch, Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal, 1864 Baljuw is usually translated into English as \\"bailiff\\". The word schout, depending on its context, can be translated variously into English, usually as sheriff, bailiff, or reeve, but strictly in their respective medieval senses.For example, see Simon Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches. As a result, the Dutch word is sometimes used in English (even though schout is not actually a word in English).For example, see Russell Shorto, The Island at the Centre of the World and David Nicholas, Medieval Flanders. In Dutch, the plural of schout is schouten. The Dutch word schout comes from Middle Dutch scouthete, in turn from Old Low Franconian skolthēti, and is cognate with Old English scyldhǣta, sculthēta \\"reeve, (medieval) bailiff\\", German Schultheiß, (Swiss) Schulze \\"bailie (magistrate)\\", from PGmc *skuldi-haitijō \\"debt-orderer\\". The office was occasionally referred to in Latin as scultetus.

History and information Prairie Meadows in March 2007 In 1984, Prairie Meadows received a license from the Iowa Racing and Gaming commission to operate a horse racing facility after parimutuel betting was legalized by the state the previous year. In 1987, groundbreaking ceremonies were held for Prairie Meadows. Prairie Meadows conducted its first day of racing on March 1, 1989. However, the track lost money during its first few years of operation and filed for bankruptcy in November 1991. Live racing was suspended for the 1992 season before revenues from off-track betting allowed racing to resume the following year. On May 17, 1994, Polk County voters approved a referendum allowing the installation of slot machines at Prairie Meadows. On April 1, 1995, the slot machine casino opened at Prairie Meadows, and by the end of 1996, Prairie Meadows was able to pay off the bonds that were issued by the Polk County Board of Supervisors. On December 14, 2004, Prairie Meadows added casino game tables after receiving state approval to do so. As a result of the high demand for these tables, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission approved Prairie Meadows' plans to expand its facility on January 25, 2005. Construction on the $60 million expansion began in September 2005. An addition to the casino opened in August 2006, while two new restaurants and a 1,200-seat concert hall known as \\"The Meadows\\" opened in February 2007. Prairie Meadows is owned by Polk County and operated by a local, non-profit, 13-member board of directors. The revenues generated by Prairie Meadows are given to various community projects in the Des Moines area, including construction of the Iowa Events Center complex in downtown Des Moines. Prairie Meadows' gross revenue for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2008, was nearly $193 million. That total ranked second to the Horseshoe Casino in Council Bluffs among Iowa's casinos. On January 16, 2019, Prairie Meadows announced a partnership with bookmaker William Hill in preparation for the proposed legalization of sports betting in Iowa. Physical attributes Prairie Meadows has a one-mile dirt track with a chute for quarter horses. On site is a casino with 1,900 slot machines and casino game tables featuring games such as poker, roulette, and blackjack. The track area has also hosted free concerts by national musical acts in recent years.

Early life General Al-naif graduated from the Iraqi Military Academy in 1954. He served as second lieutenant in the 9th infantry brigade until 1956. He graduated from the Iraqi Military Staff College in 1960 and promoted to Staff Captain. He then became instructor in the Iraqi Military Staff College in the same Year. In 1963, he attended Sandhurst Military Intelligence Academy in Britain. In 1964, President Arif appointed then Staff Major Al-naif as Deputy Director of Military Intelligence. Political life After the death of President Abdul Salam Arif in helicopter crash in 1964, Al-naif was appointed Senior Advisor to the younger President Arif, and then National Security Advisor, but remained Deputy Director of Military Intelligence. From 1964 until 1968, Al-naif played a major role in negotiating peace with the Kurdish leader Mulla Mustafa Al Barazani, who had close and trusting relationship with Al-naif. There are reports that during the Kurdish revolt in Northern Iraq in the 1960s Al-naif convinced the Iraqi leadership to negotiate with the Kurdish revolt leadership rather than resort to military confrontation with them. He held regular secret meetings with Mulla Barazani and was instrumental in bringing the Kurdish civil war to a peaceful end. In 1968, Al-naif became the youngest Prime Minister of Iraq, at the age of 34. He appointed the first and last inclusive cabinet in Iraq. His cabinet, which he called coalition cabinet was the largest cabinet in Iraqi history. It included representatives from all ethnic and religious members of the Iraqi population, with several Ministers appointed without portfolios. For the first time in Iraqi history, the Vice Prime Minister and Vice President were both Kurds. But soon after that he was deposed by a Ba’ath Party coup d'état, and exiled to Morocco as Ambassador to Rabat. People closest to General Al-naif speak of him as being an independent politician, with revolutionary ideas. As his political life was during the Cold War, he did not hesitate to express his opposition to communism and Soviet Union expansion and was inspired by the American system of freedom and democracy. He had read the biography of John F Kennedy in Arabic several times and was inspired by Kennedy's courage and revolutionary ideas of human rights and equality. He was focused on Iraqi domestic issues and did not get involved in regional Arab issues outside of Iraq. He remained independent throughout his political career but when he formed his cabinet in 1968, he included members of every Iraqi political party. Exile After the Ba'ath deposition, Al-naif was then exiled to Switzerland, were he served as Representative to the United Nations in Geneva. It is reported that while he served as Ambassador of Iraq to Switzerland, he secretly headed opposition movement to the Ba’ath government in Iraq, then lead by Saddam Hussein. Al-naif secretly returned to Northern Iraq in 1969 and was welcomed back and protected by the Kurdish leader Mulla Mustafa Al Barazani and also by the Iraqi troops that were sent to fight the Kurds, because he was a well respected officer of the Iraqi Military. He remained in Northern Iraq until 1972, when he left Iraq and moved to Britain with his family. As he arrived in Britain, the Iraqi Government of Saddam Hussein sentenced Al-naif to death in absentia. It is unknown why he decided to leave Northern Iraq, but he maintained close relationships with the Kurdish leaders and Iraqi opposition to the Ba’ath Party. There are reports that he became concerned that his anti Ba’ath coalition movement was infiltrated by Saddam Hussein's secret Mukhabarat apparatus and he was informed of attempts to assassinate him in Northern Iraq by them. Al-naif enjoyed good relationship with Shah Reza Pahlavi Of Iran, Jordan's King Hussein and Saudi Arabia King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz, who supported his opposition to Saddam Hussein's Ba’ath Party Government in Iraq. 1972 assassination attempt In 1972, the Ba’ath Government in Iraq sent assassins disguised as Iraqi diplomats to kill Al-naif in London, but that attempt was foiled by Al-naif's wife Lamia, who stood in the line of fire and shielded him. She recovered from her injuries after surgery at London's Middlesex Hospital. 1978 Assassination Al-naif then moved to Jordan, where he enjoyed close friendship with Jordan's King Hussein. Al-naif was assassinated while visiting Britain on July 9, 1978, by orders of Saddam Hussein because of his opposition to the Iraqi Ba’ath Government. He was critically injured as he left the Intercontinental Hotel in London's Park Lane and died the following day. His body was transported to Jordan where he was buried at the orders of Jordan's King Hussein. As the evidence showed Iraqi Government involvement in Al-naif's assassination, Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Iraq and ordered all Iraqi diplomats out of Britain. This was immediately reciprocated by Iraq. Two men were arrested in Britain, and accused of the killing. The assailant Salem Hassan, a Palestinian belonging to the Abu Nidal terrorist group, who was charged and sentenced to life in prison, and Sadoun Shakir, who was the Head of Saddam Hussein's Mukhabarat organization who entered Britain under a false name using an Iraqi Diplomatic passport. Shakir was exchanged for two British hostages arrested in Iraq after Al-naif's assassination. King Hussein of Jordan hosted Al-naif's family in Jordan after Al-naif's assassination and personally attended to their security and well being. His killer, Salem Ahmed Hassan, was quickly captured. Hassan was later convicted of the shooting at the Old Bailey and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979.

Their name is Sanskrit for \\"of practical application; layer; garment\\" and the like. Four crores of Nivātakavacas were born in the family of Prahlāda. The army of the Asuras, the enemies of the Devas, was formed by the Nivātakavacas and Kālakeyas. They are incredibly strong and skilled in magic, mysticism and warfare, wielding powerful weapons. The Devas under Indra couldn't overcome them despite their many battles. The Nivātakavacas are said to have terrorized the world, living deep beneath the ocean and residing in the city of Maṇimatī after securing boons from Brahmā. Despite their evil ways, they are also glorious and legendary beings. As told in the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāvaṇa with his sons Meghanada, Atikaya and with his army attacked them; but found himself unable to defeat them after hundred of years of battle. The two sides finally stroke an alliance after Brahmā intervened. Mahābhārata account In the Mahābhārata, their number is said to be about thirty million. They are finally vanquished and destroyed entirely by the Super Hero Arjuna, who is asked to do so by his father Indra as a preceptor's fee. Indra provides him a celestial chariot, with his driver and armor for battle. He beheld the wonderful city of the Dānavas near the sea and entered beneath the earth. There ensued a dreadful conflict between Arjuna and the demons. Arjuna began to slay them by the thousands from his aerial car using celestial weapons. He slayed all the visible Dānavas opposing him. Meanwhile, the invisible Dānavas attempted to concoct magical illusions, causing Arjuna's charioteer Mātali to fall off. Arjuna recovered him and dispelled the illusions via arms. The fierce elites of the Nivātakavacas assailed Arjuna with crags, distressing the warrior. Inspired by his driver's words, Arjuna discharged the favourite weapon of the king of the celestials, the dreadful thunder-bolt-(Vajra), with which he vanquished the remaining Dānavas. On returning from battle, Arjuna described the mighty unearthly aerial city of Hiraṇyapura in the air. He claimed that this city was superior to that of the gods he beheld earlier. On learning that it was inhabited by several more Asuras, Arjuna took siege of it. He managed to destroy the city, with the help of Rudra's weapon, defeating the remaining Dānavas by throwing them from the sky and crushing the city.

Before its first factory opened, 39 Chinese FAW employees traveled to the Stalin Truck Factory for instruction in truck production. Operations were conducted in the Soviet mold, and Russia is even credited with choosing Changchun as the location for the first FAW vehicle-manufacturing facility. The city boasted an industrial base left over from Japanese occupation and, situated in northeastern China, is near Russia.For pre-existing industrial base, see *For northeastern China location near Russia, see First Automobile Works initially made only commercial trucks but started producing passenger cars in 1958. These vehicles, the Hong Qi luxury sedans, were the first domestically produced Chinese automobiles. Only for party elite, the design changed little over their thirty-year production run.The home team economist.com, Nov 13th 2008 Following this, FAW's Audi products are the traditionally favored choice for ranking Chinese state officials.Chinese public revved up over BMW, Benz on gov't car list xinhuanet.com, 2009-06-13 These Audis are, alongside Beijing Benz Mercedes Benzes some of the only Western luxury cars to have gained popularity in the Chinese market. In 1992, the name First Automobile Works was changed to China FAW Group Corporation. Though FAW was the fourth Chinese automaker to take on Western partners, its early joint venture with Volkswagen in 1990 saw it become the second Chinese auto company to develop a strong cooperative relationship with a foreign counterpart. SAIC was the first, in 1984 and also with VW.Theme and variations economist.com, Nov 13th 2008 Other, failed foreign-Chinese joint ventures preceding FAW-VW are what is now Beijing Benz (with US partner AMC) and the failed Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company.*For Beijing Benz, see JV renamed Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler chinadaily.com.cn, 2004-12-07 *For Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company, see Changing lanes in China: foreign direct investment, local government, and auto sector development (page 137) Eric Thun. Cambridge University Press, 2006. 326 pages. Volkswagen was the first foreign partner for FAW, but others soon followed. The company acquired 50% ownership of Tianjin Automotive Xiali in September, 2002, and renamed the brand FAW Tianjin. As a result, FAW ended up with Toyota as a foreign joint venture partner. FAW established a joint venture with General Motors in 2009GM, China FAW Set Up Commercial-Vehicle Joint Venture Bloomberg.com, August 30, 2009 and has joint ventures with a handful of other foreign companies as well.

A son of Clint Murchison Sr., who made his first fortune in oil exploration and became notorious for exploiting the sale of \\"hot oil\\", Clint and his surviving brother inherited their father's wealth and business interests to which Clint Jr. added ventures of his own. These included the establishment of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys franchise, real estate development, construction, home building, restaurants and financing the offshore pirate radio station called Radio Nord. Early life Murchison had two brothers, John D. Murchison (1921–1979) and Burk Murchison (1925–1936), who died at age ten from a childhood disease. His mother died when he was two and he was mainly raised by an aunt. He attended school at Lawrenceville School and joined the Marine Corps after Pearl Harbor and went on to become a student at Duke University as part of the Marine Corps V-12 training program where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in electrical engineering. He received a master's degree in mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Business career Following the death of his father Clint Murchison Sr., John and Clint Jr. inherited the wealth that their father had created. They began doing business as the Murchison Brothers in the late 1940s from an office in Dallas, Texas. Their inherited interests included the Daisy Manufacturing Company (manufacturing a BB gun); Field and Stream magazine; Heddon Rod & Reel; Henry Holt and Company (later known as Holt, Rinehart, and Winston); Delhi Oil; Kirby Petroleum and a marine construction company known as Tecon Corporation. In 1952, Murchison joined a syndicate that included Everette Lee DeGolyer and Jack Crichton, both of Dallas, to use connections in the government of General Francisco Franco to obtain drilling rights in Spain. The operation was handled by Delta Drilling, owned by Joe Zeppa. In addition to the Dallas Cowboys, The Murchison Family businesses included Centex Corporation (home builders), Daisy Air Rifles, Field & Stream magazine, the Tony Roma's restaurant chain and real estate developments throughout the U.S. In the early 1960s the Murchisons were involved in a proxy fight with Allan P. Kirby over control of Alleghany Corporation, a holding company whose interests included New York Central Railroad and Investors Diversified Services, a large mutual fund company. The proxy fight was the largest in corporate history. Dallas Cowboys founding owner In 1960, the National Football League approved a franchise for Dallas, and Murchison, along with Bedford Wynne, was the franchisee or license holder. A motivating factor in the NFL's decision to award a license for Dallas was the establishment of the American Football League (AFL) by Lamar Hunt, another Dallas area businessman. Hunt, in helping create the AFL, established a professional football presence in Dallas, and the NFL realized the urgency with which they needed to address a potential market gain by the upstart league and a loss for the established organization. For the most part, Murchison was a hands-off owner, delegating a great deal of operational control of the Cowboys to general manager Tex Schramm, head coach Tom Landry and scouting/personnel director Gil Brandt. His general attitude was to hire experts and let them execute the aspect of the business that fell in their expertise. Hence, Landry enjoyed absolute authority over the day-to-day running of the actual team; Brandt was unhindered in the area of drafting and scouting players, and Schramm oversaw many of the team's day to day administrative concerns. Schramm even represented the Cowboys at league meetings and exercised the Cowboys' voting rights, prerogatives normally reserved to the owner. Murchison's laissez-faire attitude has been credited by many Cowboys fans as the driving force in the team's 20 consecutive winning seasons from 1966–1985 (including five Super Bowl appearances and including two Super Bowl championships). By leaving most football matters in the hands of the operations staff, Murchison did not create an atmosphere of second guessing and arguments over player selection or credit for the team's success. Murchison suggested hiring Landry away from his job as a defensive coach with the New York Giants. “I would love to take one percent credit for Landry,” Schramm said, “but I can't.\\" As the team floundered through their first few seasons and critics called for Landry's firing, Murchison backed his coach by handing him a 10-year contract. Murchison enjoyed a reputation as a practical joker. On the eve of the Dallas Cowboys' first Super Bowl he wrote to coach Tom Landry, “Dear Tom: I have taught you all I can. From on, you're on your own.” In 1984, an ailing Murchison sold the Dallas Cowboys to an investment syndicate led by Bum Bright, a Dallas area businessman who had a background in banking/financial services and in oil/gas production. Bright in turn sold the Cowboys to Jerry Jones in 1989 following several losing seasons. Dallas sportswriter Blackie Sherrod attributed the Cowboys' success to two rare possessions of Clint Murchison: a bottomless pocketbook and patience. In 1963, Dallas suddenly became known as the city that assassinated John F. Kennedy. Murchison's Cowboys, featuring likable players and a winning tradition, paved the way for a new Dallas image.  Building Texas Stadium  The Cowboys played at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas since their inception in 1960. With the team becoming more successful in the mid-1960s, Clint Murchison, Jr. wanted a new stadium for the team. Unable to strike a bargain with the City of Dallas, he elected to build a new stadium in Irving, Texas. Murchison worked with architects to create a revolutionary design for a football-only stadium that would feature a roof that would cover all the seats, but leave an open field to keep the elements as part of the game. Cowboys Linebacker D.D. Lewis said, “Texas Stadium has a hole in its roof so God can watch His favorite team play.” Texas Stadium was the first NFL stadium to use seat option bonds to help pay construction costs. The bonds were in denominations of $250. Better seats required the purchase of multiple bonds with the best seats requiring the purchase of four bonds for a total of $1,000. The rest of the financing was provided by Murchison and no taxpayer money was used. “Not one old lady on Social Security is going to have her taxes raised because of this stadium,” Murchison said. Incorporating a host of first-ever innovations, Murchison became known as the godfather of modern stadium construction. Texas Stadium was the first dedicated football stadium to offer luxury suites. The Circle Suites were available for purchase for $50,000 for the life of the stadium. The suites were an immediate status sensation. Over the years the suites increased in value including one trading hands for a million dollars. Murchison's luxury suite often played host to famous guests including Willie Nelson, Clint Eastwood, Jerry Jeff Walker, Norman Lear, Burt Reynolds, Henry Kissinger and Lyndon Johnson.  NFL Innovations  Murchison, with his MIT background, understood the potential of using computers in football. The Cowboys became first team to use computers in talent scouting. The Cowboys used an IBM 360 Model 65 computer. As part of the agreement to build Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas, Murchison gave up ownership of the stadium and the 95 acres on which it sat in exchange for a 40-year lease. He retained the management rights to the stadium. This became a model for how other NFL teams would operate stadiums. In 1985, Murchison designed, constructed and financed a 30-acre campus-style headquarters for the Dallas Cowboys called Valley Ranch located in Irving, Texas. The first of its kind in the NFL, it was originally intended to be part of a 160-acre mixed use development. Radio Nord Murchison funded radio entrepreneur Gordon McLendon to create a floating commercial (pirate radio) station called Radio Nord aboard the motor vessel Bon Jour, anchored in the Stockholm archipelago. Murchison and McLendon remained in the shadows and allowed Murchison's long-time friend Robert F. Thompson to take credit for actual ownership while day-to-day management was vested in Swedish-Finnish businessman Jack S. Kotschack. Radio Nord broadcast in Swedish for 16 months, between March 8, 1961 and June 30, 1962. With its mix of popular music, DJ's and news, Radio Nord became very popular. Despite politics and religious issues being banned at the station, it was stopped when the Swedish government introduced new legislation in the spring of 1962, criminalizing the act of buying commercials on the station. The ship Bon Jour was later renamed , and after docking for almost a year in Galveston, Texas she sailed for southern England to become Radio Atlanta (McLendon began his radio career in the small town of Atlanta, Texas). The station was not a financial success, and joined forces with the Caroline organization to become the southern station of Radio Caroline. Within a short period of time the \\"Project Atlanta\\" people sold out completely to the Caroline group. Bankruptcy Murchison ran into financial difficulties as a result of questionable investments and mismanagement and failing health at a time when the real estate market was collapsing, at the same time as a sharp decrease in the price of oil and a rise in interest rates. In February 1985, he had to file for personal bankruptcy protection after three creditors, the Toronto- Dominion Bank, the Kona-Post Corporation and Citicorp, filed a petition to force him into bankruptcy. Lawyers involved in the case called it one of the largest personal bankruptcy cases in United States history. Death Murchison fought a rare nerve disease called olivopontocerebellar atrophy and was in a wheelchair in his final years. He died of pneumonia in 1987 at age 63 in Dallas, and is buried at Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in North Dallas.

Early life  Talib was born in 1917 in Nasiriyah, Iraq. His family were from the landowning class in Iraq; his father was a landowner in and mayor of Nasiriyah and a member of parliament. Military career Talib was educated at the British Military Academy from 1936 to 1939. During 1954 and 1955 he was stationed in London as a military attaché, In 1958 Naji Talib's rank and post was that of Staff brigadier, commander, 15th Infantry Brigade, 1st Division, Basrah, and upon retirement from the army he had reached the rank of Major General. Political career In 1956 Staff Colonel Naji Talib was the commandant of the Senior Officers School in Baghdad. During this year he proposed the immediate union of Iraq with the United Arab Republic upon an antagonistic intervention by any of the parties to the Baghdad Pact, The Supreme committee committed itself unanimously to the proposal. In 1957 Naji Talib became the second deputy chairman of the Free Officers Movement in Iraq. Naji Talib's role in government included taking up the positions of Minister of Social Affairs 14 July 1958 – 7 February 1959, Minister of Industries 1963, Minister of Foreign Affairs 1964–1965, and finally Prime Minister 9 August 1966 – 9 May 1967. Naji Talib later became a middle-of-the-roader after holding ministerial portfolios under Qasim and in the days of the Ba'th. While politically he wavered between an independent nationalist attitude and Nasserism, he had succeeded in remaining in all the good graces of all the contending military factions. Later activities On November 7, 2004 a proposal was sent to then Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, to form an Iraqi committee initiative on Falluja. The proposal stated that Naji Talib was willing to become a member of an initiative which planned to start a series of visits to the town of Falluja, to conduct meetings with its inhabitants, combatants, and official police there to find a just solution to safeguard the town and its people from harm as well save the lives of occupation troops. On October 22, 2005 Talib was acting as a negotiator for the Sunnis in Iraq.

AFP can be fractionated by affinity electrophoresis into 3 glycoforms: L1, L2, and L3 based on the reactivity with the lectin Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA). AFP-L3 binds strongly to LCA via an additional α 1-6 fucose residue attached at the reducing terminus of N-acetylglucosamine; this is in contrast to the L1 isoform. It is the L1 isoform which is typically associated with non-HCC inflammation of liver disease condition. The L3 isoform is specific to malignant tumors and its detected presence can serve to identify patients whom need increased monitoring for the development of HCC in high risk populations (i.e. chronic hepatitis B & C and/or liver cirrhosis). AFP-L3% is now being considered as a tumor marker for the North American demographic. AFP-L3% assay AFP-L3 is isolated via an immunoassay and quantified using chemiluminesence on an automated platform. Results for AFP-L3 are represented as a ratio of LCA-reactive AFP to total AFP (AFP-L3%). The AFP-L3% assay, a liquid-phase binding assay, will help to identify at-risk subjects earlier, allowing for more intense evaluation for evidence of HCC according to existing practice guidelines in oncology. AFP-L3% is the standard for quantifying the L3 isoform of AFP in serum of high risk chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. Studies have shown that AFP-L3% test results of more than 10% can be indicative of early HCC or early nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. Early testimonials from hepatologists indicate that there is a target patient population for the AFP-L3% assay. This target population are those CLD patients who have AFP concentrations in the indeterminate range of 20-200+ ng/mL and a small or indeterminate mass on imaging. It is in this range that doctors experience trouble differentiating non-HCC fluctuations in AFP vs indication of HCC. In such patients these hepatologists recommend utilizing AFP-L3% to clarify the disease state. Some hepatologists also use a positive result to urge insurance companies to pay for more frequent and intensive imaging. Ultimately AFP-L3% may be used as a rule-in or rule-out assay for transplantation consideration and/or an intermediate step in surveillance precluding costly imaging on patients with fluctuating AFP results but negative for HCC.

When the main flagpole was felled by a shot during the bombardment of Fort Sumter by Confederate forces, Second Lieutenant Norman J. Hall rushed to retrieve the flag and remount it on a makeshift pole. The flag was lowered by Major Robert Anderson on April 14, 1861 when he surrendered Fort Sumter, in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, at the outset of the American Civil War. Anderson brought the flag to New York City for an April 20, 1861, patriotic rally, where it was flown from the equestrian statue of George Washington in Union Square. More than 100,000 people thronged Manhattan's Union Square in what was, by some accounts, the largest public gathering in the country up to that time. The flag was then taken from town to town, city to city throughout the North, where it was frequently \\"auctioned\\" to raise funds for the war effort. Any patriotic citizen who won the flag at auction was expected to immediately donate it back to the nation, and it would promptly be taken to the next rally to repeat its fundraising magic. The flag was a widely known patriotic symbol for the North during the war. On April 14, 1865, four years to the day after the surrender and as part of a celebration of the Union victory, Anderson (by then a major general), raised the flag in triumph over the battered remains of the fort. Author Shelby Foote quotes Anderson as saying, \\"I thank God that I have lived to see this day,\\" as he took the flagpole's halyards in his hands.The Civil War: A Narrative: Volume 3, Red River to Appomattox, page 971, by Shelby Foote The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher was the principal orator at the 1865 celebration, and gave a lengthy speech, as was the custom of the day. He said in conclusion: Later that night President Lincoln would be shot at Ford's Theatre. The Fort Sumter Flag is still on display at National Park Service museum at the fort. Commercial replicas of the flag are widely available.

It has a swimming pool/water park, a live arena, and function rooms. The function room, located next door to the indoor leisure complex, is, along with the Portsmouth Guildhall and The Wedgewood Rooms, a popular venue for live music. Artists that have performed at Pyramids Centre include Roger Taylor, Feeder, You Me at Six, Bring Me The Horizon, Asking Alexandria, Example, The Darkness, Arctic Monkeys & Gallows. Location Located on Southsea Seafront between Clarence Pier and South Parade Pier, the Pyramids Centre is situated just 25 m from the sea. History In 1982, Portsmouth City Council outlined its plan to update the image of promoting the City as a tourist resort in the document \\"Tourism and Portsmouth\\". This signalled the move away from \\"Come to Sunny Southsea\\" to \\"Portsmouth : Flagship of Maritime England\\", with the aim of emphasising the City's Naval Heritage to encourage people to have a holiday in the area. This approach was based on the establishment of the Maritime Heritage Area. There was a need however, to still provide for the traditional holiday maker and so other tourist facilities were required to supplement those existing and this resulted in the development of the Sea Life Centre. Given the great British weather, there was also a need for a wet weather facility, which was the starting point for the Pyramid Centre. Planning permission was granted in July 1986 for the development of a water-leisure & conference centre on the site of the old Rock Gardens Pavilion site. The Pavilion was single storey in height and had provided an entertainment facility on the seafront for a number of years, but was rundown and needed replacing. There was also a bandstand in the middle of the rock garden area as well. This offered an ideal site for a modern tourism orientated facility with its location adjoining the Rock Gardens and Castle Fields. The scheme was, therefore, set for a leisure and entertainment facility. The Pyramids was opened to the public in July 1988. It was developed by Clifford Barnett Developments Ltd in partnership with the City Council at a cost of £8.5m. The Developer's architects were Charles Smith Architects from Boston Spa, West Yorkshire. The centre was managed initially by a partnership between J. Lyons Catering Ltd and Clifford Barnett. An agreement was entered into by the City Council whereby profits and losses were shared during the first ten years. However, due to a number of factors the City Council took over the management of the centre. It was from the start controlled by Portsmouth Operating Company Limited whose Directors included the Chair of the Leisure Committee. Further development There have been a number of changes to the use of the building since it was built including allowing auction/sales to take place 24 days a year; and adding in December 1993 a wine bar, known as the \\"Frog on the Front\\" on the front elevation where there used to be a Tourist Information Centre and a retail shop at the lower ground floor level. The venue has been quite successfully used as a night-club at the weekends. In August 1995 planning permission was granted for a single storey extension to the southern terrace, and in July 1996 permission was granted for the construction of a canopy over the north entrance. Today The centre is now operated by leisure and cultural trust BH Live in partnership with Portsmouth City Council. Sports Events The Centre hosted the Darts Untouchables event, which saw players including Phil Taylor compete.

It was part of the Winter War and was fought near the village of Summa (now Soldatskoye) along the main road leading from Leningrad to Viipuri.  First battle in December  The village of Summa was a gateway to the city of Viipuri. The Finns had built 41 reinforced concrete bunkers in the Summa area, and the defense line was stronger than elsewhere in the Karelian Isthmus. However, the Finns had made mistakes in planning and nearby Munasuo swamp, east of Summa, had a kilometer wide gap in the line. At least 20 tanks drove through the line in the first day of battle, but the Soviets did not have proper co-operation between branches of service; tanks, artillery and troops fought their own battles. The Finns stood still in trenches and allowed the Soviet tanks to move behind the defense line on December 19th, as they did not have proper anti-tank weapons. After that the Finns repelled the Soviet main troops. Soviet tanks cut-off behind the line aimlessly attacked Finnish strongpoints, but once these were eliminated the threat was over. The Finns won the battle on 22 December.  Second battle in February  As the Soviets found it too difficult to breach the line at the Summa sector, they attacked 10 km to the east in a sector known as Lähde. If they broke through there then they could encircle the Finns holding the Summa position. Timoschenko knew he could beat the Finns in a battle of attrition. His plan was to wear them down and go for an intense final attack. First large probing actions were launched against the Finnish lines. For over ten days the line held every position. On 11 February, the Soviets began their major assault. On 12 February, a minor breach in the Finnish lines in the Lähde sector led to disaster. By that time, so many breaches had occurred in the Mannerheim Line that the reports concerning them were virtually disregarded. The following morning, a Finnish counter-attack was supposed to be launched by the entire 5th Division, the only reserve in easy reach of the front-line, but only one of the three regiments was available as the other two regiments had to be dispatched elsewhere. Only two Finnish battalions launched a counter-attack against two well supplied Soviet regiments that were equipped with armor and artillery. The attack was thrown back with heavy Finnish casualties. The Soviets made efforts to exploit this prominently. One tank regiment proceeded as far as the Lähde road junction but then halted. Although complete victory was in their grasp, the Soviets stopped their armoured spearhead. Many Finnish companies were reduced to half their original strength. One company had lost 86 out of 110 men. Over-night from the 14th to the 15th, the Finns began withdrawing from the Summa position. On the morning of the 15th the Soviets attacked an empty position at Summa with more than 100 tanks and two divisions. That afternoon, Mannerheim ordered a general retreat to the Intermediate Line.

Lake Georgetown is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoir formed on the San Gabriel by the North San Gabriel Dam, which is located about three miles west of Georgetown, Texas. The dam, lake, and all adjacent property are managed by the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The dam was officially completed on October 5, 1979, and serves to provide flood control for the community of Georgetown. Lake Georgetown is also a source of drinking water for Georgetown and the nearby city of Round Rock. The lake is also a popular recreational destination. The other reservoir on the San Gabriel River is Granger Lake, located downstream of Lake Georgetown, near Granger, Texas. Fish populations Lake Georgetown has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Lake Georgetown include largemouth bass, catfish, white bass, hybrid striped bass, crappie, and sunfish. Recreational uses In addition to maintaining the dam that creates the reservoir, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains recreational facilities at the lake. Cedar Breaks Park, Russell Park, Jim Hogg Park and Overlook Park include day use areas for picnics. Cedar Breaks Park, Jim Hogg Park and Russell Park have boat ramp facilities for recreational boating. No camping is permitted at Overlook park though it is the only free entry park on the lake. The Goodwater Trail is a hiking trail that follows the entire perimeter of the lake with trailheads at Cedar Breaks, Overlook, Jim Hogg, and Russell Park. Tejas Camp, while technically on the San Gabriel river and not on the lake, also has trail access and is the only other entry or exit point to the southern half of the trail besides Cedar Breaks. Mountain biking is allowed on the entire length of the loop thanks to the Austin Ridge Riders group for their work on the southern half of the trail. Beginner riders would be wise to stay on the North shore as it permits shorter trips with water refilling available and multiple exits. The southern shore presents a much more challenging ride with its rocky terrain and steep drop offs and is not recommended for beginners. Also there are no water refilling stations or trail exits between Cedar Breaks and Camp Tejas. (Approximately 12 miles) Overnight primitive camping is allowed at Sawyer Park which rests roughly halfway between Cedar Breaks and Tejas.

Sometimes it is written as R3N→O or, wrongly, as R3N=O. In the strict sense, the term amine oxide applies only to oxides of tertiary amines. Sometimes it is also used for the analogous derivatives of primary and secondary amines. Examples of amine oxides include pyridine-N-oxide, a water-soluble crystalline solid with melting point 62–67 °C, and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, which is an oxidant. Applications Amine oxides are surfactants commonly used in consumer products such as shampoos, conditioners, detergents, and hard surface cleaners. Alkyl dimethyl amine oxide (chain lengths C10–C16) is the most commercially used amine oxide. They are considered a high production volume class of compounds in more than one member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); with annual production over 26,000, 16,000 and 6,800 metric tons in the US, Europe, and Japan, respectively. In North America, more than 95% of amine oxides are used in home cleaning products. They serve as stabilizers, thickeners, emollients, emulsifiers, and conditioners with active concentrations in the range of 0.1–10%. The remainder (< 5%) is used in personal care, institutional, commercial products and for unique patented uses such as photography. Lauryldimethylamine oxide, a fatty amine derivative, is a germicidal ingredient in many cosmetics.  Properties  Amine oxides are used as protecting group for amines and as chemical intermediates. Long-chain alkyl amine oxides are used as amphoteric surfactants and foam stabilizers. Amine oxides are highly polar molecules and have a polarity close to that of quaternary ammonium salts. Small amine oxides are very hydrophilic and have an excellent water solubility and a very poor solubility in most organic solvents. Amine oxides are weak bases with a pKb of around 4.5 that form R3N+−OH, cationic hydroxylamines, upon protonation at a pH below their pKb.  Synthesis  Almost all amine oxides are prepared by the oxidation of either tertiary aliphatic amines or aromatic N-heterocycles. Hydrogen peroxide is the most common reagent both industrially and in academia, however peracids are also important. More specialised oxidising agents can see niche use, for instance Caro's acid or mCPBA. Spontaneous or catalysed reactions using molecular oxygen are rare. Certain other reactions will also produce amine oxides, such as the retro-Cope elimination, however they are rarely employed.  Reactions  Amine oxides exhibit many kinds of reactions. *Pyrolytic elimination. Amine oxides, when heated to 150–200 °C eliminate a hydroxylamine, resulting in an alkene. This pyrolytic syn-elimination reaction is known under the name Cope reaction. The mechanism is similar to that of the Hofmann elimination. *Reduction to amines. Amine oxides are readily converted to the parent amine by common reduction reagents including lithium aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride, catalytic reduction, zinc / acetic acid, and iron / acetic acid. Pyridine N-oxides can be deoxygenated by phosphorus oxychloride * Sacrificial catalysis. Oxidants can be regenerated by reduction of N-oxides, as in the case of regeneration of osmium tetroxide by N-methylmorpholine N-oxide. * O-alkylation. Pyridine N-oxides react with alkyl halides to the O-alkylated product * Bis-ter-pyridine derivatives adsorbed on silver surfaces are discussed to react with oxygen to bis-ter-pyridine-N-oxide. This reaction can be followed by video-scanning tunneling microscopy with sub-molecular resolution. * In the Meisenheimer rearrangement (after Jakob Meisenheimer) certain N-oxides R1R2R3N+O− rearrange to hydroxylamines R2R3N−O−R1J.

Examples include nicotine, Zolmitriptan, and morphine. Amine oxides of anti-cancer drugs have been developed as prodrugs that are metabolized in the oxygen-deficient cancer tissue to the active drug. Human safety Amine oxides (AO) are not known to be carcinogenic, dermal sensitizers or cause reproductive toxicity. They are readily metabolized and excreted if ingested. Chronic ingestion by rabbits found lower body weight, diarrhea, and lenticular opacities at a lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAEL) in the range of 87–150 mg AO/kw bw/day. Tests of human skin exposure have found that after 8 hours less than 1% is absorbed into the body. Eye irritation due to amine oxides and other surfactants is moderate and temporary with no lasting effects. Environmental safety Amine oxides with an average chain length of 12.6 have been measured to be water-soluble at ~410 g L−1. They are considered to have low bioaccumulation potential in aquatic species based on log Kow data from chain lengths less than C14 (bioconcentration factor < 87%). Levels of AO in untreated influent were found to be 2.3–27.8 ug L−1, while in effluent they were found to be 0.4–2.91 ug L−1. The highest effluent concentrations were found in oxidation ditch and trickling filter treatment plants. On average, over 96% removal has been found with secondary activated sludge treatment. Acute toxicity in fish, as indicated by 96h LC50 tests, is in the range of 1,000–3,000 ug L−1 for carbon chain lengths less than C14. LC50 values for chain lengths greater than C14 range from 600 to 1400 ug L−1. Chronic toxicity data for fish is 420 ug/L. When normalized to C12.9, the NOEC is 310 ug L−1 for growth and hatchability.

He was the Archbishop Emeritus of San Francisco. Before that, Niederauer served as Bishop of Salt Lake City from 1994 to 2005. Biography George Niederauer was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of George and Elaine Niederauer. He attended St. Catherine's Military School and then St. Anthony High School; he was a classmate of Cardinal William Levada. After graduating in 1954, he attended Stanford University. During his freshman year Niederauer changed course and decided to enter St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, from where in 1959 he earned a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. He further completed his studies with a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and a Master of Arts degree in English literature from Loyola University, Los Angeles in 1962. Niederauer also earned a Ph.D. in English Literature at USC. Niederauer was ordained to the priesthood on April 30, 1962. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness in 1984. Niederauer served as Rector of St. John’s Seminary in Camarillo from 1987 to 1992. He was appointed the eighth Bishop of Salt Lake City by Pope John Paul II on November 3, 1994. Niederauer received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1995 from Cardinal Roger Mahony, with Archbishop William Levada and Bishop Tod David Brown serving as co-consecrators. As bishop he was seen as \\"the most approachable of persons and one whose homilies were almost magical in their ability to make potentially difficult Scripture passages and theological concepts comprehensible and applicable – even inspiring – in our daily lives.\\" On December 15, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI named him to succeed William Levada as the eighth Metropolitan Archbishop of San Francisco, following Levada's appointment to Pope Benedict's former post of Prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith in the Roman Curia. Archbishop Niederauer was the chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Communication, and a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications. On August 29, 2011, Niederauer underwent emergency double by- pass heart surgery. On July 27, 2012, the apostolic nuncio to the United States announced that the Holy See had accepted Niederauer's letter of resignation, and Salvatore J. Cordileone was appointed the Archbishop-elect of San Francisco. On that day, the see of San Francisco became vacant, and Niederauer attained the title Archbishop Emeritus. Views =Support of Proposition 8= In 2008, Archbishop Niederauer campaigned in favor of California's Proposition 8, a ballot measure to recognize heterosexual marriage as the only valid marriage within California. Niederauer claims to have been instrumental in forging alliances between Catholics and Mormons to support the measure. Wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Niederauer drew in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and proved to be a critical move in building a multi-religious coalition—the backbone of the fundraising, organizing and voting support for the successful ballot measure. By bringing together Mormons and Catholics, Niederauer would align the two most powerful religious institutions in the Prop. 8 battle.\\"Kuruvila, Matthai (November 10, 2008) \\"To Pass Measure, Catholics and Mormons Allied.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved 11-10-08.) =Films= The archbishop said that he had seen Brokeback Mountain, making him the first senior American cleric to state that he has viewed the film. When asked for his reaction he said that \\"I thought it was very powerful, and I probably had a different take on it than a lot of people did.... It was a story not only about the relationship between the two principal characters, but very much a cluster of relationships... And I think in all of that one of the lessons is the destructiveness of not being honest with yourself, and not being honest with other people – and not being faithful, trying to live a double life, and what that does to each of the lives you try to live.\\" =Abstinence= \\"Our belief is that we have to hold up the standard of abstinence, and we do that in all of our teaching about sexuality by saying that sexual activity outside of marriage is wrong. Now that's a very high bar to set and I understand that. And I don't regret that – I subscribe to it and I teach it. I understand why people find it difficult and disagree with it. I understand why they do. I don't agree with them.... What I would say is that people who disagree with us can disagree without being disagreeable.\\" =Moral teaching= \\"Authentic moral teaching is based on objective truth, not polling.\\" See also * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops  Sources  * * Salt Lake Diocese press release of Niederauer's appointment as archbishop  References  External links * Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco Official Site Episcopal succession Category:1936 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American Roman Catholic archbishops Category:People from Los Angeles Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Salt Lake City Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Roman Catholic Archbishops of San Francisco Category:Catholic University of America alumni ","title":"George Hugh Niederauer"},{"id":"3432799","text":"The All India States Peoples' Conference (AISPC) was a conglomeration of political movements in the princely states of the British Raj, which were variously called Praja Mandals or Lok Parishads.; The first session of the organisation was held in Bombay in December 1927. The Conference looked to the Indian National Congress for support, but Congress was reluctant to provide it until 1939, when Jawaharlal Nehru became its president, serving in this position till 1946. After the Indian Independence, however, the Congress distanced itself from the movement, allying itself with the princely rulers via its national government's accession relationships. The States Peoples' Conference dissolved itself on 25 April 1948 and all its constituent units merged into the Congress, with one exception, viz., the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference. This body, under the leadership of Sheikh Abdullah remained independent, while one section of it merged with the Congress in 1965. Organisation The Conference brought together representatives from hundreds of Indian princely states, including Baroda, Bhopal, Travancore and Hyderabad. It was established to encourage political dialogue between the princely class of India, and the British Raj, upon the issues of governance, political stability and future of India. For a long period, the Conference was hostile to the Indian independence movement, and acted often to condemn and counter-act the work of the Indian National Congress when it was banned by British authorities., In 1928, as a part of the All Parties Conference, the All India States Peoples' Conference met in Lucknow with other Indian political organisations to draft the Nehru Report, which was an early version of the Constitution of India. Democratisation The body had no popular representation until the 1930s, when it opened up its ranks to membership from across the political spectrum. Jawaharlal Nehru, who would become the first Prime Minister of India in 1947, was invited to become the President of the All-India body in 1935, became the President in 1939 and remained so until 1946. Indian integration The body would play an important role during the political integration of India, helping Indian leaders Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru negotiate with hundreds of princes over the formation of a united, independent India after 1947.

He received his first guitar from his mother as a gift and his neighbor, the musician Ramon Rivera gave him his first lessons.Popular Culture Cordero graduated from high school in 1944 when he was 16 years old and enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico. At the age of 19, he earned his bachelor's degree in Social Sciences. He made his professional debut during his student years with the \\"Trio Los Romanceros\\", which included Julito and Felipe Rodriguez.Federico Cordero's CD Collection After he earned his degree, he went to New York and entered Columbia University earning his master's degree in Economics. Cordero returned to the island and was hired by the Social Sciences Department of his alma mater. In 1950, he was hired by Chilean singer Lucho Gatica to play the guitar in his concerts. Political career The Speaker of the House of Representatives Ernesto Ramos Antonini offered Cordero a job in the Office of Legislative Services in the Capitol Building. Later he ran and was elected as an at-large Representative in the House. He held various positions including the chairmanship of the Commerce and Industry Committee. In 1960, Cordero returned to the University of Puerto Rico to study law and won reelection to the House. Among his classmates were future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico Víctor Pons and future Attorney General, Senate president and Governor of Puerto Rico Rafael Hernández Colón. In 1962, after earning his law degree, he resigned his legislative seat and taught law at his alma mater. First concert In 1964, Cordero held his first concert at the Ponce Museum of Art located in the city of Ponce. He also worked as the producer of the television show La guitarra y sus temas (The guitar and its themes) on WIPR- TV.

Founded in 1865, it became part of Federated Department Stores in 1929. Shortly after Federated's 1994 acquisition of R.H. Macy & Company, it eliminated the A&S; brand. Most A&S; stores took the Macy's name, although a few became part of Stern's, another Federated division, but one that offered lower-end goods than Macy's or A&S; did. History =Timeline= *1800s - The store was founded in 1865 in Brooklyn, New York, as Wechsler & Abraham by Joseph Wechsler and Abraham Abraham. In 1893, the Straus family (including Isidor Straus and Nathan Straus), who acquired a general partnership with Macy's department stores in 1888, bought out Joseph Wechsler's interest in Wechsler & Abraham and changed the store's name to Abraham & Straus. While Abraham & Straus did not at that time become a part of Macy's, the two stores shared an overseas office and maintained close ties. *1900s - Federated Department Stores, Inc. was formed in 1900 as a holding company by several family-owned department stores, including Abraham & Straus, F&R; Lazarus & Co. (along with its Cincinnati- based subsidiary, Shillito's), and Filene's of Boston. Corporate offices established in Columbus, Ohio, later moved to Cincinnati. In 1992, Federated Department Stores merged with Allied Stores Corporation. The A&S; and Jordan Marsh divisions were consolidated, forming the A&S;/Jordan Marsh division, headquartered in Brooklyn, NY. Early in the new year, Macy's files for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. In 1994 the Federated Department Stores acquired the now bankrupt R.H. Macy & Company and combines Macy's, headquartered in New York City, with A&S;/Jordan Marsh. In 1995, the name Abraham & Straus is dropped in favor of the more widely known name Macy's. In the few cases where both companies had stores in the same mall, only one building was kept as a Macy's. *2000s - In 2006, a historic bronze plaque honoring Isidor and Ida Straus and memorializing their deaths during the sinking of the RMS Titanic was removed during a 34th Street store renovation, and given to the Straus family. =Founding and early history= The first Brooklyn store, at 285 Fulton Street, opened in 1865 and measured 25 feet by 90 feet. Abraham Abraham, age 22, and Joseph Wechsler each contributed $5,000 for the purchase.\\"...And Paramus Makes Ten,\\" internal history published on opening of Paramus Park store, 1974 In 1883, the firm bought the recently built Second Empire cast-iron Wheeler Building at 422 Fulton Street to be their flagship store. On April 1, 1893, Nathan Straus, Isidor Straus, and Simon F. Rothschild as partners – the Straus brothers provided the financing, but Rothschild was the active partner – bought out Wechsler, and the firm became Abraham & Straus. At the time, the company had 2,000 employees. Simon F. Rothschild, Abraham's son-in-law, Edward Charles Blum, and son, Lawrence Abraham, became partners in the new firm. =1900–1969= By 1900, the company had 4,650 employees. From the 1890s to the 1920s, A&S; utilized a system of catalog store agencies across Long Island to serve customers. In 1912, Isidor Straus, along with his wife Ida, perished in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Around 1915, after Abraham's daughter married Isidor's son Percy Selden Straus, the Straus family divided up the empire with Nathan's family running A&S; and Isidor's family running Macy's. Beginning in 1928, the company embarked on a $7.8 million expansion of the Fulton Street Store, which included excavating a new basement without disturbing customers above. The renovated store opened October 10, just days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In 1929, the company also joined Filene's, Lazarus, and Bloomingdale's to form Federated Department Stores. To economize during the Depression, the company began scheduling employees according to hourly sales. In addition, all employees took a 10 percent pay cut. No employees were laid off. In 1937, Walter N. Rothschild led the company, and served as president and chairman until 1955. Following Rothschild, Sidney L. Solomon became the company's first non-family president. At the time, the company had 12,000 employees. After World War II – The company grew. In 1950, the company purchased Loeser's Garden City store, and two years later, its first new branch store opened in Hempstead, New York. In the following decades, the company expanded throughout the New York metropolitan area. Among its expansions was an anchor store at Paramus Park in Paramus, New Jersey, which necessitated the building of an access road that, despite the conversion of the store to Macy's, is still today known as A&S; Drive. =1970–1995= In the 1970s, Federated attempted to update the image of A&S; and funded the construction of new, more upscale stores. A&S; developed a new logo that once again branded the stores Abraham & Straus. The company opened a central distribution center which decreased the amount of non-selling space needed in each store. In 1978, the firm opened the first of its more upscale stores at the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey. This was followed by stores in White Plains, New York in 1980, The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, in 1981, and a replacement for the chain's Babylon, Long Island store at Westfield Sunrise Mall. In 1981 and 1982, the chain opened two stores at malls in the suburban Philadelphia market, The Court at King of Prussia and Willow Grove Park Mall. These new stores struggled to find their niche, and the two Pennsylvania stores were closed in 1987 and 1988, respectively, and the space became occupied by Philadelphia- based Strawbridge and Clothier. The Short Hills, New Jersey store seemed out of place in the very upscale mall, and customers resisted what were seen to be the store's more rigid policies concerning check acceptance, inter-store transfers, and refunds. Eventually, A&S; would stock the Short Hills location with merchandise that better befit the location.

From the beginning, the company had high aspirations. In 1885, the company hired architect George L. Morse to work on the Fulton Street store in Downtown Brooklyn. For their 1928 to 1930 renovations and additions, the company hired architects Starrett & van Vleck to build an Art Deco addition that faced Fulton, Hoyt, and Livingston Streets. In 2003, the Brooklyn Heights Association and the Municipal Art Society put the building on a list of 28 historic buildings in downtown Brooklyn that needed to be protected. In the mid-1970s, Abraham & Straus' flagship store made mannequin modeling famous. Linda Timmins, head of the division, selected one juvenile and ingénue with \\"The Editorial Look\\" from each of the high schools across Brooklyn and Manhattan. The schools and their students were also selected for high academic standing; Manhattan Performing Arts High School student Yvette Post, Metropolitan Opera juvenile star Robert Westin, Brooklyn's Abraham Lincoln High School's Alan Jay Kahm and head cheerleader Paula Gallo, as well as Maria Russo of Catherine McAuley High School (Brooklyn) were some of the few selected to represent the youth of New York. These \\"Mannequin Models\\" would pose for up to an hour at a time in the windows of the store as \\"Living Mannequins\\", wearing classic designer clothes and current fashions designed by Nik Nik, Pierre Cardin, and other top designers and exclusive prêt-à-porter from upscale fashion houses. Eventually, as crowds would often stop traffic and became a safety hazard, Abraham & Straus had to move the Living Mannequins inside the store or face a stiff penalty from the city. Despite this change, the crowds still came. Each season, the young mannequin models would be allowed to move in order to do an in-store runway show for the Designer de Jour. Although it was the 1970s, the store did not feature polyester suits or non-designer outfits in these shows. Unlike countless numbers of downtown department stores that have closed throughout the nation, this historic location continues as a Macy's. At , it is the second-largest Macy's in the New York City area. Macy's utilizes the lower level through 5th floor for retail departments, the 6th floor for seasonal merchandise and a beauty salon, and upper floors for a number of corporate departments. Display windows continue to be maintained along Fulton Street, and the elevator bank in the middle of the street floor continues to evoke hints of this building's elegant past. The passenger elevators at this location were among the last in all of New York City to be converted from manual operator to automatic use. Macy's has continued to reaffirm its commitment to this location. On July 16, 2014, Women's Wear Daily' reported that Macy’s had stopped the renovation of its Brooklyn flagship while it considered possibly selling the property, which could be worth $300 million from a developer looking to turn it into condominium apartments. It had also been reported that Macy's was considering building a new Downtown Brooklyn store. By 2016, the decision was made to remain in the current location, but consolidate the space into four level floors and sell off the remaining floors. As of 2018, the work continues to progress.

History =World War II= Organization and training in the United States The squadron was first activated as the 453d Bombardment Squadron at Columbia Army Air Base, South Carolina on 4 August 1942 as one of the four original squadrons of the 323d Bombardment Group. After Phase I training at MacDill Field, Florida with Martin B-26 Marauders, the squadron trained for combat at Myrtle Beach Bombing Range, South Carolina until late April 1943, when the ground echelon departed Myrtle Beach for England, sailing on the on 5 May. The air echelon of the squadron had moved to Baer Field, Indiana in February. At Baer, it received new B-26Cs, then proceeded to the United Kingdom via the south Atlantic ferry route by June.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 203-204Freeman, p. 249 Combat in Europe 323d Bomb Group B-26s The squadron began operations with Eighth Air Force in July 1943 as part of the first raid on the European continent by B-26s. When Ninth Air Force moved to the United Kingdom in the fall of 1943, the squadron became part of it. It attacked airports, industrial factories, marshalling yards and military targets in France and the Low Countries. During Big Week the squadron attacked Leeuwarden and Venlo Airfields. The squadron also attacked V-weapons launch sites in France. In preparation for Operation Overlord, the Invasion of Normandy, the 453d attacked coastal defenses and other targets in northwestern France. on D-Day it attacked lines of communication and fortifications on the coast. It was part of the aerial barrage during the opening stage of Operation Cobra, the breakout at Saint Lo. In late August 1944, the squadron left England for Lessay Airfield, an advanced landing ground in France. From the continent, it began flying night missions, with its first night mission against batteries near Saint-Malo. It also carried out night missions against ammunition dumps and fuel storage areas. In September, it attacked fortifications near Brest, France, and as allied forces advanced across France, toward the Siegfried Line shifted its operations primarily to targets in eastern France. The squadron was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for striking transportation hubs used by the Wehrmacht to bring reinforcements to the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. The 453d flew interdiction missions in the Ruhr as the Allies drove across Germany and attacked enemy communications. It flew its last combat in April 1945, then moved to Kempten, Germany, where it participated in the program to disarm Germany. It returned to the United States in November and was inactivated at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts, the Port of Embarkation, a day later. =Air Force Reserve= The squadron was reactivated under Continental Air Command (ConAC) as a reserve unit at Tinker Air Force Base in June 1949, when ConAC reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system. At Tinker, it trained under the supervision of ConAC's 2592d Air Force Reserve Training Center.See Mueller, p. 549 (training center station). The squadron flew a mix of trainers and Douglas A-26 Invaders.See Ravenstein, pp. 174-176 (323d Wing aircraft).

The Spirit closely resembles Father Christmas from English folklore. Description The Ghost of Christmas Present is the second of the three spirits (after the visitations by Jacob Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Past) that haunt the miser Ebenezer Scrooge, in order to prompt him to repent. He shows Scrooge how other people, especially those he knows, celebrate Christmas in order to show the reader what people think of Scrooge behind his back. When he first appears before Scrooge, he invites him to \\"come in and know me better, man\\". According to Dickens' novel, the Ghost of Christmas Present appears to Scrooge as \\"a jolly giant\\" with dark brown curls. He wears a fur-lined green robe and on his head a holly wreath set with shining icicles. He carries a large torch, made to resemble a cornucopia, and appears accompanied by a great feast. He states that he has had \\"more than eighteen hundred\\" brothers and later reveals the ability to change his size to fit into any space. He also bears a rusty scabbard with no sword in it, a representation of peace on Earth and good will toward men. The spirit transports Scrooge around the city, showing him scenes of festivity and also deprivation that are happening as they watch, sprinkling a little warmth from his torch as he travels. Amongst the visits are the city streets, Scrooge's nephew’s Christmas party, and the family of his impoverished clerk, Bob Cratchit. Scrooge takes an interest in Cratchit's desperately-ill son, Tiny Tim, and asks the Ghost if Tim will live. The Ghost first states that \\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die\\", and then – quick to use Scrooge's past heartless comments to two charitable solicitors against him – states, \\"What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population\\". The spirit then warns Scrooge to \\"forebear that wicked tongue until you have discovered for yourself what the surplus is, and where it is\\" and chillingly tells him \\"It may be, that in the sight of heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than MILLIONS like this poor man's child\\". The spirit finally reveals to Scrooge two emaciated children, subhuman in appearance and loathsome to behold, clinging to his robes, and names the boy as Ignorance and the girl as Want. The spirit warns Scrooge, \\"Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom unless the writing be erased\\". Ignorance and Want, represent society's abandonment of the poor and the consequences of that abandonment. Above all else, A Christmas Carol is allegorical. Dickens was a strong proponent of taking care of society's poor and downtrodden, and this is why he chose to represent them in children. The spirit once again quotes Scrooge, who asks if the grotesque children have \\"no refuge, no resource\\", and the spirit retorts with more of Scrooge's own words: \\"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?\\" The Ghost of Christmas Present, having already aged, reveals that he will only exist on Earth for a \\"very brief\\" time, implied to be that single Christmas holiday. He finally disappears at the stroke of midnight on Twelfth Night, and leaves Scrooge to face the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, as it approaches \\"like a mist along the ground\\".

That is, if F is a family of smooth curves, C is a smooth curve (not in general belonging to F), and p is a point on C, then an osculating curve from F at p is a curve from F that passes through p and has as many of its derivatives at p equal to the derivatives of C as possible... The term derives from the Latinate root \\"osculate\\", to kiss, because the two curves contact one another in a more intimate way than simple tangency.. Reprinted in . P. 69: \\"Osculating curves don't kiss for long, and quickly revert to a more prosaic mathematical contact.\\" Examples Examples of osculating curves of different orders include: *The tangent line to a curve C at a point p, the osculating curve from the family of straight lines. The tangent line shares its first derivative (slope) with C and therefore has first-order contact with C.. *The osculating circle to C at p, the osculating curve from the family of circles. The osculating circle shares both its first and second derivatives (equivalently, its slope and curvature) with C. *The osculating parabola to C at p, the osculating curve from the family of parabolas, has third order contact with C. *The osculating conic to C at p, the osculating curve from the family of conic sections, has fourth order contact with C. Generalizations The concept of osculation can be generalized to higher-dimensional spaces, and to objects that are not curves within those spaces. For instance an osculating plane to a space curve is a plane that has second-order contact with the curve. This is as high an order as is possible in the general case.. In one dimension, analytic curves are said to osculate at a point if they share the first three terms of their Taylor expansion about that point. This concept can be generalized to superosculation, in which two curves share more than the first three terms of their Taylor expansion.

In 1888, he accepted his assistant Jan Voseček as co-member of his photographic studio. History =Ignác Schächtl & Jan Voseček= The history of Šechtl & Voseček Studios goes back to 1863, when Ignác Schächtl (1840 – 1911) made the decision to leave his work as a clerk in Prague, to study the new craft of photography in Kladno. After training, he opened a studio in Plzeň. In 1869, he decided to leave the city and become an itinerant photographer. He tried his luck in Bucharest in 1871, and later in Nepomuk and Prachatice. Several significant photographs remain from this period. One unique work that has survived is a photomontage, achieved by double exposure, depicting Šechtl both as laboratory worker, and retouching a photo, in the same picture. In 1876, aged 36, Ignác Schächtl finally settled in Tábor, and officially opened his studio at house #333 on Maria Square (today Nicholas of Hus Square). His son, Josef Jindřich, was born in 1877. Family tradition says that the same day, in a pub, Šechtl met the commercial traveler, Jan Voseček (1851 – 1936), who very soon became almost a part of the family. A very important phase in the history of the studio was the period of cooperation with the first photographer in Tábor, Alexander Seik (1824 – 1905), which was officially announced in 1878. From this, Ignác Šechtl got clients, and money to buy modern equipment. After the “united photographic studio” with Seik was dissolved, in 1888, Ignác Schächtl took Jan Voseček into partnership, and the firm became known as \\"Schächtl & Voseček\\", later renamed to \\"Šechtl & Voseček\\". =Josef Jindřich Šechtl= Josef Jindřich Šechtl (1877 – 1954) continued his father's tradition. In 1907 he commenced the building of a modern photographic studio in the main street, where the Hotel Palcát now stands. Josef Jindřich Šechtl was famous for his quality portraits and group photographs. Many of the famous people who visited Tábor at this time were also photographed in the Šechtl and Voseček studios. As with his father, his passion was photojournalism, and he has provided us with a unique photo documentary of his time. Thanks to his attention to detail, his reputation grew, and the family business blossomed. =Josef Šechtl & Marie Šechtlová= Josef Šechtl (1925 – 1992) and his wife Marie Šechtlová (*1928) took over the studio in 1944. Marie in particular, brought a feminine emotive element to their work. In the 1960s, she was among the most successful photographers of “the poetry of the everyday”. Following the nationalisation of the studio by the Communist government in 1953, they continued working as freelance photographers, mounting many exhibitions and producing a number of publications, including Tábor, Jižní Čechy, Hradec Králové, and Loutky. Together, they were a team of art photographers, pioneering colour photography, and the use of large photographs for interior decoration. Museum and archive digitisation A project of digitising the archive of Šechtl and Voseček's photographs aims to make available online some 10,000 preserved glass plate negatives from 1860 to the 1950s, hundreds of 35mm films (1930 to 1950s), and thousands of medium- and large-format images. The small Šechtl & Voseček Museum of Photography has been created, in cooperation with the Škrla family, at their site on Nicholas of Hus Square. The museum is dealing with the project of digitising the archive. Three times a year, the museum prepares a themed exhibition of 80–100 pictures, to share this record of the history of Tábor and of photography.

In 1785, he transferred to the Duke of Wellington's Regiment and returned with them to England the following year as they took up duty as the King's Guard at Windsor Castle. In 1789, Macaulay's former commanding officer, John Graves Simcoe, recommended him to the post of surgeon to the New South Wales Regiment, but he did not go to Australia. When Simcoe was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada in 1791, he began organizing his staff before he set sail and he chose Macaulay to be his chief surgeon in the new Canadian colony. Macaulay accompanied Simcoe to Upper Canada, arriving at the provincial capital, Niagara-on-the- Lake, in 1792. The Macaulays enjoyed a close relationship with the Simcoes which immediately made them prominent members in local society, aided by the fact that Macaulay's wife had known Elizabeth Simcoe from childhood in England, becoming firm friends in Upper Canada. Elizabeth (Gwillim) Simcoe at Canadian biographies online This closeness drew jealousy from some Canadians, notably the Provincial Secretary William Jarvis in 1795. Career in the Canadas Front Street, York, Upper Canada; 1804 In 1796, Macaulay again accompanied Simcoe to the new provincial capital, York. Macaulay acquired several large parcels of land there due to his military service, and helped by his close friendship with the Lieutenant-Governor. In 1800, Macaulay was appointed Justice of the Peace and served on the commission to oversee improvements to Yonge Street. In 1803, along with Judge Henry Allcock, Rev. George Okill Stuart and others, he was on the committee to build an Anglican church. That same year (1803), Macaulay was appointed Chief Medical Officer in both Upper and Lower Canada, and Surgeon-General to the British Forces in the Canadas. From 1805, this required him to live in Quebec City, though his family remained in York. In 1808, he lost the post to William Somerville, the Deputy Inspector of Hospitals on the staff of Sir James Henry Craig, Governor- General of the Canadas. He was refused the position of Deputy Inspector of Hospitals and instead in 1810 was appointed a medical examiner in Lower Canada. When Somerville returned to England in 1811, he was again appointed Chief Medical Officer. During the War of 1812, he helped to plan and establish military hospitals in both the Canadas. In 1813, he served with Lieutenant- General Sir George Prévost at the attack on Sackets Harbor, New York, and, following his appointment that July as Deputy Inspector of Hospitals, was with Major-General Francis de Rottenburg on the Niagara Peninsula. He was still serving there at the end of the war and subsequently was stationed at Kingston until placed on half pay in 1817. Return to York, Upper Canada Returning to York, he served on the first Medical Board of Upper Canada and acted as its Chief Medical Officer from 1819 until his death three years later. With James Baby, Peter Robinson (1785–1838) and others, he was appointed to a commission formed in 1819 to deal with estates forfeited during the War of 1812, and he joined with other members of York’s élite, including William Allan, Thomas Ridout and William Warren Baldwin in promoting the bank which was to be chartered as the Bank of Upper Canada. Described as 'an assiduous collector of land', before 1800 alone Macaulay had acquired . He lived with his family at Teraulay Cottage . Governor John Graves Simcoe described his friend Macaulay as \\"a young man attached to his profession, and of that docile, patient, and industrious turn... that will willingly direct itself to any pursuit.\\" The York Observer reported at his death, It becomes our painful duty to communicate to our readers the decease of Dr Macaulay of this town. In the death of this truly valuable member of society, charity has lost its best supporter, and the unfortunate emigrants their best friend. He was ever ready to wait upon and relieve the forlorn stranger not only with his medicine, but with his purse; and it is to be hoped that those gentlemen who are left behind will endeavour to imitate his unbounded liberality. The House of Assembly and the Honourable Legislative Council adjourned to attend the funeral. Family Macaulay and his wife, Elizabeth Tuck Hayter (1770–1809), were married at Alverstoke, England, in 1790. She was the daughter of Naval Lieutenant Samuel Hayter (1737–1800) of Wareham Priory, and formerly of East Creech Manor, Isle of Purbeck, Dorset; a grandson of Captain Seth Jermy. Captain Seth Jermy (1653-1724) R.N, Canadian biographies online They were the parents of four sons and four daughters. Two sons (George and Allan) died in early manhood, leaving John Simcoe Macaulay and Sir James Buchanan Macaulay. Their eldest daughter, Elizabeth, married The Hon. Christopher Alexander Hagerman, and they were the parents of Mrs John Beverley Robinson. The second daughter, Mary, married The Hon. John William Gamble, and another daughter, Sarah, married The Hon. John Solomon Cartwright. Through position, association and marriage, Macaulay's family were one of the most influential of the kind in early Upper Canada.

Translators noticed similarities between the structural hierarchy of Caodaism and the Roman Catholic Church, and, for lack of better words or whatever reasons, borrowed terminologies such as pope, cardinal, bishop, priest, etc. In practice, Caodaiism has many more ranks and titles of which there are no official English translation yet. Also, the actual Vietnamese term for “pope”, as in “The Catholic Pope”, is Giáo Hoàng. In 1926, Lê Văn Trung believed a great Chinese poet had contacted him during a séance to give him a religious mission in life. This led to his signing the “Declaration of the Founding of the Cao Đài Religion” on 7 October 1926. This formally announced the founding of the religion to the world. The declaration he signed affirmed principles that combined Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, spiritism and others. Before this, Ngô Văn Chiêu had declined his appointment as Pope and withdrew to represent a more esoteric form of the faith. Lê Văn Trung took the more exoteric approach, becoming their leader and acting Pope. After Trung's death (disincarnation) in 1934, the Venerable Phạm Công Tắc, who was also the Maintainer of the Laws/Dharma, assumed the role.

History and practices The Trap Door Spiders were established by author Fletcher Pratt in 1944, in response to the June 7, 1943 marriage of his friend Dr. John D. Clark to operatic soprano Mildred Baldwin. The new Mrs. Clark was unpopular with her husband's friends, despite their participation in the ceremony (Pratt's own wife Inga Stephens Pratt was matron of honor, and L. Sprague de Camp served as Clark's best man).Asimov (1994), pages 376-377.\\"Mildred Baldwin Bride: Opera Singer Wed to Dr. John D.

The presidency of the club rotated among the members, the president for a given evening being the member who had volunteered to host the meeting by giving the dinner and supplying a guest. Over the course of its existence the Trap Door Spiders has counted among its members numerous professional men, many of them writers and editors active in the science fiction genre, along with some prominent fans such as Dr. Clark. The get-togethers of the Trap Door Spiders followed a set format, which remained consistent through the years; a dinner, given by the host for the evening, to which he would invite a guest who would be grilled by the others and form the focus of conversation for the evening. The grilling was traditionally begun by the host for the evening enquiring of the guest \\"How do you justify your existence?\\" or some variation, such as \\"Why do you exist?\\" Jack Coggins remembers that an editor for Reader's Digest went home from a meeting in tears after a brutally personal grilling. Coggins once invited Worthen Paxton, art director of Life Magazine, to a meeting.Miller, Ron. \\"Jack Coggins,\\" interview and article in Outre Magazine No. 23, 2001 pages 42–49. As of 1976, the club met roughly one Friday a month, eight or nine times a year, and maintained a membership of thirteen, among whom the privilege of hosting the meetings rotated. The host of a given meeting selected the restaurant, wine, and menu for the evening, and had the option of inviting one or two guests he believed might prove interesting to the other members. The group remained active through at least January 16, 1990, when its members attended a party given by Doubleday for Isaac Asimov at Tavern on the Green in New York City. The event commemorated Asimov's seventieth birthday and the fortieth anniversary of the publication of his first book.Asimov (1994), pages 538–539. According to L. Sprague de Camp, the club was \\"still thriving\\" as of 1996. Membership Membership of the club was by invitation, and varied as some Trap Door Spiders died or moved away (or in at least one instance was dropped by the consensus of the other members) and as others were admitted on the nomination of existing members.

According to magician and skeptic James Randi, other prominent figures attending Trap Door Spiders meetings included authors Frederik Pohl and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as Randi himself. All three appear to have attended as guests rather than members (Pohl in particular has written he was never a member),Pohl, Frederik (2009). \\"The Trap Door Spiders\\", TheWayTheFutureBlogs.com. \\"Although Wikipedia appears to think I was a member, I never was.\\" though Randi did consider himself an \\"honorary\\" member. Owing to the writings of Isaac Asimov (see below), those most closely associated with the group are Bensen, Cant, Carter, Clark, de Camp, del Rey, and Asimov himself. The Trap Door Spiders in fiction The Trap Door Spiders are fictionalized in L. Sprague de Camp's historical novel The Bronze God of Rhodes (1960), as \\"The Seven Strangers,\\" a social club holding symposia in the ancient Greek city-state of Rhodes. Such Spider elements as the rotating presidency and the question put to guests are faithfully represented in the practices of the Strangers. The club was also the inspiration for Isaac Asimov's fictional group of puzzle solvers the Black Widowers, protagonists of a long-running series of mystery short stories beginning in 1971.Asimov (1994), p.373. Asimov, a Boston resident who was often an invited guest of the Trap Door Spiders when in New York, became a permanent member of the club when he moved to the area in 1970. Asimov loosely modeled his fictional \\"Black Widowers\\" on six of the real-life Trap Door Spiders. He gave his characters professions somewhat more varied than those of their models, while retaining aspects of their personalities and appearances. Asimov's characters and their real-life counterparts are: * Geoffrey Avalon (L. Sprague de Camp) * Emmanuel Rubin (Lester del Rey) * James Drake (John Drury Clark) * Thomas Trumbull (Gilbert Cant) * Mario Gonzalo (Lin Carter) * Roger Halsted (Don Bensen) Other real people, including members of the Spiders and others, also occasionally appeared in the series in fictional guise. These included Fletcher Pratt (albeit deceased and offstage) as Widowers founder Ralph Ottur in the story \\"To the Barest,\\"Asimov, Isaac. \\"To the Barest, Afterword\\" in Casebook of the Black Widowers, New York, Doubleday, 1980. and (as guests) Asimov himself (in a humorously unflattering portrayal) as arrogant author Mortimer Stellar in \\"When No Man Pursueth\\",Asimov (1994), pages 378-379. James Randi as stage magician The Amazing Larri in \\"The Cross of Lorraine\\",Asimov, Isaac.

The remaining member of the Widowers, the group's waiter and unfailing sleuth Henry Jackson, was completely fictional, though Asimov did liken the character to that of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves from the Bertie Wooster novels.

Life He succeeded his father Maurizio Galbaio, who had associated him as doge in 778. The Byzantine emperor Leo IV the Khazar recognised his title in that year, though the attempt to set up a hereditary monarchy endangered Maurizio's own dogeship. Giovanni had been briefly held captive by the Lombard king Desiderius after a campaign in Istria, but his father, through the pope, sent ambassadors to Charlemagne, the king of the Franks, to petition for Giovanni's release. Career Upon his inheriting, without election, the full office of his father, he immediately began a vendetta against the patriarch of Grado, who represented the church and its opposition to the slave trade. Charlemagne, a dutiful son of the church and now king of Lombardy, supported the abolition of slavery in his domains and thus came to resent the Venetian commerce in the Adriatic. The patriarch, in the reign of Maurizio, had even instigated the expulsion and confiscation of goods of the Venetian merchants in the Pentapolis. Giovanni had the Empress Irene name his son Maurizio co-doge. Trying to counterinfluence the patriarch, Giovanni appointed his sixteen-year- old nephew Christopher bishop of Olivolo. The patriarch refused to consecrate him, officially due to his age, but actually because of his anti-Frankish stances. Maurizio II was sent to attack Grado with a flotilla of ships. There the elderly patriarch was thrown to his death from the tower. The opposition to the Galbaii family fled to Treviso while the nephew of the patriarch, Fortunatus, was elected in his stead and immediately fled to the Frankish court. The opposition crystallised under the leadership of one Obelerio degli Antenori and returned to Venice. Giovanni, with Maurizio and Christopher, fled to Mantua in 803, where they all probably died. Obelerio succeeded them. The Galbaio family later returned to Venice and assumed the name of Querini. References Sources *Norwich, John Julius. A History of Venice. Alfred A. Knopf: New York, 1982.

Registration is free of charge. The service is paid for by the direct marketing industry. There is a similar service for corporate users, the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (CTPS). Similar do not call lists are implemented in other countries. It is a legal requirement that all organisations (including companies, charities, voluntary organisations and political parties) do not make such calls to numbers registered on the TPS unless consent has been given; however the TPS has no powers of enforcement, and a 2013 survey by the consumer association Which? found that people registered on the TPS list received twice as many marketing calls as those not on the list. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Information Commissioner, which until 2012 did not have suitable legal powers to act, but in 2012 acquired the power to impose fines of up to £500,000. The TPS is the only such register that is enforced by law in the UK. It is regulated by Ofcom and enforced by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).Information Commissioner's Office web site It is run by the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), the organisation grouping telemarketers, on behalf of Ofcom; neither Ofcom nor the government provide any funding. Exemptions include people who have, often unwittingly, consented to be contacted, and calls purporting to be for market research. The effectiveness of the TPS is limited. Enforcement is so lax that many organisations completely ignore it and do not check numbers. There is no control over calls from outside the UK; many of the most abusive and sometimes fraudulent calls originate from overseas. A spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association—who run the TPS—said in July 2012 that it had received a dramatic increase in complaints from telephone subscribers cold- called by telemarketing firms, and that some firms simply chose to ignore the rules. The DMA sent between 1,000-2,000 complaints to the Information Commissioner's Office each month, yet no penalty fines had been imposed in at least 18 months. The head of the TPS said candidly about the service's failings, in a 2013 interview \\"I would completely understand if the Guardian [newspaper] wrote a 'TPS is broken' headline\\" The similarly named Government Telephone Preference Scheme is quite different; it is a system used since 1952 by the General Post Office and its successor British Telecom for disabling outgoing calls from all landlines if the telephone network is overloaded during an emergency; only vital lines which are registered with the scheme may make outgoing calls when it is activated.  History  Residential users have been able to register on the list since May 1999 under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999. The list has statutory force under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. From 25 June 2004 corporate subscribers were also allowed to register on the list under Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2004. In 2012 the enforcement powers of the ICO and penalties were much strengthened; however in 2013 it was still described as \\"no longer fit for purpose\\", and its head said \\"there is legislation to back us up. But the rules are complex, have loopholes, are split between agencies, tend to lag technology advances, and have been low priority\\".  Registration and complaints Numbers can be registered via the TPS website, or by telephone, and can take up to 28 days to become fully effective. Complaints can be made via the site. The TPS says that it \\"will then contact the company and warn them they are breaching the regulations and ask them to add your number to their own Do Not Call list.\\"  Violations  In addition to fines, the ICO publishes details of any formal action it takes against organisations on its website and in press releases. However, no penalties had been applied in 18 months, despite 1,000 to 2,000 monthly complaints. In 2014 consumer organisation Which? found that TPS registration eliminated no more than a third of unwanted calls, failing particularly with calls from overseas call centres.  Companies claiming to offer call banning The TPS website publishes a list of \\"unregulated organisations\\" that offer a paid-for telemarketing call banning service; the site says that: \\"our advice is NOT to pay them\\". TPS lists the websites of many such organisations, many of which display advertising links on Google searches that may mislead and divert those searching for the TPS website. However, the TPS is free of charge and is the only service that calling companies are required by law to comply with, is regulated by Ofcom, and is enforced by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). Some such organisations offer their services on Internet Web sites; others phone, often actually from overseas though this is not stated, sometimes saying falsely that the recipient has given permission to call, and often falsely claim to be from or affiliated with the TPS or BT. Many, but not all, services offered are fraudulent in addition to being ineffective.  Unwanted calls not covered by TPS  =Calls with consent= Telephone subscribers who have at some time consented to be called—perhaps by filling in a long-forgotten Web form years ago with a box to tick \\"if you don't want to receive further information\\", or a firm of which the subscriber is a customer—may legally be called unless they explicitly withdraw the implied permission given to the organisation concerned. A ticked box—or an unticked \\"no\\" box—on a form from a trusted organisation agreeing to permit calls from \\"other carefully selected organisations\\" can allow a huge variety of calls. =Silent calls= Silent calls, calls which remain silent when answered, are often due to callers using an automated dialer to make multiple calls in rapid succession, anticipating that many will not be answered; if an operator is not available at the time a call is answered, it will be silent. Silent calls, while not covered by TPS, can be reported to Ofcom. =Automatic messages= Organisations that use recorded phone messages (robocalls) for marketing or sales calls must have prior consent from the subscriber. Unauthorised silent calls and robocalls from an identified caller can be reported to the ICO. =Market research= TPS does not cover market research calls; instead individual MR companies must be contacted and told not to call a number. If the company continues to call, complaints can be made to the Market Research Society, who may be able to take action if the call was from one of their members. The TPS rules are intended to allow legitimate opinion pollers such as ICM, asking about political and other preferences, but sales lead harvesters claim to be \\"conducting a survey\\", and try to collect personal information—age, income, interests—that can be used for later sales calls or sold, rather than anonymous views about government, or council exercise facilities. =Calls from overseas= TPS will investigate unsolicited direct marketing calls from overseas made on behalf of a company that has a UK presence. Complaints about calls from companies with no UK presence can be made to the ICO. The ICO co-operates with similar organisations in Europe, the European Commission and other countries.ICO: What we cover UK organisations cannot themselves regulate or prevent calls to UK numbers being made from overseas. =Debt collection= Organisations looking to recover debts are not required to screen their data against the TPS register. Such calls, in cases where they are not allowed, can be reported to the local Trading Standards Office. Debt collection callers to a number for someone not at that number can be told not to call again; if they continue to call, the ICO may be able to help from a data protection perspective. =Text messages= Text (SMS) messages are not covered by TPS. However, they can only be sent with the recipient's prior consent; complaints can be made to the ICO. =Text alerts= Text messages sent to a landline not able to display them can cause the telephone to ring several times, and the text message to be read out automatically if the phone is answered. =Fraudulent calls= Registration with TPS does not stop illegal fraudulent calls in practice, which are often from overseas; and sometimes generated through Caller ID spoofing to display a telephone number different from the original one. Although the TPS does not have the authority to take any action of enforcement, they regularly send updates about the incoming complaints to the ICO as the body responsible. This strongly supports their investigations. Such calls can also be reported to the local Trading Standards Office or the police.

Upon succeeding Saint Sylvius as bishop of Toulouse, he ordered the completion of the basilica of St. Saturnin, a part of which was incorporated into the Basilica of St. Sernin. Saint Jerome praised Exuperius \\"for his munificence to the monks of Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, and for his charity to the people of his own diocese, who were then suffering from the attacks of the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi.\\" On behalf of the poor in his diocese he sold the basilica's altar vessels and was therefore compelled to carry the Sacred Offering in an osier basket and the Precious Blood in a vessel of glass. In respect of his virtues and in gratitude for his gifts, Saint Jerome dedicated his Commentary on Zacharias to him. Exuperius is best known in connection with the Canon of the Sacred Scriptures. He had written to Pope Innocent I for instructions concerning the canon and several points of ecclesiastical behaviour. In reply, the pope honoured him with the letter Consulenti Tibi, dated February 405, which contained a list of the canonical scriptures.including the deuterocanonical books of the Catholic Canon. The assertion of non-Catholic writers that the Canon of Innocent I excluded the Apocrypha is not true, if they mean to extend the term \\"Apocrypha\\" to the deuterocanonical books. The opinion of Baronius, that bishop Exuperius was the same person as the rector with the same name, is usually rejected, as the rector was a teacher of Hannibalianus and Dalmatius, nephews of Constantine the Great, and therefore from an earlier period than the bishop. From Jerome's letter to Furia in 394, and from the epistle of Saint Paulinus to Amandus of Bordeaux in 397, it seems probable that Exuperius was a priest at Rome, and later at Bordeaux before he was raised to the episcopate—though it is possible that in both of these letters reference is made to a different person. The precise date of his promotion to the bishop is unknown. Evidence suggests that he occupied the See of Toulouse in February 405 (as is evident from the letter of Innocent I mentioned above). It is sometimes said that Jerome reproached him in a letter to Riparius, a priest of Spain, for tolerating the heretic Vigilantius; but as Vigilantius did not belong to the diocese of Toulouse, Jerome was probably speaking of another bishop. Exuperius was venerated as a saint from early times. In the time of Gregory of Tours he was held in equal veneration with Saint Saturninus. His feast occurs on 28 September. The first martyrologist to assign it to this date was Usuard, who wrote towards the end of the 9th century.

It is the third and final spirit to visit the miser Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas Eve. Description \\"The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery. It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.\\" Scrooge finds the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come to be different from the rest of the ghosts and the most fearsome of the Spirits; it appears to Scrooge as a figure entirely muffled in a black hooded cloak, except for a single spectral hand with which it points. Although the character never speaks in the story, communicating entirely by pointing, Scrooge understands it, usually through assumptions from his previous experiences and rhetorical questions. It is notable that, even in satires and parodies of the tale, this spirit retains its original look. When the Ghost makes its appearance, the first thing it shows Scrooge is three wealthy gentlemen making light of a recent death, remarking that it will be a cheap funeral, if anyone comes at all. One businessman said he would go – but only if lunch is provided. Next, Scrooge is shown the same dead person's belongings being stolen by Scrooge's charwoman, Scrooge's laundress, Mrs. Dilber, and the local undertaker and sold to a fence called Old Joe. He also sees a shrouded corpse, which he implores the Ghost not to unmask. Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death. The ghost can only show him a poor couple indebted to the man momentarily rejoicing that the man is dead, giving them more time to pay off their debt. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The spirit then takes Scrooge to a rundown churchyard and shows the repentant miser his own grave; Scrooge then realizes the dead man of whom the others spoke ill was himself. For the first time the hand appeared to shake. \\"Good Spirit,\\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: \\"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!\\" Scrooge then watches as the Spirit's robe shrinks to become his bedpost and finds that he is back in the present on Christmas morning. Along with the visions supplied by the other spirits, the ghost's warnings about Scrooge's future transform him into a better man.

The film is based on a combination of plot and character elements from the first four books of Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series (A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore, and Tehanu). The film's title is named from the collection of short stories, Tales from Earthsea, made in 2001. The plot was \\"entirely different\\" according to the author Ursula K. Le Guin, who told director Gorō Miyazaki, \\"It is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie\\", although she later expressed her disappointment with the end result. A film comic adaptation of the film has been published in Japan. Plot The crew of a war galley are up against a storm. Suddenly two dragons are seen fighting above the clouds, during which the White Dragon is killed suddenly by the Black Dragon, an occurrence believed to have been impossible for centuries. News of the kingdom declining and nothing has been heard from Prince Arren, which troubles the King of the once tranquil kingdom of Enlad. The wizard Root speaks of dragons and men once being \\"as one\\", divided by their particular desires (freedom and possessions respectively), which is the cause of the world's balance, gradually weakening. Suddenly the King is fatally stabbed with a dagger in a dark corridor by his own son, Prince Arren, who steals his father's sword and flees the castle. In the desert, Arren is rescued from wolves by the archmage Sparrowhawk. Together they travel to the city of Hort Town. When Arren explores the town alone, he rescues a young girl named Therru from slavers, but is later captured by the same slave master, Hare. His sword is dumped in the sea. Sparrowhawk rescues Arren from the slave caravan and takes him to a farm run by Sparrowhawk's oldest and greatest friend Tenar, who lives with Therru. Sparrowhawk's intervention against Hare's slave caravan angers Lord Cob, a powerful warlock and the ruler of Hort Town, who wants the archmage brought to the castle. Meanwhile, Sparrowhawk tells Arren that he seeks a way to restore the upset balance, then resumes his search in Hort Town. While there he buys Arren's sword from a merchant's stall and manages to evade capture from Hare whilst learning about Cob's castle. Arren confesses to Therru that he killed his father and that he feels an unknown presence following him. Because of this, Arren leaves the farm, but is met by the presence, which is a mirror image of himself. Arren falls unconscious after stumbling into a swamp while fleeing from the image. Cob takes him to the castle, where he manipulates him into revealing his \\"true name\\", Prince Lebannen, to control him. Meanwhile, Hare captures Tenar as bait to lure Sparrowhawk into the castle, leaving Therru tied to a post as a messenger. She frees herself, and encounters Sparrowhawk, who gives her Arren's sword to give to Arren. Sparrowhawk breaks into the castle to save Tenar and confronts Cob. Sparrowhawk learns that Cob is causing the world's Balance to collapse by opening the door between life and death to try and gain eternal life. Sparrowhawk tries to warn Cob of the dangers of upsetting the balance, and Cob sends Arren out to kill him. Sparrowhawk frees the prince from Cob's control but is captured by Hare, his great mystical strength and powers having been weakened within the stronghold of Cob's castle. Meanwhile, Therru sees the same copy of Arren and follows him to the castle, where he reveals that he is the light within Arren and tells Therru his true name. Therru enters the castle and learns of Sparrowhawk and Tenar's sunrise execution. She finds Arren, guilty and hopeless, and brings hope back to him, calling him by his true name and confiding in him her own true name, Tehanu. They rush to rescue Sparrowhawk and Tenar. Arren confronts Cob, who tries to kill him. He fights back and finally unsheathes his sword, which was sealed with magic. Arren cuts off Cob's staff-holding hand. Unable to use any of his magic powers, Cob rapidly begins to age. He captures Therru and flees to the highest tower of the castle, with Arren in pursuit. Cornering Cob, Arren tries to explain what he learned about life and death from Therru and Sparrowhawk to Cob, but the withering Dark Lord refuses to listen and uses the last of his magic to strangle Therru to death. Instead of dying, she reveals her true form as the Black Dragon, possessing life everlasting. Therru kills Cob with her fire breath and rescues Arren from the collapsing tower. Sparrowhawk and Tenar leave the castle while Therru and Arren land in a field where Therru changes back into a human. Arren tells Therru he will leave for home to repent for his crime, but will come back to see her some day. After he and Therru reunite with Sparrowhawk and Tenar, the four of them spend time together. Arren and Sparrowhawk depart for Enlad, bidding Therru and Tenar goodbye. Therru looks up to see her fellow dragons airborne, indicating that the balance of the world has been restored.

Production This feature film from Studio Ghibli is the first anime film adaptation of any part of the Earthsea series. In the past, many directors, including Hayao Miyazaki, had tried to adapt the Earthsea cycle for film, but were disapproved by the author herself. When Le Guin first heard of Miyazaki's interest in adapting her work, she had not seen any of his films and associated animation with the output of Disney. As such, she turned down his request. In 2003, after winning an Oscar for his film Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki received Le Guin's approval but was busy directing Howl's Moving Castle. Studio Ghibli head Toshio Suzuki decided that Hayao's son Gorō Miyazaki, who was advising on the film, should be given his first directing job for the adaptation. Hayao was dissatisfied with the decision, thinking that Gorō lacked the necessary experience. They reportedly did not speak to one another during production of the film. Hayao later acknowledged his son's work upon its first preview.See Nausicaa.net Goro Miyazaki's Blog. Some feel that a major section of the plot was adapted from the director's father, Hayao Miyazaki's The Journey of Shuna graphic novel, with many direct references. Le Guin, who had become a devoted fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work following their first encounter and had wished for him to direct the film, was also disappointed by the selection of Goro as director, but was told by Studio Ghibli that Hayao would oversee the film's production. =Music= The soundtrack for Tales from Earthsea was composed and managed by Tamiya Terashima and was released by Tokuma Japan Communications and Studio Ghibli Records as a multichannel hybrid SACD-CD on 12 July 2006. Carlos Núñez was a key collaborator on the soundtrack, contributing his ocarina, whistle and Galician gaita (bagpipe) to 11 of the 21 tracks. Newcomer singer, Aoi Teshima, sang in 2 of the tracks. A follow-up album, \\"Melodies from Gedo Senki\\", was released on 17 January 2007 and included unreleased Gedo Senki OST tracks and new tracks by Núñez.Ghibliworld, MEMORIES FROM GEDO SENKI WITH CARLOS NUNEZ, 19 December 2006 Studio Ghibli, カルロス・ヌニェスのニューアルバムの発売決定！, 11 December 2006 Trailer Studio Ghibli released the first and second trailers on its official web site. A three-minute Japanese trailer was first shown in Japanese cinemas starting Saturday 24 February 2006. It was aired on NTV on 23 February 2006 (the day the trailer was completed). Theo Le Guin, Ursula K. Le Guin's son, viewed the Japanese trailer and said this of it: \\"The images are really beautiful. The song too, it's not like something from Hollywood, but felt really like Ghibli.\\" The trailers were made by Keiichi Itagaki, who had been responsible for trailers for all of the other Ghibli films up until then. Reception The film reached No. 1 at the Japanese Box Office on its opening week with a gross of over 900 million yen, or 7.7 million USD, pushing Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest to second place and became the number one movie in the country for five weeks,Ranking at Eiga.com from 2006-08-15 until it was pushed out of the top spot when X-Men: The Last Stand was released.Box Office Japan's Weekly Statistics The movie went on to be the #4 top-grossing movie for the year in Japan. In the early 1980s animator and director Hayao Miyazaki asked Ursula K. Le Guin, the author of the Earthsea series, for permission to create an animated adaptation of Earthsea. Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and anime in general, turned down the offer. Years later, after seeing My Neighbor Totoro, she reconsidered her refusal, believing that if anyone should be allowed to direct an Earthsea film, it should be Hayao Miyazaki. The film was ultimately directed by Miyazaki's son Gorō, rather than Hayao Miyazaki himself, which disappointed Le Guin. While she was positive about the aesthetic of the film, writing that \\"much of it was beautiful\\", she took great issue with its re-imagining of the moral sense of the books and greater focus on physical violence. \\"[E]vil has been comfortably externalized in a villain\\", Le Guin writes, \\"the wizard Kumo/Cob, who can simply be killed, thus solving all problems. In modern fantasy (literary or governmental), killing people is the usual solution to the so-called war between good and evil. My books are not conceived in terms of such a war, and offer no simple answers to simplistic questions.\\" She stated that the plot departed so greatly from her story that she was \\"watching an entirely different story, confusingly enacted by people with the same names as in my story\\". She also praised certain depictions of nature in the film, but felt that the production values of the film were not as high as previous works directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and that the film's excitement was focused too much around scenes of violence. Her initial response to Gorō Miyazaki was \\"[I]t is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie\\". However, she stated that the comment disclosed on the movie's public blog did not portray her true feelings about the film's vast departure from original stories; \\"taking bits and pieces out of context, and replacing the storylines with an entirely different plot...\\" Le Guin's mixed opinion of the film is indicative of the overall reception of the film, particularly in Japan. In Japan, the film found both strong proponents and detractors. Many of the opinions can best be summed up in a response to Le Guin's comments on her website, that the weak points of the film were the result of \\"when too much responsibility was shouldered by someone not equipped for it\\". The critical reception in Japan was positive, but received mixed reviews when comparing it to the other Ghibli movies. Miyazaki was presented Japan's Bunshun Raspberry Award for \\"Worst Director\\", with Tales from Earthsea receiving the award for \\"Worst Movie\\", at the end of 2006.Earthsea Wins \\"Raspberry Award\\" - Anime News Network The film was nominated in 2007 for the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year (losing to The Girl Who Leapt Through Time)Official website of the award.

In its American release, the film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for some violent images, making it the first and only animated film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to receive a PG-13 rating. It is also the second Studio Ghibli film to receive this rating after Princess Mononoke (The Wind Rises, the third PG-13 film from Studio Ghibli, was distributed under Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner).

The film was not released as widely as previous Ghibli movies, playing to 23 venues across the nation and making an unremarkable £23,300. Reviews were generally positive, but received mixed reviews when it was compared to the past Ghibli films. Radio Times suggested that it \\"lacks the technical sheen and warm sentimentality of some of Ghibli's earlier films\\", while the Daily Mirror called it \\"ploddy, excruciatingly slow\\" and not in the same league as the work of Hayao Miyazaki. However, Empire magazine said it was \\"well worth watching\\" while The Guardian called it \\"An engaging piece of work\\".

The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris and his release to live in London with his daughter Lucie, whom he had never met. The story is set against the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. Dickens' best-known work of historical fiction, A Tale of Two Cities is regularly cited as the best- selling novel of all time. In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll.\\"The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003. Retrieved 26 July 2019 The novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has continued to have an influence on popular culture. Synopsis =Book the First: Recalled to Life= Dickens' famous opening sentence introduces the universal approach of the book, the French Revolution, and the drama depicted within: > It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of > wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was > the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of > Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had > everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to > Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so > far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted > on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of > comparison only.Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities, Book the First, > Chapter I. In 1775, a man flags down the nightly mail-coach on its route from London to Dover. The man is Jerry Cruncher, an employee of Tellson's Bank in London; he carries a message for Jarvis Lorry, a passenger and one of the bank's managers. Lorry sends Jerry back to deliver a cryptic response to the bank: \\"Recalled to Life.\\" The message refers to Alexandre Manette, a French physician who has been released from the Bastille after an 18-year imprisonment. Once Lorry arrives in Dover, he meets Dr. Manette's daughter Lucie and her governess, Miss Pross. Lucie has believed her father to be dead, and faints at the news that he is alive; Lorry takes her to France to reunite with her father. In the Paris neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Dr. Manette has been given lodgings by his former servant Ernest Defarge and his wife Therese, owners of a wine shop. Lorry and Lucie find him in a small garret, where he spends much of his time making shoes – a skill he learned in prison – which he uses to distract himself from his thoughts and which has become an obsession for him. He does not recognise Lucie at first but does eventually see the resemblance to her mother through her blue eyes and long golden hair, a strand of which he found on his sleeve when he was imprisoned. Lorry and Lucie take him back to England. =Book the Second: The Golden Thread= In 1780, French émigré Charles Darnay is on trial for treason against the British Crown. The key witnesses against him are two British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly, who claim that Darnay gave information about British troops in North America to the French. Under cross-examination by Mr. Stryver, the barrister defending Darnay, Barsad claims that he would recognise Darnay anywhere. Stryver points out his colleague, Sydney Carton, who bears a strong resemblance to Darnay, and Barsad admits that the two men look nearly identical. With Barsad's eyewitness testimony now discredited, Darnay is acquitted. In Paris, the hated and abusive Marquis St. Evrémonde orders his carriage driven recklessly fast through the crowded streets, hitting and killing the child of Gaspard in Saint Antoine. The Marquis throws a coin to Gaspard to compensate him for his loss. Defarge, having observed the incident, comes forth to comfort the distraught father, saying the child would be worse off alive. This piece of wisdom pleases the Marquis, who throws a coin to Defarge also. As the Marquis departs, a coin is flung back into his carriage. Arriving at his country château, the Marquis meets his nephew and heir, Darnay. Out of disgust with his aristocratic family, the nephew has shed his real surname (St. Evrémonde) and anglicised his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais, to Darnay.Dickens 2003, p. 191 (Book 2, Chapter 16). The following passage records the Marquis' principles of aristocratic superiority: > \\"Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and > slavery, my friend,\\" observed the Marquis, \\"will keep the dogs obedient to > the whip, as long as this roof,\\" looking up to it, \\"shuts out the > sky.\\"Dickens 2003, p. 128 (Book 2, Chapter 9). This statement (about the > roof) is truer than the Marquis knows, and another example of foreshadowing: > the Evrémonde château is burned down by revolting peasants in Book 2, > Chapter 23. That night, Gaspard, who followed the Marquis to his château by riding on the underside of the carriage, stabs and kills him in his sleep. Gaspard leaves a note on the knife saying, \\"Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from JACQUES.\\"Dickens 2003, p. 134 (Book 2, Chapter 9) After nearly a year on the run, he is caught and hanged above the village well. In London, Darnay asks for Dr. Manette's permission to wed Lucie, but Carton confesses his love to Lucie as well. Knowing she will not love him in return, Carton promises to \\"embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you\\".Dickens 2003, p. 159 (Book 2, Chapter 14) Stryver considers proposing marriage to Lucie, but Lorry talks him out of the idea. On the morning of the marriage, Darnay reveals his real name and family lineage to Dr. Manette, a detail he had been asked to withhold until that day. In consequence, Dr. Manette reverts to his obsessive shoemaking after the couple leave for their honeymoon. He returns to sanity before their return, and the whole incident is kept secret from Lucie. Lorry and Miss Pross destroy the shoemaking bench and tools, which Dr. Manette had brought with him from Paris. As time passes in England, Lucie and Charles begin to raise a family, a son (who dies in childhood) and a daughter, little Lucie. Lorry finds a second home and a sort of family with the Darnays. Stryver marries a rich widow with three children and becomes even more insufferable as his ambitions begin to be realised. Carton, even though he seldom visits, is accepted as a close friend of the family and becomes a special favourite of little Lucie. In July 1789, the Defarges help to lead the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal tyranny. Defarge enters Dr. Manette's former cell, \\"One Hundred and Five, North Tower,\\"Dickens 2003, p. 330 (Book 3, Chapter 9) and searches it thoroughly. Throughout the countryside, local officials and other representatives of the aristocracy are dragged from their homes to be killed, and the St. Evrémonde château is burned to the ground. In 1792, Lorry decides to travel to Paris to collect important documents from the Tellson's branch in that city and place them in safekeeping against the chaos of the French Revolution. Darnay intercepts a letter written by Gabelle, one of his uncle's servants who has been imprisoned by the revolutionaries, pleading for the Marquis to help secure his release. Without telling his family or revealing his position as the new Marquis, Darnay sets out for Paris. =Book the Third: The Track of a Storm= \\"The Sea Still Rises\\", an illustration for Book 2, Chapter 22 by \\"Phiz\\" Shortly after Darnay arrives in Paris, he is denounced for being an emigrated aristocrat from France and jailed in La Force Prison.Emigration is about to be made illegal but is not yet. See Dickens 2003, p. 258 (Book 3, Chapter 1) Dr. Manette, Lucie, little Lucie, Jerry, and Miss Pross travel to Paris and meet Lorry to try to free Darnay. A year and three months pass, and Darnay is finally tried. Dr Manette, viewed as a hero for his imprisonment in the Bastille, testifies on Darnay's behalf at his trial. Darnay is released, only to be arrested again later that day. A new trial begins the following day, under new charges brought by the Defarges and a third individual who is soon revealed as Dr Manette. He had written an account of his imprisonment at the hands of Darnay's father and hidden it in his cell; Defarge found it while searching the cell during the storming of the Bastille. While running errands with Jerry, Miss Pross is amazed to see her long-lost brother Solomon, but he does not want to be recognised in public. Carton suddenly steps forward from the shadows and identifies Solomon as Barsad, one of the spies who tried to frame Darnay for treason at his trial in 1780. Jerry remembers that he has seen Solomon with Cly, the other key witness at the trial, and that Cly had faked his death to escape England. By threatening to denounce Solomon to the revolutionary tribunal as a Briton, Carton blackmails him into helping with a plan. At the tribunal, Defarge identifies Darnay as the nephew of the dead Marquis St. Evrémonde and reads Dr Manette's letter. Defarge had learned Darnay's lineage from Solomon during the latter's visit to the wine shop several years earlier. The letter describes Dr Manette's imprisonment at the hands of Darnay's father and uncle for trying to report their crimes against a peasant family. Darnay's uncle had become infatuated with a girl, whom he had kidnapped and raped; despite Dr. Manette's attempt to save her, she died. The uncle killed her husband by working him to death, and her father died from a heart attack upon being informed of what had happened. Before he died defending the family honour, the brother of the raped peasant had hidden the last member of the family, his younger sister. The Evrémonde brothers imprisoned Dr. Manette after he refused their offer of a bribe to keep quiet. He concludes his letter by condemning the Evrémondes, \\"them and their descendants, to the last of their race.\\"Dickens 2003, p. 344 (Book 3, Chapter 10) Dr. Manette is horrified, but he is not allowed to retract his statement. Darnay is sent to the Conciergerie and sentenced to be guillotined the next day. Carton wanders into the Defarges' wine shop, where he overhears Madame Defarge talking about her plans to have both Lucie and little Lucie condemned. Carton discovers that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family savaged by the Evrémondes.Dickens 2003, (Book 3, Chapter 12) At night, when Dr. Manette returns, shattered after spending the day in many failed attempts to save Darnay's life, he falls into an obsessive search for his shoemaking implements. Carton urges Lorry to flee Paris with Lucie, her father, and Little Lucie, asking them to leave as soon as he joins. Shortly before the executions are to begin, Solomon sneaks Carton into the prison for a visit with Darnay. The two men trade clothes, and Carton drugs Darnay and has Solomon carry him out. Carton has decided to be executed in his place, taking advantage of their similar appearances, and has given his own identification papers to Lorry to present on Darnay's behalf. Following Carton's earlier instructions, the family and Lorry flee to England with Darnay, who gradually regains consciousness during the journey. Meanwhile, Madame Defarge, armed with a dagger and pistol, goes to the Manette residence, hoping to apprehend Lucie and little Lucie and bring them in for execution. However, the family is already gone and Miss Pross stays behind to confront and delay Madame Defarge. As the two women struggle, Madame Defarge's pistol discharges, killing her and causing Miss Pross to go permanently deaf from noise and shock. The seamstress and Carton, an illustration for Book 3, Chapter 15 by John McLenan (1859) The novel concludes with the guillotining of Carton. As he is waiting to board the tumbril, he is approached by a seamstress, also condemned to death, who mistakes him for Darnay (with whom she had been imprisoned earlier) but realises the truth once she sees him at close range. Awed by his unselfish courage and sacrifice, she asks to stay close to him and he agrees. Upon their arrival at the guillotine, Carton comforts her, telling her that their ends will be quick but that there is no Time or Trouble \\"in the better land where ... [they] will be mercifully sheltered\\", and she is able to meet her death in peace. After Carton tearfully hears the execution of the seamstress, his final thoughts flash in his mind as he is pushed towards the slot where the blade would fall. Carton's unspoken last thoughts are prophetic:Dickens 2003, p. 390 (Book 3, Chapter 15) Characters In order of appearance: =Book the First (November 1775)= Chapter 2 Illustration from a serialised edition of the story, showing three tricoteuses knitting, with the Vengeance standing in the centre. * Jerry Cruncher: Porter and messenger for Tellson's Bank and secret \\"Resurrection Man\\" (body-snatcher); though rough and abusive towards his wife, he provides courageous service to the Manettes in Book the Third. His first name is short for Jeremiah; the latter name shares a meaning with the name of Jarvis Lorry. * Jarvis Lorry: A manager at Tellson's Bank: \\"...a gentleman of 60 ... Very orderly and methodical he looked ... He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it...\\" He is a dear friend of Dr. Manette and serves as a sort of trustee and guardian of the Manette family. The bank places him in charge of the Paris branch during the Revolution, putting him in position to provide life-saving service to the Manettes in Book the Third. The end of the book reveals that he lives to be 88. Chapter 4 * Lucie Manette: Daughter of Dr. Manette; an ideal pre-Victorian lady, perfect in every way. About 17 when the novel begins, she is described as short and slight with a \\"pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes...\\" Although Sydney Carton is in love with her, he declares himself an unsuitable candidate for her hand in marriage and instead she marries Charles Darnay, with whom she is very much in love, and bears him a daughter. However, Lucie genuinely cares about Carton's welfare and defends him when he is criticised by others. She is the \\"golden thread\\" after whom Book the Second is named, so called because she holds her father's and her family's lives together (and because of her blonde hair like her mother's). She also ties nearly every character in the book together.Dickens 2003, p. 83 (Book 2, Chapter 4) Chapter 5 * Monsieur Defarge: Given name Ernest, he is the owner of a Paris wine shop and leader of the Jacquerie. \\"A bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty ... He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.\\" He is devoted to Dr. Manette having been his servant as a youth. One of the key Revolutionary leaders, in which he is known as Jacques Four, he embraces the Revolution as a noble cause, unlike many other revolutionaries. Though he truly believes in the principles of the Revolution, Defarge is far more moderate than some of the other participants (notably his wife). * Madame Defarge: Given name Thérèse; a vengeful female Revolutionary, she is arguably the novel's antagonist and is presented as a more extreme and bloodthirsty personality than her husband Ernest. \\"There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman ... Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities.\\" The source of her implacable hatred of the Evrémonde family is revealed late in the novel to be the rape of her sister and killing of her brother when she was a child. * Jacques One, Two, and Three: Revolutionary compatriots of Ernest Defarge. Jacques Three is especially bloodthirsty and serves as a juryman on the Revolutionary Tribunals. Chapter 6 * Dr. Alexandre Manette: Lucie's father; when the book opens, he has just been released after a ghastly 18 years as a prisoner in the Bastille. Weak, afraid of sudden noises, barely able to carry on a conversation, he is taken in by his faithful former servant Defarge who then turns him over to Jarvis Lorry and the daughter he has never met. He achieves recovery and contentment with her, her eventual husband Charles Darnay, and their little daughter. All his happiness is put at risk in Book the Third when Madame Defarge resolves to send Evrémonde/Darnay to the guillotine, regardless of his having renounced the Evrémondes' wealth and cruelty. At the same time, the reader learns the cause of Dr. Manette's imprisonment: he had rendered medical care to Madame Defarge's brother and sister following the injuries inflicted on them by the Evrémonde twins back in 1757; the Evrémondes decided he couldn't be allowed to expose them. =Book the Second (Five years later)= Chapter 1 * Mrs Cruncher: Wife of Jerry Cruncher. She is a very religious woman, but her husband, somewhat paranoid, claims she is praying (what he calls \\"flopping\\") against him, and that is why he does not often succeed at work. Jerry often verbally and, almost as often, physically abuses her, but at the end of the story, he appears to feel somewhat guilty about this. * Young Jerry Cruncher: Son of Jerry and Mrs Cruncher. Young Jerry often follows his father around to his father's odd jobs, and at one point in the story, follows his father at night and discovers that his father is a Resurrection Man. Young Jerry looks up to his father as a role model and aspires to become a Resurrection Man himself when he grows up. Chapter 2 * Charles Darnay: A Frenchman of the noble Evrémonde family; \\"...a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.\\" When introduced, he is on trial for his life at the Old Bailey on charges of spying on behalf of the French crown. In disgust at the cruelty of his family to the French peasantry, he took on the name \\"Darnay\\" (after his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais) and left France for England.After Dr Manette's letter is read, Darnay says that \\"It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust, that first brought my fatal presence near you.\\" (Dickens 2003, p. 347 [Book 3, Chapter 11].) Darnay seems to be referring to the time when his mother brought him, still a child, to her meeting with Dr Manette in Book 3, Chapter 10. But some readers also feel that Darnay is explaining why he changed his name and travelled to England in the first place: to discharge his family's debt to Dr Manette without fully revealing his identity. (See note to the Penguin Classics edition: Dickens 2003, p. 486.) He and Lucie Manette fall deeply in love, they marry, and she gives birth to a daughter. He exhibits an admirable honesty in his decision to reveal to Dr Manette his true identity as a member of the infamous Evrémonde family. He puts his family's happiness at risk with his courageous decision to return to Paris to save the imprisoned Gabelle, who, unbeknownst to him, has been coerced into luring him there. Once in Paris, he is stunned to discover that, regardless of his rejection of his family's exploitative and abusive record, he is imprisoned incommunicado simply for being an aristocrat. Released after the testimony of Dr Manette, he is re-arrested and sentenced to be guillotined owing to Madame Defarge's undying hatred of all Evrémondes. This death sentence provides the pretext for the novel's climax. Chapter 3 * John Barsad (real name Solomon Pross): An informer in London and later employed by the Marquis St. Evrémonde. When introduced at Charles Darnay's trial, he is giving damning evidence against the defendant but it becomes clear to the reader that he is an oily, untrustworthy character. Moving to Paris he takes service as a police spy in the Saint Antoine district, under the French monarchy. Following the Revolution, he becomes an agent for Revolutionary France (at which point he must hide his British identity). Although a man of low character, his position as a spy allows him to arrange for Sydney Carton's final heroic act (after Carton blackmails him with revealing his duplicity). * Roger Cly: Barsad's collaborator in spying and giving questionable testimony. Following his chaotic funeral procession in Book the Second, Chapter 14, his coffin is dug up by Jerry Cruncher and his fellow Resurrection Men. In Book the Third, Jerry Cruncher reveals that in fact the casket contained only rocks and that Cly was clearly still alive and no doubt carrying on his spying activities. * Mr Stryver: An ambitious barrister, senior partner to Sydney Carton.Stryver, like Carton, is a barrister and not a solicitor; Dickens 2003, p. xi \\"... a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy...\\"; he wants to marry Lucie Manette because he believes that she is attractive enough. However, he is not truly in love with her and in fact treats her condescendingly. Jarvis Lorry suggests that marrying Lucie would be unwise and Stryver, after thinking it over, talks himself out of it, later marrying a rich widow instead. * Sydney Carton: A quick-minded and highly intelligent but depressed English barrister, referred to by Dickens as \\"The Jackal\\" because of his deference to Stryver. When introduced, he is a hard-drinking cynic, having watched Stryver advance while never taking advantage of his own considerable gifts: Dickens writes that the sun rose \\"upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible to the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.\\" In love with Lucie Manette, she cares about him but more as a concerned mother figure than a potential mate. He ultimately becomes a selfless hero, redeeming everything by sacrificing his life for a worthy cause. Chapter 6 * Miss Pross: Lucie Manette's governess since Lucie was 10 years old: \\"... one of those unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had...\\" She is fiercely loyal to Lucie and to England. She believes her long-lost brother Solomon, now the spy and perjurer John Barsad, is \\"the one man worthy of Ladybird,\\" ignoring the fact that he \\"was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore...\\" She is not afraid to physically fight those she believes are endangering the people she loves. She permanently loses her hearing when the fatal pistol shot goes off during her climactic fight with Madame Defarge. Chapter 7 * \\"Monseigneur\\": An unnamed generic aristocrat whose extraordinary decadence and self-absorption, described in detail, are used by Dickens to characterise the ancien régime in general. \\"The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur.\\" His fellow nobles also luxuriate in vast wealth, but this does not inoculate them from feeling envy and resentment: as the Marquis St. Evrémonde leaves Monseigneur's house \\"with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand\\", he turns to the latter's bedroom and quietly says, \\"I devote you ... to the Devil!\\" When the Revolution begins, Monseigneur puts on his cook's clothing and ignominiously flees, escaping with only his life. * Marquis St. Evrémonde:Also called \\"The Younger\\", having inherited the title at \\"the Elder\\"s death, the Marquis is sometimes referred to as \\"Monseigneur the Marquis St. Evrémonde\\". He is not so called in this article because the title \\"Monseigneur\\" applies to whoever among a group is of the highest status; thus, this title sometimes applies to the Marquis and other times does not. Uncle of Charles Darnay: \\"...a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.\\" Determined to preserve the traditional prerogatives of the nobility until the end of his life, he is the twin brother of Charles Darnay's late father; both men were exceptionally arrogant and cruel to peasants. Lamenting reforms which have imposed some restraints on the abusive powers of his class, the Marquis is out of favour at the royal court at the time of his assassination. Murdered in his bed by the peasant Gaspard. * Gaspard: A peasant whose child is run over and killed by the Marquis St. Evrémonde's carriage. He plunges a knife into Evrémonde's heart, pinning a note that reads, \\"Drive him fast to his tomb,\\" a reference to the careless speed that caused his little child's death. After being in hiding for a year, he is found, arrested, and executed. * The Mender of Roads: A peasant who later works as a woodsawyer; the Defarges bring him into a conspiracy against the aristocracy, where he is referred to as Jacques Five. Chapter 8 * Théophile Gabelle: Gabelle is \\"the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary, united\\"Dickens 2003, p. 120 (Book 2, Chapter 8) for the tenants of the Marquis St. Evrémonde. Gabelle is imprisoned by the revolutionaries, and his beseeching letter brings Darnay to France. Gabelle is \\"named after the hated salt tax\\".Dickens 2003, p. 462 =Book the Third (Autumn 1792)= Chapter 3 * The Vengeance: A companion of Madame Defarge referred to as her \\"shadow\\" and lieutenant, a member of the sisterhood of women revolutionaries in Saint Antoine, and Revolutionary zealot. (Many Frenchmen and women did change their names to show their enthusiasm for the Revolution.Dickens 2003, p. 470) Carton predicts that the Vengeance, Defarge, Cly, and Barsad will be consumed by the Revolution and end up on the guillotine. Chapter 13 * The Seamstress: \\"...a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes...\\" Having been caught up in The Terror, she strikes up a conversation with the man she assumes is Evrémonde in the large room where the next day's guillotine victims are gathered. When she realises that another man has taken Charles Darnay's place, she admires his sacrifice and asks if she can hold his hand during their tumbrel ride to the place of execution. Sources  While performing in The Frozen Deep, Dickens was given a play to read called The Dead Heart by Watts Phillips which had the historical setting, the basic storyline, and the climax that Dickens used in A Tale of Two Cities.Dickens by Peter Ackroyd; Harper Collins, 1990, p. 777 The play was produced while A Tale of Two Cities was being serialised in All the Year Round and led to talk of plagiarism.Dickens by Peter Ackroyd; Harper Collins, 1990, p. 859 Other sources are The French Revolution: A History by Thomas Carlyle (especially important for the novel's rhetoric and symbolism); Zanoni by Edward Bulwer-Lytton; The Castle Spector by Matthew Lewis; Travels in France by Arthur Young; and Tableau de Paris by Louis-Sébastien Mercier. Dickens also used material from an account of imprisonment during the Terror by Beaumarchais, and records of the trial of a French spy published in The Annual Register.Dickens by Peter Ackroyd; Harper Collins, 1990, p. 858-862 Publication history The 45-chapter novel was published in 31 weekly instalments in Dickens' new literary periodical titled All the Year Round. From April 1859 to November 1859, Dickens also republished the chapters as eight monthly sections in green covers. All but three of Dickens' previous novels had appeared as monthly instalments prior to publication as books. The first weekly instalment of A Tale of Two Cities ran in the first issue of All the Year Round on 30 April 1859. The last ran 30 weeks later, on 26 November. A Tale of Two Cities has been cited as one of the best-selling novels of all time by various sources including The Guardian and The Telegraph. It has been stated to have sold 200 million copies since its first publication, though this figure has been dismissed as \\"pure fiction\\" by Oxford University's Peter Thonemann, who claims it is the result of poor reference checking on Wikipedia. World Cat listed 1,529 editions of the work, including 1,305 print editions. Analysis A Tale of Two Cities is one of only two works of historical fiction by Charles Dickens (the other being Barnaby Rudge). Dickens uses literal translations of French idioms for characters who cannot speak English, such as \\"What the devil do you do in that galley there?!!\\" and \\"Where is my wife? ---Here you see me.\\" The Penguin Classics edition of the novel notes that \\"Not all readers have regarded the experiment as a success.\\" J. L. Borges quipped: \\"Dickens lived in London. In his book A Tale of Two Cities, based on the French Revolution, we see that he really could not write a tale of two cities. He was a resident of just one city: London.\\" =Themes= Resurrection In Dickens' England, resurrection always sat firmly in a Christian context. Most broadly, Sydney Carton is resurrected in spirit at the novel's close (even as he, paradoxically, gives up his physical life to save Darnay's). More concretely, \\"Book the First\\" deals with the rebirth of Dr. Manette from the living death of his incarceration. Resurrection appears for the first time when Mr. Lorry replies to the message carried by Jerry Cruncher with the words \\"Recalled to Life\\". Resurrection also appears during Mr. Lorry's coach ride to Dover, as he constantly ponders a hypothetical conversation with Dr. Manette: (\\"Buried how long?\\" \\"Almost eighteen years.\\" ... \\"You know that you are recalled to life?\\" \\"They tell me so.\\") He believes he is helping with Dr. Manette's revival and imagines himself \\"digging\\" up Dr. Manette from his grave. Resurrection is a major theme in the novel. In Jarvis Lorry's thoughts of Dr. Manette, resurrection is first spotted as a theme. It is also the last theme: Carton's sacrifice. Dickens originally wanted to call the entire novel Recalled to Life. (This instead became the title of the first of the novel's three \\"books\\".) Jerry is also part of the recurring theme: he himself is involved in death and resurrection in ways the reader does not yet know. The first piece of foreshadowing comes in his remark to himself: \\"You'd be in a blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!\\" The black humour of this statement becomes obvious only much later on. Five years later, one cloudy and very dark night (in June 1780Dickens 2003, p. xxxix), Mr. Lorry reawakens the reader's interest in the mystery by telling Jerry it is \\"Almost a night ... to bring the dead out of their graves\\". Jerry responds firmly that he has never seen the night do that.Dickens 2003, pp. 107–108 (Book 2, Chapter 6) It turns out that Jerry Cruncher's involvement with the theme of resurrection is that he is what the Victorians called a \\"Resurrection Man\\", one who (illegally) digs up dead bodies to sell to medical men (there was no legal way to procure cadavers for study at that time). The opposite of resurrection is of course death. Death and resurrection appear often in the novel. Dickens is angered that in France and England, courts hand out death sentences for insignificant crimes. In France, peasants had formerly been put to death without any trial, at the whim of a noble.Dickens 2003, p. 103 (Book 2, Chapter 9) The Marquis tells Darnay with pleasure that \\"[I]n the next room (my bedroom), one fellow ... was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter—his daughter!\\"The Marquis emphasizes his because Dickens is alluding to the (probably mythical) Droit du seigneur, under which any girl from the Marquis' land would belong to the Marquis rather than to her parents. Dickens 2003, p. 127 (Book 2, Chapter 9) The demolition of Dr. Manette's shoe-making workbench by Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry is described as \\"the burning of the body\\".Dickens 2003, p. 212 (Book 2, Chapter 19) It seems clear that this is a rare case where death or destruction (the opposite of resurrection) has a positive connotation since the \\"burning\\" helps liberate the doctor from the memory of his long imprisonment. But Dickens' description of this kind and healing act is strikingly odd: \\"The Accomplices\\", an illustration for Book 2, Chapter 19 by \\"Phiz\\" > So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry > and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the > removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a > horrible crime.Dickens 2003, p. 214 (Book 2, Chapter 19) Sydney Carton's martyrdom atones for all his past wrongdoings. He even finds God during the last few days of his life, repeating Christ's soothing words, \\"I am the resurrection and the life\\".John 11.25-6 Resurrection is the dominant theme of the last part of the novel. Darnay is rescued at the last moment and recalled to life; Carton chooses death and resurrection to a life better than that which he has ever known: \\"it was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there ... he looked sublime and prophetic\\". In the broadest sense, at the end of the novel, Dickens foresees a resurrected social order in France, rising from the ashes of the old one. ''' Water Hans Biedermann writes that water \\"is the fundamental symbol of all the energy of the unconscious—an energy that can be dangerous when it overflows its proper limits (a frequent dream sequence).\\"Biedermann 1994, p. 375 This symbolism suits Dickens' novel; in A Tale of Two Cities, the frequent images of water stand for the building anger of the peasant mob, an anger that Dickens sympathizes with to a point, but ultimately finds irrational and even animalistic. Early in the book, Dickens suggests this when he writes, \\"[T]he sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.\\"Dickens 2003, p. 21 (Book 1, Chapter 4) The sea here represents the coming mob of revolutionaries. After Gaspard murders the Marquis, he is \\"hanged there forty feet high—and is left hanging, poisoning the water.\\"Dickens 2003, p. 178 (Book 2, Chapter 15) The poisoning of the well represents the bitter impact of Gaspard's execution on the collective feeling of the peasants. After Gaspard's death, the storming of the Bastille is led (from the St. Antoine neighbourhood, at least) by the Defarges; \\"As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled around Defarge's wine shop, and every human drop in the cauldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex...\\"Dickens 2003, p. 223 (Book 2, Chapter 21) The crowd is envisioned as a sea. \\"With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into a detested word [the word Bastille], the living sea rose, wave upon wave, depth upon depth, and overflowed the city...\\" Darnay's jailer is described as \\"unwholesomely bloated in both face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water.\\" Later, during the Reign of Terror, the revolution had grown \\"so much more wicked and distracted ... that the rivers of the South were encumbered with bodies of the violently drowned by night...\\" Later a crowd is \\"swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets ... the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.\\" During the fight with Miss Pross, Madame Defarge clings to her with \\"more than the hold of a drowning woman\\". Commentators on the novel have noted the irony that Madame Defarge is killed by her own gun, and perhaps Dickens means by the above quote to suggest that such vicious vengefulness as Madame Defarge's will eventually destroy even its perpetrators. So many read the novel in a Freudian light, as exalting the (British) superego over the (French) id. Yet in Carton's last walk, he watches an eddy that \\"turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it onto the sea\\"—his fulfilment, while masochistic and superego-driven, is nonetheless an ecstatic union with the subconscious. Darkness and light As is frequent in European literature, good and evil are symbolized by light and darkness. Lucie Manette is the light, as represented literally by her name; and Madame Defarge is darkness. Darkness represents uncertainty, fear, and peril. It is dark when Mr. Lorry rides to Dover; it is dark in the prisons; dark shadows follow Madame Defarge; dark, gloomy doldrums disturb Dr. Manette; his capture and captivity are shrouded in darkness; the Marquis' estate is burned in the dark of night; Jerry Cruncher raids graves in the darkness; Charles' second arrest also occurs at night. Both Lucie and Mr. Lorry feel the dark threat that is Madame Defarge. \\"That dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me,\\" remarks Lucie. Although Mr. Lorry tries to comfort her, \\"the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself\\". Madame Defarge is \\"like a shadow over the white road\\", the snow symbolising purity and Madame Defarge's darkness corruption. Dickens also compares the dark colour of blood to the pure white snow: the blood takes on the shade of the crimes of its shedders. Social justice Charles Dickens was a champion of the poor in his life and in his writings. His childhood included some of the pains of poverty in England, as he had to work in a factory as a child to help his family. His father, John Dickens, continually lived beyond his means and eventually went to debtors' prison. Charles was forced to leave school and began working ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, earning six shillings a week. Dickens considered the workings of a mob, in this novel and in Barnaby Rudge, creating believable characters who act differently when the mob mentality takes over. The reasons for revolution by the lower classes are clear, and given in the novel. Some of his characters, notably Madame Defarge, have no limit to their vengeance for crimes against them. The Reign of Terror was a horrific time in France, and she gives some notion for how things went too far from the perspective of the citizens, as opposed to the actions of the de facto government in that year. Dickens does not spare his descriptions of mob actions, including the night Dr Manette and his family arrive at Tellson's bank in Paris to meet Mr Lorry, saying that the people in the vicious crowd display \\"eyes which any unbrutalized beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun\\". The reader is shown that the poor are brutalised in France and England alike. As crime proliferates, the executioner in England is ::stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now hanging housebreaker ... now burning people in the hand\\" or hanging a broke man for stealing sixpence. In France, a boy is sentenced to have his hands removed and be burned alive, only because he did not kneel down in the rain before a parade of monks passing some fifty yards away. At the lavish residence of Monseigneur, we find \\"brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives ... Military officers destitute of military knowledge ... [and] Doctors who made great fortunes ... for imaginary disorders\\".Dickens 2003, p. 110 (Book 2, Chapter 7) This incident is fictional, but is based on a true story related by Voltaire in a famous pamphlet, An Account of the Death of the Chevalier de la Barre.The Chevalier de la Barre was indeed executed for acts of impiety, including failure to pay homage to a procession of monks. These acts were attributed to him, it seems, by his mother's slighted lover. A synopsis of the story is given by Stanford University's Victorian Reading Project. See also Andrew Sanders, Companion to A Tale of Two Cities (London: Unwin Hyman, 1988), p.31; see also Voltaire, An Account of the Death of the Chevalier de la Barre (1766); translated by Simon Harvey, Treatise on Tolerance (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). So riled is Dickens at the brutality of English law that he depicts some of its punishments with sarcasm: \\"the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action\\". He faults the law for not seeking reform: \\"Whatever is, is right\\" is the dictum of the Old Bailey.Dickens 2003, p. 63 (Book 2, Chapter 2). Dickens is quoting Alexander Pope's Essay on Man of 1733. Dickens wants his readers to be careful that the same revolution that so damaged France will not happen in Britain, which (at least at the beginning of the book) is shown to be nearly as unjust as France; Ruth Glancy has argued that Dickens portrays France and England as nearly equivalent at the beginning of the novel, but that as the novel progresses, England comes to look better and better, climaxing in Miss Pross' pro-Britain speech at the end of the novel. But his warning is addressed not to the British lower classes, but to the aristocracy. He repeatedly uses the metaphor of sowing and reaping; if the aristocracy continues to plant the seeds of a revolution through behaving unjustly, they can be certain of harvesting that revolution in time. The lower classes do not have any agency in this metaphor: they simply react to the behaviour of the aristocracy. In this sense it can be said that while Dickens sympathizes with the poor, he identifies with the rich: they are the book's audience, its \\"us\\" and not its \\"them\\". \\"Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious licence and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind\\".Dickens 2003, p. 385 (Book 3, Chapter 15) With the people starving and begging the Marquis for food, his uncharitable response is to let the people eat grass; the people are left with nothing but onions to eat and are forced to starve while the nobles are living lavishly upon the people's backs. Every time the nobles refer to the life of the peasants it is only to destroy or humiliate the poor. = Autobiographical material = Some have argued that in A Tale of Two Cities Dickens reflects on his recently begun affair with eighteen-year-old actress Ellen Ternan, which was possibly platonic but certainly romantic. Lucie Manette has been noted as resembling Ternan physically.Dickens 2003, p. xxi After starring in a play by Wilkie Collins titled The Frozen Deep, Dickens was first inspired to write Tale. In the play, Dickens played the part of a man who sacrifices his own life so that his rival may have the woman they both love; the love triangle in the play became the basis for the relationships among Charles Darnay, Lucie Manette, and Sydney Carton in Tale. Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay may bear importantly on Dickens' personal life. The plot hinges on the near-perfect resemblance between Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay; the two look so alike that Carton twice saves Darnay through the inability of others to tell them apart. Carton is Darnay made bad. Carton suggests as much: > 'Do you particularly like the man [Darnay]?' he muttered, at his own image > [which he is regarding in a mirror]; 'why should you particularly like a man > who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, > confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for > talking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what > you might have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked > at by those blue eyes [belonging to Lucie Manette] as he was, and > commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in > plain words! You hate the fellow.'Dickens 2003, p. 89 (Book 2, Chapter 4) p. > 89 Many have felt that Carton and Darnay are doppelgängers, which Eric Rabkin defines as a pair \\"of characters that together, represent one psychological persona in the narrative\\".Rabkin 2007, course booklet p. 48 If so, they would prefigure such works as Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Darnay is worthy and respectable but dull (at least to most modern readers), Carton disreputable but magnetic. One can only suspect whose psychological persona it is that Carton and Darnay together embody (if they do), but it is often thought to be the psyche of Dickens. He might have been quite aware that between them, Carton and Darnay shared his own initials, a frequent property of his characters.Schlicke 2008, p. 53 However, he denied it when asked. Dickens dedicated the book to the Whig and Liberal prime minister Lord John Russell: \\"In remembrance of many public services and private kindnesses.\\" Setting The novel takes place primarily in London and Paris in the latter half of the eighteenth century. It spans a time period of roughly 36 years, with the (chronologically) first events taking place in December 1757 and the last in either late 1793 or early 1794. Research published in The Dickensian in 1963 suggests that the house at 1 Greek Street, now The House of St Barnabas, forms the basis for Dr Manette and Lucie's London house. > In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree > rustled its green leaves, church organs claimed to be made, and likewise > gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out > of the wall... as if he had beaten himself precious.A Tale of Two Cities, > Charles Dickens The \\"golden arm\\" (an arm-and-hammer symbol, an ancient sign of the gold- beater's craft) now resides at the Charles Dickens Museum, but a modern replica could be seen sticking out of the wall near the Pillars of Hercules pub at the western end of Manette Street (formerly Rose Street),Richard Jones.

Popular culture  At the 1984 Democratic National Convention in the U.S., the keynote speaker Mario Cuomo of New York delivered a scathing criticism of then-President Ronald Reagan's comparison of the United States to a \\"shining city on a hill\\" with an allusion to Dickens' novel, saying: \\"Mr. President, you ought to know that this nation is more a Tale of Two Cities than it is just a 'Shining City on a Hill'.\\" A Tale of Two Cities served as inspiration to the 2012 Batman film The Dark Knight Rises by Christopher Nolan. The character of Bane is in part inspired by Dickens' Madame Defarge: He organises kangaroo court trials against the ruling elite of the city of Gotham and is seen knitting in one of the trial scenes like Madame Defarge. There are other hints to Dickens' novel, such as Talia al Ghul being obsessed with revenge and having a close relationship to the hero, and Bane's catchphrase \\"the fire rises\\" as an ode to one of the book's chapters. Bane's associate Barsard is named after a supporting character in the novel. In the film’s final scene, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) reads aloud the closing lines of Sydney Carton’s inner monologue—\\"It's a far far better thing I do than I have ever done, it's a far far better rest I go to than I have ever known\\"—directly from the novel. In DC Entertainment's show Titans, Beast Boy, portrayed by Ryan Potter, reads part of the opening paragraph of Book 1, Chapter 1 — The Period, in season 2, episode 9 titled \\"Atonement\\".

It was fought between fleets of England, commanded jointly by Prince Rupert of the Rhine and George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, and the United Provinces commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. In the Netherlands, the battle is known as the Two Days' Battle. Background This attack follows on the heels of the Four Days' Battle of 1–4 June 1666 which is normally considered a Dutch victory. Battle =First day= In the early morning of 25 July, the Dutch fleet of 88 ships discovered the English fleet of 89 ships near North Foreland, sailing to the north. De Ruyter gave orders for a chase and the Dutch fleet pursued the English from the southeast in a leeward position, as the wind blew from the northwest. Suddenly, the wind turned to the northeast. The English commander, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, then turned sharply east to regain the weather gauge. De Ruyter followed, but the wind fell and the fleet fell behind. The Dutch van, commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Johan Evertsen, was becalmed and drifted away from the line of battle, splitting De Ruyter's fleet in two. This awkward situation lasted for hours; then, again, a soft breeze began to blow from the northeast. Immediately, the English van, commanded by Thomas Allin, and part of the centre formed a line of battle and engaged the Dutch van, still in disarray and basically defenceless. The outnumbered Dutch failed to form a coherent line of battle in response, and ship after ship was mauled by the combined firepower of the English line. Vice-Admiral Rudolf Coenders was killed, and Lieutenant-Admiral Tjerk Hiddes de Vries had an arm and a leg shot off. De Ruyter formed the Dutch centre and attempted to reach the van, but the wind was against him and he failed to reunite his forces. With the Dutch van defeated, the English converged to deliver the coup-de-grâce to De Ruyter's centre . George Monck, accompanying Rupert, predicted that De Ruyter would give two broadsides and run, but the latter put up a furious fight on the Dutch flagship De Zeven Provinciën. He withstood a combined attack by Sovereign of the Seas and Royal Charles and forced Rupert to leave the damaged Royal Charles for Royal James. The Dutch centre's resistance enabled the seaworthy remnants of the van to make an escape to the south. Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp, commanding the Dutch rear, now brought his vessels to De Ruyter's rescue. Tromp ordered his vessels to the west crossing the line of the English rear under the command of Jeremiah Smith. The English rear was now cut off from the centre, and Tromp's squadron began a dogged attack that forced Smith's ships to flee to the west. The pursuit of the English rear lasted well into the night, with Tromp ultimately destroying with a fireship. After Tromp thrice shot the entire crew from its rigging, Smith's flagship caught fire and had to be towed home. The vice commander of the English rear was Edward Spragge, who felt so humiliated by the course of events that he became a personal enemy of Tromp. He would later be killed pursuing Tromp in the Battle of Texel. =Second day= On the morning of 26 July, Tromp broke off pursuit, well-pleased with his first real victory as a squadron commander. During the night, a ship had brought him the message that De Ruyter had likewise been victorious, so Tromp was in a euphoric mood. That abruptly changed upon the discovery of the drifting flagship of the dying Tjerk Hiddes de Vries. Suddenly he feared that his ship was now the only remnant of the Dutch fleet and that he was in mortal peril. Behind him, those ships of the English rear still operational had again turned to the east. In front, the other enemy squadrons surely awaited him. On the horizon, only English flags were to be seen. Manoeuvring wildly, Tromp, drinking a lot of gin to restore his nerve, dodged any attempt to trap him and brought his squadron safely home in the port of Flushing on the morning of 26 July. There, to great mutual relief, he discovered the rest of the Dutch fleet. It took Tromp six hours to gather enough courage to face De Ruyter. It was obvious to him that he should never have allowed himself to get completely separated from the main force. Indeed De Ruyter, not being his usual charitable self, immediately blamed him for the defeat and ordered Tromp and his subcommanders Isaac Sweers and Willem van der Zaan from his sight, and told them to never again set foot on De Zeven Provinciën. The commander of the Dutch fleet still had not mentally recovered from the events of the previous day. St. James Day Fight August 4th, 1666, by Wenceslaus Hollar On the morning of 5 August, after a short summer's night, De Ruyter discovered that his position had become hopeless. Lieutenant-Admiral Johan Evertsen had died after losing a leg, De Ruyter's force was now reduced to about forty ships, crowding together and most of these were inoperational, being survivors of the van. Some fifteen good ships had apparently deserted during the night. A strong gale from the east prevented an easy retreat to the continental coast, and to the west the British van and centre (about fifty ships) surrounded him in a half-circle, safely bombarding him from a leeward position. De Ruyter was desperate. When his second-in-command of the centre, Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes visited him for a council of war, he exclaimed: \\"With seven or eight against the mass!\\" He then sagged, mumbling: \\"What's wrong with us? I wish I were dead.\\" His close personal friend Van Nes tried to cheer him up, joking: \\"Me too. But you never die when you want to!\\" No sooner had both men left the cabin than the table they had been sitting at was smashed by a cannonball. The English, however, had their own problems. The strong gale prevented them from closing with the Dutch. They tried to use fire ships, but these, too, had trouble reaching the enemy. Only the sloop Fan-Fan, Rupert's personal pleasure yacht, rowed to the Dutch flagship De Zeven Provinciën to harass it with its two little guns, much to the hilarious laughter of the English crews. When his ship had again warded off an attack by a fire ship (the Land of Promise) and Tromp still did not show up, for De Ruyter tension became unbearable. He sought death, exposing himself deliberately on the deck. When he failed to be hit, he exclaimed: \\"Oh, God, how unfortunate I am! Amongst so many thousands of cannonballs, is there not one that would take me?\\" His son-in-law, Captain of the Marines Johann de Witte, heard him and said: \\"Father, what desperate words! If you merely want to die, let us then turn, sail in the midst of our enemies and fight ourselves to death!\\". This brave but foolish proposal brought the Admiral back to his senses, for he discovered that he was not so desperate and answered: \\"You don't know what you are talking about! If I did that, all would be lost. But if I can bring myself and these ships safely home, we'll finish the job later.\\" Then the wind, that had brought so much misfortune to the Dutch, saved them by turning to the west. They formed a line of battle and brought their fleet to safety through the Flemish shoals, Vice-Admiral Adriaen Banckert of the Zealandic fleet covering the retreat of all damaged ships with the operational vessels, the number of the latter slowly growing as it turned out that only very few ships had actually deserted in the night; most had merely drifted away, and now, one after the other, they rejoined the battle. Aftermath The battle was a clear English victory. Dutch casualties were enormous, estimated immediately after the battle of about 5,000 men, compared with 300 English killed; later, more precise information showed that only about 1,200 of them had been killed or seriously wounded. However the twin disasters of the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London, combined with his financial mismanagement, left Charles II without the funds to continue the war. In fact, he had had only enough reserves for this one last battle. In fact, the Dutch had lost only two ships: De Ruyter had been successful at saving almost the complete van, only Sneek and Tholen struck their flag, and they could quickly repair the damage. The Dutch soon recovered; within a month, they again took sea, but only a minor skirmish resulted. During this later fight, De Ruyter inhaled a burning fuse filament that burnt a fistula in his throat; he would recover just in time to inflict a severe blow on the English navy in the Raid on the Medway in 1667, when, at last, he could carry out the plan he was prevented from executing in 1666. But during the weeks that the Dutch fleet was in repair, Admiral Robert Holmes, aided by the Dutch traitor Laurens van Heemskerck, penetrated the Vlie estuary, burnt a fleet of 150 merchants (Holmes's Bonfire) and sacked the town of Ter Schelling (the present West-Terschelling) on the Frisian island of Terschelling. Fan-Fan was again present. In the Republic, the defeat also had a far-reaching political effect. Tromp was the champion of the Orangist party; now that he was accused of severe negligence, the country split over this issue. To defend himself, Tromp let his brother-in-law, Johan Kievit, publish an account of his conduct. Shortly afterward, Kievit was discovered to have planned a coup, secretly negotiating a peace treaty with the English king. He fled to England and was condemned to death in absentia; Tromp's family was fined and he himself forbidden to serve in the fleet. In November 1669, a supporter of Tromp tried to stab De Ruyter in the entrance hall of his house. Only in 1672 would Tromp have his revenge, when Johan de Witt was murdered; some claim Tromp had had a hand in this. The new ruler, William III of Orange, succeeded, with great difficulty, in reconciling De Ruyter with Tromp in 1673.

It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was adapted into the 1925 silent film Pampered Youth. In 1942 it was again made into a movie, this time under its own title, with sound, and to a tightly clipped but effective script by Orson Welles, who also directed. Much later, in 2002, came a TV adaptation based on Welles' screenplay. Plot summary The story is set in a largely fictionalized version of Indianapolis, and much of it was inspired by the neighborhood of Woodruff Place. The novel and trilogy trace the growth of the United States through the declining fortunes of three generations of the aristocratic Amberson family in an upper-scale Indianapolis neighborhood, between the end of the Civil War and the early part of the 20th century, a period of rapid industrialization and socio-economic change in America. The decline of the Ambersons is contrasted with the rising fortunes of industrial tycoons and other new-money families, who derived power not from family names but by \\"doing things\\". As George Amberson's friend (name unspecified) says, \\"don't you think being things is 'rahthuh bettuh' than doing things?\\" The titular family is the most prosperous and powerful in town at the turn of the century. Young George Amberson Minafer, the patriarch's grandson, is spoiled terribly by his mother Isabel. Growing up arrogant, sure of his own worth and position, and totally oblivious to the lives of others, George falls in love with Lucy Morgan, a young though sensible debutante. But there is a long history between George's mother and Lucy's father, of which George is unaware. As the town grows into a city, industry thrives, the Ambersons' prestige and wealth wanes, and the Morgans, thanks to Lucy's prescient father, grow prosperous. When George sabotages his widowed mother's growing affections for Lucy's father, life as he knows it comes to an end. Reception The Magnificent Ambersons received the 1919 Pulitzer Prize. \\"The Magnificent Ambersons is perhaps Tarkington's best novel,\\" said Van Wyck Brooks. \\"[It is] a typical story of an American family and town—the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Ambersons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end.\\" Adaptations =Radio= The Campbell Playhouse presented Orson Welles's one-hour radio adaptation of The Magnificent Ambersons on October 29, 1939. The cast included Welles, Walter Huston, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, Bea Benaderet, Nan Sunderland, and other members of the Mercury Theatre company. =Film= The Magnificent Ambersons was adapted by Jay Pilcher for a Vitagraph Pictures feature film titled Pampered Youth (1925), directed by David Smith and starring Cullen Landis, Ben Alexander, Allan Forrest, Alice Calhoun, Emmett King, Wallace MacDonald, Charlotte Merriam, Katheryn Adams, Aggie Herring and William Irving. After Vitagraph was purchased by Warner Bros., the 70-minute film was reedited to 33 minutes and released with the title Two to One (1927). The original film is considered lost. Orson Welles adapted the story for his second feature film, The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), starring Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt, Agnes Moorehead and Ray Collins, with Welles providing the narration. Welles lost control of the editing of the film to RKO Pictures, and the final version released to audiences differed significantly from his rough cut of the film. More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer Bernard Herrmann insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio. Even in the released version, The Magnificent Ambersons is often regarded as among the best American films ever made. In 2002, the A&E; Network aired its original film The Magnificent Ambersons, directed by Alfonso Arau and starring Madeleine Stowe, Bruce Greenwood, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Gretchen Mol, Jennifer Tilly, Dina Merrill and James Cromwell.

SIGIR was an independent government agency created by the Congress to provide oversight of the use (or misuse) of the $52 billion U.S. reconstruction program in Iraq. Stuart W. Bowen, Jr. was appointed to the position of CPA-IG on January 20, 2004 and served until its closure in October 2013. SIGIR reported directly to Congress, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense. SIGIR's mission was to provide independent and objective oversight of U.S.-funded Iraq reconstruction policies, programs, and operations through comprehensive audits, inspections, and investigations. As of July 2009, SIGIR has issued 22 Quarterly Reports to Congress, 303 audits and inspections, 386 recommendations, and four Lessons Learned reports. SIGIR representatives have also testified before Congress on 27 separate occasions. Moreover, SIGIR's investigative and oversight work has resulted in 29 criminal indictments, more than $81 million in U.S. taxpayer funds saved or recovered, and $224 million being put to better use. In February 2009, SIGIR issued its fourth Lessons Learned report, Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience. Hard Lessons provides the first comprehensive account of the U.S. reconstruction effort in Iraq, chronicling the myriad challenges that confronted the rebuilding program, and concludes with 13 lessons drawn from the reconstruction experience. Influence on Law and Policy. SIGIR reports have led to several important changes in U.S. reconstruction policy. These changes to the law and to key agencies’ policies and procedures have increased management efficiencies and influenced the development of more effective approaches to overseas contingency operations. Some examples of how SIGIR's oversight work has affected U.S. policy include: (1) the reorganization of the Department of State's anticorruption programs in Iraq; (2) the imposition by Congress of stricter limitations on the amount of Commander's Emergency Response Program funds that can be used on any one project; (3) the establishment of improved processes for transferring U.S.-funded assets to the government of Iraq; (4) the issuance by the Office of Management and Budget of updated procurement guidance, including a number of management and operational best practices that should be considered in planning contingency operations and responding to national emergencies; and (5) the establishment by the Congress of two new special inspectors general modeled on SIGIR – SIGAR, to oversee U.S.-funded reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, and SIGTARP, to oversee the Department of Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). SIGIR has provided resources and expertise to both SIGAR and SIGTARP during their establishment and development. Recognition. SIGIR's work has been recognized in three awards from the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. SIGIR's findings and analyses have also contributed to key policy papers produced by Congressional Committees, think tanks, and policy review bodies, such as the Gansler Commission, the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Iraq Study Group. While an Army War College fellow at The Institute of World Politics, Brigadier General (Army) Brian Mennes criticized UC national security by pointing at the failures of the SIGIR in his paper \\"Security Reform beyond the Project on National Security Reform.\\"Security Reform beyond the Project on National Security Reform References External links ;Official websites *U.S. Public Law 108-106, November 6, 2003—legislation that created the position of Coalition Provisional Authority Inspector General *Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction website ;Other websites *Audit of Iraq Spending Spurs Criminal Probe, Washington Post, May 5, 2005 *So, Mr Bremer, where did all the money go?, The Guardian, July 7, 2005 *Millions go missing on Iraqi gravy train, Baltimore Sun, July 30, 2005 *The man charged with auditing the Iraq reconstruction finds he's fighting his own kind of war, Esquire, November 30, 2006 *Report cites reconstruction progress, but also problems, USA Today, October 30, 2007 *In Ramadi, Real Rebuilding, With Fresh Paint, New York Times, November 22, 2008 *Iraq Auditor Warns of Waste, Fraud In Afghanistan, Washington Post, February 2, 2009 *Over $8B of the Money You Spent Rebuilding Iraq Was Wasted Outright Wired , March 6, 2012 *Security Reform beyond the Project on National Security Reform, \\"The Institute of World Politics\\", April, 2013 Category:Coalition Provisional Authority Category:United States Inspectors General Category:Government agencies established in 2004 Category:Independent agencies of the United States government ","title":"Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction"},{"id":"3433057","text":"KRWG may refer to: * KRWG-TV, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television station (channel 22 analog/23 digital) licensed to Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States * KRWG (FM), a radio station (90.7 FM) licensed to Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States ","title":"KRWG"},{"id":"3433079","text":"Patricia Gretchen Mann Brewin (known as Gretchen) was born in Ottawa, Ontario to mother Marjorie Mann and Walter Mann on December 23, 1938.

Characteristic The original idea of this multisports endurance event was two-fold: The first was to prepare Navy SEALs to do the Ironman Triathlon. The second was to promote the sport of triathlon in the SEAL Teams where physical training was multi- faceted and competitive spirit is high. The event is open to both military and civilians alike. It also invites tri-athletes with disabilities to participate in the triathlon as individuals or in relay teams. All editions have been carefully monitored and supported by UDT-SEAL Association members and volunteers and officers and men of the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training department from the Navy Special Warfare Command. The Superfrog is a traditional swim-bike-run event that covers a course consisting of a two-lap 1.2 miles open ocean swim, a four-lap 56 mile bike course and a five-lap 13.1 mile run. This type of circuit-style racing allows for a central control point where start and finish lines, bike/run transition area, racer aid stations, and spectators view are greatly enhanced. This circuit-style race is presented by Naval Special Warfare and sponsored by MWR, North Island. The open-ocean swim starts at 7am behind the BUD/S, NSW Center area and finishes behind SEAL Teams Five and Seven. Wheel-chair racers enter the ocean first, followed by individual racers and three-person relay teams. Previous editions were held in the month of September. The September high surf is usually accompanied by unusually cold water. Upon completion of the swim, the bicycle riders head south from the Amphibious Base along Highway 75. It is flat but can be a little windy in some sections. Competitors in the event have been subjected to 100-degree heat on the highway. In 2011, the half-Ironman triathlon is back to September, being run on the 10 year anniversary of 9/11 - 11 September 2011. In previous editions several professional triathletes competed in this event, including Bettina Ernst (1996), Paula Newby-Fraser (2002), Heather Fuhr (2006), and Lance Armstrong (2012). In January 2015, World Triathlon Corporation announced the acquisition of SuperFrog, Inc., owners of the SuperFrog, Super Seal and Seal Sprint triathlons.

Early life and education Lowder graduated from Whitman-Hanson Regional High School in 1981 and was inducted into the high school's hall of fame in 1991. In 1985 he graduated from Marquette University with an honors BA in English and History, and he graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1999, with a Masters in Literary Studies. Career =As a novelist= His earliest novels were part of the Forgotten Realms and Ravenloft shared universe book lines, but beginning in the late 1990s he turned his attention more often to creator-owned projects. His novels include Prince of Lies, The Ring of Winter, and Spectre of the Black Rose (the latter with Voronica Whitney-Robinson), and his short fiction has appeared in such anthologies such as Shadows Over Baker Street, Truth Until Paradox, and Historical Hauntings. Some of his short stories have been cited in the honorable mention list of the annual Year's Best Fantasy and Horror. He was an Origins Award finalist in the Best Short Fiction category for his 2003 novella, \\"The Night Chicago Died\\", a story that featured the debut of his mystery man character, The Corpse. His novels have been translated into more than a dozen languages. =As an editor= As an editor, Lowder directed several best-selling book lines for TSR, Inc. in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft, and Dark Sun. In 1999, Peter Corless brought Lowder in to oversee the Pendragon fiction line for Green Knight Publishing; Lowder continued to reprint older Athurian works and also produced the original short story collections The Doom of Camelot (2000) and Legends of the Pendragon (2002) and the original novel Exiled from Camelot (2001). He served as executive editor for Green Knight Publishing's line of Arthurian fiction — the Pendragon fiction series — and as a consulting editor for CDS Books on their City of Heroes novels. Lowder has edited more than a dozen anthologies, with subjects ranging from King Arthur to superheroes to zombies. He has won several Origins Awards and an ENnie Award, and been shortlisted for an International Horror Guild Award for these projects. Though some of these anthologies have been published in connection with role-playing game product lines, they often contain only creator-copyrighted stories. This makes them unusual, as game publishers frequently insist on work for hire contracts for such projects. Lowder edited a set of zombie anthologies based on the All Flesh Must Be Eaten game, beginning with The Book of All Flesh (2001); these were the first fiction books from Eden Studios. His final short story collection for the series was The Book of Final Flesh (2003). Lowder edited a 2003 anthology of short stories based on the Silver Age Sentinels game from Guardians of Order. He also worked on Astounding Hero Tales (2007) for Hero Games and Worlds of their Own (2008) for Paizo Publishing. Lowder produced Hobby Games: The 100 Best (2007) and Family Games: The 100 Best (2010) for Green Ronin Publishing. In May, 2017, Chaosium appointed Lowder executive editor of their fiction line. Chaosium President Rick Meints commented on the hire: “James embodies that magic combination of wisdom and enthusiasm. Knowing his craft inside and out, he brings his advocacy and integrity to the table at every turn. Having him relaunch our fiction line is a ‘the stars are right’ moment.” Lowder had previously served as a consultant for Chaosium, helping the company and freelancers resolve payment and contract problems with past fiction projects. =Comic books and other works= Lowder also works in comic books. He has penned scripts for several companies, including Image, DC, Devil's Due, and Desperado. A Ravenloft comic by Lowder was in the works before DC decided to end its relationship with TSR. His short work \\"Lost Loves\\", from the Moonstone Monsters: Demons anthology, was a finalist for the Bram Stoker Award in 2004 for Best Illustrated Narrative. He contributed as a writer and consulting editor to the Worlds of Dungeons & Dragons comic book series, published by Devil's Due. He became the editor for the monthly series Hack/Slash with issue #25 and continued with the series when it moved from Devil's Due to Image. His pulp hero serial \\"The Corpse: Orphans of the Air\\" ran as an occasional back-up in Hack/Slash, starting in 2011. Lowder's critical essays and film and book reviews have appeared in such publications as Amazing Stories and Polyhedron, the latter of which featured his long-running video review column \\"Into the Dark\\" from 1991 to 1994. He has written support material for various role-playing games, including Dungeons & Dragons and Call of Cthulhu. In the media Beginning in 2010, Lowder contributed to an annual \\"Games to Gift\\" holiday segment for the show \\"Lake Effect\\" on WUWM, Milwaukee Public Radio. He appeared as himself in episode 302 (\\"Man Beasts\\") on the television series Weird or What?, discussing the history of werewolf lore and the Beast of Bray Road. Lowder also served as a puppeteer for the low budget zombie puppet musical Misfit Heights (2012).

Upgrades over the standard BMW 4-Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car. __TOC__ F82/F83 generation (2014–2020) On 25 September 2013, BMW released the technical specifications of the M4. It is powered by the S55B30 engine, which is developed and engineered by BMW M GmbH. This 3.0-litre inline-6 engine has been built specifically for the new M4/M3, having a redline of 7,600 rpm with the rev limiter actuated at 7,300 rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers with a peak boost pressure of . The power is rated at , however this is achieved not at a specific engine speed, but is instead rated throughout the range of 5,500–7,300 rpm. The engine's torque is rated at throughout the range of 1,850–5,500. Two transmission choices are available, the 6-speed manual and the 7-speed M-DCT transmissions. The 7-speed M-DCT transmission accelerates the car from 0 to in 4.1 seconds) and the 6-speed manual transmission from 0 to in 4.3 seconds. The weight of the European specification M4 equipped with a manual transmission is and with the M-DCT dual-clutch transmission, the car is some heavier, losing some as compared to the E92 M3. As per its E92 predecessor, the roof of the coupe model is constructed from carbon fibre (except if the optional sunroof is fitted). Carbon fibre is also used for the bootlid and engine brace. For the first time in a M3/M4 model, an electric power steering unit is used. The steering system is specifically tuned for both the M3 and M4, however it has been criticised for lacking in feel. The and wheel options are available with lightweight forged alloy wheels being standard. The M compound brakes come standard (with blue brake calipers), while carbon ceramic brakes (with gold brake calipers) are available as an option. The M4 features Active Sound, live amplification of the engine's natural sound inducted into the passenger cabin via speakers in the car. BMW claims this technology has been used so that the well insulated cabin can reduce road/wind noise but still provide the driver with the sporty sound of the M powered engine. There are no artificial sound or any pre-recorded track in the system. This system was first implemented in the M5 (F10). The M4 is based on the F32 4 Series however 50 percent of its components are unique as compared to the 4 Series. The convertible variant of the M4 was announced along with its coupe sibling, also internally known as F82 or F83 M4. It shares almost everything with the coupé version, but weighs more due to its folding metal roof. The convertible weighs (manual), (M-DCT). The three-piece retractable hardtop folds in 20 seconds. The only significant difference between the two is the weight due to its retractable hardtop. As with any convertible car, the driver will experience its stiff ride due to added rigidity. Like its hardtop counterpart, the F83 M4 uses carbon fibre reinforced plastic to lighten and stiffen the car. Because of its extra weight it accelerates slower, taking it 0.3 seconds longer to ; 4.6 seconds with the manual and 4.3 seconds with the M-DCT transmission. The dynamic differences between the two variants are marginally small. Starting from the 2019 model year (production from 07/2018 onward) BMW removed the carbon fibre driveshaft so as to be able to fit an Otto Particulate Filter (OPF), necessary to comply with WLTP emissions regulations. =BMW M4 Competition= During February 2016, BMW announced the M4 Competition. The M4 Competition boasts and a revised suspension for better handling. New springs, dampers and anti-roll bars complement the included Adaptive M Suspension. BMW also re-tuned the electronic differential and the Dynamic Stability Control to match the upgraded hardware. The interior remains largely unchanged, but Competition Package cars get new lightweight sport seats along with the M-striped woven seat belts. The exterior includes the M Sport exhaust with black chrome tailpipes and high gloss Shadow Line exterior trim. Gloss black trim is added to the kidney grille, side gills, and model badge on the trunk. With the competition package, the coupe version accelerates from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0 seconds. There is a convertible version, and that does the run in 4.2 seconds, both coupe and convertible forms using the dual clutch transmission. =M4 GTS= BMW introduced the M4 GTS concept in August 2015 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In 2016, BMW introduced the production version of the car which was a track-focused version of the standard M4 coupé itself with a limited production run of 700 units. It is powered by the same twin-turbocharged straight-six engine as in the normal M4, but the power output has been raised to at 6,250 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm largely due to a nozzle water injection system that is the first to be used on a production automobile in almost twenty years. In addition to the increased engine power, the M4 GTS is lighter than the standard M4 Coupé with the DCT transmission, so the weight now stands at . The 0 to acceleration time is reduced to 3.8 seconds, while the top speed stands at . The M4 GTS has, according to BMW, lapped the infamous Nürburgring Nordschleife track in 7 minutes and 28 seconds, 24 seconds faster than the base M4 and 20 seconds faster than the M3 GTS. This equates to the same time as a Porsche Carrera GT. =M4 DTM Champion Edition= M4 DTM Champion Edition The BMW M4 DTM Champion Edition was first launched in 2014, following the victory of Marco Wittmann in the 2014 DTM season, in commemoration of the winning BMW M4 DTM racecar. The model is based on Wittmann's 2014 M4 DTM in color. The 2014 DTM Champion Edition is limited to 23 units, Wittmann's race number. After winning the 2016 season, BMW once again released a DTM Champion Edition of the M4. The M4 DTM Champion Edition uses the engine from the M4 GTS with and water injection. All performance data are identical to those of the GTS. It is limited to 200 units and is only available in white in keeping with the DTM car. The biggest visual difference to the GTS lies in the smaller spoiler, as well as the omission of the orange design elements. =M4 CS= In early 2017, BMW announced M4 CS in limited run of 3,000 units globally. The M4 CS sits between the M4 Competition Package and the M4 GTS. The M4 CS utilises the same engine as the standard M4 which generates and of torque.  G82 generation (2021-)  The second iteration of the BMW M4, codenamed G82, is a largely based on the standard 4 Series (F22 generation), which is in turn based largely on the BMW Concept 4. It is a high performance version of the standard F22 4 Series. Prototypes of the BMW M4 have been seen tested on the Nurburgring beside the G80 BMW M3. The first units will be assembled in November 2020, with global deliveries starting in early 2021. Motorsport = BMW M4 DTM = The BMW M4 DTM competes in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters since 2014. Marco Wittmann won the 2014 and 2016 championships. = BMW M4 GT4 = The BMW M4 GT4, aimed at amateur drivers, debuted at the 2017 24 Hours of Nürburgring. It features a 3.0 L turbocharged straight-six engine rated at , and a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. GT4 racer is the hardest BMW M4 yet - Stephen Dobie, Top Gear, 25 May 2017 = BMW M4 GT3 = The BMW M4 GT3 is a racecar version of the G82 BMW M4. It is a direct successor to the BMW M6 GT3, racing from the 2022 season and onwards. The M4 GT3 will use a race-prepped variant of the inline- six from the road car. BMW M Motorsport stretches out the front to add much wider fenders, and more angular styling for the hood accentuated the inward slanted brows above the headlights. The exhaust exits just ahead of the passenger side front wheel, on the right side of the car. At the back, there are inlets on the sides of the wider fenders. A gooseneck-mounted spoiler and big diffuser manage the airflow. Deliveries will take part in late 2021.

The ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to arrange the sequence of deposition and the time of deposition of all rocks within a geological region, and eventually, the entire geologic record of the Earth. The standard stratigraphic nomenclature is a chronostratigraphic system based on palaeontological intervals of time defined by recognised fossil assemblages (biostratigraphy). The aim of chronostratigraphy is to give a meaningful age date to these fossil assemblage intervals and interfaces.  Methodology  Chronostratigraphy relies heavily upon isotope geology and geochronology to derive hard dating of known and well defined rock units which contain the specific fossil assemblages defined by the stratigraphic system. In practice, as it is very difficult to isotopically date most fossils and sedimentary rocks directly, inferences must be made in order to arrive at an age date which reflects the beginning of the interval. The methodology used is derived from the law of superposition and the principles of cross-cutting relationships. Because igneous rocks occur at specific intervals in time and are essentially instantaneous on a geologic time scale, and because they contain mineral assemblages which may be dated more accurately and precisely by isotopic methods, the construction of a chronostratigraphic column relies heavily upon intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. Metamorphism, often associated with faulting, may also be used to bracket depositional intervals in a chronostratigraphic column. Metamorphic rocks can occasionally be dated, and this may give some limits to the age at which a bed could have been laid down. For example, if a bed containing graptolites overlies crystalline basement at some point, dating the crystalline basement will give a maximum age of that fossil assemblage. This process requires a considerable degree of effort and checking of field relationships and age dates. For instance, there may be many millions of years between a bed being laid down and an intrusive rock cutting it; the estimate of age must necessarily be between the oldest cross-cutting intrusive rock in the fossil assemblage and the youngest rock upon which the fossil assemblage rests.  Units  Chronostratigraphic units, with examples: *eonothem – Phanerozoic *erathem – Paleozoic *system – Ordovician *series – Upper Ordovician *stage – Ashgill  Differences from geochronology  It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units. Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is correct to say that fossils of the species Tyrannosaurus rex have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series. Geochronological units are periods of time and take the same name as standard stratigraphic units but replacing the terms upper/lower with late/early. Thus it is also correct to say that Tyrannosaurus rex lived during the Late Cretaceous Epoch.International Commission on Stratigraphy. \\"Chronostratigraphic Units.\\" International Stratigraphic Guide. Accessed 14-DEC-2009. Chronostratigraphy is an important branch of stratigraphy because the age correlations derived are crucial to drawing accurate cross sections of the spatial organization of rocks and to preparing accurate paleogeographic reconstructions.

The story follows a murder on an Amish farm. Plot summary The novel recounts the story of how a dead infant found on an Amish farm rocks the entire community. As the police investigate the death, they discover that the baby was not stillborn, but instead had died shortly after birth. Police were able to find cloth fibers in the infant's mouth and throat, including bruises on the mouth, which leads them to conclude that he was suffocated. An 18-year- old, unmarried Amish girl, Katie Fisher, is charged with the murder of her newborn son. However, Katie denies ever being pregnant. Ellie Hathaway, an experienced defense attorney and a distant relative of Katie, reluctantly accepts the case after a confrontation with her aunt (the relative who connects Ellie with Katie by marriage). As part of the bail conditions of the pre-trial hearing, Ellie has to remain on the farm with Katie prior to the trial—a period that lasts several months. A doctor is able to determine that the infant was born prematurely, and could have died from natural causes due to listeriosis, a bacterial infection which Katie contracted from drinking unpasteurized milk from their Amish dairy farm. During that time, Ellie begins a relationship with her former lover Coop, a legal psychologist whom she trusts with Katie's interviews, and whom she had previously left years before. Coincidentally, on the first day of Katie's trial, Ellie finds out she is pregnant with Coop's baby. Coop then asks Ellie to marry him, but she defers. After the jury deliberates for several days, Katie instead chooses to settle for a plea agreement, and is sentenced to one year of electronic monitoring, which allows her to stay at the farm while wearing an electronic bracelet. Katie's mother, Sarah Fisher, gives Ellie the scissors that were used to cut the umbilical cord, revealing that she knew Katie was pregnant and had gone to her the night she gave birth, though Katie didn't know. Ellie has an ethical obligation as an attorney to provide this evidence to the police, but instead, she opts not to because of Sarah's plea to her - mother to mother. The novel ends with Coop picking up Ellie from the Fisher dairy farm to begin their life together. Characters  *Katie Fisher: Protagonist; an unmarried 18-year-old Amish girl. After giving birth to a baby that was later found dead, she is accused and arrested for murder. *Ellie Hathaway: A 39-year-old lawyer. Ellie is distantly related to Katie through their aunt. *Coop: Ellie's ex-boyfriend, a psychiatrist, and the father of Ellie's unborn child. *Jacob Fisher: Katie's older brother, he was excommunicated from the church for continuing schooling and giving up his Amish ways. *Aaron Fisher: Katie's father, and owner of the dairy farm, he is extremely rigid and fundamentalist in his views on religion. *Sarah Fisher: Katie's mother, she truly loves her children, and would do anything for them, though she follows her husband's strict belief system in an effort to not upset the church. *Adam Sinclair: A friend of Jacob's in college, it's revealed that he is the father of Katie's baby. *Samuel Stoltzfus: An Amish boy who works for Katie's father, Aaron Fisher, he is also Katie's boyfriend, and seems to love her. *Leda: Katie's aunt and Sarah Fisher's sister who was once excommunicated, but now serves as the Fishers' confidant (excluding Aaron Fisher). Reception Publishers Weekly had a mixed review of the novel, saying, \\"told from both third-person omniscient and first-person (Ellie's) vantages, the story rolls leisurely through the trial preparations, the results of which are repeated, tediously, in the courtroom. Perhaps the story's quietude is appropriate, given its magnificently painted backdrop and distinctive characters, but one can't help wishing that the spark igniting the book's opening pages had built into a full-fledged blaze.\\" However, Kristina Lanier wrote a more positive review for the Christian Science Monitor, saying, \\"Picoult sets a big task for herself in 'Plain Truth', but she pulls it off - avoiding sentimentality and even maintaining the cultural tension and thriller-like guessing game into the book's final scenes. Picoult's strength, though, lies in sculpting solid characters and a thoughtful, well-researched, and well-paced yarn.\\" Plain Truth was Book of the Week in the May 8, 2000 issue of People Magazine. The review of the book, written by Jill Smolowe stated, \\"despite the occasional cliche and a coda that feels artificially tacked on, Picoult's seventh novel never loses its grip. The research is convincing, the plotting taut, the scenes wonderfully vivid. Most impressive, the author gets beneath the uniformities of dress, custom and conduct to paint a unique community--closed to most Americans--in all its social and psychological complexity.\\" Film, TV and Theatrical adaptations In 2004, Lifetime debuted the Plain Truth, the television adaption of the novel, starring Mariska Hargitay as the attorney Ellie Hathaway (whose name was changed to Ellie Harrison in the film), and Alison Pill as the accused and disowned Amish girl, Katie Fisher (whose name was changed to Katie Fitch in the film).

Biography Keep was born in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, on December 23, 1800. Adept with his hands, he became interested in dentistry following an apprenticeship with a local jeweler. In 1821, he moved to Boston and graduated from Harvard Medical School with an M.D. in 1827. He practiced dentistry for 40 years, was hailed for his proficiency, and in 1843 was awarded an honorary D.D.S. by the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. Keep invented and manufactured many dental tools and is credited with being one of the first to manufacture porcelain teeth. Also, a practicing physician, Keep was the first to use anesthesia for childbirth, administering ether to Fanny Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's wife, on the occasion of her daughter's birth on April 7, 1847.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004. . p. 189 He was a critical participant in the Parkman murder trial, the first time that dental work was introduced as forensic evidence. Keep's testimony capped off a sensational trial in March 1850. Ultimately, John White Webster, a professor of chemistry at the Medical School, was convicted and hanged for the murder of George Parkman, prominent physician and member of the Boston Brahmin elite. Keep's lifelong interest was in elevating dentistry's status as a liberal profession. In his presidential address to the Massachusetts Dental Society in 1865, he remarked: :My own predilections would favor a thorough and united dental and medical education. I should hope in such a case that the degree of M.D. would be the lawful and merited appendage to the names of those young men who enter our speciality. If this, however, is not yet attainable, it may not be entirely out of place to inquire whether Harvard University might not appoint professors of dentistry, and confer upon proper candidates the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery. Two years later, in 1867, the first announcement of the Dental School of Harvard University was published, listing Keep as dean of a distinguished faculty. Keep's dream had come true; Harvard was to have the world's first university-based dental school. Keep's administrative decisions exemplify his fair and moral character. One of these decisions is documented in Richard L. Hapgood's history of Harvard's dental school: :A colored dentist who had applied unsuccessfully to several dental schools for instruction, came to Boston, called upon Dean Nathan Cooley Keep, MD, DDS, and asked to be received. Upon Keep's recommendation the School Faculty decided that Harvard University should consider right and justice above expediency and should know no distinction of nativity or color in admitting students. Hapgood RL. History of the Harvard Dental School. Boston: Harvard University Dental School. Copyright 1930 by President and Fellows of Harvard College.

The venue opened during the summer of 1986 with a capacity of 12,000. It was expanded after 2000 to 19,900; 7,000 reserved seats, 7,000 lawn seats and 5,900 general admission seats. The season for the venue is typically from mid May until late September. In 2010, it was named Top Grossing Amphitheater by Billboard. History The venue was proposed by Don Law, John E. Drew and Sherman Wolf in 1985. Originally, the suggested site was in Brookline, Massachusetts. At that time, the venue was planned to be a performing arts center, consisting of concert hall, auditorium and black box theater. After conducting research, Law concluded the New England region was in desperate need of an outdoors venue (at the time, the main outdoor venues were Tanglewood, Cape Cod Melody Tent, and the South Shore Music Circus). The performing arts center was converted into an amphitheatre. The site was moved to Mansfield to create a regional venue, being within of Providence, Boston, Worcester and Cape Cod. The venue opened June 13, 1986 as the Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts; with a performance by Yo-Yo Ma and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. It was one of the busiest venues in New England, hosting nearly 80 concerts per season. Over the years, additional amphitheaters were added to the region. The Xfinity Theatre in Hartford and the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion in Boston brought competition to the area, bringing the venue to an average of 36 events per season. In 1998, the owner of venue, Don Law Company, was sold to SFX Entertainment and naming rights were sold to Tweeter Home Entertainment a year later, with the venue now becoming the \\"Tweeter Center for the Performing Arts\\". When the electronics retailer faced bankruptcy in 2007, multi-media organization Comcast bought naming rights, with the venue becoming the Comcast Center in 2008. The company renamed the venue \\"Xfinity Center\\" in 2014, to correspond with its current product branding.

Sognnæs grew up in Bergen and took his final exams at Tanks gymnas in 1931. He took the first part of dental education in Leipzig, and concluded with an examination at the Norwegian Dental School (Norges Tannlegehøyskole) in 1936. He participated in a Norwegian scientific expedition to Tristan da Cunha during 1937-38. Sognnaes came to America in 1938 as an intern at the Forsyth Dental Infirmary for Children in Boston. He continued on as a Carnegie Dental Fellow at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in New York, where he earned a master of science degree in physiology and a Ph.D. in pathology in 1941. Milestones (Oct. 8, 1984. Time Magazine) Following World War II, in which he served in the Royal Norwegian Air Force, Sognnaes accepted a teaching position at Harvard University. There he occupied an endowed chair as the Charles A. Brackett professor of oral pathology and eventually served Director of Postdoctoral Studies at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine between 1956 and 1960, when he came to UCLA. Sognnaes guided the founding of the UCLA School of Dentistry, which was established in 1960. Sognnæs also put his name on scientific publications, primarily on research on tooth enamel and fluoride. Later he published several articles on education and research. He stepped down as dean in 1968, but continued as professor.Crowning (UCLA Today. Jan 26, 1998) Sognnaes will perhaps be best remembered for his work as a gifted forensic scientist. He is credited with identifying the remains of Adolf Hitler and Martin Bormann, through examination of American and Soviet documents.

Between 1942 and 1944, he was chief of the German Army Personnel Office. Schmundt was injured during the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler and died a few months later from his wounds. Biography Schmundt was born in Metz and served as a lieutenant for the German Army during World War I. In World War II he attained the rank of General of the Infantry on 1 September 1944, and became the Chief of the Personnel Department of the German Army. Throughout the war, Schmundt was one of Adolf Hitler's many adjutants, and flew with Erwin Rommel in early 1941, just before the Afrika Korps was created. Approximate positions of participants at the conference meeting, Schmundt (7) was standing directly in front of the bomb. Schmundt was one of the casualties of the failed 20 July plot, planned to kill the German dictator Adolf Hitler. One of the conspirators, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, placed a bomb in a briefcase beside Hitler. Colonel Heinz Brandt moved it behind a heavy table leg and unwittingly saved Hitler's life, but as a consequence, he lost his own. Severely injured in the assassination attempt, Schmundt initially made a promising recovery, but ultimately died of complications resulting from his injuries on 1 October 1944 at the Carlshof hospital. After Schmundt's death, all current Generals and Field Marshals were summoned by Hitler to attend a funeral service at the Tannenberg Memorial, in east Prussia. As reported by Hauptmann Alexander Stahlberg (aide to Field Marshal Von Manstein) in his book Bounden Duty, the group were entrained back to Berlin and Schmundt was buried, on Hitler's orders, in Invalids' Cemetery. Hitler did not attend either ceremony. Schmundt was posthumously awarded the German Order on 7 October 1944. He was replaced as the Chief of the Personnel Department by General Wilhelm Burgdorf, the Deputy Chief.

He is best known as the director of American History X (1998).  Life and career  Kaye was born to an Haredi Jewish family in Stamford Hill, London, United Kingdom. He has made several well-known music videos, including the video for \\"Runaway Train\\" by Soul Asylum, which won a Grammy Award, \\"Dani California\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, \\"What God Wants\\" by Roger Waters, and \\"Help Me\\" and \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" by Johnny Cash. Kaye is a six time Grammy nominated music video director. His feature film debut was American History X (1998), a drama about racism starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Kaye disowned the final cut of the film and unsuccessfully attempted to have his name removed from the credits. The film was critically lauded and Norton was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film. The battle over artistic control of the film, which has become part of Hollywood folklore, all but destroyed Kaye's career. He delivered his original cut on time and within budget – but when the producer, New Line Cinema, insisted on changes, the arguments began. The debate quickly escalated. Kaye spent $100,000 of his own money to take out 35 full-page ads in the Hollywood trade press denouncing Norton and the producer, using quotations from a variety of people from John Lennon to Abraham Lincoln. He attended a meeting at New Line to which (to ease negotiations) he brought a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Tibetan monk. When the company offered him an additional eight weeks to re-cut the film, he said he'd discovered a new vision and needed a year to remake it, and flew to the Caribbean to have the script rewritten by the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott. Finally, when the Directors Guild refused to let him remove his name from the New Line version of the film, he demanded it to be credited to 'Humpty Dumpty' instead, and filed a $200 million lawsuit when the company refused. Kaye's second feature, a documentary called Lake of Fire, was about the abortion debate in the United States. It opened in Toronto in September 2006. The movie was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature (though it did not win a nomination), and was nominated for Best Documentary Film at the Independent Spirit Awards, the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, and the Satellite Awards. Lake of Fire took Kaye 18 years to make. Kaye's third feature film was a crime drama titled Black Water Transit starring Laurence Fishburne, Karl Urban, Evan Ross, Brittany Snow, and Stephen Dorff. The film was shot in New Orleans during the summer of 2007. A rough cut was reportedly screened at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival but the film was never released to cinemas. As of 2017 the film is considered unfinished due to the production company's bankruptcy and the ensuing litigation. Kaye's fourth feature film, Detachment (2011), starring Adrien Brody, as well as featuring Kaye's daughter Betty, is a drama about the decline of the education system in American high schools. It premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival On 9 September 2011, Detachment screened in competition at the 37th Deauville American Film Festival in France. It won both the Revelations Prize and the International Critics' Award. On 18 September, Detachment was announced as the Closing Night Film at the Woodstock Film Festival, where Kaye was the recipient of the Honorary Maverick Award. On 12 October 2011, Detachment screened in competition at the Valenciennes International Festival of Action and Adventure Films in France, where it won the Grand Prize and the Audience Award. Later, on 26 October, the film screened in competition at the 24th Tokyo International Film Festival. It received the award for Best Artistic Contribution, sharing honors with the film Kora. Detachment also screened in competition at the 35th São Paulo International Film Festival and won the Audience Award for Best Foreign Language Film. On 16 November, Detachment screened at the 53rd Muestra Internacional de Cine in Mexico. In January 2012, Detachment won Best Picture at the Ramdam Film Festival in Tournai, Belgium. On 24 January 2016, Kaye announced on his Facebook page that he will be directing Joe Vinciguerra's screenplay titled Stranger Than the Wheel. The upcoming film features Shia LaBeouf and potentially Alec Baldwin about a young man who revisits his past, and his relationship with this abusive father. Kaye also began filming a documentary in 2016 called The Hell of Compromise which he is making about the struggle over American History X, composed chiefly of videos he shot of himself at the time. Kaye said that it is meant to be a personal portrait of the process and the trauma that he encountered in his first experience as a Hollywood filmmaker. He also pointed out that the point of the movie was to help creative people to not get in their own way. Personal life Kaye has been married twice. His first wife was a Romanian woman named Eugenia Volosonovici. They have two daughters. His second wife is Chinese-American artist Yan Lin Kaye. They have two daughters: Shanghai and Eema Emet Kaye. Kaye enjoys singing, songwriting and playing guitar. He is frequently found at various open mic nights around London, most notably Redrock Jam at Dublin Castle, Camden and Ant Henson's Open Mic London in Clerkenwell.

As of February 2013, has been observed telescopically 457 times with a data-arc span of 2,947 days and it was the target of Doppler observations in 5 occasions; therefore, its orbit is very well determined. Its semi-major axis of 0.7237 AU is very similar to that of Venus but its eccentricity is rather large (0.4104) and its orbital inclination is also significant (9.0060°). The spectrum of implies that it is an X-type asteroid and hence an albedo of about 0.25 should be assumed. The body is calculated to measure 236 meters in diameters. Its rotational period is 13.5 hours and its light curve has an amplitude of 0.9 mag which hints at a very elongated body, perhaps a contact binary.

Wiegert and Kimmo Innanen in 2004, two years after the actual discovery of the object. From the perspective of a hypothetical observer in a frame of reference rotating with Venus, it appears to travel around the planet during one Venusian year although it does not orbit Venus but the Sun like any other asteroid. As quasi-satellite, this minor body is trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Venus. Besides being a Venus co-orbital, this Aten asteroid is also a Mercury grazer and an Earth crosser. exhibits resonant (or near-resonant) behavior with Mercury, Venus and Earth.On the dynamical evolution of 2002 VE68 It seems to have been co-orbital with Venus for only the last 7,000 years, and is destined to be ejected from this orbital arrangement about 500 years from now. During this time, its distance to Venus has been and will remain larger than about 0.2 AU (3·107 km).  Potentially hazardous asteroid  is included in the Minor Planet Center list of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) because it comes relatively frequently to within 0.05 AU of Earth.

The school was founded in 1933 by the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn History The school was founded as St. Anthony's Juniorate by the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn, New York in September 1931. At the time, it was designed to be an all-boys preparatory boarding school for prospective novitiates. On August 31, 1933, ground broke on the Juniorate's new facility in Smithtown, New York. Students interested in the Juniorate attended St. Francis Preparatory School, which was then located in Brooklyn. The ground-breaking marks the founding of St. Anthony's and appears on the school's crest. The school never expanded to more than 50 or 60 pupils at one time during the early years. The first five students graduated in June 1935. In 1949, the Franciscan Novitiate moved from Smithtown to Wyandanch, New York. In 1958, the Juniorate expanded into a day school to serve the boys of the nearby towns. Anticipating this change, the school admitted no freshmen for a period of one year and changed its name to St. Anthony's High School. The school began to grow in size to its current population of nearly 2,500. In June 1969, the school's juniorate program was terminated. Following the end of the program was a substantial increase in the percentage of lay faculty members and the presence of nuns. On December 5, 1983, Most Reverend John R. McGann announced that, as part of extensive changes in the educational plans of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, Holy Family Diocesan High School, South Huntington, New York, would close in June 1984, and St. Anthony's High School will re-locate in the Holy Family facility. The two schools were athletic rivals and were forced to blend into one school. Following this, the school began to admit young women. St. Anthony's is currently located in this former Holy Family location at 275 Wolf Hill Road in South Huntington. Curriculum The basic curriculum at St. Anthony's includes required courses in Theology, English, Social Studies and Physical Education (4 years); Mathematics, Science, Foreign Language (3 years); Fine Arts (Health, Art, Music or Drama) (1 year). Honors and Advanced Placement courses are offered to students who qualify, with electives in all disciplines. The passing grade at St. Anthony's is 75% to ensure that each student leaves with a higher standard of excellence before entering college and a minimum grade of 80% is required for any letter of recommendation to college.

(also Christine), (26 March 1277 – 27 December 1356) was a German Dominican nun, writer and mystic.  Life  Ebner was born in the Imperial City of Nuremberg, the child of the patrician Seyfried Ebner and his wife, Elizabeth Kuhdorf. In 1289, at the age of twelve, she entered the Monastery of St. John the Baptist in Engelthal, which was a community of nuns of the Dominican Second Order outside the city, in the Burgraviate of Nuremberg. Founded as a beguinage some fifty years earlier, over the next hundred years this monastery was to become a much-renowned center of spirituality and learning. According to some, it might very well have been the foremost center of mystical life during the early fourteenth century in Germany, if not all of Europe.Monastic Matrix \\"Ebenthal\\" Less than a year later after her admission, Christina fell gravely ill. This affliction would reappear up to three times a year for the next decade. Also, later, she frequently suffered from various illnesses. About this time, she began experiencing frequent religious visions, which her confessor, Friar Conrad of Füssen, O.P., encouraged her to write down. So she began writing her first book, Leben und Offenbarungen ( Life and Revelations) in 1317. She continued to work on it at least until 1324. In 1338, she began a correspondence with the secular priest Henry of Nördlingen, who was an enthusiastic propagator of mystic spirituality and literature. Through him, she started a correspondence with the Blessed Margareta Ebner, who was also a Dominican nun actively involved in the spiritual movement of the period; but Margareta was no relative of Christina's in spite of the same family name \\"Ebner\\". Around 1340, Christina started compiling the Book of Sisters (Schwesternbuch), a record of the mystical visions and life experiences of the other nuns in her monastery, called Von der genaden uberlast (Of the Burden of Grace). It can be attributed to Ebner based on a 1451 manuscript and belongs to a genre known as the Sister-books. Between 1344 and 1352, she wrote a second book of Revelations (Offenbarungen).See: Siegfried Ringler: Ebner, Christine. In: Verfasserlexikon. 2nd edition, tom 2 (1980), col. 297–302; Susanne Bürkle: Ebner, Christine. In Walther Killy: Killy Literaturlexikon. 2nd edition, tom 3. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin / New York 2008, p. 163b-165b. In it, she deals with historical and political events of the time such as the riots at Nuremberg in 1348; the earthquake of the same year; the outbreak of the Black Death; the Flagellants' processions of 1349; and the long quarrel between the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV and the Holy See. Christina does not limit herself to the role of a bystander. Instead, she takes a deep interest in the events, develops her own opinions about them and even actively tries to influence their course. By that time, her reputation had spread widely through Northern Europe. In 1350, the Emperor Charles IV himself came to visit her at the monastery, seeking her guidance and prayers. In 1351 she was finally visited for the first time by her long-time confidant, Henry of Nördlingen, who spent three weeks as a visitor to the monastery. At that time he gave her a copy of Mechthild's of Magdeburg mystic work Das fließende Licht der Gottheit (The Flowing Light of the Godhead), which is found reflected in her own later works and in those of the other nuns in the community.Monastic Matrix \\"Christine Ebner\\" Ebner died in her monastery at Engelthal on 27 December 1356, in her 67th year of monastic life.

Personal life  Nur Misuari was born on March 3, 1939 in Tapul, Sulu, Philippines.University of the Philippines, U.P. Biographical Directory, Supplement 1, University of the Philippines, Quezon City (1970) The fourth of ten children, his parents were of Tausūg-Sama descent and came from Kabinga-an, Tapul Island. His father was Saliddain Misuari, who worked as a fisherman, and his mother was Dindanghail Pining. Nur Misuari is a direct descendant of Panglima Mahabasser Elidji, a Tausūg warrior and representative from the Sultanate of Sulu who he claims helped the Sultanate of Brunei forces under Sultan Muhyiddin during the civil war in northern Borneo, after which the eastern part of Sabah was rewarded to the Tausūgs by Sultan Muhyiddin. Misuari's father moved their family from Tapul to Jolo, Sulu when he was still young. He attended Jolo Central Elementary School from 1949 to 1955 and studied at Sulu National High School for his secondary education from 1955 to 1958. Misuari's family experienced financial difficulties and could not afford to send him to college. His teacher assisted him to acquire a scholarship from the Commission on National Integration, which allowed him to study at the University of the Philippines, Manila. Misuari initially took up a degree in liberal arts, intending to pursue medicine. Instead, Misuari shifted his course to political science in his second semester with the intent of taking up law, despite the fact that his father \\"hated\\" lawyers. He became active in many of the university's extra- curricular activities, particularly in debate. After attaining his bachelor's degree in political science from the University of the Philippines in 1962, he entered the College of Law at University of the Philippines, Diliman but dropped his law studies in his second year after being convinced by his mentor and now national author, Caesar Majul, to pursue a master's degree related to political science. He finished his master's degree in Asian studies in 1964 at the Asian Center of the University of the Philippines, Diliman. In 1964, Misuari founded a radical student group called the Bagong Asya (New Asia). Together with Jose Maria Sison, he also founded the Kabataan Makabayan (Patriotic Youth). Until 2016, Misuari had five wives, his first wife was Desdemona Tan, who died of illness in Islamabad, Pakistan. The elder sister of the deceased Desdemona, Eleonora Rohaida Tan then became his second wife. His third and fourth wives are Tarhata Ibrahim and Maimona Palalisan. His fifth wife comes from the tribe of Subanen, while Sherry Rahim became his sixth wife. As per polygyny, Islam allows men to marry up to four wives currently alive at the same time, thought Misuari already have six wives, this does not include his first wife who have been deceased. = Political career = Through Cesar Adib Majul, Misuari became a lecturer at the University of the Philippines in political science in July 1966 until his retirement as instructor on November 15, 1968. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Mindanao Independence Movement which aimed to organize an independent state in southern Philippines. The Mindanao Independence Movement formed the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) that sought political reforms from the government of the Philippines. Unable to gain reforms, the MNLF engaged in military conflict against the Philippine government and its supporters between 1972 and 1976 under the leadership of Misuari. The military resistance to the government of former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos did not produce autonomy for the Moro people. Misuari departed to Saudi Arabia in self-exile, returning to the Philippines after Marcos was removed from office during the People Power Revolution in 1986. Misuari justified the MNLF armed struggle on the non-implementation of the Tripoli Agreement, originally signed by Ferdinand Marcos and later included and accepted in the peace agreement signed by former Philippine president Fidel Ramos in the 1990s. This agreement established an autonomous region for Moros, where Misuari became governor.  Removal as ARMM governor  Misuari in 2007 After he was installed as the region's governor in 1996, his rule ended in violence when he led a failed rebellion against the Philippines government in November 2001, thus illegally escaping to Sabah, Malaysia. During his time there, his third wife Tarhatta together with their three children were allowed to visit by the Malaysian government. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) regional chairman suggested the Malaysian government send Misuari to Saudi Arabia or Libya to avoid \\"political persecution\\" by the Philippine government. However the Malaysian leader at the time, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resisted by saying; \\"We cannot entertain asylum as Misuari had not used his powers correctly although we provide support for him in the past for his bid on autonomy that saw the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)\\". He was then deported back to the Philippines, and removed from his office by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2001 before being arrested in 2007 on charges of terrorism. On December 20, 2007, he was denied a petition for bail and remained under house arrest in Manila. The Philippine court however, granted the bail petition of Misuari's seven co-accused, at 100,000 pesos.Abs-Cbn Interactive, Judge denies Misuari's bail petition On April 25, 2008, he was allowed to post bail, upon the instructions of the Cabinet security cluster. According to Moro sources, Misuari is a \\"charismatic leader\\" who held considerable sway over the indigenous people in Mindanao but lost this backing because of his mismanagement and the corruption of his officials during his tenure as governor for the ARMM.  Controversy and criticism  Since the 1970s, there has been an animosity between Moro separatist leaders that resulted in the creation of MILF and other factions of MNLF due to dispute with Misuari. His anger towards Malaysia began when the Malaysian government deporting him back to the Philippines and supporting the MILF on the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro that resulted in his dissatisfaction towards Malaysian leaders. As a form of revenge to the Malaysian government, he made a controversial statement by stating the Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah as part of the Bangsamoro lands between March and July 2013, as well supporting an intrusion by a self-proclaimed Sultan Jamalul Kiram III of a defunct-Sultanate of Sulu as legal. As a consequence, his word has resulted into many Moro refugees (who have resided illegally in both states since the 1970s to escaping the war in southern Philippines) to suffer in discrimination and been deported back to the Philippines, as well making himself been labelled as a \\"terrorist\\" by the Malaysian government (which also had been on effect to the Jamalul Kiram III group). Misuari also began to accuse the MILF as \\"a tool been used by the Malaysian government to promoting disunity among the Moro peoples\\" in which he was then criticised by the MILF for his attitude of \\"blaming everybody for the failure of his past leadership and growing irrelevance to the Bangsamoro struggle to self-determination\\". On September 9, 2013, Misuari was blamed for his rebels encounter with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) which saw massive casualties and thousands of residents been affected. In denying their action, the MNLF stated they were in Zamboanga City only to hold a peaceful rally to assert the implementation of the GRP-MNLF Agreement but they were coerced by the AFP that compelled them to defend their own lives. The AFP and the Philippine government portrayed the MNLF as terrorist as they were causing chaos in the city and using civilians as a human shield. The conflict lasted until September 28, 2013 with more than 50,000 families, comprising 118,000 people (which 23,000 of them are children) lost their homes and many other properties. Misuari had since been living in self-exile and insisted that they were attacked by the AFP. The Philippine government has been trying to get him in custody for causing chaos. In 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte said that he would drop any previous charges by past administration for the arrestment of Misuari due to his old age. The move was also supported by the Department of Justice (DoJ). However, in the same year, Misuari again make a controversial proposal by calling the government to include the extreme terrorist-group Abu Sayyaf in Moro peace talks that was responded with a rejection by the Philippine government and the country armed forces as the group have committed \\"too many murders to innocent civilians\\", Duterte also citing the Abu Sayyaf group has been repeatedly called before to stop their terrorist activities, but the group continue to do so and obeying the law that push the need for the group to be destroyed. Despite Duterte plan to drop charges against Misuari, the government of Zamboanga City has made a clear stand that they will pursuing cases against Misuari for his previous siege in the city as we ought to follow the rule of law though we respect the actions of the President according to the city legal officer, Jesus Carbon Jr. Misuari returned to accusing neighbouring Malaysia by saying \\"Malaysia using Moro people for kidnappings since the 2000 Sipadan kidnappings and said want to drag the country leaders to International Criminal Court (ICC), saying that \\"the [pieces of] evidence are available as his people are everywhere and Malaysia cannot escape as because they are continue to hiring Moro people\\". Responding to the accusation to neighbouring country, Sabah Chief Minister Musa Aman urges Misuari to prove his allegation as such claims could strain relations between Malaysia and the Philippines. Malaysian state assemblyman from Senallang of Semporna Nasir Tun Sakaran urge Misuari to give his evidence and name any Malaysian politicians who he claimed was involved as any allegation must be accompanied by evidence. Adding that as Malaysia has its own laws, they would investigate and punish the involved suspects immediately if they know their identity. Malaysian Dewan Rakyat Deputy Speaker Ronald Kiandee also urging Misuari to prove his allegation if his claim was true, while Kinabatangan member of parliament Bung Moktar Radin said he was not surprised by the accusation towards Malaysian politicians as he had seen similar talks occur in Malaysia coffeeshops, but stressed if the allegation was true the Malaysian authorities must take action on any individuals involved. Meanwhile, the Sabah Suluk Solidarity Council (SSSC) regrets by the remarks and urging the Malaysian Embassy in Manila with the help of Philippine government to find out the identity of any Malaysian leaders who were involved in the kidnapping activities. The AFP and Philippine National Police (PNP) also requesting Misuari to present his evidence than only making allegation. Malaysian Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Shahidan Kassim began investigations to verify claims by Misuari and admits there could be involvement of certain groups. In response to all questions directed to him, Misuari said he will present all the evidence only to ICC. He also stated that he will not sit on the same negotiating table with MILF who he described as \\"traitors\\", as well accusing fellow MNLF faction Muslimin Sema and ARMM Governor Mujib Hataman of \\"associating with drug lords and involvement in the 2016 Davao City bombing\\". As a response, President Duterte said ready to give Misuari group a separate peace talks as Misuari did not want a similar peace talks with the MILF. The President stated \\"I will talk to everybody soon after my visit to Malaysia\\". = Corruption charges = Misuari has been charged with graft following the \\"anomalous\\" bidding of educational materials that was committed between 2000–2001 during his term as the governor for the ARMM, amounting to P137.5 million. He was charged with 3 counts of graft and 3 counts of malversation of non-existent educational materials. According to the charge sheets filed before court by the Office of the Ombudsman on May 22, 2017 and released to media on May 24, Misuari authored the purchase of materials for 3 separate educational projects in the ARMM in 2000 and 2001. All of these materials, according to state investigations, were never delivered.

Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe, also known as Puerto del Hambre (Port Famine), is a historic settlement site at Buena Bay (locally known as Mansa Bay) on the north shore of the Strait of Magellan approximately south of Punta Arenas in the Región de Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena, Patagonia, Chile. Puerto Hambre lies halfway between the South Pole and Chile's northern border with Peru. Since Chile claims its Antarctic territories extending all the way to the South Pole, this point is sometimes considered the geographical center of Chile. A monument near the site marks this midpoint. History After Francis Drake's successful negotiation of the Strait of Magellan to enter the Pacific Ocean, Spain determined to fortify the strait to hinder further piracy on its ships. Initially two forts commanded by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa were planned for Primera Angostura, but that location was discarded because the tide there would aid ships in crossing the narrow passage.Mateo Martinic, Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes A Spanish fleet of 23 ships and almost 3,000 men and settlers sailed from San Lucar de Barrameda on 27 September 1581, but storms destroyed two of the ships and caused the fleet to return to Spain. Two months later Sarmiento sailed again with 16 ships and 2,200 men. Diego Flores, Sarmiento's second in command, was separated from the main fleet by storms near the eastern entrance of the Strait of Magellan and returned to Spain with 6 ships. Monument at the site of Puerto Hambre. In March 1584 Sarmiento founded the Spanish settlement of Rey Don Felipe with around 300 settlers. Conditions were harsh and local vegetation sparse, and the settlers starved or froze to death. When the next English navigator, Thomas Cavendish, landed at the site in 1587, he found only ruins of the settlement. He renamed the place \\"Port Famine\\". In the 19th century, it was developed as a naval base used by the British Royal Navy. The name was subsequently translated into Spanish as Puerto Hambre or Puerto del Hambre, and these names are still in use. According to archeological finds in the 1970s, the base established by Cavendish was located in the Bahía San Juan, just south of the Bahía San Blas where the Ciudad del Rey Felipe had been. The Royal Navy hydrographic survey ship HMS Beagle commanded by Captain Pringle Stokes was surveying Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego when Stokes fell into a deep depression. At Port Famine in August 1828, he locked himself in his cabin and shot himself. He was buried in the Cementerio inglés (English cemetery). His grave is still marked on nautical charts. Command of HMS Beagle was temporarily given to the Beagle's Executive Officer, Lieutenant W.G. Skyring, and then to Flag Lieutenant Robert FitzRoy. FitzRoy became the captain of the Beagle for its second survey expedition, and he took the young naturalist Charles Darwin as a companion on this voyage. They visited Port Famine a number of times between 1832 and 1834 during the expedition. Chile determined to resettle the site in the 1840s. On 2 May 1843 the first twenty immigrants, including Bernhard Eunom Philippi, reached the port of Puerto del Hambre. In 1843 Commander John Williams Wilson of the Chilean Navy, also known as Juan Guillermos, built Fuerte Bulnes approximately further south at the Peninsula known as Punta Santa Ana (Santa Ana Point). The fort bolstered Chile's claim to the Strait and the Patagonian lands. In February 1968 the ruins of Puerto del Hambre were made a National Monument. Fuerte Bulnes, which had been abandoned in the 19th century, was reconstructed from 1941 to 1943. In 1968 it was also designated as a National Monument.

The band started playing in 1999 as part of the Avanzada Regia musical movement and is currently composed of Eduardo Davalos de Luna, also known as MC Babo (lead vocals), Rowan Rabia (beatmaker) and DJ Agustín (only in live shows). They have been referred to as one of the most notable Mexican hip-hop groups. History Cartel de Santa started playing in 1996, when MC Babo and some friends began singing improvised rap songs. The group became famous in 2003, when the band released its first self-titled album. The album includes hits such as \\"Perros\\", \\"Todas Mueren por Mí\\" and \\"La Pelotona\\". The album was produced by Jason Roberts who had previously worked with artists such as Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, House of Pain, Guns N' Roses, Control Machete, and Plastilina Mosh. This contributed to the fame of the band. That same year, the group released a video clip of the song \\"Perros\\". This video was broadcast across Latin America on MTV. A year later, in 2004, a new album was released, Vol. 2, which included hits as \\"Blah, blah, blah\\", \\"La Llamada\\" and \\"El Arte del Engaño\\". Cartel de Santa Vol. 2 counted with the collaboration of other artists, such as Tego Calderón, in \\"Conexión Puerto Rico\\", and Mr. Pomel, in \\"Crónica Babilonia\\". In 2007, Cartel de Santa recorded its third album, named Volumen Prohibido. It included the single \\"Cheka Wey\\" featuring female hip-hop artist Mery Dee. A few months after the album release, the lead vocalist, Babo, was arrested for the killing of a fellow band member. During a confrontation with Juan Miguel Chávez, an old rival, on the street, Babo shot a warning shot, which instead hit former band member Ulises. Eduardo Dávalos, Babo, turned himself in to the Ministerial Police of Nuevo Leon state. He later wrote a song about the incident while in prison in which he expresses his regret over the killing of Ulises. The band released a compilation album, Cartel de Santa, Greatest Hits, aimed at raising funds to be used to set the vocalist free. MC Babo was liberated from prison nine months later, with help of Sony Music, after the group paid about 130,000 pesos as bail. In February 2008, the band released its fourth album, Vol. IV. Some of the songs recount Babo's memories during the months he was in prison. The album was meant as a message to fans that \\"el Cartel\\" would keep making music. The first single of this album was \\"Hay mamita\\" which also has a music videoclip. In March 2010, Babo announced on the band's Myspace the release of another album. The fifth album was released in May 2010 with the name \\"Vol. V: Sincopa\\". Like their last work, Volume V showed a better sound and beats quality. Cartel de Santa was nominated for the Latin Grammys as a result of their new release. The group's sixth album, \\"Golpe Avisa\\" was released on August 5th, 2014, by Sony Music Entertainment. This work is the group's first studio album released after the departure of rapper MC Dharius. \\"Golpe Avisa\\" features collaborations with Campa, Draw, Big Man and Millionaire. The song \\"Me alegro de su odio\\" had originally been released with vocal work from then group member Dharius in June 2013. However, after the rapper's decision to leave the group, this subject had to be re-recorded to include it in the album. This reissued theme was never released as a single. On 3 October 2016 Cartel released their seventh album \\"Viejo Marihuano\\", with the singles \\"Mucha Marihuana\\" and \\"Soy Quien soy\\". It was published by Babilonia Music, S.A. De C.V. In 2017, Cartel received a gold record in Mexico for reaching 100,000 sales of Viejo Marihuano.http://polvora.com.mx/2016/09/22/el-nuevo-disco-de- cartel-de-santa/ #PPCDSALVC Controversy In April 2007, MC Babo turned himself in to Mexican police officials claiming that he accidentally shot and killed his fellow band member. While at a house in Santa Catarina, Nuevo León, MC Babo learned that a formal rival was headed to the home to settle a dispute. He then proceeded to shoot Juan Miguel Chavez Pimentel, known as El Micky, in the leg upon his arrival. Babo claimed that one of the shots from his .38 revolver ricocheted off of the floor and hit his friend Ulises 'Buenrostro', killing him. In January 2008, Babo was released from jail after nine months incarceration, after the group paid a bail of about 130,000 pesos. In May 2018, nude photographs of MC Babo were published on the internet.

Early life and career  Louise Closser was born in Chicago, Illinois. Her father was Joseph A. Closser (1844–1887), a wealthy grain dealer and her mother was Louise M. Closser (1847–1932). She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, and at Emerson College of Oratory in Boston. She made her theatrical debut in Detroit in an 1894 production of In Old Kentucky. Her first theatrical success came in 1903, when she appeared in a Broadway production of George Bernard Shaw's Candida. In 1907, she made her London debut in Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. She was equally famous on New York and London stages, she was known to the world of literature for such novels as Home Talent and An American's London, as well as to the theater for a play called Mother's Millions, which she co-authored. In 1899, Closser married artist and actor Walter Hale, whose name she used for her stage career, and who illustrated a number of her travel books. She collaborated with him in the preparation of many travel works. They traveled all over the world. She was a correspondent for Harper's during World War I. Following her husband's death from cancer in 1917, she left the stage for Hollywood. She had a parallel career as an author and playwright, starting in the first decade of the 20th century. Death She experienced an apoplectic stroke while shopping in Hollywood, California in 1933. She was rushed to Monte Sano Hospital. She suffered another stroke the next day and died, aged 60. She had just recently finished filming Dinner at Eight. In her will, Mrs. Hale requested an Episcopalian funeral service as simple and as inexpensive as possible. She directed that at the close of the service her body be cremated and that \\"no friend or kin accompany the body further than the church door.\\" In her will, Mrs Hale said, \\"If I live in the memory of my friends, I shall have lived long enough.\\" Family Hale had no children. She left her estate to relatives and charities. Her body was cremated and the ashes were interred in Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

During the economic boom, Japan rapidly became the world's second largest economy (after the United States). By the 1990s, Japan's demographics began stagnating and the workforce was no longer expanding as it did in the previous decades, despite per-worker productivity remaining high.  Background  This economic miracle was the result of post-World War II Japan and West Germany benefitting from the Cold War. It occurred chiefly due to the economic interventionism of the Japanese government and partly due to the aid and assistance of the U.S. Marshall Plan. After World War II, the U.S. established a significant presence in Japan to slow the expansion of Soviet influence in the Pacific. The U.S. was also concerned with the growth of the economy of Japan because there was a risk that an unhappy and poor Japanese population would turn to communism and by doing so, ensure Soviet control over the Pacific. The distinguishing characteristics of the Japanese economy during the \\"economic miracle\\" years included: the cooperation of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks in close-knit groups called keiretsu; the powerful enterprise unions and shuntō; good relations with government bureaucrats, and the guarantee of lifetime employment (shūshin koyō) in big corporations and highly unionized blue-collar factories.  Governmental contributions  The Japanese financial recovery continued even after SCAP departed and the economic boom propelled by the Korean War abated. The Japanese economy survived from the deep recession caused by a loss of the U.S. payments for military procurement and continued to make gains. By the late 1960s, Japan had risen from the ashes of World War II to achieve an astoundingly rapid and complete economic recovery. According to Knox College Professor Mikiso Hane, the period leading up to the late 1960s saw \\"the greatest years of prosperity Japan had seen since the Sun Goddess shut herself up behind a stone door to protest her brother Susano-o's misbehaviour.\\" The Japanese government contributed to the post-war Japanese economic miracle by stimulating private sector growth, first by instituting regulations and protectionism that effectively managed economic crises and later by concentrating on trade expansion.Hane, Mikiso. Eastern Phoenix: Japan Since 1945. Boulder: Westview Press, 1996.  History  = Brief introduction to the Japanese economic miracle = Japanese economic miracle refers to the significant increase in the Japanese economy during the time between the end of World War II and the end of the Cold War (1945-1991). The economical miracle can be divided into four stages: the recovery (1946-1954), the high increase (1955-1972), the steady increase (1972-1992), and the low increase (1992-2017). Although heavily damaged by the nuclear bombardment in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other Allied air raids on Japan, Japan was able to recover from the trauma of WWII, and managed to become the second-largest economic entity of the world (after the United States) by the 1960s (Soviet Union excluded). However, after three decades, Japan had experienced the so- called \\"recession in growth\\", as the United States had been imposing economic protection policy in oppressing Japanese production and forcing the appreciation of the Japanese yen. In preventing further oppression, Japan greatly improved its technological advances and raised the value of the yen, since to devalue, the yen would have brought further risk and a possible depressing effect on trade. The appreciation of the yen led to significant economic recession in the 1980s. To alleviate the influence of recession, Japan imposed a series of economical and financial policy to stimulate domestic demand. Nevertheless, the bubble economy that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the subsequent deflationary policy destroyed the Japanese economy. After the deflationary policy, the Japanese economy has been through a time of low increase period which has lasted until today. For more detailed information regarding this period, see Economic history of Japan and Lost Decade (Japan). = Recovery stage (1946-1954) = Japan was seriously harmed in WWII. For instance, during wartime, \\"the Japanese cotton industry was brought to its knees by the end of the Second World War. Two-thirds of its prewar cotton spindles were scrapped by wartime administrators, and bombing and destruction of urban areas had caused a further loss of 20 percent of spinning and 14 percent of weaving capacity\\". Nonetheless, the ability of recovery astonished the world, earning the title of \\"Japanese Economic Miracle\\". By and large, every country has experienced some degree of industrial growth in the post-war period, those countries that achieved a heavy drop in industrial output due to war damage such as Japan, West Germany and Italy, have achieved a most rapid recovery. In the case of Japan, industrial production decreased in 1946 to 27.6% of the pre-war level, but recovered in 1951 and reached 350% in 1960. One reason for Japan's quick recovery from war trauma was the successful economic reform by the government. The government body principally concerned with industrial policy in Japan was the Ministry of Industry. One of the major economic reforms was to adopt the \\"Inclined Production Mode\\" (傾斜生産方式 keisha seisan hoshiki). The \\"Inclined Production Mode\\" refers to the inclined production that primarily focuses on the production of raw material including steel, coal and cotton. Textile production occupied more than 23.9% of the total industrial production. Moreover, to stimulate the production, Japanese government supported the new recruitment of labour, especially female labour. By enhancing the recruitment of female labour, Japan managed to recover from the destruction. The legislation on recruitment contains three components: the restriction placed on regional recruitment and relocation of workers, the banning of the direct recruitment of new school leavers, and the direct recruitment of non-school leavers under explicitly detailed regulations issued by the Ministry of Labour. The second reason that accounts for Japan's rapid recovery from WWII was the outbreak of the Korean War. The Korean War was fought in territory that had been, until 1945, Chōsen (朝鮮) that Empire of Japan had annexed. As the United States was participating in the conflict on the Korean Peninsula, it turned to the Japanese economy for procurement of equipment and supplies because the logistics of shipping from the States soon became a significant problem for the military. Japan's industry was soon providing the required munitions and logistics to the American forces fighting in Korea. The demand stimulated the Japanese economy enabling it to recover quickly from the destruction of the Pacific War and provide the basis for the rapid expansion that was to follow. = High increasing stage (1954-1972) = After gaining support from the United States and achieving domestic economic reform, Japan was able to soar from the 1950s to the 1970s. Furthermore, Japan also completed its process toward industrialization and became one of the first developed countries in East Asia. The Japanese Economic Yearbooks from 1967 to 1971 witnessed a significant increase. In 1967, the yearbook said: the Japanese economy in 1966 thus made an advance more rapidly than previously expected. In 1968, the yearbook said that the Japanese economy continued to make a sound growth after it had a bottom in the autumn of 1965. The words \\"increase\\", \\"growth\\" and \\"upswing\\" filled the summaries of the yearbooks from 1967 to 1971. The reasons for Japan to complete industrialization are also complicated, and the major characteristic of this time is the influence of governmental policies of the Hayato Ikeda administration, vast consumption, and vast export.  Influence of governmental policies: Ikeda administration and keiretsu  In 1954, the economic system MITI had cultivated from 1949 to 1953 came into full effect. Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, who Johnson calls \\"the single most important individual architect of the Japanese economic miracle,\\" pursued a policy of heavy industrialization. This policy led to the emergence of 'over-loaning' (a practice that continues today) in which the Bank of Japan issues loans to city banks who in turn issue loans to industrial conglomerates. Since there was a shortage of capital in Japan at the time, industrial conglomerates borrowed beyond their capacity to repay, often beyond their net worth, causing city banks in turn to over-borrow from the Bank of Japan. This gave the national Bank of Japan complete control over dependent local banks. The system of over-loaning, combined with the government's relaxation of anti-monopoly laws (a remnant of SCAP control) also led to the re-emergence of conglomerate groups called keiretsu that mirrored the wartime conglomerates, or zaibatsu. Led by the economic improvements of Sony businessmen Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita, the keiretsu efficiently allocated resources and became competitive internationally. At the heart of the keiretsu conglomerates' success lay city banks, which lent generously, formalizing cross-share holdings in diverse industries. The keiretsu spurred both horizontal and vertical integration, locking out foreign companies from Japanese industries. Keiretsu had close relations with MITI and each other through the cross-placement of shares, providing protection from foreign take- overs. For example, 83% of Japan's Development Bank's finances went toward strategic industries: shipbuilding, electric power, coal and steel production. Keiretsu proved crucial to protectionist measures that shielded Japan's sapling economy. Keiretsu also fostered an attitude shift among Japanese managers that tolerated low profits in the short-run because keiretsu were less concerned with increasing stock dividends and profits and more concerned about interest payments. Approximately only two-thirds of the shares of a given company were traded, cushioning keiretsu against market fluctuations and allowing keiretsu managers to plan for the long-term and maximize market shares instead of focusing on short-term profits. The Ikeda administration also instituted the Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy, a system of import controls designed to prevent the flooding of Japan's markets by foreign goods. MITI used the foreign exchange allocation to stimulate the economy by promoting exports, managing investment and monitoring production capacity. In 1953, MITIs revised the Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy to promote domestic industries and increase the incentive for exports by revising the export-link system. A later revision-based production capacity on foreign exchange allocation to prevent foreign dumping.  Vast consumption: from survival to recreation  During the time of reconstruction and before the 1973 oil crisis, Japan managed to complete its industrialization process, gaining significant improvement in living standards and witnessing a significant increase in consumption. The average monthly consumption of urban family households doubled from 1955 to 1970. Moreover, the proportions of consumption in Japan was also changing. The consumption in daily necessities, such as food and clothing and footwear, was decreasing. Contrastingly, the consumption in recreational, entertainment activities and goods increased, including furniture, transportation, communications, and reading. The great increase in consumption stimulated the growth in GDP as it incentivized production. = Vast export: Golden Sixties and shift to export trade = The period of rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1961 paved the way for the Golden Sixties, the second decade that is generally associated with the Japanese economic miracle. In 1965, Japan's nominal GDP was estimated at just over $91 billion. Fifteen years later, in 1980, the nominal GDP had soared to a record $1.065 trillion. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Ikeda, former minister of MITI, the Japanese government undertook an ambitious \\"Income Doubling Plan\\" (所得倍増計画). Ikeda lowered interest rates and taxes to private players to motivate spending. In addition, due to the financial flexibility afforded by the FILP, Ikeda's government rapidly expanded government investment in Japan's infrastructure: building highways, high-speed railways, subways, airports, port facilities, and dams. Ikeda's government also expanded government investment in the previously neglected communications sector of the Japanese economy. Each of these acts continued the Japanese trend towards a managed economy that epitomized the mixed economic model. Besides Ikeda's adherence to government intervention and regulation of the economy, his government pushed trade liberalization. By April 1960, trade imports had been 41 percent liberalized (compared to 22 percent in 1956). Ikeda planned to liberalize trade to 80 percent within three years. His plans however met severe opposition from both industries who had thrived on over-loaning and the nationalist public who feared foreign enterprise takeovers. The Japanese press likened liberalization to \\"the second coming of the black ships,\\" \\"the defenselessness of the Japanese islands in the face of attack from huge foreign capitalist powers,\\" and \\"the readying of the Japanese economy for a bloodstained battle between national capital and foreign capital.\\" Ikeda's Income Doubling Plan was largely a response to this growing opposition and widespread panic over liberalization, adopted to quell public protests. Ikeda's motivations were purely pragmatic and foreign policy based, however. He moved toward liberalization of trade only after securing a protected market through internal regulations that favored Japanese products and firms. Ikeda also set up numerous allied foreign aid distribution agencies to demonstrate Japan's willingness to participate in the international order and to promote exports. The creation of these agencies not only acted as a small concession to international organizations, but also dissipated some public fears about liberalization of trade. Ikeda furthered Japan's global economic integration by joining the GATT in 1955, the IMF, and the OECD in 1964. By the time Ikeda left office, the GNP was growing at a phenomenal rate of 13.9 percent. In 1962, Kaname Akamatsu published his famous article introducing the Flying Geese Paradigm. It postulated that Asian nations will catch up with the West as a part of a regional hierarchy where the production of commodity goods would continuously move from the more advanced countries to the less advanced ones. The paradigm was named this way due to Akamatsu's envisioning this pattern as geese flying in unison with Japan being an obvious leader. = Steady increasing stage (1973-1992) = In 1973, the first oil-price shock struck Japan (1973 oil crisis). The price of oil increased from 3 dollars per barrel to over 13 dollars per barrel. During this time, Japan's industrial production decreased by 20%, as the supply capacity could not respond effectively to the rapid expansion of demand, and increased investments in equipment often invited unwanted results—tighter supply and higher prices of commodities. Moreover, the Second Oil Shock in 1978 and 1979 exacerbated the situation as the oil price again increased from 13 dollars per barrel to 39.5 dollars per barrel. Despite being seriously impacted by the two oil crises, Japan was able to withstand the impact and managed to transfer from a product- concentrating to a technology-concentrating production form. The transformation was, in fact, a product of the oil crises and United States intervention. Since the oil price rose tenfold, the cost of production also soared. After the oil crises, to save costs, Japan had to produce products in a more environmentally friendly manner, and with less oil consumption. The biggest factor that invited industrial changes after the oil crises was the increase in energy prices including crude oil. As a result, Japan converted to a technology-concentrating program, ensuring the steady increase of its economy, and standing out beyond other capitalist countries that had been significantly wounded during the oil crises. Another factor was the friction between the United States and Japan, as Japan's rapid economic growth could potentially harm the economic interests of the United States. In 1985, the United States signed the \\"Plaza Accord\\" with Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. The \\"Plaza Accord\\" was an attempt to devalue the US dollar, yet harmed Japan the most. Japan attempted to expand international markets through the appreciation of the Japanese yen, yet they over-appreciated, creating a bubble economy. The Plaza Accord was successful in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Western European nations but largely failed to fulfill its primary objective of alleviating the trade deficit with Japan.  Role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was instrumental in Japan's post-war economic recovery. According to some scholars, no other governmental regulation or organization had more economic impact than MITI. \\"The particular speed, form, and consequences of Japanese economic growth,\\" Chalmers Johnson writes, \\"are not intelligible without reference to the contributions of MITI\\" (Johnson, vii). Established in 1949, MITI's role began with the \\"Policy Concerning Industrial Rationalization\\" (1950) that coordinated efforts by industries to counteract the effects of SCAP's deflationary regulations. In this way, MITI formalized cooperation between the Japanese government and private industry. The extent of the policy was such that if MITI wished to \\"double steel production, the neo-zaibatsu already has the capital, the construction assets, the makers of production machinery, and most of the other necessary factors already available in-house\\". The Ministry coordinated various industries, including the emerging keiretsu, toward a specific end, usually toward the intersection of national production goals and private economic interests. MITI also boosted the industrial security by untying the imports of technology from the imports of other goods. MITI's Foreign Capital Law granted the ministry power to negotiate the price and conditions of technology imports. This element of technological control allowed it to promote industries it deemed promising. The low cost of imported technology allowed for rapid industrial growth. Productivity was greatly improved through new equipment, management, and standardization. MITI gained the ability to regulate all imports with the abolition of the Economic Stabilization Board and the Foreign Exchange Control Board in August 1952. Although the Economic Stabilization Board was already dominated by MITI, the Yoshida Governments transformed it into the Economic Deliberation Agency, a mere \\"think tank,\\" in effect giving MITI full control over all Japanese imports. Power over the foreign exchange budget was also given directly to MITI. MITI's establishment of the Japan Development Bank also provided the private sector with low-cost capital for long-term growth. The Japan Development Bank introduced access to the Fiscal Investment and Loan Plan, a massive pooling of individual and national savings. At the time FILP controlled four times the savings of the world's largest commercial bank. With this financial power, FILP was able to maintain an abnormally high number of Japanese construction firms (more than twice the number of construction firms of any other nation with a similar GDP).  Conclusion  Coincidentally, the conclusion of the economic miracle coincided with the conclusion of the Cold War. While the Japanese stock market hit its all-time peak at the end of 1989, making a recovery later in 1990, it dropped precipitously in 1991. The year of the conclusion of the Japanese asset price bubble coincided with the Gulf War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Ebner – from 1311 – experienced a series of spiritual visions in which Jesus Christ gave her messages which she recorded in letters and a journal at the behest of her spiritual director; she was ill for well over a decade as she experienced these visions. The backdrop of much of Ebner's religious life was the bitter fighting between Pope John XXII and Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Bavarian, in which she and her convent faithfully backed Louis. Ebner's beatification cause began in the 1600s well after her death though stalled for a time until 1910 when the initial process was concluded; Pope John Paul II beatified Ebner in 1979 after confirming her longstanding \\"cultus\\" – or popular devotion to her – rather than recognizing a miracle as would be the norm. Life Margareta Ebner was born circa 1291 in Donauwörth to aristocratics; she received a thorough education in her home. In about 1305 she entered the Kloster Mödingen convent of the Dominican Nuns near Dillingen and made her profession around 1306. From 1312 to 1325 she suffered a grave illness and in her later Revelations described how she had \\"no control over herself\\" and often would laugh or weep on a constant level with sometimes little reprieve. This illness was the stimulus for her conversion to a deeper spiritual life of devotion to God. This illness seemed to even put her at the point of death on occasion and even when she seemed to recover she still remained in bed for well over a decade. It was from 1311 that she began to experience her visions of Jesus Christ who graced her with messages. Ebner became prone to further bouts of illness for the remainder of her life. But she could exercise her desire for penance and mortification via abstinence from wine and fruit as well as bathing which were considered some of the greatest pleasures of life in that time. In the 1320s, the perennial feud between pope and Holy Roman Emperor ramped up again. John XXII excommunicated Louis the Bavarian and placed the empire under an interdict; Louis appointed his own pope. The convent's members were forced to disperse for safety during Louis IV's campaign against the papal forces. Ebner took refuge at her old home with her relations. Upon her return her nurse died and she grieved without consolation until the secular priest Heinrich von Nördlingen assumed her spiritual direction in 1332. But her confessor was often absent due to his personal allegiance to the pope. The correspondence that passed between them is the first collection of this kind in the German language. At his command – beginning during the Advent of 1344 – she began to write with her own hand a full account of all her revelations and her conversation with the Infant Jesus as well as all the answers that she had received from Him including those given to her in her sleep. Ebner also wrote her visions in the Swabian dialect. This journal is preserved in a manuscript in 1353 at Medingen. Ebner also had extensive correspondence with the noted Dominican theologian and preacher Johannes Tauler as well as Christina Ebner (no relation). He was considered the leader of the spiritual movement dubbed the Friends of God. Through her connection with him she has become identified as part of this movement. From her letters and journal it is learned that she never abandoned her compassion for the Emperor Louis whose soul she learned in a vision had been saved. Ebner died on 20 June 1351. Her remains are now interred in her old convent in a chapel that had been constructed in 1755. Beatification Ebner's tomb in her old convent. The beatification cause opened in Augsburg in an informative process in 1686 though this seemed to be stalled at some stage until it was later closed centuries later in 1910; theologians had to investigate each of her writings and letters in order to determine those writings adhered to official doctrine. Such contraventions in her writings would have suspended the cause though the theologians approved these on 14 March 1952 having found no fault in them. Historians assigned to the cause also approved it on 12 June 1963 before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and their consultants approved the cause on 9 May 1978. The C.C.S. alone then approved the cause on 7 November 1978. Ebner was beatified on 24 February 1979 after Pope John Paul II confirmed her longstanding and local \\"cultus\\" – or popular devotion\\" – which meant that no miracle would be required for her to be beatified as is the norm. Spiritual works Ebner's experiences are mainly recorded in the \\"Revelations\\" (or \\"Offenbarungen\\") which she composed in 1344–48 with the encouragement of her spiritual advisor Heinrich; it was in this that she recounted the spiritual graces she had received between 1312 and 1348. There are about seven manuscripts which have survived. There also remain 56 letters that Heinrich had written to Ebner which survive in a single late manuscript though one of her letters to him still survives.

Smith, was a career United States Army officer who fought in the Mexican–American War, a civil engineer, and a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He briefly commanded the Army of Northern Virginia from May 31 until June 1, 1862, following the wounding of General Joseph E. Johnston at the Battle of Seven Pines, and before General Robert E. Lee took command. Smith later served as Interim Confederate Secretary of War and in the Georgia state militia. Early life and Mexico Smith was born in Georgetown, Kentucky, and was a brother-in-law of Horace Randal and a distant relative of John Bell Hood. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point as a brevet second lieutenant in 1842. Smith finished eighth out of 56 cadets while at West Point. He entered the Army Corps of Engineers afterward, and was promoted to second lieutenant on January 1, 1845.Eicher, p. 495. Smith fought in the Mexican–American War, winning two brevet promotions for his actions there. On April 18, 1847, he was appointed brevet first lieutenant for his service at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, and on August 20, 1847, brevet captain for his service at the Battle of Contreras. In 1848 he became an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847. On March 3, 1853, Smith was promoted to first lieutenant. He resigned his commission on December 18, 1854, to become a civil engineer in New York City, and was Streets Commissioner there from 1858 to 1861. Civil War service Smith's home state of Kentucky became a border state when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Some months afterward, he presented himself at Richmond to serve the Confederate States of America. Commissioned as a major general on September 19, he served in Northern Virginia as a divisional and \\"wing\\" commander, and fought in the Battle of Seven Pines near Richmond during the Peninsula Campaign. On May 31, 1862, Smith briefly took command of the Army of Northern Virginia after Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was wounded at Seven Pines, due to his being the senior major general in Johnston's army. However, Jefferson Davis replaced him with Robert E. Lee the following day, June 1. On June 2, Smith became ill and took a leave of absence to recuperate.The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. Series 1, Volume 11 (Part III), p. 685 In late August, Smith returned and took command of the defenses around Richmond, which was expanded to become the Department of North Carolina & Southern Virginia in September. In addition, he acted as interim Confederate States Secretary of War from November 17 through November 21, 1862. He resigned his commission as a major general on February 17, 1863, and became a volunteer aide to General P. G. T. Beauregard for the rest of that year. Smith was also the superintendent of the Etowah Iron Works in 1863 until June 1, 1864, when he was commissioned a major general in the Georgia state militia and commanded its first division until the end of the war. Postbellum life Smith was paroled in Macon, Georgia, on April 20, 1865, and moved to Tennessee to become an iron manufacturer from 1866 to 1870. He moved back to his native Kentucky to become Insurance Commissioner until 1876, and then moved to New York City and began writing. Smith authored Notes on Insurance in 1870, Confederate War Papers in 1884, The Battle of Seven Pines in 1891, and Generals J. E. Johnston and G. T. Beauregard at the Battle of Manassas, July 1861 in 1892. His final work, Company \\"A,\\" Corps of Engineers, U.S.A., 1846–48, in the Mexican War, was published in 1896 after his death. In December 1894 he was one of nineteen founders of the Military Order of Foreign Wars - a military society for officers who were veterans of wars with foreign nations and their descendants.

The station is owned and operated by Relevant Radio and broadcasts its nationally syndicated Catholic talk and teaching programming. WQOF operates with 35,000 watts during the day and 5,000 watts at night. Its transmitter is off Brookville Road in Silver Spring, Maryland.Radio-Locator.com/WQOF History Fred Fiske and Gale Garnett in 1964. 1260 kHz was the original home of WOL, which signed on in 1928. WOL was the Washington affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System during radio's \\"golden age\\" and fed the Fulton Lewis Jr. nightly newscast to the network. WOL made a programming and call sign swap with AM 1450 WWDC on February 20, 1950. That landed the WWDC call letters on 1260 AM for the rest of the century. During the 1960s, radio personalities such as Jimmy Dean and Fred Fiske had programs on this station. The format was middle-of-the-road. It staked out a place in radio and music history by being the first American radio station to play a Beatles song when it aired \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" in December 1963. During the 1970s, WWDC was a moderately popular Top 40 station. In 1981, the station began to simulcast of the morning and afternoon drive shows on sister FM Rock station WWDC-FM (\\"DC101\\"), with separate shows and the same music format during other dayparts. In 1984, it broke off the simulcast completely and became an Adult Standards station. WWDC changed its call letters to WGAY in 1999, following the dropping of the long-time beautiful music format that was WGAY-FM (which became WJMO-FM and then WIHT). WGAY kept its adult standards format nonetheless until Clear Channel Communications bought the station with the AMFM merger in 2000. On April 2, 2001, the standards format was dropped, and the business news format and WWRC callsign were moved from 570 AM to 1260 AM. It thus inherited the legacy of another heritage Washington station, which had originally been on 980 AM before changing dial positions with WTEM in 1992. Still, there were difficulties finding a format for the station that was different from the other Clear Channel stations in the Washington metropolitan area. Until 2005, the station carried the business talk format, a full-time audio relay of CNN Headline News, and sports talk programming (as \\"Sports Talk 1260\\", a supplement to sister station WTEM), then switched to progressive talk and became an Air America Radio affiliate. Hosts under the station's progressive talk format included Lionel, Stephanie Miller, Ed Schultz, Bill Press, Rachel Maddow and Ron Reagan. While the progressive format suffered from low ratings (The Washington Post reported its ratings in December 2006 as being \\"an almost imperceptible audience\\"), WWRC booked a .4 rating in Summer 2008 and a .1 rating in Winter 2008. Red Zebra Broadcasting purchased WWRC, WTEM and WWRC from Clear Channel in a deal announced in 2008. On September 15, 2008, WWRC was branded as \\"Obama 1260\\" while maintaining its progressive talk format, plus news coverage from CNN and CNBC. The temporary branding was a stunt coinciding with conservative-oriented sister station WTNT (branded \\"McCain 570\\"), and was expected to last throughout the 2008 Presidential Election. While WTNT was re-branded \\"Freedom 570\\" right after the election, WWRC retained its Obama 1260 branding beyond Illinois senator Barack Obama's Presidential inauguration on January 20, 2009. In January 2009, WWRC launched its new website http://www.obama1260.com/ (the domain expired September 11, 2009). However, The Washington Post reported on February 2, 2009, that the station would be changing to a business talk format the following week (although the Ed Schultz Show was moved to sister station WTNT, he would eventually be dropped from that station's lineup). Starting on February 9, 2009, WWRC broadcast a syndicated business talk format under the brand, \\"Money 1260.\\" Chiefly an outlet for the Business Talk Radio Network, the station also carried Ray Lucia and Clark Howard. Logo as \\"1260 The Answer\\" WWRC was sold to Salem Communications in April 2010. Upon taking control on May 15 (initially via a local marketing agreement before completing its purchase on August 3), Salem relaunched the station with its conservative talk format, again reviving the \\"WRC\\" branding as \\"1260 WRC.\\" Prior to Salem's purchase of WWRC, the station aired Washington Redskins and Notre Dame football games as an affiliate station. WWRC also had carried sports broadcasts dislodged from WTEM and WTNT by schedule conflicts. In late October 2014, carried a series of promos alluding to a rebranding to occur after the 2014 midterm elections. The rebranding took place on November 4, 2014, with the station taking Salem's common major-market branding of \\"The Answer\\" as \\"1260 The Answer\\", though no personalities were shifted around or removed. On November 20, 2017, Salem moved the talk programming, \\"Answer\\" branding, and WWRC callsign to 570 AM (the former WSPZ), which they had purchased from Red Zebra Broadcasting the prior May.

A folk healer may be a highly trained person who pursues their specialties, learning by study, observation and imitation. In some cultures a healer might be considered to be a person who has inherited the \\"gift\\" of healing from his or her parent. The ability to set bones or the power to stop bleeding may be thought of as hereditary powers. Granny women Granny women are purported to be healers and midwives in Southern Appalachia and the Ozarks, claimed by a few academics as practicing from the 1880s to the 1930s. They are theorized to be usually elder women in the community and may have been the only practitioners of health care in the poor rural areas of Southern Appalachia. They are often thought not to have expected or received payment, and were respected as authorities on herbal healing and childbirth. They are mentioned by John C. Campbell in The Southern Highlander and His Homeland: White witch White witch, and good witch are qualifying terms in English used by some to distinguish practitioners of folk magic for benevolent purposes (i.e. white magic) from practitioners of malevolent witchcraft or black magic.\\"There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent.\\" Macfarlane 1970 p. 130; also Appendix 2.

Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe.

Telemundo Internacional carries a variety of programs, consisting mainly of select programs from the Telemundo national schedule. History =Origins as Telenoticias= CBS TeleNoticias logo used from 1997 to 2000. Telemundo Puerto Rico traces its history to June 1, 1993, when Telemundo Group (then owned by investment firm Reliance Capital) announced that it would launch a 24-hour Spanish-language cable news channel that would be distributed in Latin America, Spain and the United States. This service, christened Telenoticias, launched on December 1, 1994, becoming the second 24-hour news channel to serve Latin America that was headquartered in the region. Telenoticias – which broadcast its programming in Spanish and Portuguese – was operated out of Telemundo's headquarters in the Miami suburb of Hialeah, Florida. In addition to distribution on cable and satellite television, some Telenoticias programming was also carried by television stations in certain U.S. markets. From the beginning, all five of the network's owners did not maintain a smooth relationship, disagreeing on Telenoticias' management and content; ultimately, the partners opted to sell of the network. In late June 1996, the companies sold Telenoticias to CBS, marking the company's first cable television venture since it ran the short- lived arts-oriented network CBS Cable (which it eventually named its new cable division) in the early 1980s. Following the closure of the CBS purchase, the network was rebranded CBS Telenoticias on January 1, 1997. As part of the sale agreement, Telemundo entered into an agreement to outsource production responsibilities for the Telemundo network's national news program, Noticiero Telemundo. The network also began utilizing resources from CBS Newspath to provide story content to supplement the newscasts. The network expanded its distribution into the United States in the fall of 1997, at the same time as it expanded to Brazil. The network gained a major coup early on, when it reached an agreement with Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão to produce Jornal do SBT and share its content resources, but it faced difficulties getting cable carriage and with the satellite intended to carry its feed. During the first quarter of 1998 alone, Telenoticias and fellow CBS Cable-owned channel Eye on People lost a combined $9 million in revenue. In late 1998, CBS sold a 70% interest in the channel to Mexican-based Grupo Medcom, a concern operated by the Serna family; under the deal, CBS continued to provide news content resources through CBS Newspath. Financial problems ultimately trickled into Telenoticias' operations, and by early August 1999, the network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. CBS sold its stake in Telenoticias to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Liberty Media in February 2000 for $2.35 million; the deal was approved in federal bankruptcy court, placing Telenoticias back under the auspices of Telemundo, which Sony and Liberty acquired months after Telenoticias' sale to CBS. =Reformatting as Telemundo Internacional= In September 2000, the network changed its name to Telemundo Internacional, abandoning its original focus as a news channel to convert into a bilingual general entertainment network. At that time, the rebranded network began airing programs from the Telemundo broadcast network and later, its sister cable channel mun2; it also carried some shows produced by the Telemundo Internacional production division, such as the talk shows Hoy en América (\\"Today in America\\") and América en vivo (\\"America Live\\") as well as four daily newscasts – some of which were rebroadcast on Telemundo, including a Mexico City-based late-night program Noticiero Telemundo Internacional (which ran on the Telemundo network until its cancellation in 2011, and aired as a substitute for local newscasts on some of the network's broadcast affiliates). Senior anchor Marian de la Fuente was the last anchor to also serve as the managing editor for its news operation. In 2005, Telemundo reduced news programming on the cable network and dropped the mun2 shows; it then began to air some older telenovelas produced by Colombian production company RTI, which maintained a content partnership with Telemundo that included co-production agreements for some telenovelas seen on the broadcast network. Programming Telemundo Internacional programming slate relies primarily on a variety of programming from the main Telemundo network schedule, consisting mainly of telenovelas, sports, talk and variety series and feature films. Telemundo Internacional does not carry any traditional advertising; breaks within programs consist largely of public service announcements (which comprise 90% of breaks), along with promotions for Telemundo Internacional programs (which make up 5% of the breaks).

The aim of the Conference was to extend the existing limits on naval construction which had been agreed in the Washington Naval Treaty. The Washington Treaty had limited the construction of battleships and aircraft carriers, but had not limited the construction of cruisers, destroyers or submarines. Background In February 1927, President Calvin Coolidge issued a call to the Big Five Powers to meet in Geneva to confront the issue of naval rivalries, as a result of discussions about naval arms limitations at League of Nations disarmament meetings.Marriott, p.12 Britain and Japan accepted the invitation, but France and Italy (the other nations which had signed the Washington Treaty) declined.Potter, p.234 The Washington Treaty had defined a ratio of 5:5:3:1.75:1.75 in the strength of capital ships (battleships and battlecruisers) between Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy respectively. The USA sought to use the Geneva conference to extend this ratio to smaller craft, allowing both Britain and themselves cruisers with a total displacement of 300,000 tons, with the Japanese allowed 180,000 tons. At the same time, the USA wanted to avoid further restrictions on the size of individual ships.Marriott, p.12 Negotiations Under the Washington Treaty, each nation was allowed to build cruisers of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying 8-inch guns. In practice this had also become a minimum figure, with navies competing to design cruisers of exactly 10,000 tons displacement. The USA's negotiating position, on which it was unwilling to compromise, was a plan to build 25 heavy cruisers of 10,000 tons displacement (250,000 tons total).Marriott, p.12-3 Britain, by contrast, was prepared to accept parity with the USA in its cruiser fleet, so long as the Royal Navy was able to maintain the very large cruiser force, if necessary of smaller and cheaper ships, which it felt was necessary to protect the long trade routes and imperial commitments of the British Empire. Britain proposed the reduction of the 10,000-ton and 8-inch limit for newly constructed cruisers. The British estimated they needed 70 cruisers totalling 560,000 tons displacement (i.e. averaging 8,000 tons each), almost twice the total tonnage of the American proposal.Marriott, p.12-3 The principal Japanese concern was to avoid a repetition of the 5:5:3 ratio. The Japanese naval staff felt that a fleet 70% the size of that of the USA was the minimum required to win a war against the USA. Since the 70% ratio had not been achieved with battleships, it was particularly important to retain it for cruisers.Evans and Peattie, p.234 However, since the British and American delegations were unable to reach agreement, Japanese objections were not crucial to the failure of the summit. In the end, the participants at the conference failed to reach a binding agreement regarding the distribution of naval tonnage. Impact The question of limitations on cruiser tonnage was raised again at the London Naval Conference of 1930, resulting in the London Naval Treaty. The London Conference succeeded where Geneva failed, with the U.S. being permitted a larger number of heavy cruisers than Britain, but Britain being permitted a larger number of light cruisers. Agreement was reached in part because the British and U.S. delegations recognized a greater shared interestPotter, p.234-5 and the need to cut government expenditure as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. These events focused minds on the need to reach an agreement.Marriott, p.13 Notes References * *Evans, David & Peattie, Mark.

It was invented around 1844 by the Dutch pharmacist Petrus Jacobus Kipp and widely used in chemical laboratories and for demonstrations in schools into the second half of the 20th century. It later fell out of use, at least in laboratories, because most gases then became available in small gas cylinders. These industrial gases are much purer and drier than those initially obtained from a Kipp apparatus without further processing. Design and operation The apparatus is usually made of glass, or sometimes of polyethylene, and consists of three vertically stacked chambers, roughly resembling a snowman. The upper chamber extends downward as a tube that passes through the middle chamber into the lower chamber. There is no direct path between the middle and upper chambers, but the middle chamber is separated from the lower chamber by a retention plate, such as a conical piece of glass with small holes, which permits the passage of liquid and gas. The solid material (e.g., iron sulfide) is placed into the middle chamber in lumps sufficiently large to avoid falling through the retention plate. The liquid, such as an acid, is poured into the top chamber. Although the acid is free to flow down through the tube into the bottom chamber, it is prevented from rising there by the pressure of the gas contained above it, which is able to leave the apparatus only by a stopcock near the top of the middle chamber. This stopcock may be opened, initially to permit the air to leave the apparatus, allowing the liquid in the bottom chamber to rise through the retention plate into the middle chamber and react with the solid material. Gas is evolved from this reaction, which may be drawn off through the stopcock as desired. When the stopcock is closed, the pressure of the evolved gas in the middle chamber rises and pushes the acid back down into the bottom chamber, until it is not in contact with the solid material anymore. At that point the chemical reaction comes to a stop, until the stopcock is opened again and more gas is drawn off. Kipp generators only work properly in the described manner if the solid material is insoluble in the acid, as otherwise the dissolved material would continue to evolve gas even after the level dropped. The produced gas often requires further purification and/or drying, due to content of water vapor and possibly mist if the reaction is vigorous. Examples for prepared gases and their educts For successful use in a Kipp's apparatus, the solid material has to be available in lumps large enough to stay on the retention plate without falling through its holes. *Hydrogen from zinc flakes or iron and hydrochloric acid or diluted sulfuric acid *Carbon dioxide from pieces of marble (calcium carbonate) and hydrochloric acid *Hydrogen sulfide from iron(II) sulfide and hydrochloric acid *Acetylene from calcium carbide and water *Methane from aluminium carbide and lukewarm water, deuterated methane (CD4) from aluminium carbide and heavy water *Chlorine from potassium permanganate, calcium hypochlorite, or manganese dioxide and hydrochloric acid; also from barium ferrate and hydrochloric acid *Oxygen from calcium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide with a bit of nitric acid; also from barium ferrate and dilute sulfuric acid *Ozone from barium peroxide and concentrated sulfuric acid *Nitric oxide from copper turnings and diluted nitric acid *Nitrogen dioxide from copper turnings and concentrated nitric acid *Ammonia from magnesium nitride and water, deuterated ammonia when heavy water is used; also from calcium oxide and solution of ammonium chloride *Carbon monoxide from pumice impregnated with oxalic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid *Sulfur dioxide from pumice impregnated with sodium metabisulfite (or sufficiently large pieces of sodium metabisulfite) and concentrated sulfuric acid, or from sodium hydrogen sulphite and concentrated sulfuric acid *Hydrogen chloride can be prepared from lumps of ammonium chloride and concentrated sulfuric acid Generally, weak acidic gases can be released from their metal salts by dilute acids, and sometimes just with water: * Hydrogen sulfide from metal sulfides * Hydrogen selenide from selenides, e.g. aluminium selenide * Hydrogen telluride from tellurides, e.g. aluminium telluride * Some hydrocarbons can be prepared from certain carbides  Methane from methanides  acetylene from acetylides  Methylacetylene and propadiene from sesquicarbides, e.g. magnesium carbide * Ammonia from certain nitrides, e.g. magnesium nitride * Phosphine from phosphides, e.g. calcium phosphide (often produced together with small amount of diphosphane) * Arsine from arsenides, e.g. zinc arsenide * Stibine from antimonides, e.g. magnesium antimonide * Silanes from some silicides (analogue of hydrocarbons, with number of silicon atoms corresponding to the silicide anion structure, sometimes more are produced from the same compound; e.g. silane, disilane and trisilane from decomposition of magnesium silicide) * Germanes from germanides, e.g. magnesium germanide * Stannanes from stannides, e.g. magnesium stannide * Boranes from borides (e.g. tetraborane from magnesium boride, aluminium boride, or beryllium boride and an acid) * Hydrogen fluoride can be made from concentrated sulfuric acid and e.g. calcium fluoride * Hydrogen bromide can be prepared from bromides with concentrated phosphoric acid (conc. sulfuric acid is too oxidizing) A version of the apparatus can be used for reaction between two liquid precursors. A mercury trap has to be added as a check valve, and the middle bulb is filled with an inert porous material, e.g. pumice, onto which one of the precursors is dropped.http://users.humboldt.edu/rpaselk/MuseumProject/Instruments/Kipp- Erdmann/GasCurrents.htm *Hydrogen chloride is prepared from hydrochloric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid *Hydrogen sulfide from concentrated sodium sulfide solution and diluted sulfuric acid *Sulfur dioxide from 40% solution of sodium metabisulfite and concentrated sulfuric acid *Nitric oxide from ferrous chloride in hydrochloric acid and 20% solution of sodium nitrite *Dinitrogen trioxide, aka nitrous anhydride, from 20% solution of sodium nitrite and concentrated sulfuric acid *Carbon monoxide, from concentrated formic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. Further gas treatments The prepared gas is usually impure, contaminated with fine aerosol of the reagents and water vapor. The gases may need to be filtered, washed and dried before further use. Hydrogen can be washed from sulfane, arsine and oxygen with subsequent bubbling through solutions of lead acetate, silver nitrate, and alkaline pyrogallic acid. Acidic gases (e.g. hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide) can be dried with concentrated sulfuric acid, or with phosphorus pentoxide. Basic gases (e.g. ammonia) can be dried with calcium oxide, sodium hydroxide or soda lime. Disposal of the gases can be done by burning the flammable ones (carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrocarbons), absorbing them in water (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine), or reacting them with a suitable reagent. Variants Many variants of the gas production apparatus exist. Some are suitable for production of larger amounts of gases (Gay-Lussac and Verkhovsky), some for smaller amounts (Kiryushkin, U-tube). A Döbereiner's lamp is a small modified Kipp's apparatus for production of hydrogen. The hydrogen is led over a platinum sponge catalyst, where it reacts with air oxygen, heats the catalyst and ignites from it, producing a gentle flame. It was commercialized for lighting fires and pipes. It's said that in 1820s over a million of the \\"tinderboxes\\" (\\"Feuerzeug\\") was sold.

He produced recordings of Judy Collins, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Bob Gibson, Love, Phil Ochs, Tom Rush, Judy Henske, Josh White, The Wackers and many other artists. Career Starting out as one of Elektra Records' earliest producers in 1958, he learned audio engineering working closely with label founder Jac Holzman. In Holzman's history of Elektra Follow the Music, he recalls Abramson's production work: \\"He had a natural musical and dramatic sense and absorbed the practical aspects of engineering rapidly. He was an artist himself, with an even temperament, able to get along very well with the artists, and he became a hybrid recording engineer/producer—our first.\\" In addition to music production, Abramson directed art films and promotional music shorts of Love and The Doors. Notably, the films made for The Doors' \\"Break on Through\\" and \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" were early forerunners of the music video era and were shown at live concerts. After leaving Elektra, Abramson became more involved in the visual arts, and his photography, paintings and sculpture have been exhibited in numerous galleries. In his later years, he was Program Director for Family of Woodstock in Woodstock, New York. While filming his movie and unavailable as a record producer, Judy Collins took a sabbatical, waiting for her favorite producer to return. Personal life and death Abramson was married in 1967 to Janet (Janis) Young in a small country church near Philadelphia. Together they had two sons, Ethan and Jared. His wife was a stage, movie and television actress, appearing in The Boston Strangler with Tony Curtis- as the only potential victim to survive, and in Loving, with George Segal, as his \\"adulterer partner\\". She was a regular on the NBC soap operas, Our Five Daughters and Another World. They separated in the late 1970s, and Young went on to teach in the drama department at Bennington College for about two decades. Mark Abramson died in May 2007.

He was a member of Aosdána.Aosdána: Former members. Life and works Crozier was born in Glasgow to Irish parents and educated at the Glasgow School of Art between 1949 and 1953. On graduating he spent time in Paris and Dublin before settling in London, where he gained a reputation as the 1950s equivalent of a Young British Artist through the early success and notoriety of his exhibitions of assemblages and paintings at the ICA, Drian and the Arthur Tooth galleries, with whom he had a long association. Profoundly affected by post-war existential philosophy, Crozier allied himself and his work consciously with contemporary European art throughout the 1950s and 1960s, rather than with the New York abstractionists, who were more fashionable in the UK at the time. He was also part of the artistic and literary world of 1950s Soho, a close associate of 'the Roberts', Colquhoun and MacBryde, John Minton and William Scott, and part of the expatriate middle-European and Irish intellectual circles in London of the time. Crozier spent 1963 in southern Spain with the Irish poet Anthony Cronin; this proved pivotal to Crozier's development as an artist. On his return to the UK, he began a series of skeletal paintings which anticipated the 'New Expressionist' German painters of the 1980s, and which were influenced by Crozier's visit in 1969 to Auschwitz and Belsen Based in London throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Crozier exhibited his works in London, Glasgow, Dublin and all over Europe. As many artists of the 1960s did, Crozier combined painting with teaching, first at Bath Academy of Art, (with Howard Hodgkin, Gillian Ayres and Terry Frost), then at the Central School of Art and Design (with William Turnbull and Cecil Collins), at the Studio School in New York and finally at Winchester School of Art where he led a strong centre for painting based on the European tradition. From the 1980s, Crozier's painting blossomed with a new freedom and confidence, the result of his giving up teaching and the stimulus provided by his studios in West Cork in Ireland, and in Hampshire in England. His abstract landscapes and still life painting used sumptuous colour to convey an emotional intensity. To the end of his life, he was endlessly concerned with the challenge of creating a new language in figurative painting. William Crozier represented the UK and Ireland overseas, and was awarded the Premio Lissone in Milan in 1958 and the Oireachtas Gold medal for Painting in Dublin in 1994. In 1991 the Crawford Art Gallery Cork and the Royal Hibernian Academy curated a retrospective of his work. He was elected to Aosdana in 1992 and was elected an honorary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy. In 2005 Crozier celebrated his 75th birthday with a major exhibition in Cork to celebrate the European Capital of Culture. Here Crozier exhibited a selection of his drawing work, providing the first opportunity to see that the master of colour was also an inventive artist in black and white. He celebrated his 80th year with a large exhibition of his current work at the Flowers Galleries, while a concurrent exhibition of his painting of the 1950s and 60s at the Pyms Gallery, also in London, triggered a reappraisal of his early painting. Acquisitions of his work by the Tate Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland quickly followed. He died peacefully aged 81 at home on 12 July 2011. His funeral service was held in Wickham on 19 July 2011 and in his beloved West Cork on 19 August 2011.The Sunday Times. He left €184,870 in his will. Films Several films have been made about Crozier and his work, such as Gordon Smith's 'William Crozier' for Scottish TV (1970) and 'The Truth About a Painter' directed by Cian O hEigertaigh for RTÉ (1993). Meridian Film UK made two films centred on Crozier and his art: ‘’Charlston’ and ‘Meon Shore’ as part of the series, 'Summer Painting' in 1996, and later ‘The Frame: Jane Bown photographs William Crozier’ in 2000. Crozier contributed his hostile view of Dalí's painting \\"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\\" to an episode of the BBC documentary series, The Private Life of a Masterpiece, which analysed the painting in 2005. Exhibitions Examples of the artist's work can be seen in most major public and private collections in the British Isles, and in the National Galleries of Ireland, Canada, Poland and Australia, and the Tate Gallery in Britain among many other national collections. He is strongly represented in the corporate collections in the UK and Ireland, including BNP Paribas and British Petroleum Plc. William Crozier's work features in all current reference works on 20th century Irish and Scottish Art. Work by Crozier can be seen in the following public collections: Aberdeen Art Gallery, The Ulster Museum, City Art Gallery (Birmingham), Huddersfield Art Gallery, The European Commission (Brussels), Museum of Modern Art (Copenhagen), Crawford Municipal Gallery (Cork), Museum of Modern Art (Dallas), Irish Museum of Modern Art (Dublin), Royal Hibernian Academy (Dublin), Office of Public Works (Dublin), Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (Edinburgh), City Art Gallery (Gdańsk), Victoria and Albert Museum (London), National Gallery of Australia (Melbourne), National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa), and the National Museum (Warsaw).

It is the first seaport in the Persian Gulf. It is alternatively spelled Al-'Uqair, Uqayr, and Ogair, all Latin transliterations of the same Arabic word. It has been linked by some to the ancient city of Gerrha mentioned in Greek and Roman sources. The site was also the location of the conference at which the Uqair Protocol of 1922 was issued, which helped to establish the borders of modern Saudi Arabia. The fort sits about 50 mu northeast of the fertile oasis of Al-Hasa on the east coast of the Persian Gulf. At the ancient locale are the remains of a large fort that now marks the site of the same name. The current structure that exists is of unknown origin. It is not absolutely clear who built the fort that measures roughly 150 ft (50 m) on each side which consists of a stone rampart topped with mud brick. (The Persian Gulf in Antiquity, Vol. II, D.T. Potts, P. 56). Location Modern Uqair is 55 mu due south of Dhahran, a Saudi Aramco compound. It lies about 50 nu northeast of the fertile oasis of al-Hasa and its main city Hofuf on the western shore of the Persian Gulf, on a straight line between the oasis and the island state of Bahrain. The new Uqair–Al-Hasa road (35 mi) which was constructed recently and passes by Al-Jishah town will support the economic development of Al-Hasa oasis. Modern maps place Uqair at the harbor and shallow lagoon the fort was built next to. =Other important surrounding locations of antiquity= The location of pre-Islamic Al-Hasa is of great importance and relevance to Uqair. Artesian wells once fed \\"a series of interconnected streams and lakes draining north eastward toward the Persian Gulf above Uqair. Reports of the existence of this active ravine system can be traced back to the time of Pliny.\\" (Potts, p. 29). Evidence of this effluent has a great bearing on the exploration of the fort at Uqair and the ancient Arabian city of Gerrha. A large source of fresh water near the Persian Gulf is reason enough to create a trading port located at Uqair and to facilitate the civilization that flourished at Al-Hasa. It is well documented that the Al- Hasa region and most notably Uqair were once considered to be strong candidates for the possible lost city of Gerrha, an emporium of trade and mercantile activity dating to at least 225 BC. Other ancient civilizations flourished in the surrounding area. Across the shallow Gulf strait sixty miles to the northeast are the ancient burial mounds of what is now known to be the lost ancient civilization of Dilmun. These burial mounds estimated at more than 100,000, rest on the island of Bahrain (Looking for Dilmun, Geoffrey Bibby, p. 7). On the Arabian Peninsula, the walled city of Thaj is 80 miles north of Uqair and just 20 miles inland from another ancient Arabian oasis, Qatif. Both of these sites have been dated to at least the Hellenistic period. The Saudi island of Tarut, another rich archeological area, lies 40 miles to the east of the old port and fishing village of Jubail, which once served Thaj and Qatif, and is located about 35 miles north of Uqair. = Links to ancient Gerrha = Ancient Gerrha has been associated with several locations. The notorious shifting sands of the desert have made it difficult to locate the trading emporium, well described in general history and archeological texts. Even though Uqair is the present location of what is believed to be an Islamic fort, the whole region twenty miles north of the current structure was also referred to as Uqair, or Gerrha, long before the fort was built. The lost city of Gerrha according to Danish archeologist Geoffrey Bibby, however, \\"still awaits its discoverer.\\" (Bibby, p. 325) =Ties to Mesopotamia = Trade and commerce of early civilizations in the Persian Gulf region was both the umbilical cord to surrounding cultures and the eventual physical link that has allowed scientists and researchers to literally piece together its murky history. The greatest regional center of civilization lay only 300 miles north of Uqair at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Mesopotamia, a very fertile region north of this confluence in modern Iraq, and where Sumerian civilization began. By 3500 BC the Sumerians were living and trading beyond the Strait of Hormuz, venturing out as far as the Indus River and the Red Sea. The Sumerians were conquered by the Semitic Akkadians in 2340, becoming united under Babylon from 1792 - 1750 BC. Within the opisite ṢǒǑßǔ timeline of these dominating civilizations there existed several other cultures and dynasties; the Barbar, Seleucid, and Chaldaean - exiles from Babylonia who were among the central players of Gerrha and Uqair. Dilmun  Gerrha was preceded by the legendary Sumerian-era civilization of Dilmun (4000 - 2000 BC), which has been archeologically linked to the northern tip of Bahrain. During its zenith, the culture controlled the oceanic trading routes to the Indies and was the trading link to the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia (Area Handbook for the Persian Gulf States, 1st Edition, p. 11). To the Sumerians, Dilmun was the land of immortality and the god of Abzu. The second sea of fresh water that lay beneath the gulf and was believed to flow from the Tigris and Euphrates under the ground to present Bahrain - in the land called Enki. \\"Dilmun founded a maritime network unrivaled for its breadth by any other in the early days of man's world ... it was home of the Utunapishtim, who survived the flood, it was soapstone for figurines, alabaster for bowls, carnelian heads beads, cowries and pearls ... it was copper and lapis lazuli.\\" (\\"The Sumerian Connection\\", Jon Mandaville and Michael Grimsdale, ARAMCO World March/April 1980). Dilmun is the \\"Paradise Land, the original home of the gods, the archetypical Holy Land\\" to which the Mesopotamian hero Gilgamesh travels to in his epic journey. (Dilmun Discovered, Michael Rice, p. 7). Historical mentions of Gerrha In accounts written by his biographer Arrian, Alexander the Great mentions a planned coastal exploration of 323 BC that includes the eastern Arabian coast but does not mention Gerrha. A hundred years later, however, Eratosthenes tells of merchants from Gerrha carrying their spices and incense overland to Mesopotamia. And later Strabo quotes Artimedoros: \\"by the incense trade ... the Gerrhaei have become the richest of all the tribes and possess great quantity of wrought articles in gold and silver.\\" (Bibby, p. 317). Gerrha is described by Pliny the Elder: \\"On the Arabian shore of the Gulf one comes to the island Ichara and then the Gulf of Capeus where we find the city of Gerrha, five miles in circumference, with towers built of square blocks of salt. Fifty miles from the east lying in the interior is the region of Attene and opposite to Gerrha is the island of Tylos.\\" (Bibby, p. 318). =Wealth of Gerrha= In 200 BC a Greek grammarian named Agathrachides, who wrote a book on the Erythraean (modern Red) Sea now lost, is quoted by the Roman geographer/historian Strabo on Gerrha: \\"from their trafficking, the Gerrhaeans have become the richest of all; and they have a vast equipment of both gold and silver articles, such as couches and tripods and bowls, together with drinking vessels and very costly houses; for doors and wall and ceilings are variegated with ivory and gold and silver set with precious stones.\\" (Frankincense and Myrrh, A Study of Arabian Incense Trade, Nigel Groom, p. 67). The city of Gerrha played a central role in the interchange of commodities of certain regions of the Arabian Peninsula during the reign of the Seleucid King Antioch III, (223 - 187 BC). Most notable was the frankincense and myrrh of southwestern Arabia in Yemen's Hadramawt region. The Gerrhaeans also traded with East Africa and China through India. In their activity \\"they act as the warehouse for everything from Asia and Europe ... seem more prosperous than the Sabaeans.\\" (Groom, p. 71). Trade through Gerrha was heavy in the time of Antioch; Strabo writes: \\"the leading people of this time were the Gerrhaeans, and the Arab tribe whose capital lay on the mainland just opposite Bahrain made ... enormous incomes by trading the precious wares of Arabia and India to the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris, along the upper course of the rivers by ancient caravan routes to the coast of Syria and Phoenicia even as far as Delos and the Aegean Sea.\\" (Bibby, p. 113). The lure of wealth generated in Gerrha by its inhabitants was too tempting for Antiochus to avoid. In 205 BC, he felt it necessary to make a large-scale military incursion against the Gerrhaeans with the object of securing himself a reasonable portion of their trade. (Bibby, p. 330). Antiochus was diverted from his goal of capturing the city, however, when the \\"Gerrhaeans bought off his attack with 500 talents of silver, 1000 talents of frankincense, and 200 talents of 'stacte' myrrh.\\" (Groom, p. 195).  Geoffrey Bibby and Uqair  Geoffrey Bibby, an English archeologist who excavated on the island of Bahrain from 1954 to 1969 and claimed it to be Dilmun, included Uqair, across the straits, in his investigations, visiting it on three separate journeys, in 1963 by air only, and in 1965 and in 1968 by land. Bibby wrote: \\"Tylos we knew was Bahrain...Attene, was fifty miles inland, was normally believed to be the Hofuf oasis. On the coast, in the direct line between Hofuf and Bahrain, lay the village of Uqair, and beside it the ruins of a large walled town. It had seemed obvious to many modern theorists that Uqair must be Gerrha and the identification seemed clinched by the fact that in the local dialect of the Arabic, the letter 'q' was pronounced as a 'g.' Uqair is pronounced Ogair, which is close enough to the Greek name to be convincing.\\" (Bibby, p. 318). In Bibby's quest for the city of Dilmun he managed three sondages (digs) at the city of Uqair. Of his investigation, he detailed his search for pre-Islamic clues: \\"the ruined city of Uqair stretches more vastly on the ground than it appeared from the air. I followed ... the northern wall across the subkha [Arabic term for dried salt flats] toward the shore, the ruined tower - certainly a modern addition - marked the southwestern corner ... ahead of me the wall ended at a coastal tower, but like the wall, only a course or so high ... and beyond the strait lay the mud brick houses and yellow fort of the present villages.\\" (Bibby, p. 323). Bibby details the construction of the wall and deduces that \\"the wall was built of a coral like conglomerate called farush,\\" which to Bibby \\"felt wrong because of the fluctuating level of sea water.\\" He stated; \\"If anywhere there was a subkha today there should have been water even as recently as 2000 years ago. If that were true then this wall (at Uqair) could not be as old as the wall at Thaj.\\" (Bibby, p. 324). (The walls of Thaj, another ruined city near Qatif, were built during the same period as Gerrha - the Greek period.) But as Bibby concludes ... \\"in the cities of the Greek period on Bahrain and the temple of towns of the Seleucid on Failaka (an island off the coast of Kuwait once thought to be a Hellenistic foundry of coins) farush was never used. The walls there were made of quarried limestone.\\" (Bibby, p. 324.) Northwest of Uqair, referred to as the salt mine site, or Gerrha, are the extensive remains of irrigation works and fields visible on aerial photographs of the area, some of which may be dated to the Hellenistic period. (Potts, p. 56-57). Bibby went to these irrigation channels to dig and search for artifacts in 1968. He excavated what he labeled the \\"subkha fort and produced several shards comparable to types known from Thaj and Hellenistic Bahrain. Identical results were obtained in a sounding carried out in a different structure. This was the so called inland fort. It measured 150 ft. (49 m) by 156 ft. (52 m) and was constructed by large stone ashlars. The contention has sometimes been made that this was the site of ancient Gerrha, but there is no evidence to support this. (Potts, p. 56-57). The site of the fort is not the same as the irrigation channels.  Portuguese influence  It is not impossible the fort at Uqair could be the result of the Portuguese domination of the Persian Gulf, which began in 1506 with the expedition of Afonso de Albuquerque. His mission was to destroy Arab trade and establish Portuguese dominance. Their oppressive influence may have completely transformed the regional power structure but they left no religious and hardly any cultural imprint, except for their cannons and ruined garrisons. (From the Trucial States to the United Arab Emirates, Frauke Heard-Bay, p. 271). Before the Portuguese, \\"wealthy city states were developed around favorably situated harbors ... inhabited mostly by Arab tribes ... to dominate the entrepot trade between India, Arab countries and Europe, which passed through Mesopotamia and the Red Sea.\\" (From the Trucial States to the United Arab Emirates, Geoffrey Frauke Heard-Bey, p. 271). The construction of Portuguese forts was common. A large structure still stands on the island of Bahrain (1521 AD) in recognition of its importance as a favorable position to assert their power and control of the Persian Gulf by way of the Straits of Hormuz. (Dilmun Discovered, Michael Rice, p. 70). The Portuguese left the Gulf in 1648 after several revolts of Arab natives attempted to regain their harbors and trade. The confusion and growing interest of the Turks (who also built forts in the region) and Persians created a situation for the Portuguese which they could not control. (The Arabian Peninsula, George Allen, p. 94).  Conference of Uqair  Lastly, Uqair was an historic meeting place of major early Arabian political importance. In 1922, prominent politicians and leaders met to discuss and from new boundaries of the growing Arab state under Ibn Saud, the new revolutionary leader who was conquering the peninsula and attempting to unite it. In attendance at the Conference of Uqair was Sir Percy Zachariah Cox of Great Britain. Representing the not yet established kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Ibn Saud himself. The purpose of the rendezvous was to harness and \\"guarantee the limits of Saudi expansion.\\" (House of Saud, David Holden/Richard Johns, p. 79). At the meeting, the delegates formed the Protocol of Uqair to define the borders between northeastern Saudi Arabia with Kuwait and Iraq. Sir Percy Cox reportedly drew a line on the map from the head of the Persian Gulf (in the east) to the Trans-Jordan frontier (in the west). It gave Ibn Saud a large chunk of territory by Kuwait ... but transferred another large slice of Ibn Saud's territory into Iraqi hands. And to meet the needs of the Bedouin tribes ... a neutral zone.\\" (The House of Saud, David Holden and Richard Johns, p. 80). Back then, Kuwait was ruled by Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber, who did not attend the meeting and was later informed of the new borders. Conclusion The history of Uqair is multi-faceted. The irrigation channels north of Uqair could be the abandoned city of Gerrha. And it is alternatively possible the lost city lay beneath the sabkha near the ruined Islamic city of Uqair. But Bibby's efforts to dig the channels and beneath the walls of Uqair proved fruitless in the search for Gerrha. (Looking for Dilmun, Geoffrey Bibby, p. 372). It is the belief of the author of this article that the fort at Uqair is of Islamic origin and constructed by Arabs in defense and in anticipation of foreign attack, that eventually arrived in form of the Portuguese. Despite the lack of conclusively identifying its original builders, Uqair stands in quiet aura as a testimony to a mysterious and diverse cultural landscape that flourished in its proximity.

Lott is mostly remembered as being one of the greatest doubles players of all time. He won the U.S. title five times with three different partners: John Hennessey in 1928; John Doeg in 1929 and 1930; and Les Stoefen in 1933 and 1934. At the U. S. championships singles in 1928, Lott beat Christian Boussus and John Doeg before losing to Frank Hunter in the semi finals. In 1931 Lott beat defending champion Doeg in the semi finals before losing to Ellsworth Vines in the final. In 1934 Lott became a touring professional, thereby giving up his amateur status and the ability to play in Grand Slam tournaments.

The name agateware is derived from the agate stone, which when sliced shows multicolored layers. This pottery technique allows for both precise and thought out patterns, and free random effects. Technique In order to avoid cracking and breaking which come along with mixing a variety of different kinds of clay, potters generally use one white or very light clay as a base. They then add colors in the form of stains or oxides. Colorant is added to the clay when it is in powder form in order to avoid blistering. 1-10% of colorant is generally applied, however it is up to the individual taste of the potter. The drying process is the most crucial part of this technique. In Japan it is called nerikomi. Further reading *Cosentino, Peter. The Encyclopedia Of Pottery Techniques.

Prior to his arrest, the media nicknamed the unidentified killer \\"the Beast of Birkenshaw\\". Manuel was hanged at Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison; he was the second to last prisoner to die on the Barlinnie gallows. Early life Peter Manuel was born to Scottish parents in New York City; the family moved to Detroit, Michigan before migrating back to Scotland in 1932, this time to Birkenshaw, Lanarkshire. During his childhood, Manuel was bullied. By the age of ten, he was known to the local police as a petty thief. At the age of 16, he committed a string of sexual attacks that resulted in his serving nine years in Peterhead Prison. In 1955, he successfully conducted his own defence on a rape charge at Airdrie Sheriff Court. Murders Manuel was convicted in 1958 of the murders of seven people. One case against him was thrown out of court; another, committed in England, was attributed to him. Anne Kneilands (17): On 2 January 1956, Kneilands was stalked at the (now removed) East Kilbride golf course in the Calderwood area, where she was raped and bludgeoned to death with a length of iron. Although the police questioned him about the murder and he would confess to it two years later, Manuel escaped arrest when his father gave him an alibi. He was charged with this murder in 1958, but the case was dropped because of insufficient evidence. Marion Watt (45), Vivienne Watt (16) and Margaret Brown (41): Marion, her daughter Vivienne, and her sister Margaret were shot dead in their home in Burnside, Lanarkshire on 17 September 1956. At the time of the murders, Manuel was out on bail for housebreaking at a nearby colliery and officers in charge of the manhunt for the Watts' killer suspected him. However, for a time the main suspect was Marion's husband, William, who had been on a fishing holiday in Ardrishaig, but was suspected of driving around 90 miles through the night, faking a break-in to his own house, murdering his family, and driving back. The ferryman on the Renfrew Ferry claimed to have seen him on the ferry during the night (although this was not the most direct route) and a motorist claimed to have passed him on Loch Lomondside. Both witnesses picked him out at an identity parade. William Watt was arrested and held on remand in Barlinnie Prison, then released two months later, after the police realised that they could not make the case against him stick, and the ferryman seemed confused about what type of car he had driven. The police did not find any serious motive which might have led Watt to murder his family, although it emerged that he had a number of affairs during his marriage. Police frogmen searched the Crinan Canal next to the hotel where Watt had stayed, looking for a murder weapon and bloodstained clothing, but the weapon was in another stretch of water further south. It was established that the level of petrol in Watt's car had not fallen during his alleged overnight drive, so the police questioned petrol stations along the route to see if he had refuelled, and even speculated that he might have had a secret cache of petrol, and searched the route for it. William Watt remained the main suspect until the Smart family murder just a few miles away, when the police realised that there was a serial killer on the loose. At Manuel's trial, the defence argued that Watt had committed these murders. The legal system could have come close to a miscarriage of justice in Watt's case (who would very likely have been hanged if convicted) and the evidence of these two witnesses is still not easy to explain even now. However one possible explanation is that the ferryman was a fantasist who had already seen Watt's picture in the papers, although he claimed that he had not. The other witness admitted that he did not get a clear look at Watt, but identified him based on the way he held his cigarette.Nicol Chapter 18 \\"Who Saw Watt?\\" Sydney Dunn (36): Manuel shot and killed a Newcastle upon Tyne taxi driver named Sydney Dunn, on 8 December 1957 while looking for work in Newcastle. Dunn's body was found on moorlands in Northumberland soon after, by which time Manuel had already returned to Lanarkshire. Manuel was never tried for this murder, as it took place in a different legal jurisdiction, but 17 days after he was hanged a coroner's jury concluded Manuel had murdered Dunn, after a button found in Dunn's taxi was matched to one of his jackets. This verdict has been accepted in many accounts of the case, but some doubts have been expressed. There are a few indications that the murderer might have been a local person, or he might have come off an Irish boat train which had recently arrived at Newcastle station. Two witnesses who spoke to the killer picked out Manuel at an identity parade, but these identifications are not always decisive (see the Watt case above). One of these witnesses initially said that the apparent killer had a local accent, but when it was suggested to him that the killer might have come off the Irish boat train he said that he had an Irish accent, and Manuel had a Scottish accent. Manuel definitely did attend a job interview in Newcastle two days before this murder, but it is not clear that he hung around in the area; he could have just gone home to Scotland.Nicol Chapter 22 \\"Sidney John Dunn\\" Isabelle Cooke (17): Cooke disappeared after leaving her Mount Vernon home to go to a dance at Uddingston Grammar School on 28 December 1957. Manuel stalked, raped and strangled her, and then buried her in a nearby field. He would later lead officers to the spot where he had disposed of her body. As with Dunn's murder twenty days earlier, Cooke's disappearance was not initially connected to Manuel. Peter (45), Doris (42) and Michael Smart (10): The Smarts were shot dead in their Uddingston home in the early hours of 1 January 1958. After the murders, Manuel stayed in their household for nearly a week, eating leftovers from their Hogmanay meal and even feeding the family cat, before stealing some brand new banknotes that Peter Smart had kept for a holiday, and taking the family car and dumping it nearby. Manuel gave a lift in this car to a police officer investigating Isabelle Cooke's disappearance, even telling him that he felt that the police were not looking in the right places. Arrest Although many police officers who were familiar with Manuel suspected him of carrying out these murders, they were unable to prove his guilt until shortly after they had searched the Smarts' residence and retraced their movements in the hours before their murder, when seven £5 banknotes Peter Smart was known to have withdrawn from his bank on New Year's Eve were found to be missing from his residence, and Manuel had been discovered to be using these same banknotes to pay for drinks in several east-end Glasgow pubs. After the police arrested his father, he confessed to eight of these murders (but not Dunn) and provided incriminating information only the perpetrator could have known. As panic of the epidemic of murders spread, Lanarkshire police were reinforced by detectives and officers from the Glasgow CID. On 14 January, police arrived at the Manuels' Birkenshaw residence, armed with an arrest warrant formally charging him both with the murder of the Smart family and with breaking and entering into the Uddingston home of a family named McMunn on 4 January that year. Manuel had been asleep at the time of the police's arrival; as an officer named Andrew Stuart recited the arrest warrant to his (Manuel's) father, Manuel became verbally abusive. Informed he was to be taken to Bellshill police station for further questioning, Manuel replied: \\"You haven't found anything yet. You can't take me!\\" Shortly thereafter, he voluntarily left his home in the company of the officers. At 11:10 that evening, Manuel was formally charged with murdering the Smart family, and with breaking into the McMunn residence. Trial and execution Manuel was tried for these murders in a sensational trial at the Glasgow High Court. In a move that astounded many present, he sacked his lawyers and conducted his defence by himself. At one point, William Watt was called as a witness. Recently injured in a road accident, he appeared on a stretcher. Although the judge, Lord Cameron, admitted that Manuel conducted his defence \\"with a skill that is quite remarkable\\", the killer was unable to convince the jury of his innocence and he was found guilty of all charges against him, except for that of murdering Anne Kneilands, which had been dropped due to lack of evidence. His defence in relation to the Smart killings contained some highly implausible claims, e.g. that Peter Smart had gone on a spree and killed his family and then himself, and that Peter Smart had been a friend of his who had given him keys to the Smart house.Nicol Chapter 46 \\"The Cook and Smart Charges\\", Chapter 47 \\"Manuel's Evidence – An Appraisal\\" On 11 July 1958, Manuel was hanged on the gallows at Barlinnie Prison by Harry Allen. His last words are reported to have been: \\"Turn up the radio and I'll go quietly\\". Around the time of his trial and execution, some newspapers published claims that Manuel was responsible for several other unsolved murders from the 1950s, but the evidence for this is tenuous at best, and in some cases it can be shown that he was in prison at the time.Nicol Chapter 55 \\"The Final Reckoning\\" Manuel was the third-to-last criminal to be executed in Scotland. Anthony Miller followed Manuel on to the Barlinnie gallows in December 1960, and Henry John Burnett was executed at Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen, in August 1963. In 2009, a BBC programme Inside the Mind of a Psychopath argued that the authorities colluded to ensure Manuel was hanged.BBC Radio Scotland Serial killer's voice to be heard Manuel had been arrested only eight days after the City of Glasgow CID took over the case, leading to calls for the creation of a national police force.

Mainstream microeconomic theory posits that the ultimate goal of a business is \\"to make money\\" - not in the sense of increasing the firm's stock of means of payment (which is usually kept to a necessary minimum because means of payment incur costs, i.e. interest or foregone yields), but in the sense of \\"increasing net worth\\". Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. Compare: The profit motive is a key tenet of rational choice theory, or the theory that economic agents tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. In accordance with this doctrine, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profits. As it extends beyond economics into ideology, the profit motive has been a major matter of contention.  Economics  Theoretically, when an economy is fully competitive (i.e. has no market imperfections like externalities, monopolies, information or power imbalances etc), the profit motive ensures that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, Austrian economist Henry Hazlitt explains, “If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself.\\" In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically in free and competitive markets, if an individual firm maximizes profits, it ensures that resources are not wasted. However, the market itself, should minimize profits as it is the cost to the value chain. Competition is the key tool by which markets overcome the individual firm's profit maximization incentive. The profit motive is a good of value to the economy. It is needed to provide incentive to generate efficiency and innovation. However over-remuneration of the profit motive creates profit inefficiency.  Criticisms  The majority of criticisms against the profit motive center on the idea that profits should not supersede the needs of people. Michael Moore’s film Sicko, for example, attacks the healthcare industry for its alleged emphasis on profits at the expense of patients.\\"Press Room.\\" Michaelmoore.com. Michael Moore. Web. 22 Apr. 2013. Moore explains: :We should have no talk of profit when it comes to helping people who are sick. The profit motive should be nowhere involved in this. And you know what? It’s not fair to the insurance companies either because they have a fiduciary responsibility to make as much money as they can for their shareholders. Well, the way they make more money is to deny claims or to kick people off the rolls or to not even let people on the rolls because they have a pre-existing condition. You know, all of that is wrong.Ballasy, Nicholas. \\"Michael Moore: ‘It's Absolutely a Good Thing’ for Government to Drive Private Health Insurance Out of Business.\\" Michael Moore: 'It's Absolutely a Good Thing' for Government to Drive Private Health Insurance Out of Business. CNS News, 02 Oct. 2009. Web. 22 Apr. 2013. Another common criticism of the profit motive is that it is believed to encourage selfishness and greed. Critics of the profit motive contend that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits.  Counter-criticisms  Free-market economists argue that the profit motive, coupled with competition, actually reduces the final price of an item for consumption, rather than raising it. They argue that businesses profit by selling a good at a lower price and at a greater volume than the competition. Economist Thomas Sowell uses supermarkets as an example to illustrate this point: \\"It has been estimated that a supermarket makes a clear profit of about a penny on a dollar of sales. If that sounds pretty skimpy, remember that it is collecting that penny on every dollar at several cash registers simultaneously and, in many cases, around the clock.\\"Sowell, Thomas. \\"Profit Motive Underrated By Intelligentsia.\\" Sun-sentinel.com. Sun-Sentinel, 26 Dec. 2003. Web. 22 Apr. 2013. Economist Milton Friedman has argued that greed and self-interest are universal human traits. On a 1979 episode of The Phil Donahue Show, Friedman states, \\"The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests.\\" He continues by explaining that only in capitalist countries, where individuals can pursue their own self-interest, people have been able to escape from \\"grinding poverty\\". Author and philosopher Ayn Rand defended selfishness on ethical grounds. Her nonfiction work, The Virtue of Selfishness, argues that selfishness is a moral good and not an excuse to act with disregard for others: :The Objectivist ethics holds that the actor must always be the beneficiary of his action and that man must act for his own rational self- interest. But his right to do so is derived from his nature as man and from the function of moral values in human life—and, therefore, is applicable only in the context of a rational, objectively demonstrated and validated code of moral principles which define and determine his actual self-interest. It is not a license “to do as he pleases” and it is not applicable to the altruists’ image of a “selfish” brute nor to any man motivated by irrational emotions, feelings, urges, wishes or whims.

Mawson had been inspired to lead his own venture by his experiences on Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition in 1907–1909. During its time in Antarctica, the expedition's sledging parties covered around of unexplored territory, while its ship, , navigated of unmapped coastline. Scientific activities included meteorological measurements, magnetic observations, an expansive oceanographic program, and the collection of many biological and geological samples, including the discovery of the first meteorite found in Antarctica. The expedition was the first to establish and maintain wireless contact between Antarctica and Australia. Another planned innovation – the use of an aircraft – was thwarted by an accident before the expedition sailed. The plane's fuselage was adapted to form a motorised sledge or \\"air-tractor\\", but it proved to be of very limited use. The expedition was organised into three bases: one on the sub- Antarctic Macquarie Island and two on the Antarctic mainland. The main base, under Mawson's command, was set up at Cape Denison, about west of Cape Adare, and a western base under Frank Wild was established on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, more than west of Cape Denison. Activities at both mainland bases were hampered by extreme winds, which often made outside work impossible. The expedition was marred by the deaths of two members during an attempt to reach Oates Land: Belgrave Edward Ninnis, who fell into a crevasse, and Xavier Mertz, who died on the harrowing return journey. Mawson, their sledging partner, was then forced to make an arduous solo trek back to base; in fact he was in such a deteriorated state when he arrived back at base camp that the men there to greet him did not know whether he was Ninnis, Mertz or Mawson and had to ask him his name. He missed the ship by a few hours, and had to spend an extra year at Cape Denison, along with a relief party of six who volunteered to stay behind in case any of his Far Eastern Party returned. This sojourn was made difficult by the mental breakdown of Sidney Jeffryes, the wireless operator. It turned out to be very fortunate Mawson missed the ship because he was in such bad health that the arduous sail back to Australia could have killed him, whereas by remaining at the base camp on mainland Antarctica he was afforded several months to slowly recover while the relief party looked after him. When Mawson returned from Antarctica, he was given a hero's welcome and received many honours, including a knighthood. The scientific studies provided copious, detailed data which took thirty years to completely publish and the expedition's broad exploration program laid the groundwork for Australia's later territorial claims in Antarctica. Background Douglas Mawson (1914) In January 1909, a three-man party from Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition calculated that they had reached the South Magnetic Pole. The party included a young Australian geologist, Douglas Mawson, who, inspired by his experiences, came home with thoughts of organising his own expedition. His particular interest lay not in the South Pole, but in investigating the Antarctic lands west of Cape Adare, immediately to the south of Australia. That coast had been indeterminately explored in the 1840s by the French under Dumont D'Urville and by the American Charles Wilkes, but had not been visited since. In January 1910, in London, Mawson met Robert Falcon Scott, who was then preparing his Terra Nova expedition. Mawson proposed that he should join this expedition as the head of an independent team, based at Cape Adare. Although Scott was interested, they were unable to agree on the scope of Mawson's responsibilities. Shackleton, who was in London investigating the possibility of organising and financing an expedition of his own, suggested to Mawson that he could act as its chief scientist. While Shackleton raised funds by lecturing in America, Mawson was dispatched to investigate the possibility of purchasing and developing a goldmine in Hungary. As the proposition looked doubtful, Mawson hurried across the Atlantic to brief Shackleton and to check that he was still committed to the expedition. On 16 May, Shackleton issued a statement confirming Mawson's position as chief scientist, adding that, should he (Shackleton) be unable to accompany the expedition, \\"D. Mawson will be in charge, and I shall still use my influence ... in regard to raising the necessary funds\\". With this assurance, Mawson returned to Australia. Mawson's feelings of uncertainty were renewed as months of silence followed; Shackleton was still trying to float the gold mining venture and struggling to raise funds for the expedition. Finally, on 1 December, Shackleton confirmed that he would not be going but would, as promised, give Mawson his full support.  Preparations  alt=a map showing Australia and the area of Antarctica due south of it. The labelled places outside Antarctica are Sydney, Wellington, Hobart, and Macquarie Island; and from east to west in Antarctica, Cape Adare, main base, western base, Gaussberg. = Aims = In January 1911, Mawson revealed his plans at a meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He intended to operate in the Antarctic coastal arc between Cape Adare in the east, and Gaussberg in the west. Within these bounds, Mawson said, lay territory \\"of whose outline and glacial features [only] the barest evidence has been furnished\\". A full scientific and geographical investigation of these lands would be accompanied by a ship-based oceanographic program. The AAAS responded enthusiastically. A committee was formed under the chairmanship of Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney (who had stood with Mawson at the South Magnetic Pole), and Mawson soon acquired the backing of the scientific and political communities, as well as pledges of financial support from leading industrialists. Assured that his expedition was now safely launched, Mawson travelled to London to begin practical arrangements. Mawson's original intention had been to set up his main shore base at Cape Adare and establish others further west. He felt it necessary to modify this arrangement when, in March 1911, he learned that Scott's expedition was sending a northern party to the Cape Adare region. As a consequence, he decided to place his main base well to the west of the cape, in uncharted territory. = Ship and equipment = anchored to floe-ice off the western base during the expedition In London, in search of a suitable ship, Mawson sought the help of John King Davis, to whom he offered the post of ship's master and second-in-command of the expedition. Davis had served as 's chief officer during Shackleton's recent expedition and had acted as its captain on the voyage back to England. He accepted Mawson's offer without hesitation. Mawson hoped to secure one of the new Antarctic expedition ships – Scott's , Nimrod, or William Speirs Bruce's – but none of these was available. He finally settled on , an old Dundee whaler, built in 1876 to work in northern waters. In 1884, she had participated in the rescue efforts for American Arctic explorer Adolphus Greely's Lady Franklin Bay Expedition. The ship cost £6,000, which Mawson considered a bargain. Davis supervised an extensive refit, which included alterations to her rigging and much internal reorganisation to provide appropriate accommodation, laboratories and extra storage space. The specialist equipment required for the oceanographic program included two sounding machines: a No. 1 Lucas sounder for work in depths up to , lent to the expedition by Bruce, and a lighter Kelvin machine for use in shallower depths. Mawson also acquired a small monoplane from Vickers, for both its potential utility and its considerable publicity value. The plane was shipped to Australia, where it was badly damaged during a demonstration flight, whereupon Mawson abandoned the idea of an aircraft, removing the wings and adapting the fuselage body and engine to create a motor-sledge, known as the \\"air-tractor\\". Mawson's technological interests extended to the new field of wireless telegraphy. After discussions with the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau, he decided to set up an extra base on Macquarie Island, at the midpoint between Tasmania and Antarctica, to act as a relay station for wireless messages between Antarctica and Australia. Establishing a base at Macquarie would have the additional benefit of allowing the first proper survey and scientific study of the island. = Personnel = Before returning to Australia, Mawson recruited \\"the oldest resident of Antarctica\\", the polar veteran Frank Wild, as leader of one of the proposed mainland bases. Wild had turned down an invitation to join Scott's expedition; he disliked Scott's rigidity, considering him \\"too much the navy man\\". Mawson also took on Belgrave Edward Ninnis, a 23-year-old lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers whose father, also called Belgrave Ninnis, had accompanied the British Arctic Expedition of 1875–1876. Ninnis was to take charge of the expedition's fifty sledge dogs once they arrived from Greenland, even though he had no previous experience with dogs. He was to be assisted by another novice dog handler, Xavier Guillaume Mertz, a Swiss ski-jumping champion and mountaineer, whose skiing expertise Mawson thought would be an important asset. To preserve the expedition's predominantly Australasian character, Mawson recruited his science staff from the universities of Australia and New Zealand. In key positions were Eric Webb, a 22-year-old New Zealander who became chief magnetician, and Cecil Madigan, also 22, who was appointed as the main base's meteorologist. Madigan deferred a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University for a year to join the expedition. The decision to establish a wireless relay and scientific station on Macquarie Island meant the recruitment of a further five-man team. To command the station, Mawson appointed George Ainsworth from the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau, along with two wireless technicians, a geologist and a biologist. As the expedition's photographer, Mawson was eventually persuaded to engage Frank Hurley who had offered his services for free as soon as he had heard Mawson was recruiting. = Finance = In accordance with his undertaking to support the expedition, Shackleton persuaded the press baron Lord Northcliffe to publish an appeal for funds in the Daily Mail. The appeal resulted in an immediate influx of money; more than £6,000 in two days. The British government gave £2,000, and, after a successful presentation by Mawson, the Royal Geographical Society contributed £500. All told, following the appeal, British sources provided an amount close to £10,000. In Australia, the federal government gave £5,000, and the state governments together provided £18,500. With private donations and the British money, the expedition's total funds rose to around £38,000, still some way short of its spending commitments, but enough to send it on its way. Fundraising efforts continued while the expedition was in the field. When the expedition was over and the ship and other assets had been sold off, the overall deficit, according to Mawson's accounting, was £4,462; this, he hoped, would be made up by royalties on the sale of the expedition book and from lecture fees. He estimated that a further £8,000 would be required to publish the scientific findings. The problems of meeting these financial obligations would preoccupy Mawson for many years.  Expedition history  = Voyage south = Unloading at Cape Denison, January 1912 On 28 July 1911, Aurora – her deck teeming with the 48 dogs that had survived the trip from Greenland, laden with sledges and with more than 3,000 cases of stores on board – left London for Cardiff, where she loaded 500 tons of coal briquettes. She left Cardiff on 4 August, and arrived at Queens Wharf, Hobart, on 4 November, after a three-month voyage. In a flurry of activity, additional fuel, stores and equipment were taken aboard. Mawson chartered a steamer, SS Toroa, to carry part of the burden as far as Macquarie Island. After a series of farewell ceremonies and functions, Aurora was given a tumultuous dockside send-off from Hobart on 2 December. The passage to Macquarie Island was rough: waves repeatedly overwhelmed the ship, half-drowning the dogs and soaking the men. Part of Auroras bridge was washed away, and the cargo stored above deck suffered damage. The bad weather finally abated, and they reached Macquarie Island on 13 December, where they were joined by Toroa soon afterwards. When Ainsworth's party and its equipment were established on land, Toroa returned to Hobart, and on 24 December, after carrying out survey work, Aurora sailed on south. Mawson's hopes of finding a suitable coastline to the west of Cape Adare were soon dashed. The coast remained hidden behind impenetrable ice, and the land reported by Wilkes in 1840 appeared to be non-existent. As the ship sailed further west, Mawson decided to reduce his land bases from three to two, by consolidating the proposed central base with the main base and placing Wild in charge of a single western base. On 8 January 1912, rounding a large glacier, they sailed into a gulf which Mawson later named Commonwealth Bay, and on further exploration they discovered a long sheltered inlet which they dubbed Boat Harbour. Here, a reconnaissance party found a rocky spot at a location which they named Cape Denison, after Hugh Denison, one of the expedition's early sponsors, and Mawson decided to establish the main base there. The work of unloading the ship, frequently interrupted by storms and winds, continued until 18 January. The next day, with time running short before the onset of winter, Aurora sailed away to find a suitable site for Wild's western base. = Cape Denison =  First season: winter 1912  alt=a man in polar gear leans into the face of high winds while attempting to swing an ice axe The main base quarters provided a spacious living space, , with an attached workshop and a wide verandah for storage and housing the dogs. Away from the main huts were smaller structures, used for magnetic observations. The party quickly discovered that their chosen location was an exceptionally windy spot; powerful katabatic winds swept down to the bay from the ice sheet, storms frequently pummelled the coast, and intense localised whirlwinds battered the men and equipment. Carsten Borchgrevink, wintering at Cape Adare in 1899–1900, had reported frequent wind speeds in excess of , and in one 12-hour period winds averaged above , with gusts estimated to exceed . They had unknowingly settled in one of the windiest sites in Antarctica; Mawson frequently recorded gusts between and at Cape Denison. Mawson had planned, before winter closed in, to carry out some experimental sledging work, and on 1 March, he, Madigan and Bob Bage managed a journey of , before depositing a sledge and stores and returning to the hut. For the next five months, life was largely concentrated in the hut and centred on various scientific activities. Some outside work was unavoidable; the meteorologists and the magneticians made their daily readings regardless of conditions. In rare lulls, efforts were made to erect the wireless masts and establish contact with Macquarie Island, but after repeated failures, these attempts were temporarily abandoned at the end of April. Basilisk and Ginger, two of the alt=Two large dogs with dark, heavy fur stand on snow and rock. They are chained to a crate and face the camera. The general routine of hut life was enlivened by elaborate celebrations of birthdays, often concluding with improvised concerts. When there was a shortage of birthdays, other occasions were eulogised; Mawson records that even the anniversary of the \\"First Lighting of London by Gas\\" was observed \\"with extraordinary éclat\\". Much use was made of the expedition's library, especially the books that brought, as Mawson put it, \\"the sudden breath of a world of warmth and colour, richness and vivacity\\". On 9 August, Ninnis and Mertz ventured out, to carry stores up to the five-mile depot established in March. They named this spot \\"Aladdin's Cave\\". The beginning of September saw a break in the weather, which allowed work on the wireless masts to be completed. They began transmitting to Macquarie Island but received nothing back. Several sledging journeys were possible in September before the weather closed in again; on 9 October a particularly violent wind brought the recently erected wireless masts crashing down.  Sledging, 1912–1913  = General plan = On 27 October 1912, Mawson announced his plans for the sledging season ahead. A Southern Party led by Bage would head south, towards the Magnetic Pole, making magnetic observations along the way. An Eastern Coastal Party, under Madigan, would explore and map the coastline to the east of Cape Denison. At the same time, a Western Party under Frank Bickerton would take the motorised sledge to explore the plateau to the west. The longest journey would be undertaken by a Far Eastern Party, consisting of Mertz, Ninnis and Mawson, which would take the dogs and attempt to reach Oates Land, some distant in the vicinity of Cape Adare. Other groups would form support parties for the main journeys. All parties would be required to return to base by 15 January 1913, when Aurora was expected to retrieve them. = Far Eastern Party = Mertz and Ninnis at the start of the alt=Two men in polar gear drive a sledge dog team pulling a heavily laden sledge Mawson's Far Eastern Party left on 10 November and made good distances when the weather allowed. By 14 December, they had travelled more than towards Oates Land. Shortly after noon, as Mawson paused to calculate latitude, he saw that Mertz had stopped and was looking behind him. There was no sign of Ninnis. Mawson and Mertz retraced their steps and found a crevasse about across; tracks on the far side made it clear that Ninnis, with his sledge and dogs, had fallen into the depths. Far below on a ledge, they could see the bodies of two dogs, and debris from the sledge, but no sign of Ninnis. Their remaining ropes were far too short of reaching even the first ledge which they measured to be at a depth of , so they had no option except to hope that Ninnis would answer their shouts. They spent several hours calling but – having received no response – they were forced to give him up for dead. Shocked at the sudden loss of their companion, Mawson and Mertz now had to consider their own prospects. Ninnis's sledge had been carrying most of their provisions and equipment, and all of the dog food, leaving them with about 11 or 12 days' rations. This turned out to be an incredible spot of bad luck as Mawson was traveling ahead of Ninnis with the thought being that if any sled were to be lost it would be the first sled to hit the crevasse, which was Mawson's with only about 20% of the supplies on it. Somehow Mawson had avoided the crevasse but Ninnis did not follow the same path as Mawson and fell to his death, taking approximately 80% of their supplies with him. To reach base, they would have to augment these meagre supplies by shooting and eating the surviving dogs. They travelled steadily over the next days, despite Mawson suffering from snow-blindness; by 25 December, they calculated that they were from Cape Denison. On 29 December, they killed the last of the dogs. Both men had been feeling unwell, but from New Year's Day 1913 there was a sudden and rapid deterioration in Mertz's health; he had frostbite and became delirious and agitated. After a weather delay, they resumed their journey on the evening of 3 January, but they did not get far before the weather and Mertz's frostbite forced them to stop. They laid up until 3 January when Mertz agreed to push on, but his condition continued to worsen, and though Mawson managed to drag him on the sledge they could not cover much ground. Mertz died early on 8 January. Mawson was around from the base, which was, he observed, a relatively short distance for a healthy man, but a long way for one weak and famished. After burying Mertz and marking his grave, Mawson prepared for the journey ahead. To lighten his burden, he used a small pocket tool to cut his sledge in half. On 11 January, the weather cleared, and he set out. His extreme weakness and, in particular, the condition of his feet, meant he could not travel great distances. On 17 January, he fell into a crevasse and hung there by a rope from the sledge, which fortunately did not fall. It took him more than four hours to extricate himself. As he drew nearer to the base, he was frustratingly delayed by more bad weather. On 29 January he discovered a cairn, left by a search party, with food and a message telling him he was from Aladdin's Cave. Three days later, Mawson reached the cave, where he discovered more provisions, but something that was missing from the cave was extra pairs of crampons which he would need to make the final descent to the base. He had thrown his last pair of crampons away after clearing the final glacier a few days earlier knowing that there would be another pair at Aladdin's Cave. Bad weather meant he could not set out again until 8 February, but during this time he managed to make a pair of homemade crampons out of the wood from packing crates and loose nails which he then used for the final leg of his journey. As he descended the final slope towards the base, he thought he saw smoke on the horizon, which he took to be coming from the departing ship. When he arrived at the base, he found that the ship had indeed sailed, earlier that day, leaving a group of five – Bickerton, Bage, Madigan, Alfred Hodgeman and Archibald McLean – and a new wireless technician, Sidney Jeffryes, as a rescue party for the missing men. Mawson radioed the ship, asking Davis to return and pick up the party; Davis attempted to comply, and brought the ship back to Commonwealth Bay, but a severe gale prevented the ship from anchoring or launching a boat. After sitting offshore for a day and worried that with further delays, Aurora would not reach Wild's western base before being blocked by winter ice, Davis gave up and headed west, leaving the Cape Denison group to spend another year at the base. = Other sledging parties = The motorised sledge or \\"air-tractor\\" created from a damaged Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane did not prove a success. The Eastern Coastal Party under Madigan left the base on 8 November, following the coast eastwards. They continued, mapping as they went and collecting geological and biological samples, to just beyond the 150° E mark, about from the base. Near that point, they discovered a rocky headland, more than high, with a magnificent columnar structure resembling organ pipes. Madigan described this as a \\"cathedral of nature\\"; it was later named Horn Bluff, after William Horn, one of the expedition's sponsors. On their return journey, they celebrated Christmas Day as they camped on a glacier tongue, unaware that Mawson and Mertz were camped in the upper reaches of the same glacier. After completing a full coastal survey, Madigan's party returned to the base on 16 January 1913. Bage's Southern Party left Cape Denison on 10 November, and marched south in the direction of the Magnetic Pole as Webb made daily magnetic observations. They soon found that magnetic disturbances played havoc with the compass readings, and they steered by the sun, \\"a more than efficient substitute\\", Bage noted. On 21 December, they were from the base. However, their magnetic readings indicated that they were still some distance from the Magnetic Pole. To avoid the risk of missing the ship, they turned for home. The latter part of this journey was gruelling, as they missed their final food depot, and had to make a rapid dash to reach the base by 11 January. The Western Party delayed its departure until 3 December, hoping that better weather would aid the running of the motor-sledge. The machine had performed satisfactorily in trials, and it ran well initially, but out from the base, one of its cylinders began misfiring. The trouble worsened; the engine stalled suddenly, and the propeller was wrecked. The motor-sledge was abandoned, and the party continued its journey by man-hauling, travelling west across the plateau before turning for home. Their most important geological find was a meteorite, the first discovered in Antarctica.  The second season, 1913–1914  alt=A man crawls through a passageway filled with snow For the group left at Cape Denison, winter came early, confining them mostly to the hut for many months. The previous year's program of magnetic and meteorological observations was resumed, as were the routines of daily life at the base. Many of the group found they had time on their hands, and McLean, in the tradition of earlier expeditions, took advantage of this to edit and produce a magazine, the Adelie Blizzard. One major improvement on the previous year was that, from 20 February, regular wireless contact with Macquarie Island was established, which allowed the group to stay in touch with the outside world until 8 June, when strong winds once again brought down the wireless masts. The wireless operator, Jeffryes, was initially a conscientious and respected member of the group, but from mid-June, his behaviour began to deteriorate. He became moody and aggressive, challenging his hut mates to fights, mumbling to himself, developing a persecution mentality and neglecting his hygiene. This was alarming enough for the rest of the group, but when the wireless masts were re-erected early in August, Jeffryes began sending out wild messages, claiming that all the others apart from Mawson had gone insane and were trying to murder him. Bickerton began practising operating the wireless, and Mawson sent a message to Ainsworth at the Macquarie Island wireless station to censor all communications received from Jeffryes. Finally, in a period of semi-lucidity, Jeffryes asked to be relieved from his duties, and Bickerton permanently took over the wireless operator's role. As the weather was improving, Mawson decided that he would take out a final sledging party with Madigan and Hodgeman, primarily to recover equipment that had been dumped or cached during the journeys of the previous year. In this, they were largely unsuccessful. They returned to base on 12 December, and Aurora arrived the next day. They finally left Cape Denison on 24 December 1913\\\\. As they sailed away, they could see the cross, erected on high ground by Bickerton and McLean, commemorating their lost comrades, Ninnis and Mertz. = Western base = Frank Wild (left), leader of the Far Western Party, with Andrew Watson during the sledging expedition Mawson had hoped to place the western base around (and no more than ) west of Cape Denison, to make inter-base wireless communication possible. After landing the Cape Denison party in January 1912, Aurora sailed west, well beyond the mark, without finding any suitable landing spot. On 15 February, they were from Cape Denison, and in danger of being frozen in for the winter when they found a large ice shelf at 66° 21′ S, 94° 51′ E. Lacking other options, Wild investigated it as a site for the base and, despite the possibility of the ice breaking up, he decided to risk it. The base was established by 21 February, when Aurora sailed for Hobart. Wild named the ice shelf after Shackleton, whose birthday fell on 15 February. Attempts to establish wireless contact with Cape Denison failed; they were unable to erect a suitable mast and discovered that vital parts of the transmitting equipment were missing. Over the course of the next year, the party at the western base completed a busy program of work. This included two major sledging journeys east and west of the base, mapping a total of over . They also completed several depot-laying trips and an exploration of the inland plateau. They made regular meteorological, geological, magnetic and other scientific observations. Wild took a sledging party east before being halted by impassable ice. A party led by Sydney Evan Jones travelled west to reach Gaussberg, the extinct volcano discovered by Drygalski's expedition in 1902. In February 1913, the party waited anxiously for Auroras return. Lacking provisions for another year at the base, they prepared for the possibility that the ship would not arrive by building up stocks of seal and penguin meat, but to their great relief, Aurora appeared on 23 February; by that same evening the men, their equipment and their personal possessions were aboard, and the ship was on its way to Hobart. = Macquarie Island = Wireless Hill, Macquarie Island Ainsworth's party began daily meteorological observations from 1 January 1912, and the wireless station was erected on a high promontory christened Wireless Hill. By mid-February, the station had made contact with Sydney, and by 12 May, was transmitting daily weather reports to Wellington. Signals from Cape Denison were heard for the first time on 25 September. Still, the cape was unable to receive messages from Macquarie. On 20 February 1913, two-way communication with Cape Denison was finally established, and after that messages were regularly exchanged. The Macquarie party, who had been expecting to be relieved, heard in March that Cape Denison would be operational for a second season, and that the Macquarie station would therefore need to remain open until November. Mawson radioed that the supply ship could pick up any of the party who wished to leave in May, but all elected to stay. As it turned out, severe winter weather prevented supply vessels from reaching them until 20 August, by which time provisions and fuel supplies were close to exhaustion. Arthur Sawyer, who had fallen ill, was taken off the island. Aurora arrived on 29 November, when the rest of the Macquarie party was picked up, replaced by members of the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau. = Oceanographic work = Harold Hamilton hand-netting from Aurora The expedition's main oceanographic work was carried out during two cruises in 1912, and in a coastal journey in 1914, after the final relief of Cape Denison. The first cruise, May to July 1912, included investigation, southwest of Tasmania, of the supposed location of the Royal Company's Islands which had been searched for without success on numerous occasions. Aurora found no trace of them either, nor of any shelving of the seabed that might suggest sunken islands. The main sphere of oceanographic research was the sea around Macquarie Island and further northeast towards the Auckland Islands. The second cruise, in November 1912, returned to these waters. Three days out from Hobart, the depth to the seabed suddenly decreased, from the measured on the previous day to . A repeat sounding, taken in case of error, produced . Davis took this as evidence of a submerged ridge that might have been part of a land bridge connecting Australia with the Antarctic in prehistoric time. Subsequent soundings failed to substantiate this theory. After the remaining members of the Cape Denison party had been picked up in December 1913, Mawson decided that, before returning home, they would conduct a coastal and seabed survey to the west, as far as the Shackleton Ice Shelf. This task proved taxing and led to dissension between Mawson and Davis, who was by this time sleep-deprived and exhausted. Mawson noted as much in his diary: \\"I hope the strain won't tell any more on him\\". The work began on 1 January 1914, and was mostly complete by 2 February. After an arduous period in the ice, during which Davis rarely left the bridge, Aurora began the journey home.  Aftermath  Before they departed, the Denison party erected a cross in memory of Ninnis and Mertz. On 26 February 1914, Aurora reached Adelaide to an enthusiastic welcome. For the next month, Mawson was engaged in a busy round of receptions and scientific meetings, before sailing for London on 1 April, accompanied by his bride, Paquita Delprat, whom he had married the previous day. In London, he lectured to the Royal Geographical Society, visited the parents of Ninnis, and was received at Marlborough House by Alexandra, the Queen Mother, and her sister, the Dowager Empress of Russia. On 29 June, before his return to Australia, he was knighted at Buckingham Palace by King George V and was later the recipient of many further honours, including the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's medal in 1915. In Australia, Mawson faced the reality of the expedition's debts. He proposed that the Australian government should purchase Aurora and the other artefacts and equipment from the expedition for £15,000 – an amount, he reckoned, that would not only meet all outstanding debts but would finance the production of the scientific reports. The government turned him down. Instead he sold Aurora to Shackleton for a mere £3,200, for use in the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (ITAE), and hoped to settle the balance of the debt through the sales of his chronicle of the expedition, The Home of the Blizzard, and with the profits from Hurley's film and photographs. The outbreak of war later in 1914 delayed the book's publication, while the distribution of the film was hampered by contractual problems and by a shift of public attention towards the war. As a result, the scientific reports were produced piecemeal over the next 30 years, the last appearing in 1947. Many of the expedition's personnel enlisted in the armed forces when war broke out; Bage – already an officer in the Royal Australian Engineers – was killed during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, and Leslie Blake, the cartographer and geologist of the Macquarie Island party, died after being badly wounded by a shell in France in 1918. Several would return to the Antarctic: Mawson as the leader of the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) in 1929–1931; Davis, as captain of Aurora for the relief voyage for the Ross Sea party in Shackleton's expedition, and as captain of during the first stage of BANZARE; Hurley joined the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, and also signed on to BANZARE. Wild joined ITAE as well, and in 1921 he accompanied Shackleton on his final expedition, taking over as leader following Shackleton's sudden death in January 1922. Charles Harrisson, who had been a member of the Far Western Party, visited Macquarie Island in 1914, but his ship disappeared without a trace on its return voyage to Australia. Two days after arriving in Adelaide, Jeffryes took a train heading to his home in Toowoomba, but he never arrived; a month later he was found near Stawell, Victoria, wandering in the bush. He spent the next year in asylums, but after an assault on a member of staff, he was committed to a criminal asylum in Ararat, where he died in 1942. His family were highly critical of Mawson's lack of care and sympathy; they wrote him numerous letters apparently without response. In 2018, Jeffryes was finally honoured by the erection of a plaque in Ararat cemetery, near the site of his unmarked grave.  Appraisal  The expedition produced the first map of Macquarie Island. The scientific work of the expedition covered the fields of geology, biology, meteorology, terrestrial magnetism and oceanography; the vast amounts of data filled multiple reports published over a period of 30 years. These reports provided an extensive description of Antarctica's extreme weather and of its animal and plant life. This was the first expedition to successfully establish wireless contact between the Antarctic continent and the Australian mainland, through the relay station on Macquarie Island; it also provided the first studies and mapping of the island. Its eight major sledging parties travelled for a total of , while Aurora sailed along of uncharted coastline, mapping the continental shelf through 55° of longitude. Hurley's photographs and film provided a comprehensive pictorial record. Many Antarctic features bear names paying tribute to expedition members, including Cape Mawson, Mawson Coast, Mawson Peninsula, Madigan Nunatak, Mertz Glacier and Ninnis Glacier. The expedition was the first step towards Australia's later territorial claims on the Antarctic continent, and was on a greater scale than any of its predecessors in the field. Frank Hurley summed up the character of the expedition: \\"Shackleton grafted science on to exploration – Mawson added exploring to science\\". According to the historian Gordon Hayes, \\"Mawson's expedition, judged by the magnitude both of its scale and of its achievements, was the greatest and most consummate expedition that ever sailed to Antarctica.\\"  See also  * Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration References = Notes = = Citations = = Sources = Books       *  Journals and magazines  * * Websites  * Further reading    External links   Letter written by Bob Bage while preparing for the relief party Category:1911 in Antarctica Category:1912 in Antarctica Category:1913 in Antarctica Category:1914 in Antarctica Category:Antarctic expeditions Category:Australia and the Antarctic Category:Expeditions from New Zealand Category:Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration Category:New Zealand and the Antarctic ","title":"Australasian Antarctic Expedition"},{"id":"3433787","text":"Cuevas or Cueva may refer to: Places * Cueva de Ágreda, a municipality located in the province of Soria, Castile and León, Spain * Cuevas Bajas, a town and municipality in the province of Málaga, part of the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain * Cuevas de Almudén, a town in the province of Teruel, Aragón, Spain * Cuevas del Almanzora, a municipality of Almería province, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain * Cuevas del Becerro, a town and municipality in the province of Málaga, part of the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain * Cuevas del Valle, a municipality in the province of Ávila, Castile and León, Spain * Cuevas de Provanco, a municipality in the province of Segovia, Castile and León, Spain * Cuevas de San Clemente, a municipality in the province of Burgos, Castile and León, Spain * Cuevas de San Marcos, a town and municipality in the province of Málaga * Cuevas de Vera, a town in south-eastern Spain, on the right bank of the river Almanzora * Cuevas Labradas, a town in the province of Teruel, Aragón, Spain Caves * Cueva de La Pasiega, a cave in the Spanish municipality of Puente Viesgo * Cueva de las Manos, a cave in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina * Cueva de los Casares, a cave in Guadalajara, Spain * La Cueva del Indio, a cave in Puerto Rico, site of petroglyphs * Cueva de los Verdes, a cave in the Canary Islands * Cuevas de El Castillo or the Cave of El Castillo, an archaeological site within the complex of the Caverns of Monte Castillo * Cuevas de Sorbas, limestone caves in Sorbas, Almeria, Spain  Other uses  * Cueva people, an extinct indigenous people exterminated in the 16th century * La Cueva High School, a public high school located in northeast Albuquerque, New Mexico People with the surname =Athletes= * Christian Cueva, Peruvian football (soccer) player * José \\"Pipino\\" Cuevas, Mexican boxer * Juan Cuevas, an Argentinian football (soccer) forward * Nelson Cuevas, Paraguayan football (soccer) player * Pablo Cuevas, Uruguayan tennis player * William Cuevas, Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher =Artists= * Aida Cuevas, Mexican ranchera singer * Carlos Cuevas, Spanish actor * George de Cuevas, Chilean-born ballet impresario and choreographer * José Luis Cuevas, Mexican painter and sculptor * Juan Martín Cueva, Ecuadorian documentary film director * Juan de la Cueva, Spanish dramatist and poet * Beto Cuevas, the former lead singer of the now-defunct Chilean rock band, La Ley * Manuel Cuevas, a costume designer for Rock and Roll and Country and Western singers * Minerva Cuevas, a Mexican conceptual artist * Patricio Cueva Jaramillo, Ecuadorian painter and journalist * Sal Cuevas, bassist for Ray Barreto and the Fania All-Stars * Sofía Cancino de Cuevas (1897–1982), Mexican composer, pianist, opera promoter, singer and symphonic conductor =Politicians= * Alfonso de la Cueva, marqués de Bedmar, Spanish diplomat and bishop * Carlos Cueva Tamaríz, Ecuadorian politician, lawyer and professor * Fernando Cordero Cueva, Ecuadorian politician and architect * Gabriela Cuevas Barron, Mexican politician affiliated to the National Action Party (PAN) * Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva, Portuguese-born Sephardi gobernador of Nuevo León * Arlene Stringer- Cuevas (1933-2020), American politician =Other= *Altamiro de la Cueva, fictional character in a Spanish comic *Andres Cuevas, Australian engineer *Elvira Cuevas, Puerto Rican ecologist See also * Las Cuevas (disambiguation) ","title":"Cuevas"},{"id":"3433802","title":"2002 California gubernatorial election"},{"id":"3433805","text":"Eric Joseph Winston (born November 17, 1983) is a former American football offensive tackle.

Early years Winston played high school football at Robert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, where he was ranked amongst the most talented high school tight ends in the country. He played alongside fellow NFL running back Cedric Benson, and the two helped win three Texas 5A state championships. http://www.hurricanesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205558308 College career Winston chose to attend college at the University of Miami after being heavily recruited by several other schools. At Miami, Winston majored in International Finance and Marketing and played offensive tackle. He initially was set to play tight end for the Hurricanes, but made the switch before his sophomore year. Winston was widely considered one of the best offensive tackles to enter the 2006 NFL Draft. However, an anterior cruciate ligament injury during his junior year made his draft stock drop, and several draft scouting organizations expressed slight worry over the possible implications of the injury and subsequent surgery on his play. Winston was also a standout student, graduating in three years with a GPA above 3.5, and he was a 2005 All-America selection. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. Professional career =Houston Texans= Winston was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2006 NFL Draft.

No video evidence has ever been produced to support Winston's claim. In a post game interview, he claimed \\"this isn't the Roman Colosseum\\" and \\"it is hard economic times\\". He mentioned that he came to the understanding he probably won't live as long because he plays this game, but cheering over a player getting knocked out is \\"100% sickening\\". He was released by the Chiefs on March 6, 2013. =Arizona Cardinals= Winston with the Arizona Cardinals in 2013 Winston signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals on July 25, 2013. =Seattle Seahawks= Winston signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks on July 29, 2014.

He became involved in political activism as a student, joining the Black People's Convention in 1973, and the South African Students' Movement in 1974. While a member of the latter organization, he participated in the Soweto Uprising of 1976. Molefe was married to Boitumelo \\"Tumi\\" Plaatje, with whom he had four children. The couple divorced in 2003, after she alleged that he had molested his ten-year-old daughter.South African Press Association. \\"Ex-wife accuses Molefe of molesting child\\" , The Daily Dispatch, 15 March 2003.

He left the group in 1981 as a result of a dispute over the role of white Africans in the anti-apartheid movement, and the following year he became one of the \\"Council of Ten\\" within the Soweto Civic Organization, serving in that capacity until 1984.

His sentence was overturned by the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1989. Following his release from prison, Molefe became a member of the newly- legalized African National Congress. He advanced through various party offices, and then in 1994 he achieved the office of Premier of the North West Province (a new position) , an office he held until April 2004.

The species was first described by French surgeon and naturalist René Lesson in 1847. It reaches a length of and weighs . The Inca dove has an average wingspan of 28.5 cm and a max wingspan of 32 cm. It is a slender species, with a gray-brown body covered in feathers that resemble a scaled pattern. The tail is long and square and edged with white feathers that may flare out in flight.

Its range has been expanding northward and southward the past few decades Kannan, R. J. L. Jackson, and E. Brooks. 2019. History and Current Status of the Inca Dove (Columbina inca) in Arkansas. J. Arkansas Academy of Science 73: 65-71.https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3343&context;=jaas. Despite being named after the Inca Empire, this species does not occur in any of the lands that once constituted that empire. Inca doves are expanding their range in the north and south. This terrestrial species forms flocks in deserts, scrublands and cultivated areas and may also be found in urban settings where they feed upon grass seeds and take advantage of the ready availability of water from agricultural and suburban irrigation. The Inca dove has escaped or been deliberately released in the US state of Florida, but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes.  Nesting  Inca doves build their nests primarily in trees and shrubs. The average diameter is about 5 centimeters. The male gathers nesting material and presents it to the female, who also gathers some nesting material. The nest is composed of twigs, grass, weed stalks, and leaves and becomes reinforced with the brood's excrement. The nest is often used over and over, with one nest being reused 11 times.  Behavior  Inca dove looking for food in a street of Chihuahua City, during a snowy day. During winter, Inca doves roost in communal huddles in a pyramid formation that aid in heat conservation. These pyramids can contain up to 12 birds. They often flock outside their territories, with flocks going up to 100 birds.  Voice  The song, a forceful cooing rendered variously as cowl-coo or POO-pup, may be given from a tree, wire, or other open, high perch such as a television aerial.

Tilghman was a Dodge City city marshal in the early 1880s and played a role in the Kansas County Seat Wars. In 1889 he moved to Oklahoma where he acquired several properties during a series of land rushes. While serving as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma, he gained recognition for capturing the notorious outlaw Bill Doolin and helping to track and kill the other members of Doolin's gang, which made him famous as one of Oklahoma's \\"Three Guardsmen\\". Tilghman never achieved the household-word status of his close friends Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson but nevertheless remains a well-known figure of the American Old West. His memoirs were made into a 1915 film that he directed and starred in as himself. Tilghman died in 1924 at the age of 70 after being shot and killed by a corrupt prohibition agent on the streets of Cromwell, Oklahoma. Much of the fame that he has since achieved has been attributed to the efforts of his second wife, who published his biography in 1949. In 1960, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Early life William Matthew Tilghman Jr. was born on July 4, 1854, in Fort Dodge, Iowa. He was the third of six children born to William Matthew Tilghman Sr. (1820–1908) and his wife Amanda Shepherd (1830–1915).Bill Tighman's five siblings were Richard Lloyd Tilghman (1847-1900), Mary Tilghman (1851-1900), Franklin Tilghman (1856-1929), Harriet \\"Hattie\\"Tilghman (1860-1905) and Josephine \\"Josie\\" Tilghman (1861-1944). In 1857, the Tilghman family relocated to the newly created Kansas Territory and settled on a farm near Atchison. At the age of seventeen, Bill Tilghman won a contract to supply buffalo meat to the men building the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. From September 1, 1871, to April 1, 1872, Tilghman is reputed to have killed 3,300 buffalo. He would claim this was the \\"all time record\\" in later years. According to Zoe Tilghman, his second wife, he also killed two Cheyenne braves when they confronted him, as he feared they would torture him. Dodge City According to his second wife, Tilghman first became a lawman in September 1874, when he signed on as a deputy under Sheriff Charles E. Bassett (1847–1896) of Ford County, Kansas.Tilghman, Zoe A. Marshal of the Last Frontier - pp. 21–23. Despite this claim, there is no record of Tilghman serving as Bassett's deputy. Sometime during the summer of 1877, the 23-year-old Tilghman marriedThe exact date is unknown, since no wedding certificate has been found. a 16-year-old widow named Flora (Kendall) Jefferson (1861–1900).Flora F. Kendall was born in Doniphan, Kansas on May 26, 1861. She married John Jefferson (1851–1877) on April 5, 1877. He died shortly after the wedding from an unknown cause. The marriage was an unhappy one almost from the start, but nonetheless produced four children: Charles,Charles Augustus Tilghman was born on November 22, 1878. He married Ione Conklin (1884–1973), with whom he had two children. He died on March 13, 1972, at the age of 93. Dorothy,Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Tilghman was born on May 22, 1881. She married Daniel J. Norton, with whom she had three children. She died on October 20, 1973, at the age of 92. William,William Tilghman was born on April 3, 1886, in Dodge City. He died on July 29, 1952, at the age of 66. and Viona.Viona \\"Vonie\\" Tilghman was born on December 14, 1890. She married Frederick Lee Sikes (1888–1967), with whom she had a daughter. She died on July 7, 1927, at the age of 36. Early in 1877, Tilghman and Henry Garris opened the Crystal Palace Saloon in Dodge City. A local paper reported during the summer that \\"Garris and Tilghman's Crystal Palace is receiving a new front and an awning, which will tend to create a new attraction towards the never ceasing fountains of refreshment flowing within.\\"Dodge City Times, July 21, 1877. Barely a year later, during the spring of 1878, Tilghman and Garris sold the Crystal Palace Saloon.Dodge City Times, May 11, 1878. Bill Tilghman's first documented service as a lawman began on January 1, 1878, when he became a deputy under Sheriff Bat Masterson. Within a month of his appointment, Tilghman was charged with being an accessory to an attempted train robbery.Dodge City Times, February 9, 1878. On February 12, the charges against him were dropped for lack of evidence.Dodge City Times, February 16, 1878. Tilghman was again suspected of a crime two months later, on April 16, when he was arrested by Masterson on a charge of horse theft. Once again the charges were dismissed.Ford County Globe, April 23, 1878. Troubles of a different sort came up on March 8, 1879, when Masterson had to sell his deputy's Dodge City house at auction, apparently to satisfy a judgment.Dodge City Times, March 8, 1879. =City Marshal= On November 6, 1883, Patrick F. Sughrue (1844–1906) was elected sheriff of Ford County and Bill Tilghman became his deputy. During this period, Tilghman also owned a Dodge City saloon called the Oasis, which he sold to his brother Frank in early April 1884. According to a local paper, \\"William Tilghman, Esq, proprietor of the 'Oasis,' has sold out to his brother Frank, who will refit and fix up and make everything smooth and harmonious to the visitor.\\"Dodge City Democrat, April 5, 1884. Tilghman gained his first important position as a lawman on April 10, 1884, when he was appointed city marshal of Dodge City.Dodge City Times, April 17, 1884. On May 2, 1884, the citizens of Dodge presented Tilghman with a solid gold badge.Ford County Globe, May 6, 1884. In her biography of her husband, Tilghman's widow wrote that Tilghman and Assistant Marshal Ben Daniels ran \\"Mysterious\\" Dave Mather out of Dodge during late July 1885.Tilghman, Zoe A. Marshal of the Last Frontier pp. 163–165. Mather's 1992 biographer said the story does not add up for many reasons. The most obvious is that Mather was scheduled to stand trial for murder at the time, which raises the question of why Dodge City's marshal and assistant marshal would run out an indicted man rather than confine him.DeMattos, Jack. Mysterious Gunfighter: The Story of Dave Mather. College Station, TX: Creative Publishing Company, 1992 pp. 156–157. On March 9, 1886, Tilghman resigned as city marshal to tend to his ranch. The great blizzard of 1886 wiped out the livestock on many ranches in the area, including a ranch that Tilghman owned. Even after resigning as city marshal, Tilghman still held a commission as a Ford County deputy sheriff. Law enforcement duties brought him to Farmer City, Kansas on his thirty-fourth birthday – July 4, 1888 – where he shot and killed a man named Ed Prather. The local paper reported that Prather \\"made frequent threats against Wm. Tilghman, the deputy sheriff, who took all the abuse from the excited man without offering any retaliation ... in conversation with Mr. Tilghman, he became very abusive and threatened to put an end to him right there, and suiting action to his words, he threw his hand upon his revolver; but Mr. Tilghman was too quick for him and held a revolver in his face. Mr. T. ordered him three times to take his hand off his gun, and would have disarmed him if he had been near enough; but Prather sought a better position, but Tilghman pulled the trigger and Prather was a dead man. A coroner's jury ... after a thorough examination of the circumstances, returned a verdict of justifiable killing.\\" Farmer City Western Farmer, July 5, 1888. =Gray County War= In January 1889, Bill Tilghman was one of several Dodge City gunfighters involved in the Gray County War, a county seat war fought between the rival Kansas towns of Ingalls and Cimarron. During a pitched battle between the two factions, one man was killed and five were wounded. Tilghman escaped with nothing more serious than a sprained ankle. Oklahoma On April 22, 1889, the first of the celebrated Oklahoma land rushes took place. The city of Guthrie, which had not existed the day before, had an instant population of 15,000. One member of that population was Bill Tilghman, who built a commercial structure on his Oklahoma Avenue lot and used the rent from it to help re-establish himself as a rancher. For the remaining thirty-five years of his life, Tilghman was an Oklahoman. Another land rush was held on September 22, 1891, and Tilghman established a ranch. During this period, Oklahoma was suffering from the depredations of numerous outlaws, most notably Bill Doolin and his gang, the Wild Bunch. In May 1892, Tilghman was appointed a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma. He joined forces with fellow deputy marshals such as Heck Thomas, Chris Madsen, Frank Canton, and Bud Ledbetter to wage total war on the outlaws active in the territory. In the Cherokee Strip land rush of September 16, 1893, the new town of Perry, Oklahoma was created, and Bill Tilghman was appointed city marshal of Perry on October 21. Heck Thomas was hired as assistant marshal. Both Tilghman and Thomas retained their commissions as deputy U.S. marshals. Once law and order was established in Perry, Tilghman went back on the trail of the Doolin gang. A famous but completely fictitious story tells of how Tilghman entered a \\"dugout\\" on January 8, 1895. Tilghman supposedly detected the tips of several rifles pointed at him from hidden positions in the dugout. According to this story, one of the hidden outlaws attempted to shoot Tilghman in the back, but was prevented from doing so by Bill Doolin himself, who stated: \\"Bill Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back.\\" This much-repeated tale has its origin in a 1915 pamphlet which was sold in conjunction with Tilghman's motion picture The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws. In 1937, Chris Madsen, Tilghman's fellow marshal, commented on the yarn as follows: \\"I like Bill Tilghman ... but Bill, when he got into the moving picture business, had to make a record whether it was right or not ... Bill was a little inclined to be romantic.\\" Slowly but surely, the Doolin gang was all but exterminated. Chris Madsen's posse killed \\"Tulsa Jack\\" Blake on April 4, 1895; George \\"Bitter Creek\\" Newcomb and Charley Pierce were killed on May 2. Then on September 6, 1895, Tilghman and two other deputy marshals tracked down William F. \\"Little Bill\\" Raidler. After being ordered to surrender, Raidler opened fire and was brought down by a blast from Tilghman's shotgun. The outlaw survived his wounds and was sentenced to ten years. =Capture of Bill Doolin= The high point of Tilghman's career came on January 15, 1896, when he single-handedly captured Bill Doolin, the putative leader of the Wild Bunch. Tilghman trailed Doolin to the health resort in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Entering a bathhouse, he spotted Doolin seated in the lobby, though Doolin failed to recognize Tilghman, who suddenly began wrestling with the outlaw. After a brief struggle, Tilghman subdued Doolin without a shot being fired. Once Doolin was in custody, Tilghman wired U.S. Marshal Evett Dumas Nix in Guthrie, Oklahoma: \\"I have him. We will be there tomorrow. Tilghman.\\" The following day, some 2,000 people jammed the Guthrie railroad station to see Tilghman bring in Doolin. The remainder of the Doolin gang was soon killed or captured. A posse killed George \\"Red Buck\\" Waightman on March 4, 1896, and \\"Dynamite Dick\\" Clifton was rounded up shortly afterward. Tilghman's glory for capturing Bill Doolin quickly evaporated when Doolin escaped from jail on July 5, less than six months after his capture. Doolin was finally tracked down by Heck Thomas and his posse and was shot to death on August 24, 1896. Tilghman never received the reward money for Doolin's capture, which the state of Oklahoma refused to pay after Doolin escaped. The last two members of the Doolin gang were accounted for when \\"Dynamite Dick\\" Clifton was killed on November 7, 1897, followed by the death of \\"Little Dick\\" West on April 8, 1898.West had been cornered by a posse consisting of Tilghman, Heck Thomas, Albert Thomas (Heck's son), Ben Miller, Frank Rinehart and William D. Fossett. When ordered to surrender, West fired three shots from his revolver. Both Rinehart and Fossett returned fire. A coroner's jury ruled that West came to his death \\"at the hands of officer Fossett while resisting arrest.\\" Following the demise of the Wild Bunch, Tilghman, Heck Thomas, and Chris Madsen became known collectively as the \\"Three Guardsmen\\" of Oklahoma. Later years In 1899, Tilghman established the Oakland Stock Farm, which bred thoroughbred horses. Bill traveled to Kentucky for two of his studs. One of them was Chant, the winner of the 1894 Kentucky Derby. Prosperous and popular, Tilghman easily won election as sheriff of Lincoln County, Oklahoma in 1900. He was re-elected two years later. Flora Kendall Tilghman died at the age of 39 on October 12, 1900.Guthrie Leader, October 13, 1900. Bill and Flora Tilghman had had an unhappy marriage and were living apart at the time of her death. Contrary to latter-day reports, there is no evidence that they were divorced at the time. On July 15, 1903, the 49-year-old Tilghman married for a second time. The bride, Zoe Agnes Stratton (1880–1964), was 26 years younger and a graduate of the University of Oklahoma. Bill and Zoe Tilghman had three sons named Tench,Mayo Tench Tilghman was born on September 26, 1905. He married Doris Roselyn Tucker (1910–1992) on July 15, 1939. They had one daughter. He died on August 13, 1970, at the age of 64. Richard,Richard Lloyd \\"Dick\\" Tilghman was born on September 20, 1907, and died at the age of 22 on October 28, 1929. He had attempted to hold up a dice game, and suffered a fatal wound when he was shot through the liver. and Woodrow.Woodrow Wilson \\"Woodie\\" Tilghman was born on October 23, 1912. He was a career criminal who spent most of his life behind bars. He was shot and wounded in Oklahoma City during a fight with his girlfriend. He died on March 1, 1981, at the age of 68. =Politician= The 19th Democratic National Convention was held in St. Louis between July 6 and 9, 1904. Alton Brooks Parker (1852–1926) received the nomination for president. Tilghman was part of the Oklahoma delegation, and was part of a group of Democrats who journeyed to Parker's home to inform him of his nomination. While in New York, Tilghman looked up his old friend Bat Masterson, who was now a journalist working for the New York Morning Telegraph. Masterson introduced Tilghman to President Theodore Roosevelt, who defeated Alton Brooks Parker in the 1904 election. Tilghman's being a Democrat probably accounted for his failure to receive the appointment from Roosevelt that he coveted above all others – U.S. Marshal of Oklahoma. Roosevelt had offered the position to Masterson, who turned it down. For a while Roosevelt also considered Chris Madsen (who had served with the Rough Riders), but the appointment finally went to someone else. Tilghman was never in the running. President Roosevelt remained fond of Tilghman, however, and invited him to be his special guest at the inauguration of William Howard Taft as president on March 4, 1909. With his powerful political connections, Tilghman easily won election as an Oklahoma state senator in 1910. Following his term in the senate, Tilghman became chief of police in Oklahoma City on May 8, 1911. He served two years and helped rid Oklahoma City of much of its criminal element. =Movie star= Bill Tilghman posing with his Winchester rifle in a scene from the 1915 film The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws Instead of writing his memoirs, Tilghman recounted his Oklahoma adventures in cinematic form. On January 18, 1915, Tilghman, Evett Dumas Nix, and Chris Madsen formed the Eagle Film Company. Nix had the title of president, Tilghman was vice-president and treasurer, and Chris Madsen was designated as secretary. After a screenwriter, cameraman, and cast were hired, filming began on The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws. Tilghman produced with Nix and Madsen, directed with Kent, wrote with Lute P. Stover, and starred in the film as himself. Nix, Madsen, and Roy Daugherty also appeared as themselves. The film had its premier in Chandler, Oklahoma, on May 25, 1915. Tilghman took the film on the road for several years, during which he appeared on stage and gave lectures. The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws originally ran for about 96 minutes.Surviving posters and newspaper advertising for the film describe it as being \\"Complete in Six Parts\\" - meaning it contained six reels. With the hand-cranked cameras of the silent movie era, a reel of film usually ran for about 16 minutes, meaning that the six reels of Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws probably ran about 96 minutes. Today, only thirteen minutes of the film survive.The 35mm negative of the surviving 13 minutes has been preserved by the Library of Congress (AFI/Claire Conrad Collection), with video tinting approximating the original print colors. Academic Frank Richard Prassel called the film \\"a major source of popular disinformation\\", as it features staged scenes purported by the filmmakers to be real. =Death= In 1924, at the age of 70, Tilghman entered Cromwell, Oklahoma, as a special investigator. He had previously clashed there with a corrupt U.S. prohibition agent, Wiley Lynn, and confronted him on October 31 when he heard that Lynn was drunkenly discharging his gun. Tilghman attempted to take Lynn into custody without using his own pistol, and, with the help of a bystander, disarmed Lynn. However, Lynn pulled a second pistol and shot Tilghman several times; Tilghman died the following day. In a controversial trial, Lynn was acquitted of murder after pleading self-defense. Lynn was later shot and killed in a gunfight in 1932. Governor Martin E. Trapp (1877–1951) directed that Tilghman's body lie in state in the rotunda of the Oklahoma capitol building and be attended by an honor guard. Tilghman's pall bearers included Governor Trapp, former Governor J.B.A. Robertson, Oklahoma Attorney General George Short, and U.S. Marshal Alva McDonald. Tilghman was the third person ever and first police officer to have received such honors. He was buried in Chandler, Oklahoma. A park in the town is named for him. Film and television portrayals In 1956, actor Donald \\"Don\\" Kennedy (b. 1920) played \\"Deputy Bill Tillman\\" in an episode called \\"Dodge City Gets a New Marshal\\" on the syndicated television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. On February 13, 1960, actor Brad Johnson played Tilghman in an episode called \\"The Wedding Dress\\" on the syndicated television series Death Valley Days (Season 8, Episode 18). Actress Mary Webster was cast as Mrs. Tilghman. In 1981, Tilghman was portrayed by Rod Steiger (1925–2002) in Cattle Annie and Little Britches, a 97-minute film which also starred Burt Lancaster (1913–1994) as Bill Doolin. On August 22, 1999, TNT broadcast the made-for- television film You Know My Name, which starred Sam Elliott (b. 1944) as Bill Tilghman, Carolyn McCormick (b. 1959) as Zoe Tilghman, and Arliss Howard (b. 1954) as Wiley Lynn. The film was a highly fictionalized account of Tilghman's final months and death. In 2019, Tilghman is portrayed by Ken Arnold in a movie entitled Bill Tilghman and the Outlaws, also starring Robert Carradine as Frank James and Johnny Crawford as William S.

After the war, remnant troops, primarily U.S. Air Force personnel, augmented by a smaller number of coordinating and training personnel from the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps remained in Saudi Arabia under the aegis of Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA), as part of Operation Southern Watch (OSW). The United Kingdom and France also maintained a small contingent of Royal Air Force and French Air Force training personnel. Operation Southern Watch patrolled by the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain enforced the Iraqi no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991, and the country's oil exports through the shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf. In 2003, the United States withdrew remaining non-training troops or armament purchase support from Saudi Arabia, with 200 of these support personnel remaining, primarily at Eskan Village, a base which is owned by the Saudi Arabian government itself, in support of the US Military Training Mission (USMTM) in Saudi Arabia and the Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program. Overview Since Saudi Arabia houses the holiest sites in Islam (Mecca and Medina), a number of Muslims, including Bin Laden and his supporters, were outraged at the permanent presence of non-Muslim U.S., British and French military personnel. The continued presence of U.S. troops after the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia was also one of the stated motivations behind the September 11th terrorist attacks and the Khobar Towers bombing. The date of the 1998 United States embassy bombings was eight years to the day (August 7) that American troops were sent to Saudi Arabia.Plotz, David (2001) What Does Osama Bin Laden Want?, Slate Opinion polls conducted by Gallup from 2006–2008, found that many in Muslim majority countries strongly objected to U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia. 52% of Saudis agreed that removing military bases from Saudi Arabia would very significantly improve their opinion of the United States. Also, 60% of Egyptians, 39% of Jordanians, 40% of Syrians and Palestinians, 55% of Tunisians, 13% of Iranians, 29% of Turks, 40% of Lebanese, and 30% of Algerians gave that opinion, too.Opinion Briefing: U.S. Image in Middle East/North Africa, dated January 27, 2009 The U.S. had rejected the characterization of its presence as an \\"occupation\\", noting that the government of Saudi Arabia consented to the presence of troops. Withdrawal On April 29, 2003, Donald Rumsfeld announced that he would be withdrawing remaining U.S. troops from the country. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz had earlier said that the continuing large U.S. presence in the kingdom was putting American lives in danger. The announcement came one day after the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) was shifted from Prince Sultan Air Base to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Non-combat Defense assistance activities include United States Military Training Mission (USMTM) staff and the Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program (OPM-SANG) at the Eskan Village, a Saudi owned complex outside of Riyadh. U.S. officials transferred control of Prince Sultan Air Base to Saudi officials at a ceremony on August 26, 2003. The base had been home to up to 60,000 US personnel at one time.

She is painted in Measure 32/16D dazzle camouflage. USS Allentown (PF-52), a United States Navy in commission from 1944 to 1945, has thus far been the only U.S. Navy ship to be named for Allentown, Pennsylvania. She later served in the Soviet Navy as EK-9 and in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as JDS Ume (PF-9), JDS Ume (PF-289) and as YAC-14. Construction and commissioning Allentown was laid down on 23 March 1943, at the Froemming Brothers, Inc., shipyard in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1477). Launched on 3 July 1943, sponsored by Miss Joyce E. Beary, she was moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she fitted out and was commissioned on 24 March 1944, with Commander Garland W. Collins, USCG, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= Allentown departed New Orleans on 3 April 1944 bound for shakedown training at Bermuda. After about a month of training, she set a course for New York City escorting the Norwegian merchant ship SS Norden. She arrived in New York on 13 May 1944 and underwent post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Near the end of June 1944, she stood out of New York in the screen of a convoy. She arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 June 1944 and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for additional repairs. She completed repairs in mid-August 1944 and returned to New York, where she arrived on 16 August 1944. Soon thereafter, she returned to sea as a unit of Escort Division 33 in the screen of a convoy bound for the Pacific. Steaming via the Panama Canal and Bora Bora in the Society Islands, Allentown reached the northern coast of New Guinea at the end of September 1944. She then began patrol and escort duty in the New Guinea area. At the end of October 1944, she participated briefly in the occupation of the island of Morotai in the Molucca Islands. In mid-November 1944, she began escorting convoys between Hollandia, New Guinea, and Leyte in the Philippine Islands in support of the U.S. invasion there. Those duties and convoy-escort missions between the various islands of the Philippine archipelago occupied her time until early March 1945. On 9 March, Allentown joined the escort of a Ulithi-bound convoy on the first leg of her voyage back to the United States. She arrived at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, on 7 April 1945. After completing an overhaul, Allentown departed Puget Sound on 7 June 1945, bound for Kodiak in the Territory of Alaska. Earmarked for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula, a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan, Allentown joined her sister ships , , , , , , , and in getting underway from Kodiak on 13 June 1945 bound for Cold Bay, Alaska, where they arrived on 14 June 1945 to enter Project Hula. Training of Allentowns new Soviet Navy crew soon began at Cold Bay.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 25. =Soviet Navy, 1945–1949= Allentown was decommissioned on 12 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with nine of her sister ships, the first group of patrol frigates transferred to the Soviet Navy. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Allentown was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-9 in Soviet service. On 15 July 1945, EK-9 departed Cold Bay in company with nine of her sister ships - EK-1 (ex-Charlottesville), EK-2 (ex- Long Beach), EK-3 (ex-Belfast), EK-4 (ex-Machias), EK-5 (ex-San Pedro), EK-6 (ex-Glendale), EK-7 (ex-Sandusky), EK-8 (ex-Coronado), and EK-10 (ex-) - bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union. EK-9 served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 27, 39. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-9 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but on 15 October 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-9 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. =Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, 1953–1971= Reverting to her former name, Allentown remained at Yokosuka, laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, until 2 April 1953 when she was loaned to Japan. She served the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as . Ume was redesignated PF-289 on 1 September 1957. The United States struck her name from the Navy list on 1 December 1961 and transferred her to Japan on a permanent basis on 28 August 1962. Ume was reclassified as an \\"auxiliary stock craft\\" and renamed YAC-14 on 31 March 1965.

The stems are upright, 20–40 cm (rarely to 60 cm), not scaly at base, covered with bristly and some glandular hairs. The basal leaves are up to long and wide, narrowly lanceolate, gradually narrowed into a stalk, upper surface usually spotted white or pale green. The stem leaves are lanceolate or oval-lanceolate, stalkless, half- clasping the stem. The flowers are funnel-shaped, carried in short hairy cymes in spring. The corolla is 8–12 mm long, pink turning blue or violet. The fruit is a nutlet to long and broad. Chromosomes 2n=14. Three subspecies have been described, but are not accepted as distinct by the Flora Europaea. In the New Forest in England, P. longifolia shares its habitat with wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood-sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), bastard balm (Melittis melissophyllum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa), columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).

Gaudapada was the author or compiler of the ', also known as Gaudapada Karika. The text consists of four chapters (also called four books), of which Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology thereby showing it was influenced by Buddhism. However, doctrinally Gaudapada's work is Vedantin, and not Buddhist. The first three chapters of Gaudapada's text have been influential in the Advaita Vedanta tradition. Parts of the first chapter that include the Mandukya Upanishad have been considered a valid scriptural source by the Dvaita and Vishistadvaita schools of Vedanta. Dates The century in which Gaudapada lived and his life details are uncertain. Estimates vary from early 6th to 7th century CE. He is generally dated from estimates for Adi Shankara, whose teacher Govinda Bhagavatpada is presumed to be the direct disciple of Gaudapada. Shankara in some texts, refers to Gaudapada as the \\"teacher's teacher\\" who knows the tradition of the Vedānta (sampradāya-vit). Assuming how long each lived and when, Gaudapada is estimated to have lived sometime in the 7th century CE. Alternatively, states Potter, the phrase \\"teacher's teacher\\" should not be taken literally, and more in the sense of another phrase he uses for Gaudapada, namely Paramaguru (highest teacher). He may have been the guru of Sankara's teacher, but was likely a more distant guru, states Michael Comans (aka Vasudevacharya). Another estimate places him around the early 6th century.Gaudapada, Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP This estimate is based on Buddhist literature, and particularly those of scholars Bhavaviveka, Santaraksita and Kamalasila who cite Gauḍapada kārikās. Bhavaviveka was a contemporary of Dharmapala, states Karl Potter, while Chinese texts and travel accounts place Dharmapala in the mid 6th century CE. Assuming the Buddhist and Chinese records are reliable, and for Bhavaviveka to have quoted Gauḍapada kārikās, Gaudapada must have lived around 500 CE, or sometime in the first half of 6th century CE. But, it is certain that Gaudapada lived after the 4th century because he cites some Buddhist views of Nāgārjuna and Asanga, the latter of whom various accounts place in 4th century India. Mandukya Karika The Mandukya Karika is an influential Vedanta text. Above: a manuscript page (Sanskrit, Devanagari script) =Authorship= Gaudapada wrote or compiled the ', also known as the ' and as the '. Some scholars, states Karl Potter, doubt that Gaudapada Karika was written by one author. The ' is a concise explanation, in verse form, of the doctrines in Mandukya Upanishad, one of the shortest but a profound Upanishad, consisting of just 12 sentences. Even before the time of Adi Shankara, Mandukya Upanishad was considered to be a Śruti, but not one particularly important during his era. In later periods it acquired a higher value, and expressing the Upanishadic essence. The Karika, notably, presents rational arguments from dream states, infinitude and finitude, space and time, causality, disintegration, and generation in support of the advaita doctrine.See Introduction of Mandukya Upanishad with the Karika of Gaudapada and the Commentary of Shankaracharya (trans.Swami Gambhirananda.

The ' is the earliest extant systematic treatise on ,Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, , p. 239 though it is not the oldest work to present Advaita views, nor the only pre-Sankara work with the same type of teachings. According to Hajime Nakamura, not only was the Gaudapada Karika treasured in the Advaita tradition, the text was revered and highly respected in Vishistadvaita and Dvaita Vedanta schools of Hinduism as well. Gaudapada's text, adds Nakamura, was treasured but not considered a Sruti by Advaita scholars, while Ramanuja and Madhvacharya of non-Advaita schools considered its first chapter to be a Sruti. =Contents= The Gaudapadiya Karika has 215 metered verses which are divided into four chapters: # Chapter One (29 verses) — Agama, or Agama Prakarana (Traditional doctrine, includes 12 verses of the Mandukya Upanishad) # Chapter Two (38 verses) — Vaitathya Prakarana (Unreality) # Chapter Three (48 verses) — Adavaita Prakarana (Nonduality) # Chapter Four (100 verses) — Alatasanti Prakarana (The Peace of the Firebrand) Chronologically, according to Hajime Nakamura, the Buddhist texts that quote from Gaudapada Karikas imply that the Vedantic ideas in the first three chapters are of greater antiquity. Most of Chapter Three of the compilation of Gaudapada Karika was complete by 400–500 CE, states Nakamura. He estimates that most of Chapter One was complete by 300–400 CE, while Chapter Two which presupposes Chapter One can be dated to have been mostly complete after Chapter One but before Chapter Three. Most of the Chapter Four was written sometime between 400 and 600 CE. Chapter One: Traditional Doctrine (Agama) The Self resides in one's body in three forms: waking state, sleeping dreamy state and in deep sleep state, according to Potter's translation. When awake, the Self experiences the Vishva – the external objects and the visible; when dreaming, it experiences the Taijasa – the internal mind objects and what appears in the dreams; when in deep sleep, the Self experiences Prajna – the unpolarized, the fruits of the heart and bliss. The description of these states of self are similar, states Arvind Sharma, to those found in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and other ancient Hindu texts. Gaudapada presents the competing traditional theories about life in vogue, before and in his times, in Karika 6 through 9. Some claim creation is the result of the expansion of the Self, some claim it is a mere magic show, some claim the creation is from God's desire, some claim Kala (time) creates all beings. In Karika 10, the text states there is a fourth state of the Self, called Turiya, one of Advaita (nonduality), all pervading, unchanging and without Dukkha (sorrow). This fourth state of Self in Gaudapada Karika is found in chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad, which discusses the \\"four states of consciousness\\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep.PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University New York Press, , pages 32-33; Quote: \\"We can see that this story [in Chandogya Upanishad] is an anticipation of the Mandukya doctrine, (...)\\"Robert Hume, Chandogya Upanishad - Eighth Prathapaka, Seventh through Twelfth Khanda, Oxford University Press, pages 268-273 The Vishva and Taijasa state of Self – states Gaudapada – can be a source of cause and effect, the Prajna is only cause, while Turiya state is neither. It is the waking state and dream state that lead to awareness, errors and unawareness. The perceived duality of the world is Maya, when in reality there is only nonduality. Chapter One ends with the discussion of the Om and its symbolism for Brahman, and the Atman within the heart of all living beings. Chapter Two: Unreality (Vaitathya) Unreal are the dream objects during sleep, states Gaudapaada, because the one who dreams never actually goes to the places he dreams of, and because whatever situation he dreams about is something he leaves upon waking up. This is in the scripture Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad. In the same sense, the true reality is covered up for man even in his waking state, state Kaarikas 4-6 of Chapter Two, because, translates Potter, \\"any object nonexistent in the beginning and in the end is also nonexistent in the middle\\".For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, page 10-11 with footnotes When we sleep, we feel the external things we dream about are real and the internal states as unreal, but in the awakened state we realize both are unreal. In the same way, in our waking state whatever we apprehend to be real and unreal are both unreal, covering up the true reality, state Kaarikas 10–15. But this assertion leads to the obvious question, states Gaudapaada, that if both internal and external are not true reality, who is it that imagines, who apprehends them and who cognizes? Gaudapaada submits his answer as the Aatman (Self, soul).For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapaada Kaarika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, page 12 with footnotes 11-12; Quote: उभयोरपि वैतथ्यं भेदानां स्थानयोर्यदि । क एतान्बुध्यते भेदान्को वै तेषां विकल्पकः ॥ ११ ॥ कल्पयत्यात्मनाऽऽत्मानमात्मा देवः स्वमायया  स एव बुध्यते भेदानिति वेदान्तनिश्चयः ॥ १२ ॥ Gaudapaada Kaarika states that while we do grasp objects, we perceive, we think, but this does not connote the nature of reality and unreality, just like our fear of \\"a rope for a serpent in darkness\\".For Sanskrit original and an alternate translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapaada Kaarika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, page 13-14 with footnotes We construct realities, states Gaudapaada, and imagine Jivatman to be various things such as praana (breath), loka (world), deva (gods), bhoktr (enjoyer), bhojya (enjoyables), sukshma (subtle), sthula (gross), murta (material), amurta (nonmaterial) and so on.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapaada Kaarika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 15-17 with footnotes, 77-84 We imagine things in our mind, we create things in our mind, we destroy things in our mind, says Gaudapaada; yet all these things are not different from It, the Aatman (gender neutral). All such constructions create dualities in our imagination, are Maaya. The true reality, state Kaarikas 33–36, is nondual and it is Aatman. Those who have mastered and grown past all attachments, past all fear and past all anger, they are past all dualities, know their Self, have secured the nonduality within. According to Kaarikas 36–38, such wise individuals, do not care about praise from anyone, are beyond all rituals, are homeless wanderers, for they have realized the true inside them and outside; they, translates Potter, \\"remain steadfastly true to nature\\".For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapaada Kaarika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 18-19 with footnotes, 85-88 Chapter Three: Nonduality (Advaita) Gaudapada opens this chapter by criticizing devotional worship of any form, and states that this assumes that the Brahman-Atman is born. He states that the nondual Brahman-Atman (Self) can give rise to apparent duality (Jivas, individual souls), while remaining unaffected in the process. To this end he gives the analogy of space and jars. Self is like space and the Jivas are like space in jars. Just as space is enclosed in a jar, so is the Self manifested as Jivas. When the jar is destroyed the space in the jar merges into space so likewise, are the Jivas one of the Self.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 20-21 with footnotes Gaudapada states that the Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad teach this, that one's own Atman (self) is identical to the Atman in other beings, and all Atman are identical with the Brahman. While some Upanishads, acknowledges Gaudapada, imply a difference between individual soul and the Brahman, those texts are discussing the apparent distinction (duality) when one believes in apparent creation. In reality, states Gaudapada, there is no creation of souls from Brahman as they are identical.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 21-23 with footnotes We must not confuse passages meant for spiritual instruction. According to Karikas 3.17-18, Gaudapada admits that dualists disagree with this view, but the ancient texts admit duality in the context of appearances, while \\"nonduality is indeed the highest reality\\", translates Karmarkar.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 23-24 with footnotes 17 & 18 According to Karl Potter's translation of Karikas 3.33-36, an awareness that is without conceptual construction is unborn, and this is identical to the object of that awareness called Brahman. This awareness is not a metaphor, nor born, it is real. Such awareness shines forth without fear, beyond words and thought, is calm and unwavering, equanimous, and full of light.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 27-29 with footnotes This inner contactless concentration (Asparsha yoga) is difficult for most including the yogis, who see fear in what is fearlessly blissful. Such is the awareness that comes from self-reflection, understanding, giving up attachment to Dukkha (frustration) and Sukha (pleasure), where the mind rests in indescribable calmness within.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 29-31 with footnotes Chapter Four: The Peace of The Firebrand (Alatasanti) The last chapter of Gaudapada Karika has a different style than the first three, and it opens by expressing reverence for all \\"the greatest of men\\", who are like the cosmic space through their awareness of nonduality, free from self- contradictions and confusion, and who understand Dharma. Karikas 3–10 repeat some content from previous chapters, but with some word substitutions.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 32-33 with footnotes Karikas 11–13 quote the key duality premise of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, cross examines it, then asks how and why is cause eternal? The text states that the Samkhya premise \\"cause is born as its effect\\" leads to infinite regress, which is not persuasive. Gaudapada Karika then acknowledges the theory of Ajativada or non-origination of the Buddhas (Buddhists). Like Samkhya premise, the text praises and cross examines it, in three ways: first, non-origination premises makes sense when neither the point of origin nor the end of something is known, but we know the point of origin of any example of something produced and there Ajativada premise does not follow; secondly, the Ajativada premise commits the Sadhyasama fallacy of reasoning by offering examples of what is yet to be proved. Thirdly, state Karikas 29–41, neither samsara nor mukti has a beginning or end, because if something is born it must have an end, and something that is unborn has no end.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 39-41 with footnotes Karikas 45–52 state that only (Vijnana) consciousness is real, explaining it with an example of fire stick before and during the time it burns, and adding we construct and deconstruct our state of awareness.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 43-44 with footnotes Karikas 53–56 assert that there is no causation, no effects, and repeats that consciousness is the only one real thing. Everything is impermanent, nothing is eternal and everything is also without origination by nature, state Karikas 57–60.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 45-46 with footnotes Karikas 61–81 repeat text on four states from earlier chapters to re-emphasize the premises about impermanence and non-origination.For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 47-52 with footnotes Attachment to unreality causes desire, sorrow (Dukkha) and fear, while detachment leads to freeing from such states and to samadhi. There are three stages of understanding state Karikas 87–89: Laukika (ordinary. which cognizes object and subject as real), Shuddha laukika (purified ordinary, perceiving is considered real but not the objects) and Lokottara (supramundane, where neither objects nor perceiving are cognized as real).For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 53-54 with footnotes Karikas 90–100 presents Agrayana (vehicle) to knowing. The text states, \\"all dharmas are without beginning, without variety, and are consciousness only\\". Duality is for the unwise, nonduality and undifferentiated Reality is for the wise and difficult to grasp. The last Karikas of the Chapter Four add, translates Karl Potter, \\"this the Buddhas understand, the Buddha instructs us that consciousness does not reach the dharmas, yet the Buddha said nothing about either consciousness or dharmas!\\"For Sanskrit original and translation: RD Karmarkar (1953), Gaudapada Karika, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, pages 55-56 with footnotes =Relationship to Buddhism= The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question. One school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (vijñapti-mātra) and \\"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation, which is the structure of Māyā\\". Gaudapada \\"wove [both doctrines] into the philosophy of Mandukaya Upanisad, which was further developed by Shankara\\". Of particular interest is Chapter Four, in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the Buddha and the term Asparsayoga is borrowed from Buddhism. According to Murti, \\"the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Vedanta philosopher, is attempting an advaitic interpretation of Vedanta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them.\\"TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), , pages 114-115 However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavour. While the first three chapters discuss Brahman and Atman (soul, Self), Chapter Four doesn't. This, according to Murti, may be because this was authored by someone else and not Gaudapada, a position shared by Richard King. Further, state both Murti and King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three. According to Sarma, Chapter Four may well have been written by Gaudapada assuming he was fully conversant with Mahayana school's teachings, yet \\"to mistake him to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd\\". The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti: Advaitins particularly have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis. Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. Other works by Gaudapadacharya A number of additional works are attributed to Gaudapada, but their authenticity is uncertain. The attributed works are: * A bhasya on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad * A bhasya on Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad * A bhasya on Anugita * Durga Saptashati Tika — A bhasya on Devi Mahatmya * Sri Vidyaratna Sutra bhasya * Subhagodaya on Sri Vidya * Uttara Gita Bhashya Gaudapada is also credited with a commentary on Samkhyakarikas. According to Potter, the naive nature of this commentary is in sharp contrast to the depth of reflection in Gaudapada Karikas, and the commentary on Samkhyakarikas is unlikely to be one by Gaudapada. Advaita guru-paramparā Gaudapada is one of the key persons in the Advaita Vedanta. He is traditionally said to have been highly influential on Adi Shankara, one of the most important figures in Vedic philosophy.

It was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1969, mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams. Once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs, it is now a loosely connected network of individual \\"sets\\", often engaged in open warfare with one another. Its members traditionally wear blue clothing, a practice that has waned somewhat due to police crackdowns targeting gang members. Historically, members have been primarily of African American heritage. The Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States.U.S. Department of Justice, Crips. With an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008, they have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes. The Crips have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods.  History  Stanley Tookie Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1969, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were 17 years old. Williams discounted the sometimes cited founding date of 1969 in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption.Williams, Stanley Tookie; Smiley, Tavis (2007). Blue Rage, Black Redemption. Simon & Schuster. pp. xvii–xix, 91–92, 136. . Gang activity in South Central Los Angeles has its roots in a variety of factors dating to the 1950s, including post-World War II economic decline leading to joblessness and poverty, with racial segregation leading to the formation of black \\"street clubs\\" by young African American men who were excluded from organizations such as the Boy Scouts, and the waning of black nationalist organizations such as the Black Panther Party and the Black Power Movement. By 1978, there were 45 Crips gangs, called sets, in Los Angeles. They were heavily involved in the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Williams, a member of the Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and on August 9, 1979, Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips' leadership was dismantled, prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips that led nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Gangster Crips or Neighborhood Crips, waging all-out war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980, the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The gang's growth and power really took off in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets. Crips sets began distributing crack cocaine. The huge profits induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crip membership grew steadily and by the late 1980s it was one of the country's largest street gangs. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crips sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States. Etymology Some sources suggest that the original name for the alliance, \\"Cribs\\", was narrowed down from a list of many options and chosen unanimously from three final choices, over the Black Overlords and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name evolved into \\"Crips\\" when gang members began carrying around canes to display their \\"pimp\\" status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or \\"Crips\\" for short. In February 1972 the Los Angeles Times used the term. Another source suggests \\"Crips\\" may have evolved from \\"Cripplers\\", a 1970s street gang in Watts, of which Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for \\"Common Revolution In Progress\\", a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party, directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented \\"Community Revolutionary Interparty Service\\" or \\"Community Reform Interparty Service\\". In his memoir, Williams refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, writing that it \\"depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs—nothing more, nothing less.\\" Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips. A Crip gang signal Williams recalled that a blue bandana was first worn by Crips founding member Buddha, as a part of his color-coordinated clothing of blue Levi's, a blue shirt, and dark blue suspenders. A blue bandana was worn in tribute to Buddha after he was shot and killed on February 23, 1973, and the color became associated with Crips. Membership The Crips have over 800 sets with 30,000 to 35,000 members and associate members, including more than 13,000 in Los Angeles. The states with the highest estimated number of \\"Crips sets\\" are California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Members typically consist of young African American men, with some being white, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander. In 1992 the LAPD estimated 15,742 Crips in 108 sets; other source estimates were 30,000 to 35,000 in 600 sets in California. Crips have served in the United States armed forces and on bases in the United States and abroad.  Crip-on-Crip rivalries  The Crips became popular throughout southern Los Angeles as more youth gangs joined; at one point they outnumbered non-Crip gangs by 3 to 1, sparking disputes with non-Crip gangs, including the L.A. Brims, Athens Park Boys, the Bishops, The Drill Company, and the Denver Lanes. By 1971 the gang's notoriety had spread across Los Angeles. By 1971, a gang on Piru Street in Compton, California, known as the Piru Street Boys, formed and associated itself with the Crips as a set. After two years of peace, a feud began between the Pirus and the other Crip sets. It later turned violent as gang warfare ensued between former allies. This battle continued and by 1973, the Pirus wanted to end the violence and called a meeting with other gangs targeted by the Crips. After a long discussion, the Pirus broke all connections to the Crips and started an organization that would later be called the Bloods,Capozzoli, Thomas and McVey, R. Steve (1999). Kids Killing Kids: Managing Violence and Gangs in Schools. St. Lucie Press, Boca Raton, Florida, p. 72. . a street gang infamous for its rivalry with the Crips. Since then, other conflicts and feuds were started between many of the remaining Crips sets. It is a common misconception that Crips sets feud only with Bloods. In reality, they also fight each other—for example, the Rolling 60s Neighborhood Crips and 83 Gangster Crips have been rivals since 1979. In Watts, the Grape Street Crips and the PJ Watts Crips have feuded so much that the PJ Watts Crips even teamed up with a local Blood set, the Bounty Hunter Bloods, to fight the Grape Street Crips. \\"War and Peace in Watts\\" (2005-07-14). LA Weekly. Retrieved 2007-05-04. In the mid-1990s, the Hoover Crips rivalries and wars with other Crip sets caused them to become independent and drop the Crip name, calling themselves the Hoover Criminals. Alliances and rivalries = Rivalry with Bloods = The Bloods are the Crips' main rival. The Bloods initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. The rivalry started in the 1960s when Washington and other Crip members attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School. After the incident, Scott formed the Pirus, while Owens established the West Piru gang. In late 1972, several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips due to their escalating attacks joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crip gangs that later became known as Bloods. Between 1972 and 1979, the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods grew, accounting for a majority of the gang-related murders in southern Los Angeles. Members of the Bloods and Crips occasionally fight each other and are responsible for a significant portion of gang-related murders in Los Angeles. = Alliance with Folk Nation = In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many Crip gang members were being sent to various prisons across the country, an alliance was formed between the Crips and the Folk Nation in Midwest and Southern U.S. prisons. This alliance was established to protect gang members incarcerated in state and federal prison. It is strongest within the prisons, and less effective outside. The alliance between the Crips and Folks is known as \\"8-ball\\". A broken 8-ball indicates a disagreement or \\"beef\\" between Folks and Crips.  Practices  \\"BK\\" (\\"blood killer\\") graffiti, Alexandria, Virginia Some practices of Crip gang life include graffiti and substitutions and deletions of particular letters of the alphabet. The letter \\"b\\" in the word \\"blood\\" is \\"disrespected\\" among certain sets and written with a cross inside it because of its association with the enemy. The letters \\"CK\\", which stand for \\"Crip killer\\", are avoided and replaced by \\"cc\\". For example, the words \\"kick back\\" are written \\"kicc bacc\\". Many other letters are also altered due to symbolic associations.Smith, Debra; Whitmore, Kathryn F. (2006). Literacy and Advocacy in Adolescent Family, Gang, School, and Juvenile Court Communities. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . Crips traditionally refer to each other as \\"Cuzz\\", which itself is sometimes used as a moniker for Crip. \\"Crab\\" is the most disrespectful epithet to call a Crip, and can warrant fatal retaliation. Crips in prison modules in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes spoke Swahili to maintain privacy from guards and rival gangs.

Responsibility for the route rests with the Highways Agency, as it is designated as a primary route associated with the A1(M) upgrade. Route It runs in a North-northeast direction from the A59 at Bond End in Knaresborough where it is called Boroughbridge Road, through the Stockwells Estate. It exits Knaresborough just past Greengate Lane where it turns directly north, before once again resuming a northeasterly direction at a sharp bend on the junction with Farnham Lane. It passes the Knaresborough Golf Club, before going through Ferrensby Lodge, and taking another Northerly turn before reaching Ferrensby itself. Beyond Ferrensby the road is called Harrogate Road, and it continues in a more or less exact northeasterly direction from Ferrensby to Spellow Hill, near Staveley, at which point it resumes its due North direction through Minskip, before turning Northeast one final time to its former terminus at junction 48 of the A1(M), just outside Boroughbridge. From here it runs in multiplex with the A1(M) for two junctions to junction 50 at Baldersby Gate Interchange. Northwards from here it follows the line of the former northbound carriageway of the A1, save for a few deviations onto the former southbound line, to a new terminus at Leeming Junction. The A6055 continues north on the western side of the newly opened A1(M), crossing over the new route in the Killerby Hall area and then taking the route of the old A1 road past Catterick to a new junction with the A6136 road on the western side of the A1(M). It then heads north through Catterick Bridge, switching to the west side and then northward up to Scotch Corner. Going north from Scotch Corner up to Barton Interchange it is firstly on the west side before transferring to the east side via an overbridge where it takes the formation of Kneeton Lane before meeting with the B6275 just east of Barton Interchange. Work on this new section, and on the A1(M) upgrade and associated junctions was expected to be finished by the end of 2017. However, delays to the A1(M) Leeming to Barton upgrade meant the full road opened up to traffic between Catterick Bridge, Brompton-on-Swale, Scotch Corner and Barton on 26 February 2018. This was still a full month before the adjacent A1(M) motorway was fully open. Between junctions 50 and 56 (Barton), the road has an additional name of LAR, Local Access Route. The old A1(M) Before 2012 there was no section of A1 (M) motorway between the junction for the A168 and Barton, just after Scotch Corner. This is where the old A1 road was sandwiched between the sections of the A1(M). It used to be in a Primary road Dual Carriageway standard use of junctions and 'give ways'. When the A1(M) was built there was no need of it any more so it was downgraded to a secondary status ripped down to a single carriageway standard. Now it is a useful road for non-motorway traffic since it joins the road where the A1 starts again toward Scotch Corner. Safety and traffic flows The new roundabout on the newly opened A6055 junction above the A1(M) west of Catterick village. The A1(M) is below the bridge where the two cars on the left are. The stretch of road between Knaresborough and Boroughbridge has been described as \\"notorious\\" on account of its safety issues and local residents have asked for speed limits and traffic calming measures. On this section, average traffic flow per day rose from 5,397 vehicles in 2000 to 7,982 vehicles in 2014. The average volume of daily traffic at the A6055 just south of the A684 junction was 4,730 in 2013 and 6,789 in 2014. The A6055 now takes the route of the former A6136 road through Catterick Bridge and continues through the old northern junction on the A1 road and forms a Local Access Route (LAR) on the western side of the A1(M) where it joins the A6108 road just south of Scotch Corner. To necessitate these changes, and with traffic flow being heavier on the A6055, the priorities at the bridge over the River Swale in Catterick Bridge have been changed. The junction used to have a priority for traffic travelling from Catterick village to Catterick Bridge as one fork of the A6136; this was changed amidst much local opposition.

The film starred Barry Watson, Michael Rosenbaum and Harland Williams. Plot Three college friends, Dave, Adam, and Dooferwho are head of the Social Committee in a fraternity house called KOK (Kappa Omicron Kappa)are living the party lifestyle. Spence, the socially-awkward KOK President, is punishing a group of new pledges for teaching the KOK handshake to a girl, when Adam and Dave interrupt his ceremony, because they need the space for further partying, in retaliation he gets upset at them and leaves. The KOK are known for throwing heavy parties and socially discriminating against the members of the all girl sorority group DOG (Delta Omicron Gamma), who regularly protest the actions of the FSSF (Fight Sexism Support Feminism) as being rude and mean to them. The KOK in retaliation to the protests, launch plastic sex-toys at their sorority house and refuse to allow them in the KOK house. The next morning, the three are accused by the KOK President Spence, of embezzling the other fraternity brothers' tuition money. They are then run out of the house for ruining the KOK members futures. Doofer suggests that the secret video camera in Adam's room in the frat house, (which Adam uses to record having sex with the Tri Pi's and preserves as part of his Walk Of Shame collection), may show who actually stole the money. In order to infiltrate the house, the three follow Doofer's plan of dressing up as women (however rather unattractive in appearance and clothing wise) to get inside because it's ladies night and also because they have been booted from the house. They are also however unsuccessful at getting the tape as Adam's younger brother Jimmy, has moved into their room, and develops a crush on Adina (aka Adam). Then they are thrown out of the house when they are mistaken for members of DOG, which the KOK call \\"DOG-Catcher\\", where a whistle blows and the words \\"DOG CATCHER\\" is said aloud and a large net is thrown on top of them and they get tossed on the front steps of the DOG house. Soon afterwards the boys now known as Adina, Roberta and Daisy pledge the sorority house DOG and soon realize just how badly they and the KOK members have been treating the DOG members and soon grow attached to them and become close friends. They also become smarter and more understanding of what it means to be a woman as they learn about low self-esteem issues and learning how to act and look like a woman. Adam, as Adina, tries to seduce his brother Jimmy to get the tape, by giving him a date-rape drug-laced drink while Jimmy does the same. Daisy (a.k.a. Dave) was supposed to back Adam up by being his Wingman, but is falling in love with the DOG president Leah. Dave and Leah meet on the first night when Dave gets up in the middle of the night to take a shower thinking he will be alone and can shower as a man. However Leah, without her glasses and can't see so well, decides to shower as well and an awkward unsettling situation causes Daisy (Dave) to make a hasty escape back to his room. His relationship with Leah gets in the way of Adam's attempts to get the tape back. The DOG sisters end up on the KOK-Tail Cruise after they win the powder puff football game against the Tri Pis, which includes a ticket on the ship. The Tri Pi's get on the boat before the DOG girls can, saying \\"No DOGS Allowed!!\\". Doofer then \\"acquires\\" a speedboat and delivers the girls to the boat, who then \\"help\\" the Tri Pi's off the boat by grabbing them from behind and casting them adrift on a life raft. Leah dances with \\"Daisy\\", when she confesses that though it will be hard to have a lesbian relationship with Daisy, she is willing to commit if Daisy is, Leah replies with \\"That's the zinger\\". Daisy then tells Leah she is moving back to Minnesota. The two come to mutual understanding. While on the ship Dave needs to get out of his dress so he can meet with John Kloss and get a job in his company. He successfully gets John Kloss to accept his, Adam and Doofer's employment. While getting re-dressed as \\"Daisy\\" with Adam trying to help, Leah walks in and mistakenly thinks that Daisy (Dave) and Adina (Adam) are in a relationship, and the \\"Minnesota\\" excuse is fake. She storms out with Daisy following her. Doofer is looking for the tape elsewhere. Jimmy finds Adina (Adam) and asks her to dance. Afterward John Kloss grabs Leah on the butt cheek and she slaps him across the face. He then organizes another \\"DOG- Catcher\\" session to throw Leah overboard, for not being receptive to his advances. Dave, as Daisy, reveals who he is to stop them throwing her overboard, while Spence catches Doofer trying to find the tape, and Adina (Adam) shows he's male too causing a big shock to Jimmy. Both the KOK and the DOG are shocked at the situation. The KOK \\"High Council\\" is convened to determine their fate, Dave describes that he feels so sorry for the way the DOGS were treated and no longer wants to be a member of KOK. Next Dave accuses Spence of stealing the money, and Doofer produces the tape to prove it. At first the tape shows Adam having sex with the Tri-Pi but then the tape shows Spence stealing the money while saying to himself \\"I'll teach them to humiliate me\\", after seeing he is the culprit he is then thrown overboard. Later, back at the KOK house, Adam is named president of the KOK house. Afterward, he asks his brother Jimmy what happened the night they were \\"together\\" on \\"their date\\", and tries to get reassurance that \\"nothing\\" happened, which Jimmy replies \\"Right\\" but in fact something did happen. Dave meets with Leah and starts their relationship over, truthfully this time. Sometime later, the life raft with all the Tri Pi's is still floating in the ocean somewhere, far away from land. Cast Reception The film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 13% based on 64 reviews, with an average score of 3.22/10. The website's consensus reads: \\"A sloppy fratboy movie, Sorority Boys offers up a parade of gross-out gags and sex jokes, while insulting and ogling women.\\" The film barely made back its $12 million budget, grossing a worldwide total of $12,517,488.

Tulsa World Media Company is part of Lee Enterprises. The new owners announced in January 2020 that a corporate purchase was made of BH Media Group,BH Media Group a Berkshire Hathaway company controlled by Warren Buffett. The printed edition is the second-most circulated newspaper in the state, after The Oklahoman. It was founded in 1905 and locally owned by the Lorton family for almost 100 years until February 2013, when it was sold to BH Media Group. In the early 1900s, the World fought an editorial battle in favor of building a reservoir on Spavinaw Creek, in addition to opposing the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. The paper was jointly operated with the Tulsa Tribune from 1941 to 1992. History Republican activist James F. McCoy and Kansas journalist J.R. Brady published the first edition of the Tulsa World on September 14, 1905 at the time Brady was starting Tulsa World, he was also publishing the Indian Republican a weekly newspaper, which was previously edited by a con artist named Myron Boyle. Brady had bought the Indian Republican in 1905 and fired Boyle in the following year. Boyle borrowed $500 from Dr. S. G. Kennedy, ostensibly to pay some personal debts. Instead, he left town without repaying Dr. Kennedy. Brady was sufficiently successful establishing the Tulsa World that it attracted a Missouri mine owner, George Bayne, and his brother-in-law, Charles Dent, who bought and ran the paper for the next five years. In 1911, Eugene Lorton, who had just sold his stake in a Walla Walla, Washington newspaper, and moved to Tulsa, bought an interest in the Tulsa World, becoming its editor, and then, with financial backing from Harry Ford Sinclair, the sole owner and publisher in 1917. Beginning in 1915, the Tulsa World fought an editorial battle advocating a proposal to build a reservoir on Spavinaw Creek and pipe the water 55 miles to Tulsa. Charles Page was among those who opposed the Spavinaw plan; he advocated a plan in his own newspaper to sell water from the Shell Creek water system, which Page owned. Page's newspaper, the Morning News, closed in 1919 after Tulsans approved a bond issue to pipe the water from Spavinaw. He sold a companion paper, Tulsa Democrat, to Richard Lloyd Jones, who renamed it the Tulsa Tribune. In the 1920s, the Tulsa World was known for its opposition to the Ku Klux Klan, which had risen to local prominence in the wake of the Tulsa Race Riot in the spring of 1921. Lorton was active in Republican Party politics until he was defeated by William B. Pine, in the 1924 primary election for the US Senate; Pine went on to win the general election. Lorton then supported Democrats Alfred E. Smith in the 1928 Presidential election and Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936. However, Lorton refused to support Roosevelt's third term bid in 1940; he returned to the Republicans and remained a GOP supporter for the rest of his life. The Tulsa Tribune and Tulsa World entered a joint operating agreement in June 1941. Eugene Lorton died in 1949, leaving majority interest in the newspaper to his wife Maude and smaller shares to four daughters and 20 employees. Eugene's presumed successor, Robert Lorton, had died at age 24 in 1939. In the 1950s, Maude Lorton transferred one-fourth of the company to attorney Byron Boone, who became publisher in 1959. Upon her death, she left the rest of her shares to her grandson Robert. In 1964, Robert Lorton became director of the News Publishing Corporation, which oversaw the non-editorial operations of both the Tulsa Tribune and Tulsa World. In 1968, he became president of the Tulsa World and publisher upon Boone's death in 1988. The Tulsa Tribune ceased operations in 1992 and Tulsa World acquired its assets. Robert Lorton reacquired the World's outstanding shares and made the newspaper entirely family-owned once again. In May 2005, he passed the title of publisher to his son Robert E. Lorton III. During the same year, World Publishing Company had 700 employees, and was ranked as one of Oklahoma's largest employers. In February 2013, the paper announced that it would be sold to Berkshire Hathaway's BH Media Group, controlled by Warren Buffett. In 2015, BH Media bought six weekly papers and the daily Tulsa Business & Legal News from Community Publishers Inc. On April 20, 2015, four Tulsa World journalists—including two nominated for the Pulitzer Prize—suddenly resigned their jobs to accept positions at a new online-only publication launched by the former World publisher, Bobby Lorton. In 2016, the World announced it would not endorse any candidate in the 2016 election, saying that the American people had been presented with \\"the least acceptable list of candidates for president in modern times.\\" The paper had maintained its loyalty to the GOP after Eugene Lorton's death; it had endorsed the GOP standardbearer in every election since 1940. Recent developments Tulsa. In February 2013, the paper announced that it would be sold to Berkshire Hathaway's BH Media Group, controlled by Warren Buffett. Lee Enterprises announced an agreement to buy BH Media Group publications and The Buffalo News for $140 million cash on January 29, 2020. The acquisition includes the Tulsa World. As of September 2012, weekday circulation was 95,003; Saturday circulation was 104,602; and Sunday circulation was 133,066. In April 2011, the World introduced a metered model to its digital products that limits the amount of locally produced articles that a non-subscriber can view at no charge. Once viewers have opened 5 stories in 30 days, they will be asked to purchase a subscription. The home page, all section pages, classifieds and most syndicated content is unrestricted to all readers. \\"In reality, more people are engaged with our content than ever before. But it no longer seems fair to have a portion of our readers pay for our content while others do not. Therefore, like many publications, we have decided to charge a fee for our digital content. Print subscribers will continue to receive unlimited access to our digital products,\\" wrote then Publisher and CEO Robert E. Lorton III in a letter to readers In March 2008, the World closed its zoned suburban newspapers, called the \\"Community World,\\" and laid off its 18 staff members. Tulsa World laid off 28 employees in early 2009. Twenty-six newsroom employees were terminated immediately. Editors said in a memo that staff members would be challenged to produce a quality product after the layoffs, and editors asked remaining newsroom employees to take on new duties. On March 29, 2009, the World published a column by its then publisher, Robert E. Lorton III, responding to what Lorton called \\"an unusual amount of concerned correspondence in regard to the future of this company and our industry.\\" Lorton asserted that despite the difficult economy and general downward trends in the newspaper industry and the World's own staff cuts, that Tulsa World remains profitable and has a healthy capital structure. The World further reduced staff on March 1, 2011 by terminating eighteen employees, \\"the result of a company-wide evaluation by management of operational efficiencies.\\" The World says \\"the reduction represents approximately 3 percent of its staff.\\" Also in January 2009, the Tulsa World and Oklahoma City's daily newspaper, The Oklahoman, announced a content-sharing agreement in which each paper would carry some content created by the other. The papers also said they would \\"focus on reducing some areas of duplication, such as sending reporters from both The Oklahoman and Tulsa World to cover routine news events.\\" In mid-January 2009, Tulsa World filed a libel lawsuit against noted local blogger Michael Bates, Urban Tulsa Weekly, and the Weeklys editor and publisher, over a column Bates wrote for the weekly paper, in which Bates expressed doubts about the Worlds circulation numbers based on a 2006 report by the Audit Bureau of Circulation. On January 20, The Tulsa World said it would drop the case against Urban Tulsa Weekly and its editor and publisher, after the weekly paper agreed to issue a retraction, but Bates remained a defendant. Tulsa Worlds decision to sue a competitor paper was criticized in a column by Slate editor Jack Shafer. On February 12, 2009, the World reported that Bates had issued an apology and retraction, and that the libel lawsuit had been settled on confidential terms.

It is best known for its screenings of foreign and independent films, and for its revival screenings. The Bay Theatre is also home to a Wurlitzer organ which is used for concerts and silent film screenings. History The Bay Theatre was originally constructed in 1947. At one time it was a Fox West Coast theater. Richard Loderhose purchased the theater in 1975. After removing some of the seats, Loderhose installed a 1928-built Wurlitzer organ that he had purchased in the early 1960s from New York City's Paramount Theater. Designed by organist Jesse Crawford, the 21 rank instrument had originally been installed in the Paramount Building's radio studio (the Paramount's auditorium organ is now in the Century II Exhibition Hall in Wichita, Kansas). The studio organ was used not only for broadcasts but for making recordings. Loderhouse acquired the organ in 1960 and installed it in his Long Island house.http://www.baytheatre.com/ds_table.htm He moved it to the Bay Theatre in 1975. He expanded the organ from its original 21 ranks to 54 ranks. It was called the largest Wurlitzer pipe organ in any operating theater in the world at that time. With the death of its owner, the organ has been removed and the future of the building in uncertain. The organ itself has been moved to Phoenix, AZ where it will be reinstalled in a public venue for performance, and religious services. The building has been closed since August 2012 and is for sale. The Seal Beach City Council designated the theater as a historical landmark in September 2016. The theater is mentioned in an unauthorized biography of Steven Spielberg as being his favorite place to see foreign movies while he was enrolled at nearby Cal State Long Beach in the mid 1960s.Cinema Treasures  Bay Theatre Restoration According to the HGTV show House Hunters Renovation that aired on November 10, 2018, Bay Theater has been purchased by Paul Dunlap, a real estate investor and Nikki his fiancée.

Gruene General Store attracts tourists to the historical community. Gruene Mansion Inn and Bed and Breakfast Gruene ( ) is a former German town in Comal County in the U.S. state of Texas. Once a significant cotton-producing community along the Guadalupe River, the town has now shifted its economy to one supported primarily by tourism. Gruene, a German surname, (pronounced \\"Green\\") is now a district within the city limits of New Braunfels, and much of it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975. The city is known for its German-Texan heritage and architecture. History =Establishment and rise to prominence= German farmers arriving in the mid 1840s became the first European settlers of what is now known as Gruene, Texas. Ernst Gruene, one such German immigrant, arrived in New Braunfels in 1845, but acreage was scarce there. With his two sons he then purchased land along the Guadalupe River, and he built the first home in Gruene in early Fachwerk, German timber framing house style. Ernst Gruene's second son, Heinrich (Henry) D. Gruene, built his own house (Gruene Family Home) and planted cotton. As cotton was a top crop it lured up to 30 families to Henry D.'s lands. In addition to his Victorian-style home (now Gruene Mansion Inn), Henry D. was responsible for several buildings in various styles, many still standing: a Victorian cottage, a large brick home, and, for his farm foreman, a frame house (now Gruene Haus). In 1878, Gruene opened a mercantile store to serve the several dozen or so families sharecropping on his land. Originally known as \\"Goodwin\\", the town benefited by its location along the stagecoach route between Austin and San Antonio, the store thrived for many years and stimulated local commercial growth. A cotton gin (now Gristmill River Restaurant and Bar) powered by the Guadalupe River was added soon after. Gruene Hall, which opened in 1878, is one of the oldest dance halls in Texas. The Thorn Hill School and three large cotton gins soon followed. By the time the International-Great Northern Railroad was built across Comal County in the 1880s, the small community was bustling with commercial and farming activity, and officially took the name \\"Gruene\\" after its founding father and most prominent citizen. =Decline and abandonment= By 1900, Gruene was a prominent banking, ginning, and shipping center for area cotton farming. Though it never had a post office of its own, the community did possess two freight rail stations by the 1910s. In 1922, the original cotton gin burned and was replaced by a modern electric model down the road (now Adobe Verde). Gruene was decimated, however, by the boll weevil blight of the 1920s, and further doomed by the effects of the Great Depression. By 1930, the population had fallen to 75, and post-World War II highway construction bypassed the town. By 1950, Gruene had become a ghost town. =Revival and renaissance= In 1974, Chip Kaufman, a UT Austin architecture student, began working to get Gruene on the National Register of Historic Places and sought new owners for properties in the historic district. Among the new owners was Pat Molak, who purchased Gruene Hall in 1975. Molak and his friend Mary Jane Nalley purchased and repaired several of the town's notable structures and transformed them into thriving businesses. Mary Jane Nalley was later given the Besserung Award by the New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce. As a result of the restoration of area structures, such as Gruene Hall and the old mercantile store, Gruene began a rebirth of sorts in the early 1970s. Redevelopment and restoration of the area continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s and today, and though no longer an autonomous community (it was annexed by New Braunfels in 1979), Gruene maintains a thriving tourist business. Many original structures from the town's heyday still exist, including the Gruene Family Home, a Victorian-style edifice built in 1872 which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and today operates as the Gruene Mansion Inn. A historic water tower rises above Gruene Hall, and other buildings at the heart of the district have been renovated into shops and restaurants. There is also a wine-tasting room.

As of 2014 it had a population of 39,611 people. A trade center and river port from at least the time of the Mali Empire, Kouroussa has long relied upon its position near the upstream limit of navigation of the Niger River to make it an important crossroads for people and goods moving between the Guinea coast and the states of the western Soudan and Niger River valley. The town and surrounding area is a center of Malinke culture, and is known for its Djembe drumming tradition. History Kouroussa represented the southern end of the Manden: the Mandé heartland of the Mali Empire. Kouroussa's position as a river port has made it a historic center for regional trade, much like its larger neighbor Kankan. Much of the Jallonke population of the area migrated from the west when the Fula people conquered the Fouta Djallon in the 13th - 16th centuries. With the collapse of the empire, southern Manden confederations and states continued to exist, including in the area around Kouroussa. In the 17th century the Fama Da Monzon Diarra of the Bambara Empire made Kouroussa the southern reach of his state. By the 18th century the Fula Muslim Imamate of Futa Jallon led by the Alamay of Timbo provided pressure from the south and west, while the growing Kong state (in modern Côte d'Ivoire) became powerful to the south and east. The Mandé state around Kouroussa, called in some periods Hamana and in others Koumara, continued as an important trade center and small regional power, squeezed between these forces.Jan Jansen. THE REPRESENTATION OF STATUS IN MANDE: DID THE MALIEMPIRE STILL EXIST IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY? History in Africa 23 (1996), 87-109 Note: Jansen argues for a reappraisal of Mandé dating which pushes remnants of the Mali Empire into the 19th century. The more traditional dates are accepted in Charlotte A Quinn. Mandingo kingdoms of the Senegambia: Traditionalism, Islam, and European expansion. Longman (1972). =Colonialism= The first known European visitor to the town was the French explorer René Caillié, who passed through the area in June 1827 on his journey to Djenné and Timbuktu. In his book Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo published in 1830, he wrote: > Courouassa [Kouroussa] is a neat village, surrounded by a mud wall, from ten > to twelve feet high and from eight to ten inches thick. It contains between > four and five hundred inhabitants. ... the inhabitants are called Dhialonkés > [Dialonké], and are chiefly idolaters. They do not travel, but occupy > themselves peaceably in the cultivation of their little fields, which are > fertilised by the inundations of the river. By the arrival of Europeans, Kouroussa was a major trade stop between the Niger River valley and the coast, with the so-called \\"Leprince\\" overland route running from the coast via Kindia, Timbo, and Kouroussa.New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress, Dood, Mead, & co, New York (1915) p. 274 In the late 19th century French forces appeared in the region just to the north, establishing bases at Kayes, Kita, Mali, Bafoulabé and eventually at Bamako. Countering the French expansion was the Fula Jihad state of which exploded out of neighboring Dinguiray to conquer both the Mandé states surrounding Kouroussa to the northwest and the Bambara to the northeast. To the south, the Wassoulou conquest state of Samori Ture appeared, sending his well armed forces against Kouroussa, its neighbors, and the French alike, while the Futa Jallon state raided the area periodically. The French officer Aimé Olivier, attempting to convince the Imamate of Futa Jallon to sign a protectorate, passed through Kouroussa in the 1880s, and at the beginning of the 1890s, French military under Louis Archinard established garrison posts at Kankan and Kouroussa, commanded from a larger post just downstream at Siguiri.Auguste-Louis-Charles Gatelet. Histoire de la conquête du Soudan français (1878-1899). Berger-Levrault, Paris (1901). pp. 146, 184-87 In 1893–1894, Commandant Briquelot set up a post at Kouroussa, as it lay along the main line for French fighting with the forces of Samori to the south. From here French forces raided areas controlled by Samori, even launching raids from here into the British territory of Sierra Leone.Gatelet, 189-191 By 1895, even while fighting with Samori continued, the French had set up a school to train local workers to identify, collect, and prepare wild rubber for French industrial purposes. Kouroussa became a regional center of rubber requisitions (often instituted as a tax in labour), which peaked in the second decade of the 20th century.Gatelet, p. 494. For the colonial era wild rubber collections, see: Emily Lynn Osborn. 'Rubber Fever', Commerce And French Colonial Rule In Upper Guinée, 1890–1913. The Journal of African History (2004), 45: 445-465 Kouroussa was administered as part of the Siguiri Cercle, which also included Kankan.Gatelet, op cit., 506, 509 The French, after annexing the Futa Jallon in the 1890s, added the region to the colony of French Upper Guinea, later a part of French West Africa, until Guinea's independence in 1959. During the colonial period the town was made a main trans-shipment point for commodities coming from French Sudan (today's Mali) due to the construction of the Guinea-Niger railway, which met the river at Kouroussa in 1910, and from which rainy season ship transport could reach Bamako.William Basil Morgan, John Charles Pugh. West Africa. Methuen, 1969. pp. 271, 587, 593. As well as a collection center for wild rubber, the French encouraged the collection gold sifted from streams and dug by local small scale mines. The French also attempted to promote local farming of groundnuts and cotton. There remains a monument to René-Auguste Caillié in Kouroussa, erected by the French. =Contemporary history= In 2001, Kouroussa was one of several places which was particularly hard hit by flooding, and became a center for thousands of internally displaced people from the surrounding area. GUINEA: Up to 70,000 affected by floods, 21 September 2001 (IRIN) In 2005, Kouroussa was rocked by major protests against the government, particularly aimed at Kouroussa Prefect Charles Andre Haba who was accused of embezzling local mining revenue.

Personal account of the 2006 tensions from Peace Corps volunteer Hilary Heuler, based in Kouroussa Population With an estimated population of just over 10,000, Kouroussa functions more as a services and transport center for the surrounding agricultural region than as a metropolitan center in its own right. =Culture= The majority of the surrounding population comes from the Malinke and Djallonke ethnic groups, who speak related Mande languages and follow the Muslim religion. Kouroussa and the surrounding region is the centre of the Hamana-Malinke Mande sub-group -- \\"Hamana\\" being the name for the region, while the Malinke are the major Mande speaking ethnic group of the upper Niger valley. There are also sizable minority communities of Fula and Dyula, the latter traditionally forming trade communities in towns like Kouroussa.

Economy =Transport= With its position near the upstream limit of navigation on the Niger River, Kouroussa is an important center of transport and trade. The Guinea Railway crosses the Niger River at this town, where there is also a river port.UNESCO: readings of Niger at Kouroussa, 1945-1979 . The town also lies at a junction in Guinea's N1 highway, which is a major transport route between Conakry, Kankan, and (via the N7 and N32) neighboring Mali.geonames.org: Kouroussa. The metre gauge Niger – Conakry rail line runs 588 km to the capital of Guinea, with a branch of 74 kilometers running from Kouroussa to Kankan. It was built by the French, using African labor, in the first two decades of the 20th century.

It is listed as an endangered species due to habitat loss and a restricted range. Golden moles are an ancient group of mammals that live mostly below ground. The eponymous Juliana is Juliana Meester, the wife of the South African zoologist who named this species. Description They have shiny coats of dense fur and a streamlined, formless appearance. They have no visible eyes or ears; in fact, they are blind - the small eyes are covered with hairy skin. The ears are small and are hidden in the animal's fur. Juliana's golden mole weighs . Ecology It is confined to sandy soils, often pockets along weathered rocky ridges of quartzite or granite. It is also common in well-irrigated gardens. Usually two young are born, sometimes one. Golden moles eat invertebrates such as insects, earthworms and snails. Their young are born in a grass-lined cavity in the ground. Golden moles usually dig their tunnels just below the surface of the ground. The main feeding activity is in the late afternoon and at night. They exhibit torpor daily during the morning and early afternoon. Status Juliana's golden mole is found in Pretoria (Gauteng), Nylstroom (Limpopo Province) and Kruger National Park (Mpumalanga), South Africa. Where it occurs, Juliana's golden mole can be locally common. However, its occurrence is extremely patchy within its limited geographic range. There are no data on population size. The population on Bronberg Ridge, Pretoria East, is severely affected by ongoing intensive urbanization and a mining operation, and it is considered to be critically endangered. The Nylsvley population in Limpopo occurs in farmlands (adjoining the Nylsvley Nature Reserve) that are subject to habitat alteration and potential degradation. Another threat is habitat fragmentation which causes obstruction to animal movement; this results in in-breeding which increases the possible risk of extinction. The International Union for Conservation of Nature now rates this species as \\"endangered\\".

This particular weapon was made for a left- handed user The howdah pistol was a large-calibre handgun, often with two or four barrels, used in India and Africa from the beginning of the nineteenth century, and into the early twentieth century, during the British Empire era. It was intended for defence against tigers, lions, and other dangerous animals that might be encountered in remote areas. Multi-barreled breech-loading designs were later favoured over contemporary revolvers, due to their higher velocity and faster reloading potential. The term \\"howdah pistol\\" comes from the howdah, a large platform mounted on the back of an elephant. Hunters, particularly in British Raj India, used howdahs as a platform for hunting, and needed large-calibre side-arms for protection against close quarters animal attacks.Maze. - p.19. The practice of hunting from the howdah basket on top of an Asian elephant was first made popular by the joint Anglo-Indian East India Company during the 1790s. The early howdah pistols were flintlock designs, and it was not until about 60 years later that percussion models in single or double barrel configuration were seen. By the 1890s and early 1900s cartridge- firing and fully rifled howdah pistols were standard. The first breech-loading howdah pistols were little more than sawn-off rifles, typically in .577 SniderMaze. - p.20. or .577/450 Martini–Henry calibre. This was practical in that the huntsman could use the same ammunition in rifle and pistol, as well as being a powerful round.Peterson & Elman The Great Guns (1971) p.239 Later English firearms makers manufactured specially-designed howdah pistols in both rifle calibres and standard pistol calibres such as .455 Webley and .476 Enfield.

By the late 19th century, top-break revolvers in more practical calibres (such as .455 Webley) had become widespread, removing much of the traditional market for howdah pistols. Modern reproductions are available from Italian gun maker Pedersoli in .577 caliber, 50 caliber, and 20 bore with percussion ignition or .45 Colt cartridges and .410 shotgun cartridges.

He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License. Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software. With this, he also launched the free software movement. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection, GNU Debugger, and GNU Emacs text editor. In October 1985 he founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify, and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license. In 1989, he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital rights management (which he referred to as digital restrictions management, calling the more common term misleading), and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, non- disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats, and binary executables without source code. In September 2019, Stallman resigned as president of the FSF and left his ‘visiting scientist’ role at MIT after it was alleged that his remarks in a discussion of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal condoned underage prostitution. This also followed a public letter by 33 of the developers of the GNU project asserting that GNU cannot exist as a project serving all internet users while Stallman is still heading the project. Stallman remains head of the GNU Project.  Early life  Stallman was born March 16, 1953, in New York City, to a family of Jewish heritage. He had a troublesome relationship with his parents and didn't feel he had a proper home. He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094. From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students. Stallman was also a volunteer laboratory assistant in the biology department at Rockefeller University. Although he was interested in mathematics and physics, his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist. His first experience with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran. He completed the task after a couple of weeks (\\"I swore that I would never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a language compared with other languages\\") and spent the rest of the summer writing a text editor in APL and a preprocessor for the PL/I programming language on the IBM System/360. = Harvard University and MIT = As a first-year student at Harvard University in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in Math 55. He was happy: \\"For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard.\\" In 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and became a regular in the hacker community, where he was usually known by his initials, RMS, which he used in his computer accounts. Stallman received a bachelor's degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974. Stallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead decided to enroll as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory. While working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman, Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking. This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. , the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking. The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper. As a hacker in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as TECO and Emacs for the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS), as well as the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974–1976 and the CADR of 1977–1979—this latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI) starting around 1980). He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20 percent of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.  Events leading to GNU  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker culture that Stallman thrived on began to fragment. To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such proprietary software had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software was a consequence triggered by the US Copyright Act of 1976. When Brian Reid in 1979 placed time bombs in the Scribe markup language and word processing system to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it \\"a crime against humanity\\". During an interview in 2008, he clarified that it is blocking the user's freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for software. Stallman's texinfo is a GPL replacement, loosely based on Scribe; the original version was finished in 1986. In 1980, Stallman and some other hackers at the AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly installed laser printer, the Xerox 9700. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's need to be able to freely modify the software they use. Richard Greenblatt, a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI) to market Lisp machines, which he and Tom Knight designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the venture capital-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded Symbolics, with the aid of Russ Noftsker, an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker Bill Gosper, who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics also forced Greenblatt to resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab's community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers. Stallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbors and be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical. The phrase \\"software wants to be free\\" is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy. He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral value, and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software. Eric S. Raymond, one of the creators of the open-source movement, argues that moral arguments, rather than pragmatic ones, alienate potential allies and hurt the end goal of removing code secrecy. In February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983. Since then, he had remained affiliated with MIT as an unpaid visiting scientist in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Until \\"around 1998\\", he maintained an office at the Institute that doubled as his legal residence.  GNU project  Stallman announced the plan for the GNU operating system in September 1983 on several ARPANET mailing lists and USENET. He started the project on his own and describes: \\"As an operating system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it.\\" GLUG) at Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Calcutta, India In 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix. The name GNU is a recursive acronym for \\"GNU's Not Unix\\". Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts. Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed. Stallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a text editor (Emacs), compiler (GCC), debugger (GNU Debugger), and a build automator (GNU make). The notable omission was a kernel. In 1990, members of the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon's Mach microkernel in a project called GNU Hurd, which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for full POSIX compliance. In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, used the GNU's development tools to produce the free monolithic Linux kernel. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name Linux to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it GNU/Linux. This has been a longstanding naming controversy in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project. Cover picture for O'Reilly Media's book Free as in Freedom Stallman's influences on hacker culture include the name POSIX and the Emacs editor. On Unix systems, GNU Emacs's popularity rivaled that of another editor vi, spawning an editor war. Stallman's take on this was to canonize himself as St. IGNUcius of the Church of Emacs and acknowledge that \\"vi vi vi is the editor of the beast\\", while \\"using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance\\". On his homepage Stallman explains what a life in the Church of Emacs means to its members: \\"Sainthood in the Church of Emacs requires living a life of purity—but in the Church of Emacs, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard)\\". In 1992, developers at Lucid Inc. doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately forked the software into what would become XEmacs. The technology journalist Andrew Leonard has characterized what he sees as Stallman's uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers: In 2018, Stallman instituted \\"Kind Communication Guidelines\\" for the GNU project to help its mailing list discussions remain constructive while avoiding explicitly promoting diversity.  Activism  Stallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement since the early 1990s. The speeches he has regularly given are titled The GNU Project and the Free Software Movement, The Dangers of Software Patents, and Copyright and Community in the Age of Computer Networks. In 2006 and 2007, during the eighteen month public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, he added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes. Stallman's staunch advocacy for free software inspired the creation of the Virtual Richard M. Stallman (vrms), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a Debian GNU/Linux system, and reports those that are from the non-free tree. Stallman disagrees with parts of Debian's definition of free software. In 1999, Stallman called for development of a free online encyclopedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles. The resulting GNUPedia was eventually retired in favour of the emerging Wikipedia, which had similar aims and was enjoying greater success. Stallman is a world traveler and has visited at least 65 countries, mostly to speak about free software and the GNU project. According to Stallman, the free software movement has much in common with that of Mahatma Gandhi. Stallman is also highly critical of the effect that drug patents have had on developing countries. Stallman giving a speech on \\"Free Software and Your Freedom\\" at the biennale du design of Saint- Étienne (2008) In Venezuela, Stallman has delivered public speeches and promoted the adoption of free software in the state's oil company (PDVSA), in municipal government, and in the nation's military. In meetings with Hugo Chávez and in public speeches, Stallman criticised some policies on television broadcasting, free speech rights, and privacy. Stallman was on the Advisory Council of Latin American television station teleSUR from its launch but resigned in February 2011, criticizing pro-Gaddafi propaganda during the Arab Spring. In August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools. This has resulted in a landmark decision to switch all school computers in 12,500 high schools from Windows to a free software operating system. After personal meetings, Stallman obtained positive statements about the free software movement from the then-president of India, , French 2007 presidential candidate Ségolène Royal, and the president of Ecuador Rafael Correa. Stallman has participated in protests about software patents, digital rights management, and proprietary software. Protesting against proprietary software in April 2006, Stallman held a \\"Don't buy from ATI, enemy of your freedom\\" placard at a speech by an ATI representative in the building where Stallman worked, resulting in the police being called. ATI has since merged with AMD Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the free software community. In response to Apple's Macintosh look and feel lawsuits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1988, Stallman called for a boycott of Apple products on the grounds that a successful look and feel lawsuit would \\"put an end to free software that could substitute for commercial software\\". The boycott was lifted in 1995, which meant the FSF started to accept patches to GNU software for Apple operating systems. Stallman using his Lemote machine at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai Stallman has characterized Steve Jobs as having a \\"malign influence\\" on computing because of Jobs' leadership in guiding Apple to produce closed platforms. In 1993, while Jobs was at NeXT, Jobs asked Stallman if he could distribute a modified GCC in two parts, one part under GPL and the other part, an Objective-C preprocessor under a proprietary license. Stallman initially thought this would be legal, but since he also thought it would be \\"very undesirable for free software\\", he asked a lawyer for advice. The response he got was that judges would consider such schemes to be \\"subterfuges\\" and would be very harsh toward them, and a judge would ask whether it was \\"really\\" one program, rather than how the parts were labeled. Therefore, Stallman sent a message back to Jobs which said they believed Jobs' plan was not allowed by the GPL, which resulted in NeXT releasing the Objective-C front end under GPL. For a period of time, Stallman used a notebook from the One Laptop per Child program. Stallman's computer is a refurbished ThinkPad T400s with Libreboot, a free BIOS replacement, and the GNU/Linux distribution Trisquel. Before the ThinkPad T400s, Stallman used a Thinkpad X60 with Libreboot and Trisquel GNU/Linux. And before the X60, Stallman used the Lemote Yeeloong netbook (using the same company's Loongson processor) which he chose because, like the X60 and the T400s, it could run with free software at the BIOS level, stating \\"freedom is my priority. I've campaigned for freedom since 1983, and I am not going to surrender that freedom for the sake of a more convenient computer.\\" Stallman's Lemote was stolen from him in 2012 while in Argentina. Before Trisquel, Stallman has used the gNewSense operating system. = Copyright reduction = Stallman has regularly given a talk entitled \\"Copyright vs. Community\\" where he reviews the state of digital rights management (DRM) and names many of the products and corporations which he boycotts. His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF Defective by Design campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a \\"reduced copyright\\" and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on cubic roots of their popularity to ensure that \\"fairly successful non-stars\\" receive a greater share than they do now (compare with private copying levy which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous micropayment system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies should be considered a copyright violation. He has advocated civil disobedience in a comment on Ley Sinde. Stallman has also helped and supported the International Music Score Library Project in getting back online, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007, following a cease and desist letter from Universal Edition. Stallman at Swatantra 2014, a conference organized by ICFOSS in Kerala, India Stallman mentions the dangers some e-books bring compared to paper books, with the example of the Amazon Kindle e-reader that prevents the copying of e-books and allows Amazon to order automatic deletion of a book. He says that such e-books present a big step backward with respect to paper books by being less easy to use, copy, lend to others or sell, also mentioning that Amazon e-books cannot be bought anonymously. His short story \\"The Right to Read\\" provides a picture of a dystopian future if the right to share books is impeded. He objects to many of the terms within typical end-user license agreements that accompany e-books. Stallman discourages the use of several storage technologies such as DVD or Blu-ray video discs because the content of such media is encrypted. He considers manufacturers' use of encryption on non-secret data (to force the user to view certain promotional material) as a conspiracy. He recognized the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal to be a criminal act by Sony. Stallman supports a general boycott of Sony for its legal actions against George Hotz. Stallman has suggested that the United States government may encourage the use of software as a service because this would allow them to access users' data without needing a search warrant. He denies being an anarchist despite his wariness of some legislation and the fact that he has \\"advocated strongly for user privacy and his own view of software freedom\\". = Terminologies = halo consisting of the platter of an old hard disk drive. (Monastir, Tunisia, 2012) Stallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms intellectual property and piracy (in relation to copying not approved by the publisher). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agrees to use his terminology throughout the article. He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues. Stallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other areas of law by lumping together things that are more dissimilar than similar. He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues, writing: An example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list:  Open source and Free software  His requests that people use certain terms, and his ongoing efforts to convince people of the importance of terminology, are a source of regular misunderstanding and friction with parts of the free software and open-source communities. After initially accepting the concept, Stallman rejects a common alternative term, open-source software, because it does not call to mind what Stallman sees as the value of the software: freedom. He wrote, \\"Free software is a political movement; open source is a development model.\\" Thus, he believes that the use of the term will not inform people of the freedom issues, and will not lead to people valuing and defending their freedom. Two alternatives which Stallman does accept are software libre and unfettered software, but free software is the term he asks people to use in English. For similar reasons, he argues for the term proprietary software rather than closed-source software, when referring to software that is not free software.  Linux and GNU  Stallman asks that the term GNU/Linux, which he pronounces , be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the kernel Linux. Stallman refers to this operating system as \\"a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer\\". He claims that the connection between the GNU project's philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux. Starting around 2003, he began also using the term GNU+Linux, which he pronounces , to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase GNU/Linux as , which would erroneously imply that the kernel Linux is maintained by the GNU project. The creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, has publicly stated that he objects to modification of the name, and that the rename \\"is their [the FSF] confusion not ours\\". = Surveillance resistance = Stallman professes admiration for whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. He has spoken against government and corporate surveillance on many occasions. He refers to mobile phones as \\"portable surveillance and tracking devices\\", refusing to own a cell phone due to the lack of phones running entirely on free software. He also avoids using a key card to enter his office building since key card systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. He usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer. Instead, he uses GNU Womb's grab-url-from-mail utility, an email-based proxy which downloads the web page content and then emails it to the user. More recently, he stated that he accesses all web sites via Tor, except for Wikipedia (which generally disallows editing from Tor unless users have an IP block exemption).  Personal life  Stallman resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He speaks English, French, Spanish and some Indonesian. He has said that he is \\"an atheist of Jewish ancestry\\" and often wears a button that reads \\"Impeach God\\". Stallman has written a collection of filk and parody songs. He is childfree and antinatalist. In April 2018, Stallman was criticized for electing to keep a joke about American federal policies toward abortion in the documentation for glibc.  Resignation from MIT and FSF  In August and September 2019 it was learned that Jeffrey Epstein had made controversial donations to MIT, and in the wake of this, MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito resigned. An internal MIT CSAIL listserv mailing list thread was started to protest the coverup of MIT's connections to Epstein. In the thread, discussion had turned to deceased MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who was named by Virginia Giuffre as one of the people that Epstein had directed her to have sex with. Giuffre, a minor at the time, had been caught in Epstein's underage sex trafficking ring. In response to a comment where one reply stated that Minsky \\"is accused of assaulting one of Epstein's victims\\", Stallman defended Minsky by claiming that \\"the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing\\". When challenged by other members of the mailing list, he added \\"It is morally absurd to define 'rape' in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17\\". Stallman remained critical of Epstein and his role, stating \\"We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex – by Epstein. She was being harmed.\\" Stallman's posts were published to the public via Medium by Selam Gano, and Vice published a copy of the email chain to that point on September 13, 2019, drawing attention to Stallman's comments. Many people started to look into Stallman's past writings over the following days to find what were considered troubling statements related to underage sex and laws relating to child pornography from 2013 and earlier. Tied to his comments regarding Minsky, this led to several calling for Stallman's resignation. On September 14 Stallman acknowledged that since the time of his past writings, he had learned that there were problems with underage sex, writing on his blog: \\"Through personal conversations in recent years, I've learned to understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically. This changed my mind about the matter: I think adults should not do that.\\" On September 16, Stallman announced his resignation from both MIT and FSF, \\"due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations\\". In a post on his website, Stallman asserted that his posts to the email lists were not to defend Epstein, stating \\"Nothing could be further from the truth. I've called him a 'serial rapist,' and said he deserved to be imprisoned. But many people now believe I defended him—and other inaccurate claims—and feel a real hurt because of what they believe I said. I'm sorry for that hurt. I wish I could have prevented the misunderstanding.\\" Stallman remains head of the GNU Project.

It ceased to operate in 1976 after failing to renew its contracts with the United States Navy. The site of the former company is now being developed for business and housing on the bank of the Saginaw River. Founding Harry J. Defoe organized the Defoe Boat and Motor Works in 1905 on the Saginaw River in Bay City, Michigan. At that time, the firm built \\"knock-down\\" boats and gasoline powered boats for business and pleasure. In 1917, the company got its first Navy contract for five Spent Torpedo Chasers. This order was followed in 1918 by an order for eight steel Tumor Mine Planters. Defoe Shipbuilding Company yards 1944 Defoe Shipbuilding Company 1944 Defoe Shipbuilding Company abandoned 1981 Defoe Shipbuilding Co abandoned 1981 Defoe Shipbuilding WWII 1944 From 1920 to 1939, the company built various types of government and commercial vessels and private yachts, including three 165-ft patrol boats, thirteen 100-ft patrol boats, fifteen 75-foot patrol boats and two harbor tugs for the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1931, Defoe built the Lenore, a yacht for Montgomery Ward Chairman Sewell Avery, who named it after his second daughter who died at the age of four; this yacht was taken by the U.S. Government in World War II for coastal picket duty by the Coast Guard, and in 1956 it was assigned as a Presidential Yacht. It was called the Barbara Anne by President Eisenhower after his granddaughter, the Honey Fitz by President Kennedy in honor of his maternal grandfather John Francis Fitzgerald, and the Tricia by President Nixon after his daughter. In 1941, the name of the company was changed to Defoe Shipbuilding Company. World War II USS Weiss (APD-135) During World War II, all production went to the war effort. From 1939 to 1945, the company built 154 ships, including four s, 13 destroyer escorts, 11 destroyer transports (converted destroyer escorts), patrol craft, and numerous landing craft of various types. The brand-new Defoe family yacht even served with the US Navy as a patrol vessel. Defoe developed a construction technique called the \\"upside-down and roll- over\\" method. This allowed most of the welding of the hull to be done \\"hand down\\" which is much easier. After the hull was completely welded, it was rolled over by a set of large wheels fastened to each end of the hull. Work then continued on the ship right-side up. Faster welding allowed the company to build one 173-foot patrol craft every week. Of all of the major ships built there, the three that were lost in action during World War II were the destroyer escort , the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter , and the patrol craft . Submarine chaser PC 482 was sunk by a U-boat in 1945. Defoe Shipbuilding Company also built three Refrigerated Freight Barges : YFR-888, YFR-889 and YFR-890 in 1945, also called a reefer barge. shipbuildinghistory.com, Freight Barges (YF, YFN) and Refrigerated Freight Barges (YFR, YFRN) Built or Acquired During WWII Ship building history, Defoe Shipbuilding Company After World War II After World War II, this company built two large Great Lakes bulk carriers, and it did repair work on Great Lakes ships including several repowerings, and self-unloading conversions. In later years, several ships were built for the U.S. Navy, including two s, four guided missile destroyers, and three Garcia-class destroyer escorts (later re-classified as frigates) for the U.S. Navy, and three guided-missile destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy. Also built there were the research vessels and . This last was the ship that found the wreck of . Great Lakes Bulk Freighters In the early 1950s Defoe Shipbuilding constructed two large Great Lakes freighters. They were both roughly based on U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh Steamship Company AA Class ship design and shared similar dimensions. As of April 2009, one of the two vessels is still in service on the Great Lakes. The only remaining large Great Lakes bulk freight vessel built by Defoe Shipbuilding still in service is the 642' 03\\" long, M/V Ojibway (Defoe hull #00422) operated by the Canadian firm Lower Lakes Towing, of Port Dover, Ontario, Canada. The Ojibway was originally built as the steamer Charles L. Hutchinson (2) for the Pioneer Steamship Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and entered service on September 24, 1952. In 1961, the Hutchinson was sold to Ford Motor Company of Dearborn, Michigan and was renamed Ernest M. Breech. In 1988, Ford was in the process of eliminating its Great Lakes shipping fleet and sold the Breech to George Steinbrenner's Kinsman Marine of Cleveland, Ohio. The Kinsman fleet in turn renamed the vessel Kinsman Independent (2). She sailed with Kinsman until 2002 when her main unloading dock in Buffalo, New York, updated its unloading equipment, allowing it to be serviced by newer more common self-unloading vessels. The vessel laid up in Buffalo for the last time under US flag on December 16, 2002. In the spring of 2004, McKeil Marine of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada purchased the Kinsman Independent. The ship was refurbished and repowered with a diesel engine, then sold to Voyageur Marine Transport LTD., of Ridgeville, Ontario, who returned her to service in late 2005 under the name Voyageur Independent. Her current owner (Lower Lakes Towing) has operated the vessel since August 28, 2007, and renamed her Ojibway on February 29, 2008. The second Great Lakes freighter built by Defoe was the 644' long S/S Richard M. Marshall (Defoe hull #00424) which was constructed in 1953 for the Great Lakes Steamship Company, of Cleveland, Ohio. She was a near twin to her predecessor (Charles L. Hutchinson) in size and capacity both having approximate dimensions of 640' long, 67' wide, 35' deep, and a cargo capacity of approximately 18,500 tons. In December, 1956, Great Lakes Steamship started the process of selling off their fleet, and the Marshall was sold to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. Starting with the 1957 season, Northwestern Mutual chartered the ship to the Wilson Marine Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio, who in turn renamed the vessel Joseph S. Wood. In 1966, the charter agreement between Wilson and Northwestern Mutual was canceled, and the vessel was sold to the Ford Motor Company of Dearborn, Michigan, for $4.3 million (US). Ford renamed the ship John Dykstra and she resumed trading on the Great Lakes on May 11, 1966. In 1983, Ford renamed the ship Benson Ford (2) after the retirement of the original S/S Benson Ford. In 1985, the vessel was renamed US.265808 (the name Benson Ford being passed on to a third vessel), and was withdrawn from service. The final voyage began when she cleared Quebec City, Quebec, Canada in tow of the Polish tug Jantar on August 11, 1987 along with the former US Steel freighter T. W. Robinson bound for Recife, Brazil, for dismantling. Closure Defoe administration offices 1981 Defoe Shipbuilding Crane Defoe Shipbuilding Crane and abandoned buildings 1981 Defoe Shipbuilding abandoned main gate 1981 The yard closed on 31 December 1976 after the Navy contracts ran out. Along with its dwindling navy contracts in its final handful of seasons, the yard was contracted for three larger Great Lakes Freighter projects. The first project was construction of the 68'x 104'7\\"x 46'6\\" bow section to the 1000' long integrated tug and barge Presque Isle. The bow was launched July 27, 1972 and was towed to Erie by the tugs Maryland and Laurence C. Turner arriving October 6, 1972. There it was combined with the balance of the barge which was under construction at Erie, PA. The combined tug and barge unit would be the second 1000' vessel trading on the lakes. The second was the conversion of 690' S/S Herbert C. Jackson from a conventional style Great Lakes freighter to a self unloader. The final major project was the conversion of the 620' lake freighter Richard J. Reiss from steam to diesel power. All three vessels are still activity trading on the Great Lakes, the latter sailing now as the M/V Manistee. The site of the shipyard later became the location for H. H. Hirschfield & Sons scrap yard. Hirschfield was recently bought out by OmniSource, Inc., another scrap company.

It is a ministry of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison, Wisconsin, and is accredited by the American Camp Association (ACA). Its mission is to \\"Camp Gray invites people of all ages to encounter Jesus Christ in all creation, experience a fun and vibrant Catholic community, and be challenged to ever more deeply know, love and serve God and neighbor.\\". Camp Gray's summer program consists of nine one-week sessions for campers ranging in age from 6-18. Typical camp activities include archery, arts and crafts, and fishing. Camp Gray also serves as a retreat center. History In 1953, Monsignor Francis Xavier Gray, pastor of St. Joseph Catholic Parish in Baraboo, Wisconsin, established the camp. He bought the original from a local businessman for $400. The original cabins started as ammunition crates from the nearby Badger Army Ammunition Plant. In the early days, Camp Gray was a boys' summer camp, owned by St. Joseph Parish and directed by the parish priest. Summer camp started in 1958 under Fr. Francis Schmidt's direction. Four weeks of summer camp for boys were offered, and the counselors were diocesan seminarians. In 1968 the Catholic Diocese of Madison, Wisconsin, incorporated the camp. In 1980, Fr. Larry Bakke's second summer as director, the first summer session for girls was held. In 1984 Camp Gray held its first co-ed session, and soon after became entirely co-ed. In 1994, Camp Gray hired its first lay director, Jake Czarnik-Neimeyer, who was succeeded in 1997 by Phil DeLong (Czarnik-Neimeyer's Assistant Director from 1994–1996). At the start of 2008, Jeff and Rebecca Hoeben, as co-directors, replaced DeLong.

The novels tell about the adventures of fictional Cossack hero Arsen Zvenyhora, also portraying some notable figures and events of 17th century Ukraine, Russia, Ottoman Empire and other countries.

The character is exaggeratedly positive: almighty leader and generous friend, a loyal lover and vassal. Thus, Zvenyhora looks like an archetypal knight of the first historical novels. The plot of the novel reject the idea of a ‘good tsar’. The main character, who is an ordinary Cossack, eclipses the figures of the representatives of the upper class, who appear greedy and dishonest.

Army & Navy Stores Inc. was a Canadian department store chain billing itself as \\"Canada's Original Discount Store\\". It operated five stores in Alberta and British Columbia before closing permanently on May 9, 2020.  History  Samuel Joseph Cohen, Joseph Cohen (\\"Joe\\"), and Harry Cohen, Jewish Canadians, opened the first Army & Navy location in Vancouver, British Columbia on West Hastings Street in 1919, selling liquidation stock from closing, bankrupt, or destroyed stores, and World War I army and navy surplus goods at low prices. A second store was opened in Regina, Saskatchewan on Scarth Street in 1920, and a third location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta in 1928 on 104th Street and Whyte Avenue. A fourth store opened in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in 1933. Army & Navy opened a store in New Westminster, British Columbia in 1939. An additional Edmonton store, located at 97th Street and 103rd Avenue east of the downtown core, was opened in 1955 and renovated and enlarged in 1968. In 1969, Army & Navy renovated and doubled the size of its Regina location. With the death of Samuel Cohen in 1966, Garth C. Kennedy became president of the company, with Jack D. Cohen as vice-president. In 1973, Army & Navy took over a former Eaton's location in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at 21st Street and 3rd Avenue, a location now occupied by the Saskatoon Public School Division. In 1978, the New Westminster store moved into the former Eaton's store at 502 Columbia Street which closed in late 1977 a few blocks away and remains there today, and in 1980, an eighth location was opened in Calgary, Alberta at 1107 33rd Street NE. In 1998, CEO Garth Kennedy died and the company was turned over to Sam Cohen's granddaughter, Jacqui Cohen. In 2000,the Saskatchewan stores closed. A new store was opened in Langley, British Columbia in 2001, and in Edmonton in 2003 in Londonderry Mall (as a replacement for the aging 97th Street Store). The Londonderry Mall location closed in 2016. In May 2020 all stores closed permanently due to insurmountable challenges of operating a retail business during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was first reported in tomatoes in 1935 and primarily affects vegetable crops, though it is not generally considered an economically significant plant pathogen. Depending upon the host, TBSV causes stunting of growth, leaf mottling, and deformed or absent fruit. The virus is likely to be soil-borne in the natural setting, but can also transmitted mechanically, for example through contaminated cutting tools. TBSV has been used as a model system in virology research on the life cycle of plant viruses, particularly in experimental infections of the model host plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Host range N. benthamiana, a common experimental host for TBSV. TBSV has a broad host range under experimental conditions and has been reported to infect over 120 plant species spanning 20 families. However, under natural conditions its range is much narrower and generally comprises crop vegetables and ornamental plants. It was first identified in tomato plants and also has been documented to affect apple, artichoke, cherry, grapevine, hops, and pepper. Although it causes significant loss of yield in tomato plants, it is not considered an economically significant pathogen. It is, however, a very well- established model system for the study of plant viruses, usually through experimental infection of Nicotiana benthamiana or Nicotiana clevelandii, relatives of tobacco plants in which TBSV can cause systemic infection. Notably, the common model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is not a host. TBSV can also replicate in yeast in laboratory conditions. Signs The signs of TBSV are host-dependent. Local infections can cause necrotic or chlorotic lesions. Systemic infections can cause stunted growth, deformed or absent fruit, and damaged leaves; in agricultural settings yield can be significantly reduced. The stunted, \\"bushy\\" appearance of the tomato plants in which the virus was first discovered gave the pathogen its name. In some hosts, most notably N. benthamiana, TBSV can cause lethal systemic necrosis. Transmission TBSV is thought to be passively transmitted in the wild, primarily through soil or water. There are no known vector organisms; transmission by aphids, mites, and the fungus Olpidium brassicae has specifically been ruled out. However, the closely related tombusvirus Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) has been observed to be transmitted by Olpidium bornovanus zoospores, so transmission of TBSV by as-yet unknown vector remains a possibility. TBSV can also be transmitted through seed or by mechanical inoculation. In experimental tests, the virus can survive passage through the human digestive system if consumed in food and will remain infectious; it has been hypothesized that spread through sewage could occur. Distribution and management TBSV is distributed fairly widely across central and western Europe, north Africa, and North and South America. No specific control measures are recommended for the virus, though pest management guidelines distributed by the University of California recommend avoiding fields with a history of TBSV or using long crop rotations. Taxonomy TBSV is the type species of the tombusvirus genus in the family Tombusviridae. Both the genus and the family derive their names from an abbreviation of \\"tomato bushy stunt virus\\". Structure TBSV is an unenveloped icosahedral virus with a T=3 viral capsid composed of 180 subunits of a single capsid protein. Its structure was studied extensively by X-ray crystallography from the late 1950s; its icosahedral symmetry was first identified by structural biologist Donald Caspar, who also pioneered the study of the tobacco mosaic virus. A near-atomic-resolution map was obtained in 1978 by a research team including Stephen C. Harrison. Genome and protein complement TBSV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a linear genome of ~4800 nucleotides. The genome contains five genes that encode a replicase composed of two proteins (p33 and p92), a capsid protein (called CP or p41), and two additional proteins, the RNA silencing suppressor p19 and movement protein p22. These two proteins are expressed from overlapping genes arranged so that the open reading frame of p19 is completely within the ORF of p22. The genome contains one additional possible gene, called pX, of unknown function. =p33 and p92= Together p33 and p92 comprise the viral replicase complex. P33 is smaller and p92 is produced through ribosomal read-through of the p33 stop codon, resulting in a shared N-terminal amino acid sequence and a large excess of p33 relative to p92. P33 proteins cooperatively bind single- stranded nucleic acids, while the p92 protein is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Both are essential to viral proliferation. Both proteins are associated with cell membranes. =p41 (capsid protein)= The viral capsid protein CP, or p41, is a double jelly roll protein that assembles into an icosahedral capsid containing 180 copies of the protein. Formation of virions is not always necessary for localized spread of the virus into neighboring plant cells, because ribonucleoprotein particles containing viral genetic material can spread to immediate neighbors through plasmodesmata. However, the capsid protein is required for systemic infection. =p19= The p19 protein in complex with double-stranded RNA. The p19 protein is a pathogenicity factor and functions by suppressing the RNA silencing pathway, a common form of antiviral defense. The p19 protein binds short interfering RNAs and prevents their incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby allowing viral propagation in the host plant. The presence of p19 is necessary for systemic infection or for lethal infection in some hosts; in the experimental host N. benthamiana, p19 largely mediates the lethal systemic necrosis that is the outcome of TBSV infection. =p22= The p22 protein is a movement protein that is required for the virus to spread from cell to cell. P22 is an RNA-binding protein that is associated with the cell wall and facilitates movement of viral genetic material from one cell to its neighbor through interconnecting plasmodesmata. Replication A TBSV virion contains one copy of its positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, which is linear and lacks a 3' polyadenine tail or 5' cap. Nevertheless, the p33 and p92 proteins are translated directly from genomic RNA. When the genome is replicated, two subgenomic RNA molecules are produced that act as messenger RNA; one from which the p41 (CP) gene is expressed, and one from the p19 and p22 genes are expressed. The overlapping p19 and p22 genes are both translated through the effects of leaky scanning. Several long-distance interactions between linearly well-separated areas of the genome have been identified with functional importance in ensuring efficient replication. Defective interfering RNA Defective interfering RNA (DI) molecules are RNAs that are produced from the viral genome but are not competent to infect cells on their own; instead they require coinfection with an intact \\"helper\\" virus. TBSV infections often produce significant numbers of DIs from consistent parts of the genome under experimental conditions, but this behavior has not been observed in the wild. Their production is likely to be host specific. Infections that give rise to DIs usually have milder signs.

The book discusses watershed events in the hacker subculture in the early 1990s. The most notable topic covered is Operation Sundevil and the events surrounding the 1987–1990 war on the Legion of Doom network: the raid on Steve Jackson Games, the trial of \\"Knight Lightning\\" (one of the original journalists of Phrack), and the subsequent formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The book also profiles the likes of \\"Emmanuel Goldstein\\" (publisher of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly), the former assistant attorney general of Arizona Gail Thackeray, FLETC instructor Carlton Fitzpatrick, Mitch Kapor, and John Perry Barlow. In 1994, Sterling released the book for the Internet with a new afterword. Historical perspective Though published in 1992, and released as a freeware, electronic book in 1994, the book offers a unique and colorful portrait of the nature of \\"cyberspace\\" in the early 1990s, and the nature of \\"computer crime\\" at that time. The events that Sterling discusses occur on the cusp of the mass popularity of the Internet, which arguably achieved critical mass in late 1994. It also encapsulates a moment in the information age revolution when \\"cyberspace\\" morphed from the realm of telephone modems and BBS' into the Internet and the World Wide Web.

Wells Drive in Chicago, Illinois. Inspired by the Richardsonian Romanesque Style of architect Henry Hobson Richardson, the building was designed by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan and completed in 1889. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra performed in the theatre until 1904 as well as the Chicago Grand Opera Company and its successors the Chicago Opera Association and Chicago Civic Opera until its relocation to the Civic Opera House in 1929. The theatre currently hosts performances by the Joffrey Ballet, in addition to a variety of concerts, musicals, performances and events. Since the 1940s, it has been owned by Roosevelt University and since the 1960s refurbished and managed by an independent non-profit arts organization.  History  = Opening and early years = The Auditorium Building in 1890 In 1885, Chicago-based businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Wythe Peck began ambitious plans for the building that would house the Auditorium Theatre.Swanson, Stevenson. \\"Dankmar Adler and Louis H. Sullivan's Auditorium\\", Chicago Tribune, Retrieved 2014-01-20. At the time, Chicago was still recovering from the 1871 Great Chicago Fire and was rife with the contentious labor issues that would lead to the 1886 Haymarket Square bombing. Peck was committed to building a state-of-the-art performance venue that would make high culture available to the general public, while also helping to bolster Chicago's sullied reputation. To subsidize the cost of performances, Peck envisioned a new concept in design: a multi-use structure that would encompass the theatre, as well as a luxury hotel and office space; proceeds from the hotel and offices would fund performances and keep ticket prices affordable.Auditorium Theatre at the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University The architecture firm Adler and Sullivan were retained to design the building at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Congress Street. It is considered to be one of their most notable buildings during their partnership together. The gala opening night performance on December 9, 1889, was a major social event bringing together politicians and national leaders. In attendance were President Benjamin Harrison, Vice President Levi Morton, Illinois Governor Joseph Wilson Fifer, Chicago Mayor DeWitt Clinton Cregier, the theatre's financial backers, and the city's elite. President Harrison (who had visited the Auditorium in 1888, when the theatre, still a construction site, housed 9000 Republican National Convention attendees) was evidently so impressed that he was rumored to have whispered to Vice President Levi P. Morton, \\"New York surrenders, eh?\\" Crowds of people lined the streets waiting to get a glimpse of the famous and wealthy guests.Roberts, Michael J.

A highlight of the evening was opera star Madame Adelina Patti's rendition of John Howard Payne's \\"Home Sweet Home\\". with artist's sketch of Patti on stage. The Auditorium Theatre played a critical role in Chicago being named host for 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Local civic leaders in Chicago were vying with those in St. Louis, New York City, and Washington to host a fair that could reestablish Chicago as a destination for travel and commerce.Rydell, Robert W. World's Columbian Exposition\\", The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago . Chicago Historical Society. 2005 The international sensation brought about by the opening of the Auditorium was seen by Congress as an indication that the people of Chicago possessed the vision and financing to successfully produce a world-class fair. During its early years, the Auditorium stage played host to the leading entertainers of the era, including John Phillip Sousa, Sarah Bernhardt, The Ziegfeld Follies, Anna Pavlova, and Helen Morgan, as well as political figures including Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Booker T. Washington.Hughes, Bob (September 29, 1985). \\"The Dramatic Story Of A Magnificent Chicago Landmark\\", Chicago Tribune, Retrieved 2014-02-14.

Following a run of the comedic musical revue \\"Hellzapoppin\\", the Auditorium Theatre went bankrupt and closed in 1941.Gross, Theodore L. The Rise of Roosevelt University: Presidential Reflections, SIU Press, 2005, p.136 In 1942, the Auditorium was taken over by the City of Chicago to be used as a World War II servicemen's center. The stage and front rows of the theatre were converted to a bowling alley and much of the ornate stenciling, plasterwork, and art glass was covered over. At the Auditorium Building, more than 2.2 million servicemen were housed, fed, and entertained between 1941 and 1945. Visible damage on the Auditorium Theatre's plaster work before the renovation. = Revival = In 1946, Roosevelt University saved the venue from demolition by acquiring the building, but lacking the money required to renovate the theatre, kept it dormant for two decades. In 1963, Mrs. Beatrice Spachner, with the approval of Roosevelt University, created the Auditorium Theatre Council and undertook a campaign to restore and reopen the theatre, raising nearly $3 million to renovate the structure. Architect Harry Weese oversaw the refurbishment of the theatre, and on October 31, 1967, the Auditorium Theatre reopened with a gala performance of the New York City Ballet's production of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\". = Music, dance, and productions = Beginning in the late 1960s through today, a host of rock and pop performers have played at the theatre, including David Gilmour, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Janis Joplin, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Aretha Franklin, Osibisa, Parliament- Funkadelic, James Taylor, Liza Minnelli, Bette Midler, and Neil Young.Auditorium Theatre at the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University Deceased musicians that have performed at the Auditorium Theatre include French organist Alexandre Guilmant in 1893 for the Chicago World's Fair, Soviet pianist Prokofiev in 1921, Chuck Berry (from St. Louis) in 1956, Ray Charles in 1967, the Beach Boys (with Dennis and Carl Wilson) in 1968, the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1968, the Monkees (with Davy Jones) in 1969, The Doors (with Chicago's Ray Manzarek) in 1969, Chicago's The Impressions with Curtis Mayfield in 1969, James Brown with Detroit's Jackie Wilson in 1969, and Queen in 1979.https://www.setlist.fm/search?page=110&query;=Chicago+Auditorium The venue also began to host more dance companies, including Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Bolshoi Ballet, and American Ballet Theatre. Broadway musicals with long-running productions at the theatre have included The Phantom of the Opera, Les Misérables, Miss Saigon, Show Boat, Hello Dolly!, The King and I, and The Who's Tommy. On July 5, 1970, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young performed at the venue, with a portion of the concert recorded for their live double album 4 Way Street. The British progressive rock band Genesis also performed as part of their Selling England by the Pound Tour (April 11, 1974), The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour (on November 20 and 21, 1974), A Trick of the Tail Tour (April 16 and 17, 1976) and Wind & Wuthering Tour on (February 15, 16 and 17, 1977) of which the February 16, 1977 concert was also broadcast live on Chicago's WKQX-FM radio station. = Present = Today, the Auditorium Theatre continues to maintain and restore the Adler & Sullivan building. Recent innovations include the introduction of the theatre's first public elevator as well as the Katten/Landau Studio housed in the Roosevelt University Wabash Building. Typically, more than 200 performances and events, ranging from dance and theater to music, educational programs, and more, attract over a quarter of a million people every year.

Each patron was required to move through the small, dark entrance way into the theatre. The entrance was \\"compressed\\" by low ceilings in a way so that when patrons left the lobby to enter the theater, the impact of \\"expanding\\" into the towering six story auditorium, with its grand gilded arches and glittering ceiling, would be all the more dramatic.Auditorium Theatre at the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University  References   External links   Genesis Wind & Wuthering Tour Live at the Auditorium Theatre on YouTube *Auditorium Theatre Programs at the Newberry Library *Auditorium Theatre Council Records at the Newberry Library Category:Concert halls in Illinois Category:Concert halls in the United States Category:Roosevelt University Category:Theatres in Chicago Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Tourist attractions in Chicago Category:Joffrey Ballet Category:National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Dance venues in the United States Category:Music venues in Illinois Category:Music venues in Chicago ","title":"Auditorium Theatre"},{"id":"3434247","text":"Salamat Hashim, also known as Hashim Salamat, was a Filipino militant who served as leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

At age six, he was taught by his mother on how to read the Quran. In the 1950s, Hashim received formal elementary and high school education and was an honor student. In the 1958, Hashim joined the Hajj and decided to stay in Mecca to be mentored by Sheikh Zawawi. He was a regular attendee of the halaqat at the Masjid al Haram. He also underwent studies at the Madrasat as- Sulatiyah ad-Diniyah. The following year, Hashim moved to Cairo to pursue further studies. He enrolled at the Al-Azhar University where he accomplished a bachelor's degree in theology, majoring in Aqeedah and Philosophy in 1967 and a post-graduate masters degree in the same university in 1969.

The first storyline in Legionnaires (1993) had the SW6 Legion face a Fatal Five comprising Tharok, Mano, the Persuader, a new Emerald Empress and a monstrous being called Mordecai. =Zero Hour= Following the Zero Hour Legion reboot, the original Fatal Five was reintroduced in Legion of Super-Heroes #78 (1996), again assembled to help fight the Sun-Eater (although it was later revealed that the Sun-Eater did not exist). Notably, in this incarnation, the analogue of Emerald Empress is simply called \\"Empress\\" and is more a skilled melee combatant than a magic user, since this continuity's Emerald Eye is a sentient being with a will unto itself and a role in other developing storylines. In the Teen Titans/Legion of Super-Heroes crossover, Persuader used his \\"atomic axe\\" to bring Fatal Five teams from other dimensions, forming the Fatal Five-HundredTeen Titans #16 (November 2004) before the two teams are able to use the Cosmic Treadmill to banish the alternate Fatal Fives back to their original universes.Teen Titans/Legion Special (November 2004) =One Year Later= The Fatal Five has not been seen in the \\"Threeboot\\" Legion setting, but in The Brave and the Bold a version of the team was taken to the present day by the Lord of Time, to assist him in gaining a powerful weapon. When his plans were foiled by Batman and Blue Beetle he abandoned them in the 21st century. After Batman and Tharok were accidentally merged into one being, the group was returned to the future where they appear to be already in the Legion's prison. =Final Crisis= All five Fatal Five members were among the supervillains in Superman-Prime's Legion of Super-Villains. =DC Rebirth= In \\"DC Rebirth\\", Emerald Empress comes to the 21st Century to destroy Saturn Girl only to also fight Supergirl. To combat Supergirl after failing to take her down on her own, she forms the 21st Century version of the Fatal Five consisting of Magog, Indigo, and the sorceress Selena. In addition, Selena strengthens the Fatal Five by creating a mindless clone of Solomon Grundy. The Fatal Five then begins their attack on Supergirl. After breaking Indigo, Supergirl thwarts Emerald Empress' plot where she fades away to the future causing the people of National City to think that Supergirl killed her.Supergirl Vol. 7 #10-13. DC Comics. Members =Emerald Empress= =Mano= Mano is a mutant born with the power to disintegrate anything that he touches with his right hand, with his \\"anti-matter touch\\". A native of the polluted world Angtu, Mano must wear an environment suit because he can not breathe the atmosphere of most other planets. The suit's helmet obscures his face so that it can only be seen as a silhouette. Hating his people for mistreating him, Mano decided to destroy them all by touching the ground, and, \\"straining his power to the utmost\\", he obliterated his planet, causing it to explode. Considered one of the worst murderers in the galaxy, Mano was recruited by the Legion themselves to help defeat the Sun-Eater, after which he continued his criminal career, mainly as a member of the Fatal Five. =Persuader (Nyeun Chun Ti)= The Persuader came from a heavy-gravity planet; as a result, all of his physical capabilities such as strength and endurance are greatly enhanced. Before becoming a supervillain, he was a gangland enforcer who gained his name from his ability to thoroughly intimidate his victims.\\"The Fight for the Championship of the Universe!\\" Adventure Comics #366 (March 1968) The Persuader wields an \\"atomic axe\\" on a long shaft, resembling a halberd. This axe could reportedly cut through anything, occasionally including purely metaphoric or intangible things, such as a person's air supply, the force of gravity, or the separation between dimensions, and followed the Persuader's mental commands. =Tharok= Tharok is the leader of the Fatal Five, Tharok is a small-time crook, who tries to impress his bosses by stealing a small nuclear device. It detonates unexpectedly when the local police fire on him, vaporizing one-half of his body. The people of his world, holding life sacred, rebuild him using robotic parts. This boosts his intelligence dramatically, but leaves his evil tendencies unchecked. In his early appearances he wore clothing that only covered the organic half of his body. Tharok's cyborg brain also allows him to control Validus, the mindless monster member of the Fatal Five. One of the Fatal Five's main attempts to defeat the Legion is masterminded by the Dark Man, the being who organized several teenage refugees from the planet Dryad into the League of Super-Assassins.The Legion (and the Legion of Substitute Heroes) first encountered the League of Super-Assassins in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #253-254 (July–August 1979). During this time period, it is revealed that the Dark Man is actually a clone of Tharok, grown from tissue removed from Tharok's body during his cyborg reconstruction. When the scheme to destroy the Legion fails, both Tharok and the Dark Man are seemingly destroyed,Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #269-271 (November 1980-January 1981) and the Fatal Five eventually disband. Post-Zero Hour Following the Zero Hour Legion reboot, Tharok is introduced in Legionnaires #34 (February 1996). In this version he stole a powerful solvent rather than a nuclear device, and when the police shot at him the container was punctured. The solvent severed every molecular bond on the left-hand side of his body. A brilliant surgeon rebuilt him as a cyborg and an ungrateful Tharok then killed him. Tharok later upgrades his robot half, giving it more built-in weaponry. Post-Infinite Crisis In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis miniseries, most of the Legion's original continuity has been restored. The restoration of the original continuity was confirmed in the \\"Lightning Saga\\" and \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story arcs. Tharok (alongside the other Fatal Five members) was among the supervillains in participating in a massive assault on the Legion by Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super- Villains.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds (August 2008-September 2009) Thus, it is unclear if Tharok has encountered the Dark Man in current DC continuity, or if the Dark Man even exists at all. Powers and abilities In the pre-Infinite Crisis continuity, the entire left-hand side of Tharok's body is mechanical. It possesses great strength and durability, and the arm can be configured into various weapon forms. It also has a cybernetic brain that is connected to Tharok's own, giving him genius-level intelligence. In the current continuity, Tharok's upper body is wholly humanoid, while below his waist, he has a robotic carriage on wheels. =Validus= In the latter half of the 30th century, an entity known as the Sun-Eater threatened to consume Earth's sun, thus destroying the solar system. Desperate to stop the Sun- Eater's efforts, Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes recruited the aid of the Fatal Five. They discovered that Validus was among their ranks, but had no idea of his true parental heritage. The Fatal Five reluctantly agreed to help the Legion, and the Sun-Eater's efforts were averted. Validus remained a loyal member of the Fatal Five, always ready to do Tharok's bidding. During one memorable altercation with the Legion, Validus killed Lyle Norg, the original Invisible Kid. It was later revealed that Validus' origin supposedly stemmed from a diabolical plot by a powerful Legion foe. As revenge for his defeat in \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\", Darkseid kidnapped one of the identical twin children of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl at birth. He then sent the newborn back in time, cursed with a monstrous body and near-mindlessness (that made him easily controlled by the likes of the Emerald Empress) with the idea that either the parent or the child would kill the other. Years later, Validus fell under Darkseid's influence yet again. He manipulated Validus against Lightning Lad, placing him in a situation where the Legionnaire would be forced to kill him to save the life of his other son, Graym. Thanks to the efforts of Saturn Girl, however, the plot was averted and both parents discovered that Validus was their child. Soon after, Validus reverted to his normal, human condition. His parents soon renamed him Garridan. During the \\"Five Years Later\\" era chronicled in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4), it was revealed that Darkseid's tampering with Garridan's body chemistry had spawned a new virus which Brainiac 5 dubbed \\"The Validus Plague\\". Only natives of Winath and Titan (the homeworlds of Garridan's parents) were susceptible to the disease, but for them it was fatal. As a result, Garridan was forced to wear a containment suit, allowing him mobility yet keeping him in perpetual medical quarantine. His replacement in the reformed Fatal Five was a similar enigmatic behemoth named \\"Mordecai\\" by Leland McCauley IV. After the events of the Zero Hour miniseries, Legion continuity was rebooted entirely, and Validus' origin was changed considerably. He was no longer the child of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl, Darkseid had nothing to do with his creation, and he was also significantly weaker. In the \\"Threeboot\\" continuity, Validus was the name of a nature spirit in the folklore of the planet of Winath, known as the Lord of Lightning. Mekt Ranzz was a member of a cult that worshipped him. Since the Ranzzes gained their powers and left the planet the cult has grown considerably, seemingly granting everyone on Winath lightning powers. This was later revealed as the product of nanomachines in their blood. On the cover of Justice League of America (vol. 2) #13, it shows Validus as a member of the latest incarnation of the Injustice League. However, in the actual issue, he does not appear. Validus (alongside the other Fatal Five members) were among the villains in Superboy-Prime's Legion of Super-Villains.As seen in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds. However, Garridan Ranzz (along with his twin brother Graym) was recently depicted as a young child living with Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 6) #1 (July 2010). Thus, it appears that Validus and Garridan are not the same being in current continuity; or that this Validus is from a different moment in time. Powers and abilities The classic Validus possessed tremendous superhuman strength, enabling him to easily overpower even the Silver Age Superboy; in fact, on one occasion, it took the combined strength of Kryptonian-level heroes Superboy, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy just to knock him down, and on another, Superboy estimated that Validus possessed twelve times his strength. Validus was shown to be strong enough to tear an entire planet apart with his bare hands. In addition, Validus could fire energy bolts from his brain that were powerful enough to incapacitate a Kryptonian or Daxamite with a single hit. He was extremely resistant to all forms of harm and sometimes seemed not even to notice super-powered attacks against him by members of the Legion. He was able to fend off even the Sun-Eater in order to rescue Princess Projectra (showing that he was not innately evil). He was also capable of flight through space and was immune to telepathy. His first appearance did define some limitations to his power: He could be held in a cell with thick inertron walls, and it was believed that he could be executed with a bombardment of \\"anti-energy\\" (although that was not demonstrated). Depictions of Validus' strength and intelligence were not consistent over time. Toys * In 2007, Validus was released as part of the Legion of Superheroes Happy Meal toy set by McDonald's. * Validus was the Collect and Connect figure for the fifteenth wave of the DC Universe Classics line. Other versions A version of the Fatal Five appeared in Tangent Comics, where the team is composed of the Tangent Comics versions of Ice, Shadow Thief, Kid Psycho, Deathstroke and Count Viper. They next appear in a flashback in the Tangent: Superman's Reign miniseries (2008), in which they are shown to have slaughtered the second Atom. This version of the Fatal Five exist on Earth-97 of the old Multiverse, which has been reborn as Earth-9 of the new Multiverse. In other media * The Fatal Five made their first television appearance in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Far From Home\\" with Cara Kesh version of Emerald Empress voiced by Joanne Whalley, Tharok voiced by Tomas Arana, Persuader voiced by an uncredited Kin Shriner, and Mano and Validus having no dialogue. * The Fatal Five, consisting of the original five members (although both Emerald Empress and Tharok act as leaders), is one of the main villain teams on the Legion of Super Heroes animated series with the Sarya version of Emerald Empress voiced by Jennifer Hale in season one and Tara Strong in season two, Tharok voiced by David Lodge, Persuader voiced by David Sobolov, and Mano and Validus having no dialogue. The group appears in four episodes in season one. It is unclear when and how the group assembled in this continuity; the Sun-Eater storyline is adapted into the first-season finale, but the Fatal Five are the villains fought in the series premiere. The Fatal Five were released by Imperiex alongside the Legion of Super-Villains from their prison, though the group disbanded when Validus was taken by Imperiex, while the Emerald Empress was rendered powerless by Matter-Eater Lad and abandoned by her remaining teammates. Both Validus and Persuader were later seen operating alone, albeit under the aegis of Imperiex. * The Fatal Five appear in the DC Universe Original Movie Justice League vs. the Fatal Five. The team's line-up includes Emerald Empress (voiced by Sumalee Montano), Tharok (voiced by Peter Jessop), Mano (voiced by Philip Anthony-Rodriguez), Persuader (voiced by Matthew Yang King), and Validus. Tharok, Mano, and Persuader travel to the present to target Jessica Cruz so that she can take them to Oa where they can free Emerald Empress and Validus. During the fight against the Justice League and Star Boy, the Fatal Five are buried when the building they are in collapses on them.

The company was founded in 1922 as Kaufman Brothers, a wholesale candy store. The company opened a wholesale toy store in 1946, and ended its candy wholesales two years later to focus entirely on the toy industry. Retail sales began in the 1970s, under the name Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby. In 1999, the company operated 1,324 stores across the United States and was the second-largest toy retailer in the U.S., but it later declared bankruptcy in both 2004 and 2008 before going out of business on February 9, 2009. The company operated 461 stores at the time of its closure. International retailer Toys \\"R\\" Us acquired the remains of K·B Toys, consisting mainly of its website, trademarks, and intellectual property rights. Strategic Marks, a company that buys and revives defunct brands, purchased the brand in 2016, and planned to open new stores under the name beginning in 2019; plans for this revival, however, fell through due to a lack of funding. History Brothers Harry and Joseph Kaufman originally opened a wholesale candy store, Kaufman Brothers, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on April 1, 1922. During the 1940s, the brothers acquired a wholesale toy company from a candy client who owed them money for outstanding debts. On September 21, 1946, Kaufman Brothers opened a wholesale toy store at 70 Columbus Avenue in Pittsfield, marking the company's entry into the wholesale toy industry. In 1948, Kaufman Brothers Inc. ended its involvement in the candy business to focus entirely on the toy business, which was thriving by that time. In 1973, the company ended its toy wholesaling to become a shopping mall-based toy retailer known as Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby, with \\"Kay-Bee\\" named after the initials in \\"Kaufman Brothers\\". The company had 26 stores at the time. In 1977, the company name changed to Kay- Bee Toy and Hobby Shops Inc. By 1979, the company was based in Lee, Massachusetts. The company opened 40 new stores during that year, and stated that it was the nation's fastest-growing toy store chain, with 170 locations across the Midwestern and Eastern United States. =Ownership changes= In 1981, the Melville Corporation purchased the company from the Kaufman family for $64.2 million. At the time, the company had 210 stores. Richard Kaufman, the son of Harry Kaufman, retired that year from his position as company president. Donald Kaufman, Richard's brother, also once served as a vice president for the company. In 1983, the bankrupt Wickes Companies, based in California, sold 37 of its 45 Toy World stores for $5.5 million to Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby, which took over the leases of the acquired stores. As of 1990, the company advertised itself as \\"The Toy Store in the Mall.\\" That year, Melville Corporation purchased Circus World's 330 stores in 32 states for $95 million; the locations became part of the Kay-Bee division. In 1991, Kay-Bee Toys purchased K&K; Toys' 136 stores, located in 18 states; the stores were converted to Kay-Bee stores the following year. During 1993 and 1994, as part of a major restructuring plan, Kay-Bee closed approximately 250 stores that had underperformed. The company became a direct competitor to Toys \\"R\\" Us in 1994, when it expanded its mall locations and began opening stores known as KB Toy Works, which operated in strip malls and sold current and closeout toys. KB Toy Works stores were larger than regular KB Toys stores, which averaged . Additionally, the company operated KB Toy Outlet stores, also known as KB Toy Liquidators; these stores were located in outlet malls and sold closeout toys. During holiday seasons, KB Toys operated temporary stores in malls known as KB Toy Express. In 1996, Kay-Bee had sales of $1.1 billion, and was sold that year to Consolidated Stores Corporation at a cost of $315 million. Company sales reached $1.6 billion in 1998, the same year that its merchandise website was launched. The store logo was also changed to \\"KB\\" that year. As of May 1999, KB Toys operated 1,324 stores. That month, Consolidated Stores announced a deal with BrainPlay.com (which provided toy sales information) to operate KBToys.com. Through the deal, Consolidated Stores would invest $80 million and would own 80 percent of the new website, while BrainPlay would own the remainder. The new website would be based at BrainPlay's headquarters in Denver, and BrainPlay's website would become KB Toys' new website, which would compete against Toys \\"R\\" Us' website and eToys.com. KB Toys' website was revamped and relaunched in July 1999, as KBKids.com. At the time, KB Toys was the second-largest toy retailer in the United States. To increase the online presence for KBKids, Consolidated Stores partnered with AOL, which was visible to 17 million potential customers online. Through the agreement, AOL would provide links to the KBKids website. In September 1999, Consolidated Stores announced plans to sell 20 percent of KBKids through shares in an upcoming public offering. In October 1999, KBKids.com launched a $43 million advertising campaign, including television commercials, to promote the site ahead of the holiday shopping season. In January 2000, Consolidated Stores filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to have KBKids listed on the NASDAQ as a separate and publicly traded company with the ticker symbol \\"KBKD\\". The initial public offering was valued at $210 million. Consolidated Stores was unable to earn considerable revenue from KB Toys, and experienced financial losses during 1999 and 2000, partially caused by spending on KBKids.com; another factor was decreased video game sales at KB Toys locations. In June 2000, Consolidated Stores withdrew its plans for KBKids to become a public company, and announced plans to sell KB Toys. In December 2000, Bain Capital purchased the company for $305 million, in partnership with KB Toys' management team. The investment group included 200 store managers led by Bain Capital and by KB Toys' chief executive officer Michael Glazer. Bain Capital contributed $18.1 million to the sale, while the remainder was financed by banks that lent the money to KB Toys. The KB Toys sale included its various divisions: KB Toy Works, KB Toy Outlet, KB Toy Liquidators, KB Toy Express, and KBKids.com. The sale ended KB Toys' two decades as a subsidiary, turning it into a private company. KB Toys began focusing more on video games, which accounted for 20 percent of the company's revenue as of 2001. Starting that year, KB Toys opened temporary \\"stores within a store\\" at select Sears department stores during the Christmas season. The stores were initially known as \\"KB Toys at Sears\\", and averaged . During 2001, KB Toys agreed to pay approximately $5.4 million to acquire several inventory lots from the bankrupt eToys. =Bankruptcies and closure= In April 2002, through dividend recapitalization, Bain Capital received an $85 million payment from KB Toys, which financed the payment through $66 million in bank loans. Glazer received $18 million, while $16 million was divided among other executives. KB Toys suffered tough competition during the 2003 Christmas season, in addition to expensive store leases in malls with decreased customer visitation. Approximately 950 of the company's 1,217 stores were located in malls. With $300 million in debt, KB Toys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2004 and subsequently closed more than 600 stores, resulting in the layoffs of more than 3,400 of the company's 13,000 employees. Creditors stated that the 2002 dividend deal with Bain Capital had rendered KB Toys insolvent, resulting in a loss of $109 million leading up to the bankruptcy filing. Bain Capital stated that KB Toys was financially well at the time of the dividend deal, and that the company's financial problems later on were unrelated to the deal. In February 2005, KB Toys' creditors, including Hasbro and Lego, accused the company's top executives and majority shareholders of improperly providing themselves with multimillion-dollar payments prior to the bankruptcy. The creditors, referring to the April 2002 deal, alleged that the payments occurred during a decline in the economy and in KB Toys' business, and that the payments had a \\"devastating impact\\" on the company. During the same month, Big Lots (formerly Consolidated Stores) filed a lawsuit against Bain Capital, alleging it was owed $45 million from the 2000 sale. Big Lots' lawsuit was dismissed in 2006. KB Toys exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2005, with 90 percent of its ownership under PKBT Holdings, an affiliate of Prentice Capital Management. Bain Capital had attempted to retain control of KB Toys, which was instead awarded to Prentice Capital by a bankruptcy judge. Through the bankruptcy emerging plan, Prentice Capital invested $20 million into KB Toys. Gregory R. Staley, a former president for Toys \\"R\\" Us' U.S. and international units, was named as KB Toys' new chief executive officer. The company had 640 stores. In August 2007, the company announced a business strategy that included layoffs at its headquarters in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. That November, the company had 566 stores and began closing 122 of them. Because of poor sales at its mall-based locations, as well as competition, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 11, 2008. The chain began going-out-of-business sales that month. At the time, the company had 10,850 employees, including approximately 6,500 seasonal workers. The company had 277 mall locations, 114 KB Toy Outlet stores, 40 KB Toy Works stores, and 30 KB Toys Holiday stores, for a total of 461. It was the largest mall-based toy retailer in the United States at the time, operating in 44 states, as well as Guam and Puerto Rico. It was also the second-oldest operating toy retailer in North America (behind FAO Schwarz) before its demise. The store-closing sales (as well as the termination of the company's website) were concluded on February 9, 2009. The K·B Toys brand and related intangible assets were sold by Streambank LLC to Toys \\"R\\" Us on September 4, 2009, for a reported $2.1 million. Because K·B Toys' stores had been closed and liquidated, the sale applied mainly to the company's logo, website, trademarks, and other intellectual properties. Toys \\"R\\" Us was initially unsure of how to integrate the K·B name into its business plan. Toys \\"R\\" Us has used the K·B Toys name on self-manufactured toys under the name \\"KB Classics\\" with the K·B Toys logo. =Failed revival= Strategic Marks, LLC, a company that buys and revives defunct brands, registered a trademark for KB Toys in 2016, after Toys \\"R\\" Us allowed the previous registration to lapse. In March 2018, Strategic Marks founder Ellia Kassoff stated that due to Toys \\"R\\" Us going out of business in the United States, Strategic Marks planned to open 1,000 KB Toys pop-up stores across America for Black Friday (November 2018). After the holiday season, Kassoff would decide which stores would then become permanent. In early November 2018, Kasoff announced that the relaunch would be delayed until 2019, allowing the company to begin with \\"as few missteps as possible\\". Kasoff stated that the delay would \\"give us plenty of time to build out the most optimum supply chain, distribution and retail infrastructure our customers deserve.\\" Prior to the delay, there had been plans to open 400 to 600 seasonal pop-up stores in 2018, and 600 to 800 permanent stores within three to four years. In March 2019, Kasoff cited a lack of funding as the reason that the pop-up stores did not open as planned. He stated, \\"The toy companies had lots of conflicts of interest that prevented them from investing in KB given that they sell to other retailers, and mall operators don't typically invest in prospective tenants. It is taking a while to get this done and build out a strategy. Once we get the money together we will be off and running.\\" Strategic Marks sought an investment bank to finance the opening of 200 to 250 temporary KB Toys stores, which would determine whether permanent locations would be viable. As of August 2020, there has been no news from Strategic Marks about the KB Toys revival. Lawsuits In December 1999, The Equal Rights Center (TERC) and two black customers filed a federal lawsuit against KB Toys over one of the company's policies in which personal checks could not be used to pay for purchases at certain stores that experienced unusually high rates of returned checks. TERC alleged that KB Toys' policy was discriminatory against black people, stating that the policy was enforced at eight stores in predominately black neighborhoods located in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area. KB Toys denied the allegation, and stated that racial demographics were not a consideration when enacting the policy 13 years earlier. The company further stated that checks from white people were also not accepted at the stores specified in the lawsuit. By March 2000, the lawsuit had been amended to include three additional black plaintiffs, and the suit sought damages as well as an end to the company's check-writing policy. In January 2001, a U.S. District judge removed TERC from the case as it was not affected by KB Toys' check-writing policy. The lawsuit continued into 2003. In 2001, the district attorney for Napa County, California filed a lawsuit alleging that KB Toys misrepresented sale prices and that it sold returned items as new. The case was settled in August 2003 for $1.2 million. In 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed in Chicago against KB Toys, alleging that the company's stores engaged in using deceptive price tags to manipulate consumers into believing that they were buying products at a discounted price. The lawsuit was settled with KB Toys providing a one-week 30 percent discount on purchases of $30 or more.

Renaissance is one of four magnet high schools in the Detroit Public Schools district; (the others being Cass Technical High School, Detroit School of Arts, and Communication & Media Arts High School). Founded in 1978 on the former site of Catholic Central High School, Renaissance's first senior class graduated in 1981. A new building was dedicated in 2005 at the site of the former Black Africa hospital . Admissions Admission is selective. Originally, 8th and 9th grade students from public and private schools took a proficiency exam before admission. A combination of the student's grades in middle school or junior high and the exam score determined school admission. This policy was changed in 1994 to allow transfer students to attend the school, although they must fulfill the same graduation requirements as other students. In 2006, more than 75% of the student's body was African-American. Renaissance opened in 1978 with first-year (\\"freshman\\") and second-year (\\"sophomore\\") students. Its first four-year graduating class received their diplomas in June 1982. Academics The students of Renaissance must take seven courses a semester and complete a total of 200 community service hours in order to graduate. Although the students only take six courses a day, their schedules rotate in order to keep up with the seven course requirement. One way that the school provides students with the opportunity to fulfill the 200-hour service requirement is through its JROTC (Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps) program.

Early work The Actor model, first published in 1973,Carl Hewitt, Peter Bishop and Richard Steiger. A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence IJCAI 1973. is a mathematical model of concurrent computation. The Actor model treats “Actors” as the universal primitives of concurrent digital computation: in response to a message that it receives, an Actor can make local decisions, create more Actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received. As opposed to the previous approach based on composing sequential processes, the Actor model was developed as an inherently concurrent model. In the Actor model sequentiality was a special case that derived from concurrent computation as explained in Actor model theory. Robin Milner's initial published work on concurrency from the same yearRobin Milner. Processes: A Mathematical Model of Computing Agents in Logic Colloquium 1973. was also notable in that it positions mathematical semantics of communicating processes as a framework to understand a variety of interaction agents including the computer's interaction with memory. The framework of modelling was based on Scott's model of domains and as such was not based on sequential processes. His work differed from the Actor model in the following ways: * There are a fixed number of processes as opposed to the Actor model which allows the number of Actors to vary dynamically * The only quantities that can be passed in messages are integers and strings as opposed to the Actor model which allows the addresses of Actors to be passed in messages * The processes have a fixed topology as opposed to the Actor model which allows varying topology * Communication is synchronous as opposed to the Actor model in which an unbounded time can elapse between sending and receiving a message. * The semantics provided bounded nondeterminism unlike the Actor model with unbounded nondeterminism. However, with bounded nondeterminism is impossible for a server to guarantee service to its clients, i.e., a client might starve. Milner later removed some of these restrictions in his work on the Pi calculus (see section Milner, et al. below). The publication by Tony Hoare in 1978 of the original Communicating Sequential Processes was different from the Actor model which states:C.A.R. Hoare. Communicating Sequential Processes CACM. August, 1978. :This paper suggests that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method. When combined with a development of Dijkstra's guarded command, these concepts are surprisingly versatile. Their use is illustrated by sample solutions of a variety of familiar programming exercises. :... :The programs expressed in the proposed language are intended to be implementable both by a conventional machine with a single main store, and by a fixed network of processors connected by input/output channels (although very different optimizations are appropriate in the different cases). It is consequently a rather static language: The text of a program determines a fixed upper bound on the number of processes operating concurrently; there is no recursion and no facility for process-valued variables. In other respects also, the language has been stripped to the barest minimum necessary for explanation of its more novel features. :... :This paper has suggested that input, output, and concurrency should be regarded as primitives of programming, which underlie many familiar and less familiar programming concepts. However, it would be unjustified to conclude that these primitives can wholly replace the other concepts in a programming language. Where a more elaborate construction (such as a procedure or a monitor) is frequently useful, has properties which are more simply provable, and can also be implemented more efficiently than the general case, there is a strong reason for including in a programming language a special notation for that construction. The fact that the construction can be defined in terms of simpler underlying primitives is a useful guarantee that its inclusion is logically consistent with the remainder of the language. The 1978 version of CSP differed from the Actor model in the following respects [Clinger 1981]: *The concurrency primitives of CSP were input, output, guarded commands, and parallel composition whereas the Actor model is based on asynchronous one-way messaging. *The fundamental unit of execution was a sequential process in contrast to the Actor model in which execution was fundamentally concurrent. Sequential execution is problematical because multi-processor computers are inherently concurrent. *The processes had a fixed topology of communication whereas Actors had a dynamically changing topology of communications. Having a fixed topology is problematical because it precludes the ability to dynamically adjust to changing conditions. *The processes were hierarchically structured using parallel composition whereas Actors allowed the creation of non-hierarchical execution using futures [Baker and Hewitt 1977]. Hierarchical parallel composition is problematical because it precludes the ability to create a process that outlives its creator. Also message passing is the fundamental mechanism for generating parallelism in the Actor model; sending more messages generates the possibility of more parallelism. *Communication was synchronous whereas Actor communication was asynchronous. Synchronous communication is problematical because the interacting processes might be far apart. *Communication was between processes whereas in the Actor model communications are one-way to Actors. Synchronous communication between processes is problematical by requiring a process to wait on multiple processes. *Data structures consisted of numbers, strings, and arrays whereas in the Actor model data structures were Actors. Restricting data structures to numbers, strings, and arrays is problematical because it prohibits programmable data structures. *Messages contain numbers and strings whereas in the Actor model messages could include the addresses of Actors. Not allowing addresses in messages is problematical because it precludes flexibility in communication because there is no way to supply another process with the ability to communicate with an already known process. *The model of CSP deliberately had bounded nondeterminism [Francez, Hoare, Lehmann, and de Roever 1979] whereas the Actor model had unbounded nondeterminism. Dijkstra [1976] had convinced Hoare that a programming language with unbounded nondeterminism could not be implemented. Consequently it was not possible to guarantee that servers implemented using CSP would provide service to multiple clients. Process calculi and Actor model =Milner, et al.= In his Turing lecture,Robin Milner: Elements of interaction: Turing award lecture, Communications of the ACM, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 78-89, January 1993. (DOI). Milner remarked as follows: :Now, the pure lambda-calculus is built with just two kinds of thing: terms and variables. Can we achieve the same economy for a process calculus? Carl Hewitt, with his Actors model, responded to this challenge long ago; he declared that a value, an operator on values, and a process should all be the same kind of thing: an Actor. This goal impressed me, because it implies the homogeneity and completeness of expression ... But it was long before I could see how to attain the goal in terms of an algebraic calculus...So, in the spirit of Hewitt, our first step is to demand that all things denoted by terms or accessed by names--values, registers, operators, processes, objects--are all of the same kind of thing; they should all be processes. Thereafter we regard access-by-name as the raw material of computation... In 2003, Ken Kahn recalled in a message about the Pi calculus: :Pi calculus is based upon synchronous (hand-shake) communication. About 25 years ago I went to dinner with Carl Hewitt and Robin Milner (of CCS and pi calculus fame) and they were arguing about synchronous vs. asynchronous communication primitives. Carl used the post office metaphor while Robin used the telephone. Both quickly admitted that one can implement one in the other. =Hoare, et al.= Tony Hoare, Stephen Brookes, and A. W. Roscoe developed and refined the theory of CSP into its modern form.S.D. Brookes, C.A.R. Hoare and W. Roscoe. A theory of communicating sequential processes JACM 1984. The approach taken in developing the theoretical version of CSP was heavily influenced by Robin Milner's work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), and vice versa. Over the years there have been many fruitful exchanges of ideas between the researchers working on both CSP and CCS. =Hewitt, et al.= Will Clinger [1981] developed the first denotational Actor model for concurrent computation that embodied unbounded nondeterminism. Bill Kornfeld and Carl Hewitt [1981] showed that the Actor model could encompass large-scale concurrency. Agha developed Actors as a fundamental model for concurrent computation. His work on representing Actor abstraction and composition, and on developing an operational semantics for Actors based on asynchronous communications trees was explicitly influenced by Milner's work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). as well the work of Clinger. =Further co-evolution= The π-calculus, partially inspired by the Actor model as described by Milner above, introduced dynamic topology into the process calculi by allowing dynamic creation of processes and for the names to be passed among different processes. However, the goal of Milner and Hoare to attain an algebraic calculus led to a critical divergence from the Actor model: communication in the process calculi is not direct as in the Actor model but rather indirectly through channels (see Actor model and process calculi). In contrast, recent work on the Actor model [Hewitt 2006, 2007a] has emphasized denotational models and the Representation Theorem. Nevertheless there are interesting co-evolutions between the Actor Model and Process Calculi. Montanari and TalcottUgo Montanari and Carolyn Talcott. Can Actors and Pi-Agents Live Together? Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science. 1998. discussed whether the Actor Model and π-calculus were compatible with each other. Sangiorgi and Walker showed how Actor work on treating control structures as patterns of passing messagesCarl Hewitt. Viewing Control Structures as Patterns of Passing Messages Journal of Artificial Intelligence. June 1977. could be modeled using the π-calculus. Although algebraic laws have been developed for the Actor model, they do not capture the crucial property of guaranteed delivery of messages sent to Serializers.

Category:Actor model (computer science) Category:Process calculi ","title":"Actor model and process calculi history"},{"id":"3434316","text":"Michael Scofield, portrayed by Wentworth Miller, is a fictional character and one of the two main protagonists of the American television series Prison Break. The character first appeared in the series pilot, in which he deliberately sends himself to prison so as to break his elder brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), out before his execution for a crime he did not commit. The storyline of the first season revolves around the two brothers and Michael's plan to help Lincoln escape his death sentence. Later seasons detail their life on the run and their quest for the truth behind Lincoln's imprisonment. As the principal character, Michael has been featured in every episode of the series. Although both Lincoln and Michael are the main protagonists of the series, Michael has been featured more extensively than Lincoln, especially in the first season and the third. Various flashbacks from subsequent episodes provide further insight into the relationship between Michael and his brother, and the reasons behind Michael's determination in helping Lincoln to escape his death sentence. In the episode flashbacks, the younger Michael is played by Dylan Minnette. It is later revealed that Michael has low latent inhibition, a perceptually differing condition in which one sees the world as pieces, rather than mere objects. Appearances =Season 1= pilot episode revealing his escape plan to his brother Lincoln Burrows The opening scene of the series shows Michael's final preparation of his plan to infiltrate Fox River State Penitentiary; a tattooist is applying the finishing touches to Michael's tattoo, which is prominently featured in the first season. In order to get into Fox River, Michael robs a bank at gun point and pleads no contest at his trial, and requests that he be sent to the prison nearest to his home. Michael begins his sentence on April 11, exactly a month before Lincoln is set to be executed.As shown in the scene where Michael looks at the diary on Henry Pope's desk after the fight with Abruzzi in the series premiere. Once there, he scrutinizes every detail regarding the prison and its inhabitants. Given Scofield's educational background, inmates and correctional off ur dad is a sketntials would have thrown such a privileged life away to end up in a state penitentiary. Even more intriguing are his weird \\"habits\\"; he is often seen conversing discreetly with his brother during Prison Industry time and Chapel time; and the fact that he tends to execute a highly defined stare around Fox River's boundaries immediately from the point he got incarcerated as well as being called personally on command by the prison's warden himself, Henry Pope. The season follows Michael as he puts his plan into action while overcoming various obstacles. In the first 13 episodes, Michael is seen to have a specific objective in each episode that he must accomplish in order to build an escape route out of the prison. On the way, he recruits a number of people to aid in the escape: his cellmate Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) to help him dig, mob boss John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) to get him on PI (Prison Industries) and provide air transport once they escape, and Charles Westmoreland (Muse Watson), who he believes to be D. B. Cooper and can help finance their lives as fugitives. Michael feigns type 1 diabetes, giving him daily access to the infirmary (the escapees' exit point from the prison) and allowing him to build a relationship with Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), who happens to be the daughter of Frank Tancredi (John Heard), the Governor of Illinois. After agreeing to help Warden Henry Pope (Stacy Keach) finish his Taj Mahal replica in his office, Michael also forms a friendship with Pope. He also later stages \\"brief insanity\\" to gain access to the penitentiary's premises to gain contact with one of its insane inhabitants gifted with photographic memory, in order to re-acquire the portion of the tattooed blueprint that he lost after coming into contact with a steaming hot piece of metal. Michael's relationship with Sara is featured prominently in the nineteenth episode, \\"The Key\\", where he fails to steal the key to the infirmary from her. Although she finds out about his motive for being in the infirmary in the following episode, Sara decides to help Michael by leaving the infirmary door unlocked on the night of the escape. Towards the end of the season, Michael finally succeeds in helping his brother escape from Fox River State Penitentiary through the window of the infirmary, but also aids the escape of six other prisoners. = Season 2 = In the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Michael, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. Michael and Lincoln travel together, after the fugitives separate to accomplish each of their individual goals. When they fail to retrieve L. J. Burrows before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. There, they reunite with four of the other escapees: Sucre, C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), T-Bag (Robert Knepper) and Tweener (Lane Garrison). The seventh episode of the season, \\"Buried\\" marks the first time Lincoln and Michael separate, when Lincoln decides to go after his son, L. J., who has been released from prison. Michael fails to retrieve the money after being fooled by T-Bag. Nevertheless, Michael continues to execute his plan in order to meet the coyote at the 'Bolshoi Booze' location. Prior to leaving for 'Bolshoi Booze', Michael meets Sara at the location which he encoded in his messages to her inside the origami cranes. Thinking that she had declined his invitation to Panama, Michael goes to meet the coyote, who has the location of an escape plane to Mexico. There, Michael is reunited with Lincoln, Sucre and the brothers' father, Aldo Burrows (Anthony Denison). When Aldo is killed by Agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner), Michael and Lincoln decide to confront \\"The Company\\" and the conspiracy, and bid farewell to Sucre, who alights the getaway plane to Mexico. After a brief capture by Mahone, Michael and Lincoln are aided in their escape by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), who turns against The Company in an act of self-preservation. Kellerman takes them to Terrence Steadman, the man Lincoln is accused of murdering. Steadman's suicide forces Michael, Lincoln and Kellerman to find Sara since she holds the key to unlocking information that can expose the conspiracy. After Sara joins them, Michael, Lincoln and Kellerman head to Chicago, where Sara's father has hidden the information. On the way, Sara tells Michael that she has fallen in love with him and later in the same episode Michael reveals that he feels the same. With the help of former Fox River warden Henry Pope, Michael and Sara succeed in getting the USB drive in Frank Tancredi's private locker. After leaving Kellerman behind, Lincoln, Michael and Sara soon find that the recorded conversation on the USB flash drive could not be used as evidence due to its modified time-stamp, and decide to blackmail Reynolds instead. When this also fails, Michael and Lincoln are forced to escape to Panama; they are also forced to leave Sara behind after she is arrested. Upon discovering that T-Bag is in Panama City, Michael decides to capture him, which he successfully does. When Michael returns his boat with Westmoreland's money to find Lincoln missing, he receives a call from Mahone, who demands the boat and the money in exchange for Lincoln's life. Michael outsmarts Mahone and escapes with Lincoln. At his new boat, Michael and Lincoln are reunited with Sara, who tells them that Lincoln has been exonerated after Kellerman's testimony. Their happiness is short-lived when Agent Kim (Reggie Lee) arrives and threatens to kill Lincoln and take Michael to Sona, which causes Sara to shoot him. As the three flee from the scene with the police pursuing them, Michael and Sara separate from Lincoln and end up surrounded in a small isolated shack. After expressing their love for each other, they leave the shack. Unbeknownst to Sara, Michael confesses to Kim's killing and is arrested in her place. Michael is imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona (Sona Federal Penitentiary). Michael is the fifth member of the Fox River Eight to be arrested by the authorities, and the second not to die upon interception. =Season 3= In the season premiere, Michael witnesses a brutal duel between inmates, the usual manner of settling disputes at Sona. He unintentionally makes an enemy of a convicted influential drug lord in the penitentiary, Lechero. Lincoln informs Michael that The Company needs him to break somebody out of Sona (James Whistler), and that they have taken Sara and LJ hostage to ensure his cooperation. He began to look for Whistler, only to find that he has a bounty on his head: whoever kills him can receive exoneration from the mayor of Panama City. As a result, Whistler had gone into hiding in the sewers. Eventually, he found him and successfully persuades Lechero to remove the bounty on his head. With seven days to bust Whistler out of prison, Michael tried to take matters into his own hands and uses it to contact Sara and receive a coded message about her location. He relays this information to Linc, who unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Sara and LJ; Sara is apparently killed as a result. Michael then purposely shorts out the power, causing Lechero to call on Michael to fix it. Michael restores power to the prison and also manages to restore power to a previously broken electric fence. It is revealed that Michael fixed the fence so that the electricity will superheat a chemical that Sucre (who was hired as the new grave digger) sprays on it, as the heated chemical is able to melt steel. Michael spies on the Sona tower guards but is seen by the second one, due to the lens glare. He observed that at 3:13 p.m., there would be a glare which causes one of the guards to look over to the other side. After a small raid takes place, the prisoners are rounded up in the yard. Captain Hurtado questions Michael to the point that he unholsters his pistol and puts it to Michael's head. Whistler manages to intervene on Michael's behalf. With the help of Mahone, Michael concluded that by drugging one of the guard's coffee, they could distract that guard. As the escape plan continues Michael finally learns of Sara's death, which has a devastating impact on him. In a moment of weakness he seems to challenge Whistler to a duel death but this reveals to be only a diversion for the escape. This escape ultimately fails. When The Company decided to rescue Whistler themselves, Michael foils their plans but he was suspected of such an operation. At the end of the episode he is being escorted out of Sona and is kept in solitary, being interrogated. He evenly relented and told them about Whistler, who then revealed that Gretchen Morgan is in charge of the operation. Later Michael finds out the officers that were with Gretchen have been killed. Michael and Whistler are returned to Sona. It was then when they turned to a new escape plan, with the help of Lechero, and that is through a tunnel. Later in the tunnels with Mahone, Whistler and Lechero, he says they need braces to hold up the escape tunnel. Then, when part of the tunnel is about to fall, Michael puts a little piece of metal in to hold it up. Their escape plan was jeopardized with Sammy taking over Sona prison and investigating their escape, but Sammy was killed after the tunnel fell upon him. It is then revealed that Michael killed Sammy by taking out that little metal piece. McGrady joined the team in the escape. Later Michael, Whistler, Mahone, and McGrady escape from Sona, with Lechero, T-Bag and Bellick caught during the escape. Michael successfully tricks Gretchen into giving LJ and Sofia back safely. When a shootout begins out a museum in Panama, Michael grabs the gun from Linc's car and has Gretchen in his sights, but she escapes when police start to shoot at her. Later on outside the hospital, LJ gave him the same origami rose that Michael had given to Sara on her birthday. Fueled by revenge, he bids farewell to his family as he goes on a solo mission to hunt down Gretchen. =Season 4= In the season premiere, Michael has tracked down Gretchen and Whistler to Los Angeles as he prepares to avenge Sara's death. When Michael has both Gretchen and Whistler at gunpoint, Gretchen reveals to him that she had lied about killing Sara Tancredi. Unsure whether or not to believe her, Michael contacts Lincoln and then Bruce. When both Michael and Lincoln get arrested, Don Self tells them that they can either bring down The Company and get Scylla (A key card that stores every bit of information about The Company – essentially their \\"little black book\\") or go to jail. They refuse and are bailed out by Bruce. Bruce takes them to Sara where Michael and she joyfully reunite. A hired assassin named Wyatt eventually hunts them down and tries to assassinate them at Sara's safe house. It is then that Michael and everyone decide to take Self's offer. They are joined by Mahone, Sucre, and Bellick in their mission. To blend in with the crowds, Michael gets his tattoos removed via laser surgery. Throughout further episodes, Michael is seen to be experiencing health problems, getting nosebleeds and suddenly clutching his head in pain. He hides these from Lincoln and Sara, but in the episode \\"Safe and Sound\\" Michael experiences a bloody nose that he could not hide from Lincoln. Michael tells his brother \\"It's not a big deal.\\" and Lincoln replies \\"It was a big deal when you were thirteen...\\" It appears that Michael shared the condition with his mother; she during her childhood had frequent nosebleeds that stopped but resumed shortly before she died at the age of 31 of a brain aneurysm. This death was a discrepancy that was never directly explained when she turned out to be alive later in the season, however based on a statement by the General regarding prior results of a surgery, and later information revealed about Michael's mother, the explanation of the discrepancy is subtly implied. Michael is experiencing nosebleeds for the first time since 13 and is about to turn 31. In the episode \\"The Legend\\", Michael is no longer able to hide his sickness as he collapses in the warehouse. Sara takes Michael to the hospital where the doctors diagnoses him with a hypothalamic hamartoma, advising that emergency surgery is required or he might die. Unwilling to go into surgery until they get Scylla, Michael receives temporary treatment from Sara and goes onwards with their plans to break into The Company. Although the group eventually succeeds in getting Scylla, Self betrays them and takes it for himself to try to sell it. Michael, however, had taken a small piece of Scylla and Self needs that piece to make Scylla complete. Self goes back to find Michael and shoots the warehouse and a gas tanker to try to force them out. Fortunately, Lincoln was not in the warehouse at the time, and upon discovering Self's car outside, he finds Self at the top of a building and knocks him unconscious. They bring Self in and are about to get Scylla when Gretchen holds the group at gunpoint, allowing Self and herself to escape. Everyone except Mahone head to the hotel Self and Gretchen are staying at. Michael tampers with the ladder outside so that when Self tries to escape, it comes loose and Self falls to the ground. Michael takes this opportunity to grab Scylla from an unconscious Self, but as he is running away his nose starts to bleed profusely. He begins losing his balance and blacks out, falling to the ground. Self then catches up and takes back Scylla. As he is preparing to shoot Michael, Company agents appear and start shooting at Self. Self jumps into Gretchen's van and they escape. The Company agents lift an unconscious Michael into their van and drive away, with Lincoln running after them. Michael is then shown in a hospital bed, connected to many machines. A hand rests on his, and it is revealed that this is General Krantz. Lincoln visits The Company's headquarters and asks General Krantz to allow him to see his brother. The General leads Lincoln to Michael, assuring him that Michael is under the best medical care and that The Company's technology is years ahead of those currently provided to the general public. He also tells Lincoln that the only way they will operate and save Michael is if Lincoln brings Scylla back. In addition, General Krantz gives Lincoln a folder labeled \\"TOMBSTONE II\\", telling him that it is \\"added incentive.\\" With Mahone arrested by Agent Lang and Agent Wheeler, it is now up to Lincoln, Sucre, and Sara to retrieve Scylla from Don Self and Gretchen and to save Michael. With Sara by his side, Michael wakes up disoriented and weak. He asks her which hospital he is in, but Sara merely assures him he does not need to worry about it and that there are good doctors here to treat him. While Lincoln and Sucre go after Scylla, Sara stays with Michael and watches over him while he undergoes surgery. The procedure that The Company doctors use on Michael is nothing like anything Sara has seen before. General Krantz tells her that while the procedure is experimental, it has been used once before on a patient who ended up living a long and happy life. Because of the surgery, all of Michael's senses become active at the same time, causing him to have his life flash before his eyes. He suddenly sees himself back in his old cell at Fox River, with Charles Westmoreland greeting him. While conversing with Westmoreland and trying to figure out the truth behind Scylla in his subconscious, the Michael in surgery is dying and begins to flatline. The Company doctor injects an unknown serum into Michael as Sara panics and rushes to Michael's side, telling him not to give up. After finally realizing what Scylla really is and hearing Sara's voice, Michael wakes up. Later on, Michael tells Sara that he had a dream about Scylla, and he explains that Scylla is not actually The Company's little black book, but knowledge regarding a chemical combination that can produce energy equivalent to that of the sun's. Lincoln visits Michael shortly after, who is shocked to find out that Lincoln is willing to work with The Company to retrieve Scylla. He attempts to convince Lincoln to stop what he is doing and that The Company cannot be trusted, but Lincoln gives Michael the \\"TOMBSTONE II\\" folder and reveals to him that their mother used to work for The Company before she died, and that he is just \\"following the family business.\\" A preview after the season 4 finale shows Lincoln on the phone with Michael and says he will stop at nothing to get Scylla. Michael replies saying he will stop at nothing to stop Lincoln from succeeding. Michael and Sara are seen exiting a pizza restaurant when a Company assassin tries to kill them. They escape. They then bribe a truck driver to let them hitchhike with him, fearing police. He calls Lincoln and tells him he will stop him from getting Scylla and reveals that their mother is alive. The truck is eventually pulled over and searched for Michael and Sara, by an unidentified man. He pretends he does not see anything and he murders the truck driver, placing a phone call stating that he has them. Michael and Sara try to call Lincoln, but they lose the signal and the back lifter is stuck so they smash a vending machine to open the side door and they escape with the guy chasing after them. Michael kills him and takes a note from him asking who sent him. The guy's last words were, \\"Not Krantz.\\" He then dies. Michael and Sara stay at one of Sara's old friend, Deb's vacation apartment, with whom she went to med school. Michael and Sara check the note they took from their abductor. It reads: I10R4AZMS=I-10 near route 4 in Arizona Michael Scofield. The back side reads B2348ROCKWELL1630VS, which they do not understand. Michael texts Lincoln to meet up with him, but instead Mahone comes. Mahone asks if Michael can explain his plan against The Company and Michael refuses to, since Mahone is working with The Company. Michael learns that Christina ordered their abductor to bring them to her, but not kill them. This provides greater incentive to Michael to want to take down The Company. They head to Rockwell Avenue, where they find a car, gun, money,a cellphone and directions to a location they need to go. They head to an airport and check through a flight log list for the initials VS; they discover the name Vincent Sandinsky. They abduct Sandinsky and a car chase ensues. They are captured and Christina orders Michael and Sara to be killed; before they can be executed, The Company agents are killed by Lincoln, Mahone, and Self. Lincoln advises Michael to leave, but he refuses. Lincoln takes Sandinsky with him as a hostage. Michael and Sara, however, took Sandinsky's cellphone which reveals he and Christina used to be lovers. Also in this episode (Vs.) it is revealed Sara is pregnant with Michael's child. In the next episode, \\"S.O.B.\\", Michael calls Lincoln and informs him that Sandinsky knows everything. Lincoln advises him to leave Miami, but Michael still refuses. Michael calls Christina and wants to meet with her to make an arrangement if he gets Scylla. She agrees, and, along with her men, heads to the warehouse where Michael and Sara are. They search the warehouse and Michael puts baggies filled with chemicals inside Christina's SUV and puts the air conditioning on, setting it to full. When Christina and her men return to the car, she starts it and when the heat hits the bags, the chemicals evaporate, suffocating the occupants. Michael and Sara take this opportunity to abduct Christina and tie her up and put her in the trunk. When she regains consciousness, and she reveals to Michael that Lincoln is not his brother. His real parents, who were Company agents, were killed. Aldo adopted Lincoln when he was three. She never loved Lincoln like she loved Michael. Michael says Lincoln was a brother more than she was a mother: She left, he stayed, he fed him, kept him off the streets and kept him in school. According to the writer of the episode, Karyn Usher, on the episode audio commentary, what she told Michael was in fact a lie. Christina does not want Michael to keep saving Lincoln. Michael demands to know where Lincoln is, and she does not answer until Michael attempts to torture her. She reveals the location at an Energy Conference. Michael leaves, leaving Sara to watch Christina. Michael meets Lincoln at the Energy Conference where the Indian Prime Minister's son, Naveen Banerjee, is assassinated by Christina's men. Lincoln and Michael reunite, whereby Michael reveals to Lincoln that Christina set them up. The police then pursue them. In the episode \\"Killing Your Number\\", Michael is forced to save Lincoln from the clutches of his mother, or save Sara from the clutches of The Company. Michael is forced to try to kill his mother, but, when the gun is out of ammunition, Sara kills Christina, saving Michael. He manages to save both and hands Scylla to Paul Kellerman. After this Michael, Lincoln, Sara, Mahone, and Sucre are exonerated. After Sara and Michael have a thoughtful walk on the beach about the new baby coming, we see four years have passed and Sara and her child are in Panama. After her son, Michael, receives a temporary tattoo, she tell him that they are going to see his father. Sara, her child, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone meet at a beach, and walk up to a grave labeled \\"Michael J. Scofield\\" and Sara places flowers (lilies) on Michael's gravestone. =The Final Break= The movie starts with Michael and Sara getting married. They have a celebration at a restaurant by the beach, which is interrupted by a squadron of FBI agents who pull up to the area. They arrest Sara for the murder of Christina Hamilton (Christina Scofield). The only footage they had of the scene was where you could only see Sara shooting Christina, but not Christina's gun. Sara ends up in prison right across from the General and T-Bag. Michael is not allowed to see Sara as the FBI suspect he is planning an escape. As Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone plan the escape, Mahone admits that he was approached to be an under cover for the FBI to get his job back. In prison Sara is almost assassinated with rat-poison as General Krantz put a bounty of $100,000 on Sara. A man in the male prison tells T-Bag that his girl can do it for $40,000, however when her and Sara duel Gretchen comes in and kills Sara's attacker. When Gretchen figures out Sara is escaping, Gretchen tells Sara that she wants to come, and uses her saving of Sara as proof she can be trusted. In a secret code, Michael tells Sara to meet him at the chapel for the escape. Mahone tells the FBI that Michael decided to parachute into the prison. As a dummy drops in by parachute Michael sneaks under the FBI agent's car who is in charge of preventing the escape. Sara and Gretchen try to get to the Chapel by starting a riot. In the midst of the riot Gretchen gets shanked by another prisoner. Sara and Gretchen quietly sneak to the chapel, however Gretchen gets caught without revealing Sara's location. Sara continues and meets up with Michael. They eventually get to the exit point, but when Michael's key card doesn't work as expected, he tells Sara to carry on without him. Michael grabs the generator wires and puts two together to knock out the power. The door opens, but Sara sees an explosion as she leaves. Sara is unable to speak and Mahone informs everyone he is gone and they need to leave. Upon leaving, Mahone shows Sara and Lincoln Michael's medical records that he did not have much longer to live, and gave them a DVD on which Michael expresses his love to them both as well as his unborn child. =Season 5= Seven years after his apparent death, Michael resurfaces in Yemen, held in Ogygia Prison. A photo of Michael is sent to Fox River Penitentiary, given to the recently released Theodore Bagwell. Taking the photo, Lincoln travels to Yemen, alongside old friend C-Note. Michael is shown to be under a new alias, Kaniel Outis, does not acknowledge Lincoln or C-Note, claiming not to know them. During Michael's stay in Ogygia, it is gradually revealed that Michael, along with a fellow prisoner named Whip, are undercover CIA operatives, but were betrayed by a mastermind agent known as Poseidon. They manage to escape the prison, along with cellmates Sid and Ja, and ISIL leader Abu Ramal, who Michael was supposed to break out. The ISIL capture the group after Ramal betrays them, but they are rescued by Lincoln, while Whip kills Ramal, leading the ISIL to declare war on the group. After Lincoln demands to know how Michael is alive and in Yemen, Michael reveals that a few weeks before his wedding with Sara, he was contacted by Poseidon, who revealed that Kellerman did not have the legal authority to exonerate Michael's team, and offered legitimate exonerations if Michael agreed to cut contact with everyone and work for him. Michael's initial refusal led to Sara's arrest, after which Michael conceded. Michael decides to use the train station to escape the country, while Lincoln insists in going to the airport, where C-Note is waiting for them along a group of refugees. They are attacked by ISIL member Cyclops, resulting in Sid's death. The group then goes to the airport, but C-Note's party takes off before they arrive, forcing them to find another way to escape Yemen. The group confronts an untrustworthy contact named Omar, and after an attempted betrayal by him, forces him to take them to Phaecia, a human settlement in the desert capable of sending the group aboard. They are attacked by ISIL, who kill Omar. They are again pursued by Cyclops, and Michael lures him into the desert while the rest of the group head to Phaecia. Michael blinds Cyclops' remaining eye, but he is able to wound Michael with a poisoned blade. Ja helps the others find Phaecia, where they use fireworks to lead Michael to them, who falls unconscious after arriving. Ja decides to stay in Phaecia while the others leave on a boat to Crete, Greece. Lincoln calls Sara and informs her of Michael's condition, and Sara goes to Crete by plane, where she reunites with Michael and heals him. Upon seeing pictures of their son Mike, and Sara's husband Jacob, Michael reveals that Jacob is Poseidon. Sara returns to the U.S. to secure Mike. Michael reunites with his old friend Sucre on board the commercial ship upon which he is working. The captain of the ship learns about Kaniel Outis and alerts the authorities. Navy SEALs are dispatched to kill Michael. Sucre formulates a plan to force the SEALs away, which causes a frustrated Jacob to have a missile fired at the ship, which explodes just after the group jumps overboard. Concept and creation =Character creation= The character was conceived after Paul Scheuring, Prison Break's creator, developed an idea by another producer, about a man who deliberately imprisons himself to break somebody out. From the initial proposal, Scheuring then justified the character and story by making him a structural engineer who worked at the architecture firm that had access to the prison's blueprints. The name was originally used in Roald Dahl's collection of short stories, Someone like you, as Michael Scofield.\\"Inside Prison Break: Chain male\\" Sydney Morning Herald. February 1, 2006. Retrieved on October 22, 2006. =Portrayal= Michael J Scofield is portrayed by Wentworth Miller. For most of the first season of the show, Miller utilized a limited range of facial expressions which generated both positive and negative criticisms. It was for this performance in the first season that Miller was nominated for a Golden Globe. The Washington Post criticized Miller's performance as being \\"the most oppressive\\" and how \\"the actor apparently thinks it looks cool for him always to be scanning the surroundings...\\"\\"'Prison Break': Sharpen Up Those Spoons\\" The Washington Post. August 29, 2005. Retrieved on October 22, 2005. Entertainment Weekly recognized the numerous scenes the actor was present in by saying that \\"it's Miller's show\\" and on his performance, they stated that his \\"Michael Scofield has the silky voice of a sociopath, the resigned stance of a long-distance runner, and the deadpan delivery of Macaulay Culkin at his Uncle Buck best.\\"Prison Break Entertainment Weekly. August 26, 2005. Retrieved on November 17, 2006. On the other hand, The New York Times commented that although Miller does not show a wide range of emotion, \\"he projects an unflappable determination that confounds his fellow prisoners...\\"\\"Jailhouse Heroes Are Hard to Find\\" The New York Times. August 29, 2005. Retrieved on October 22, 2006. Regarding his character, Miller says, \\"First season, I think part of my challenge was to create, hopefully, a compelling character. But at the same time, there were so many things I could never show, because standing next to Abruzzi or T-Bag or Bellick, I could not afford to be vulnerable. I could not afford to crack a smile.\\"\\"Prison Break actors out of the box \\" Toronto Star. August 20, 2006. Retrieved on October 22, 2006. In the show's second season, the character of Michael Scofield shows a wider range of emotions as Miller explains, \\"He's going to have some lighter, more colorful shades... now that he's off with his brother, around whom I think Michael is willing to show a side of himself that he's not with others, there's a lot more that I can explore.\\"\\"Wentworth Miller on Prison Break Season Two\\" CanMag. August 17, 2006. Retrieved on October 22, 2006. =Tattoo= The tattoo, which covers the entire upper body of Michael Scofield, is featured extensively in the first season of the show and to a lesser extent in the second season. It contributes a major part to the plot of the series, containing various details of the protagonist's plan to escape from prison and from the country. Incorporated within the tattoo are the blueprints of the prison in which the protagonists are incarcerated during the first season. Wentworth Miller, who plays Michael Scofield, has commented that questions about the tattoo are amongst the most frequently asked questions when he is interviewed about the show.Ryan, M., \\"Wentworth Miller: Do not ask about the tattoo\\", Chicago Tribune. March 16, 2006. Retrieved on March 30, 2007. In the first episode of season four, Michael refused to take any painkillers during a night-long session in which the tattoos were removed by laser. Designed by Tom Berg and created by Tinsley Transfers, the tattoo took around five hours to be applied onto Miller. When the entire tattoo does not need to be shown, for example, in scenes where the actor is wearing a T-shirt, only the forearm pieces of the tattoo are applied. =Other= In the series pilot, Michael's jail entrance form held by Bellick shows that the character was born on September 8, 1978 in Toledo, Ohio (and the date in the Prison Break: The Conspiracy game states July 2, 1972. The birthdate is inconsistent with the characters' dialogue in later episodes. In \\"By the Skin and the Teeth\\", Michael remarks to Lincoln that their fathers left them thirty years ago. Since the series is set in the year 2005,\\"Wash\\", Prison Break season 2 episode 18. the birth date shown on the prop cannot be considered as canon. Thus Michael is 27 years old since last episode in Season 3, \\"Vamonos\\", took place on June 24, 2005. This is according to the expired one week ultimatum given by The Company to Michael for breaking out James Whistler. His age is stated by Lincoln for the first time in \\"Five the Hard Way\\" as 31, meaning all the facts above cannot be canon. It's also stated Michael is born in 1976 in the episode \\"The Mother Lode\\", but in \\"Killing Your Number\\" it's retconned to October 8, 1974. Before imprisonment into Fox River State Penitentiary Michael lived at 440 West Ardmore Avenue, Apartment 11 Chicago, Illinois 60660. Characteristics \\"always scanning the surroundings\\", and \\"has the silky voice of a sociopath (and) the resigned stance of a long-distance runner\\" and projected an unflappable determination that confounded his fellow prisoners, as, being close to Abruzzi or T-Bag or Bellick, he could not afford to be vulnerable or even appear human. Later, following the escape, Michael, now off with his brother, around whom Michael was willing to show a side of himself that he was not with the others; something that is lighter and more colorful. Michael often is outwardly taciturn and stoic, rarely allowing the dangerous element he's frequently surrounded by to penetrate his thoughts. Michael has been clinically diagnosed with low latent inhibition, a condition in which his brain is more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment. As a result of this condition, he is unable to block out periphery information and instead processes every aspect and detail of any given stimulus. This, combined with a high IQ (as a psychiatrist explains) theoretically makes him a creative genius. His intelligence is well noticed even by his enemies e.g. with Mahone in Season 2 making various comments about Michael's intelligence, even holding a certain admiration to him after successfully breaking out of two prisons (Fox River and Sona). He is even offered a place in The Company. Due to a feeling of abandonment and abuse during childhood, Michael developed and has very low, or absolutely no sense of, self-worth. With the low latent inhibition, this has made him become very attuned to all the suffering around him. As a result of being unable to block out other people's suffering, he is extremely empathetic and altruistic towards other people's emotions; this explains Michael's desire to make huge sacrifices to help others – he is more concerned with other people's welfare than his own. This particular attribute is apparently the product of his detrimental experience during childhood, where, as a child, his abusive foster father would often beat him and have him locked up inside a closet; and by doing so, Michael's eyes begin to adjust to the darkened environment, allowing him to scan objects around him which he can use for his own convenience. Michael had a very strong moral sense and was cool and reasonable. He knew that if he or his allies turn to kill rather than subdue their enemies, they will gradually lose themselves and eventually everything. Bellick, \\"T-Bag\\", Whistler and overall Gretchen, all people with much blood on their hands are only alive or survived as long as they did because Michael spared them. Michael's enhanced creative ability allowed him to design a tattoo with a hidden blueprint of Fox River Penitentiary that normal people couldn't discern. Over the course of four months, Michael had specific sections of the prison tattooed onto his upper body, hidden within gothic imagery. Each part of his tattoo had to be precise, which provoked the tattooist's comment to Mahone about Michael being a \\"detail Nazi\\" and that the tattoo was \\"some sort of inside joke\\" that only he got. Michael was also shown to be meticulous and well-prepared as he used his knowledge and intellect to achieve each step of his escape plan. With time, however, Michael developed (or was possibly born with) improvisation techniques. Tossed into Sona, he developed an escape plan, which ultimately fails. The failure leads to another escape plan which Michael realizes is a threat to his and Lincoln's safety, and stops it. After he escapes Sona and brings down The Company Michael orchestrates from the outside a plan to break Sara out of prison in a relatively short amount of time. The plan is successful but costs him his life in the process. This event is present in the movie Prison Break: The Final Break. Despite this, the return of Prison Break in 2016 casts doubt over his fate, with Garry Newman suggesting that this particular event in the straight to video film is likely to be ignored.
