An affiliate of the underground hip hop collective Tunnel Rats, the duo has recorded and toured both as part of the Tunnel Rats and independently. After joining the Tunnel Rats in 1998, New Breed appeared on the DJ Maj mixtape Full Plates with the song \\"What's My Name\\" in 2001, and later that year on the Tunnel Rats album Tunnel Vision. The duo released its first album, Stop the Music, in 2002, and then appeared on the Tunnel Rats albums Underground Rise, Volume 1 in 2003 and Tunnel Rats in 2004. A second album from New Breed, Nine, came out in 2004. History Elsie and Macho were born in Brooklyn and grew up in a Puerto Rican quarter of Boston. They later moved to Los Angeles, and started rapping together at around age 15 or 16. Macho attempted to put together a showcase for a youth group, and asked his sister to help. They performed an original song, \\"Time To Make A Difference\\", to enthusiastic response, and started getting requests for performances. In 1997, Elsie and Macho met the Tunnel Rats at a Cru-vention convention, and Tunnel Rats leader Dax Reynosa asked them to join with his collective. The pair took a year to pray and decide, and the next year met up with the Tunnel Rats in Florida and officially joined the collective. New Breed first appeared with the song \\"What's My Name\\" on DJ Maj mixtape Full Plates: Mixtape. 002. Later that year it recorded as part of Tunnel Rats on the groundbreaking Tunnel Vision, and on February 12, 2002, New Breed released its first album, Stop the Music, through Uprok Records. Critics received the album favorably, noting in particular the album's Latin influence that reflected the Puerto Rican heritage of Elsie and Macho. New Breed then recorded again with the Tunnel Rats for the 2003 Uprok compilation Underground Rise, Volume 1: Sunrise/Sunset. In 2004, it released Nine and then recorded on the third Tunnel Rats album Tunnel Rats. In 2005, New Breed appeared along with rapper Triune on the song \\"Texas Hold 'Em\\" by Dokument, from the album Planet Dok. Macho also released a solo extended play, Freedom, in 2005, and, after a long hiatus, released his debut solo album, Remember, in 2011.

The Amazon River basin may be the most speciose region for butterflies. Nine countries have territory in the Amazon River basin or immediately adjoin this region: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The Andes extends from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The fauna of the Andes is also diverse. Both regions have many endemic species. South America as a whole constitutes the Neotropical realm. Habitats in these two regions are very various and include Amazon rainforest, Atlantic forest, Llanos grasslands, Puna grassland and Valdivian temperate rain forest. Peru east of the Andes is regarded as the most important biodiversity hotspot in the world. The two regions (Amazon and Andes) are South America proper excluding the pampas plains of Uruguay and Paraguay which have a distinct butterfly fauna. Isolation has led to the evolution of endemic higher taxa. Instances are Ithomiinae, Dismorphiinae, Phyciodina, Pyrrhopygini, Eumaeini (over 1,000 species), Pronophilina and Eudaminae. Endemic genera (among very many) include Morpho, Agrias, Prepona Caligo, Cithaerias, Catagramma, Parides, Hamadryas, Nessaea, Marpesia, Melanis Mesosemia, Symmachia, Evenus, Memphis, Pierella, and Astraptes. Other higher taxa are most speciose in the Neotropics, for instance Riodininae. Many species, notably Heliconius, are members of complex mimicry rings. Adaptive radiation has led to many species being geographically diverse. Examples are Consul fabius and Mechanitis lysimnia. Notable entomologists associated with Neotropical butterflies are Jean-Baptiste Godart, Henry Walter Bates, William Chapman Hewitson, Hans Fruhstorfer, Otto Staudinger, Karl Jordan and Walter Rothschild, Anton Hermann Fassl, Hermann Burmeister, William Schaus, Eug√®ne Le Moult, Richard Haensch, Gustav Weymer, Ferdinand Heinrich Hermann Strecker, Andrey Avinoff, Carlos Berg, and Vladimir Nabokov.

He was involved as a member of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in the guarding of prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp and the Holocaust in Yugoslavia. Egner was on the List of Most Wanted Nazi War Criminals of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Life Egner was a member of the intelligence service of the Nazi Party, the SD. After the war, Egner emigrated to the United States. In 1965, he applied for U.S. citizenship, which he acquired the following year. He worked as a food and beverage manager before retiring in 1980. He lived quietly with his wife in Portland, Oregon. During his naturalization, Egner stated that he had been a Wehrmacht soldier, but concealed his involvement in the SD. Role as a Wachmann in Yugoslavia Egner served in an Einsatzgruppe, a majority of whose members were Volksdeutsche, during the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia. The unit murdered an estimated 17,444 Jews and Serbs from the beginning of 1942. They used specially adapted gas vans, closed vans that were fed the exhaust from the engine; the victims, locked in the back of the van, died from the carbon monoxide poisoning. The SD played a crucial role in the extermination of Jews, Gypsies, Communists, homosexuals, and other minorities during the Third Reich. Documents show that Egner, as a Wachmann (guard), escorted a train of Sinti and Roma men, women and children to Auschwitz. For a long time, Egner insisted that he was merely a Wehrmacht soldier who was shot and wounded in 1943. Judicial documents from 2010 show that he rose to be a sergeant in the Einsatzgruppen. Egner said that he lied at the time of his initial statements because he was \\"embarrassed\\" by his involvement in the SD. He swore that he escorted two other trains to Judenlager Semlin, where Jewish and Gypsy women and children were killed, many in gas vans, and a fourth train to Avala, where prisoners were shot and buried. Many of the Avala victims were killed in reprisal for partisan attacks on German and SS units. They had been interrogated at the security police headquarters. Egner was shot and wounded in 1943, though it was during a partisan attack. He insisted that he was merely a guard who neither saw nor perpetrated any crimes and knew nothing of the function of the camps. Serbia checked Egner's role in executions at Avala and Judenlager Semlin and issued an international arrest warrant. On 26 January 2011, Egner died of natural causes in a retirement home in Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle.

They are known for a large selection of unusual antiques, and an eponymous label of home furnishings both online and in-store. The flagship emporium opened in the village of Southampton, New York on Long Island in the spring of 1996. It sits on three acres of property, previously inhabited by a local garden center. The Southampton, New York store is unique for its extensive garden area filled with outdoor furnishings, plants, and garden ornaments. There are now Mecox stores in Manhattan, West Palm Beach, Los Angeles, Napa, Pittsburgh, Dallas and Houston.  History  Mecox was founded in 1996 by William McDowell Hoak (or Mac Hoak) after a seven-year career at Morgan Stanley and ten years of experience in corporate commercial real estate. He cites his passion for antiques, design, and fine furniture as the motivation behind combining his business knowledge and avocation to open the first Mecox location. The name Mecox originates with the Shinnecock Indians. The Shinnecock Indians had a small settlement they called Mecox, meaning flat or plain country, in what is now Southampton. In 1640, eight settlers including Edward Howell came to Long Island from Boston. Howell built a mill along the Mecox Bay‚Äîthe bay for which the furniture store was named. In the years following 1996, Mecox expanded to open their seven subsequent locations across the country. The New York City location, on Lexington Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side began as a pop-up store and became a permanent location soon after. Subsequently, each of the other Mecox furniture emporiums opened. Products Hoak and his team of buyers make multiple trips each year to country fairs abroad and other venues around the world from which they source many of their antiques, home furnishings, art, and other products. Mecox also partners with local craftsman, allowing customers to commission their own pieces either from redesigns of Mecox products or completely original designs. Mecox is unique in that they update their offers both online and at each individual location weekly, often tailoring furnishings and other products to the respective season or design trend of the moment. Their list of online collections includes: Antiques, 100 Newest Products, Furniture, D√©cor + Art, and Custom. Mecox has been featured in The New York Times, Architectural Digest, Coastal Living, Elle Decor, and other design related publications. In the spring of 2017, Mecox launched its first exclusive furniture line, The Mecox Collection, focusing on woven rattan, wood and rope designs.

Her father, William Ridding (1830‚Äì1900), was the vicar of Meriden and also played cricket, and her mother was Caroline Selina Caldecott. She was also close to Lady Laura (Palmer) Ridding, the wife of her uncle George Ridding. She won a scholarship to read Classics at Girton College in 1883 and was there until 1886. After this, she financed her further studies by taking up tutoring, including a job as a classics tutor in London. She was one of the first (and possibly the first) English woman Sanskrit scholars, and published a translation of BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a's portion of the KƒÅdambarƒ´ in 1896. She was a student of E. B. Cowell and, following his death in 1903, was instrumental in getting about 260 books of his as an acquisition (\\"Cowell Library\\") into the Girton College Library in 1904. She catalogued these books herself, and was the first woman to be officially employed in the Cambridge University Library, going on to catalogue many important collections. In 1923, when Cambridge University began to allow women to receive titular degrees, she got her Master of Arts degree. Apart from being a scholar in Sanskrit in Pali, she also knew a bit of Bengali and Hindi. In later life she was particularly interested in Tibet, and was a reviewer for Tibetan books in the Journal of Asiatic Studies. She was an admirer of Charlotte Mary Yonge, and presented her collection of Yonge's work to Girton College before and at her death.

The storyline aired as part of the show's 20th anniversary and would be the catalyst for several major storylines that aired the following year. \\"The plane crash\\" also saw the departures of three established characters; David (Kevin Harrington), Liljana (Marcella Russo) and Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). The actors' departures had been announced in May 2005, but it was not confirmed they would depart during \\"The plane crash\\" until their last scenes aired. The scenes featuring the flight were shot inside a real Douglas DC-3 aeroplane in Essendon. Filming in the DC-3 was difficult due to its small size. Special effects were added in post-production to make it look like the aircraft was moving, while strobe lights and smoke were used to create the effect of the explosion. The scenes featuring the aftermath of the crash were filmed over two days in a purpose-built swimming pool at the Global Studios in South Melbourne. A wave machine was used to create the effect of the ocean and pieces of fuselage were also dropped into the pool. Some scenes had to be cut because they would have been too disturbing to show in the soap's time slot. \\"The plane crash\\" received a mixed response from television critics. Darren Devlyn from the Herald Sun called it \\"the most controversial story arc in the soap's history\\". A Daily Record reporter thought previous disastrous events \\"pale in comparison\\", while another critic thought it was \\"incredible\\". Brian Courtis from The Age did not like the crash and asked viewers to \\"suspend your sense of disbelief\\", while an Inside Soap columnist thought the storyline was implausible and contrived. \\"The plane crash\\" received a nomination for Best Storyline at the 2006 Inside Soap Awards and has been included in several features about Neighbours' most memorable moments. Plot To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Lassiter's complex in Erinsborough, businessman and Lassiter's Hotel owner Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) decides to take some employees and Ramsay Street residents on a 1940s-style joy flight to Tasmania. Tickets are given out to Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Days before the flight, Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) takes part in a robbery, while Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey) fakes a burglary at his shop that he co- owns with Toadie and Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). Paul agrees to help Dylan and gives him a ticket for the flight, warning him that he might not be able to return home. Several of those given tickets choose to give them away; Harold gives his tickets to his son David (Kevin Harrington) and his wife Lijana (Marcella Russo), Karl gives his to his ex-wife Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and her fianc√© Alex Kinski (Andrew Clarke), Lou gives his to Serena and she invites Connor. Toadie decides not to use his, as he refuses to fly with Connor. Dylan invites his girlfriend Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), while Paul invites his girlfriend Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and his daughter Elle (Pippa Black). Six hours before the flight, a mysterious person enters a hangar and attaches a bomb to the aircraft's engine. Next to the bomb, the person places a picture of Paul and Izzy. As the aeroplane leaves the mainland behind and flies over the Bass Strait, the bomb detonates destroying one of the engines. Paul tries to find out what has happened, but is told to sit down by the pilots, who try to work out how to land the aeroplane. Everyone puts on their life jackets and Paul tries to assure David that the pilots have everything under control. Paul comforts Elle, Susan tells Alex that Karl will look after his children, Izzy calls Karl to tell him she loves him, David and Liljana kiss, Connor and Serena cling together and Dylan and Sky accept their fate. The pilots struggle to control the DC-3 and when it finally runs out of fuel, it descends quickly into the ocean. Serena and Connor become trapped under a piece of wreckage, and are forced to remove their life jackets to reach the surface of the water. Susan clings onto a piece of wreckage outside, calling for Alex. Izzy appears and Susan grabs her and pulls her over to her. When they hear Elle screaming for help, Izzy goes to her, despite Susan telling her not to. Susan slowly slips under the water. Paul, Izzy, Elle, Alex and Sky are found by rescue helicopters in the 24 hours following the crash. Susan is found after three days, having washed up on the shore. Connor and Dylan also wash up on shore, but decide to take the opportunity to be assumed dead and escape arrest. David's body is found the following week, while Liljana and Serena remain missing, presumed drowned. Dylan learns from the local newspaper that Sky is alive and his brother is facing arrest for the robbery. He decides to return home and he interrupts his own funeral. Weeks later, while doing some work for the Salvation Army, Harold discovers Connor living on the streets and persuades him to come home. A memorial service is held for David, Liljana and Serena. A devastated Harold blames Paul for the loss of his family and he strangles him. Paul eventually forgives Harold, as he himself believes that his bad actions towards others led to the bomb being on the aeroplane. Months later, Paul's son, Robert (Adam Hunter) confesses to planting the bomb in an attempt to kill Paul, Elle and Izzy. For several months, he had been masquerading as his identical twin Cameron (also Adam Hunter), who was in a coma. Robert placed Cameron's fingerprints on various weapons while visiting him, and left them for police to find along with diaries in Cameron's name that planned the bombing. Robert attempts to kill Paul, Elle and Izzy again, but his efforts fail. Robert is eventually arrested and sent to prison. Production =Conception and development= On 16 October, Kris Green from Digital Spy confirmed rumours about an aircraft crash storyline were true. Green reported that the storyline would be broadcast as part of Neighbours' 20th anniversary year. He revealed that a bomb would be detonated during a flight to Tasmania, sending the aeroplane crashing into the ocean. He also reported that three characters would die during the storyline and confirmed that those on board would be; Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), Elle Robinson (Pippa Black), Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey), Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher), Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie), Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne), Alex Kinski (Andrew Clarke), David Bishop (Kevin Harrington) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). Green added that the bomber's target would survive the crash, the three deaths would affect an older character who plans revenge, while two survivors would fake their own deaths to evade the police. At the time of the storyline's conception, there was a threat of terrorism in Australia and bombings had occurred in the UK and Bali. Neighbours producer Peter Dodds did not think there would be a backlash against the show and said they would not shy away from telling stories that could upset people who have experienced similar events. He told the Herald Sun's Darren Devlyn, \\"We feel we have made these episodes in good taste. No bomb-making is seen. I don't think the audience will make a connection (with Bali). I don't think people will be offended. There has been a great deal of consideration into how we have gone about creating this storyline. You don't lose any cast member without intense thought and planning and it took us a long time to settle on how we tackled this.\\" The show's line producer Linda Walker stated that the episodes would be the catalyst for major changes in future storylines. Walker explained that they would not be changing the whole show, but as a result of the crash, some characters would not be thinking rationally, and it would set up some major storylines for the following year. The 1940s' themed joy flight was set to commemorate 20 years of the Lassiter's complex. Bassingthwaighte said there was a lot of excitement in the build up to the flight, but also some tension as many of the passengers could not stand Paul Robinson. Izzy and Elle were also \\"at each other's throats\\", but hid their animosity from the others. When the aeroplane took off, viewers were aware that there was a bomb on board. The first indication that the characters got that something was wrong was when Izzy found a note near her seat that said \\"Think about your life and everything you've done.\\" Shortly after the aeroplane left mainland Australia and was over Bass Strait, the passengers heard a loud noise as the bomb detonated and it began to go down. Bassingthwaighte stated that in the confusion no one knew what was going on and initially thought it was minor engine trouble. As the aeroplane crashed into the sea and slowly began to sink, Bassingthwaighte said that everyone was terrified because it was dark and they did not know what was happening. The characters were left stranded in the middle of the Bass Strait. As they struggled to stay alive, their family and friends gathered together to wait for news of survivors. Once the scenes aired, it was confirmed that David, Liljana and Serena Bishop had been killed off. David's body was washed ashore, but Liljana and Serena's bodies were never found and it was presumed they had drowned. An announcement about Lara Sacher, Kevin Harrington and Marcella Russo's departures from the show had been released in May 2005, but it was only confirmed that they would leave as part of a \\"dramatic\\" storyline. Script producer Luke Devenish had teased their departures, saying \\"Lil and David have been at the very forefront of stories this year ‚Äì caught up in wicked Paul's web ‚Äì and their departure ties into this. The door will be left open for their return, however, despite the spectacular circumstances. Serena's final scenes will be nothing short of heartbreaking ‚Äì but very memorable!\\" It later emerged that Paul's son Robert (Adam Hunter) had caused the aeroplane crash. Robert made further attempts to kill his father, sister and Izzy, because he was angry that Paul had abandoned him when he was younger. =Filming= The scenes featuring the characters on the aeroplane were filmed aboard this Douglas DC-3 in an airport hangar The first half of the scenes featuring the flight were shot inside a Douglas DC-3 aeroplane in a hangar in Essendon. A real DC-3 was used to make the scenes look as realistic as possible. Filming inside the cabin was not easy as it was small and cramped, especially once the camera and lighting crews were inside. During filming, the actors who were in the shot were the only ones on board. Once their scenes were shot, they disembarked and their places taken by their co-stars. The camera crew also had to take out seats to be able to shoot from different angles. As the DC-3 was static in the hangar, special effects were added in post-production to make it look like it was moving. To create the effect of the explosion, strobe lights and smoke were used, while the cast had to throw themselves around the cabin. The scenes featuring the aftermath of the crash were filmed at the Global Studios in South Melbourne in a purpose-built swimming pool, once used for the Man O Man game show. The scenes took two days to be filmed and the cast spent around six hours in the pool, which was heated to prevent them from getting ill. There were also three divers on hand to make sure the cast were safe. Actress Pippa Black explained \\"Once the studio was blacked out for the scenes at sea, it was so eerie. We had a tiny bit of light to represent the moon, but that was it.\\" A wave machine was used to create the effect of the ocean waves and pieces of fuselage were also dropped into the pool with the actors. Black added that many scenes had to be cut because they would have been too disturbing to show in the serial's time slot. The scenes featuring Dylan and Connor washing up on the shore and becoming fugitives were filmed on Phillip Island and in bushland, an hour's drive from the Neighbours studios. Bodie joked, \\"It was fun (being) driven to insanity. You're killing rabbits, trying to find fish, howling at the moon!\\" Both Bodie and Harvey wore the same clothes for around three weeks and the wardrobe department could not wash them, to make the scenes more authentic. Bodie eventually grew attached to his suit, even though it was itchy and muddy. Reception When the storyline aired in the UK in 2006, it was watched by 6.75 million viewers. The storyline received a mixed response from critics. Darren Devlyn from the Herald Sun stated that \\"The plane crash\\" was \\"arguably the most controversial story arc in the soap's history.\\" Doug Anderson, writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, enjoyed the storyline branding it \\"the plane crash we had to have.\\" He also suggested Network Ten should have had a competition for viewers to select which characters should survive and die in a \\"Big Brother meets Agatha Christie\\" style. Anderson was upset at the thought of Susan Kennedy dying and questioned \\"They wouldn't kill her off, surely.\\" A Daily Record reporter commented that while the Ramsay Street residents were not strangers to disasters, all previous events \\"pale in comparison\\" to the \\"shocking\\" plane crash. Brian Courtis from The Age was not a fan of the storyline giving it two stars during his review. He quipped \\"suspend your sense of disbelief, appreciate the Flash Gordon modelling delights, wait for that squib to explode on the model plane and appreciate the lighting of the bath tubs standing in for the Bass Strait. It's all a little like The High and the Mighty, with Connor, Dylan, Sky, Izzy, Elle and the Bishop family instead of John Wayne. Used to be a time when they just sent the show's cast-offs to Brisbane.\\" Courtis later wrote that the crash was something the show \\"needed to happen\\" in order to boost falling ratings. Writing for The Guardian, Mark Lawson observed the storyline had turned Neighbours into \\"a Melbourne Medea, driven crazy, like so many modern soap operas, by the war for audiences in a business in which supply far exceeds demand.\\" Anna Roberts of the Western Mail branded the storyline \\"incredible\\" and noted that it had led to the death of \\"three of its most disposable characters.\\" The Sunday Mirror's Kevin O'Sullivan joked about wanting the characters on the aeroplane to die, stating \\"Dramatic scenes as a sizeable slice of the Neighbours gang went down in a plane crash on their way to Tasmania. But ‚Äì just as I was about to crack open the champagne ‚Äì the devastating news came through. They survived.\\" An Inside Soap columnist thought the storyline was implausible. They wrote \\"the plane tragedy that wiped out most of the Bishop family in Neighbours earlier this year just seemed too contrived.\\" The columnist could not believe that \\"crazed\\" Robert had planted a bomb on the aeroplane, adding \\"Pull the other one!\\" \\"The plane crash\\" was nominated for Best Storyline at the 2006 Inside Soap Awards. Ashley Percival from The Huffington Post UK placed the storyline on their list of Top 10 Classic Moments from the show. While the storyline came ninth in a Virgin Media feature on \\"Soap's most explosive moments\\". Sarah Megginson from SheKnows included the storyline in her list of the \\"8 Most Memorable Neighbours moments\\" and observed \\"No one was more shocked than Paul when it was revealed that the culprit was none other than Paul's son, Robert, who planted the bomb in an effort to kill his dad!\\" \\"The plane crash\\" was named the third weirdest Neighbours storyline ever by a contributor to LastBroadcast. Daily Record's Brian McIver called it was one of soap's biggest disasters, saying \\"The genteel and suburban Australian soap went all Dynasty to mark its 20th anniversary with a plane explosion and crash.\\" References Category:Neighbours storylines Category:2005 in Australian television ","title":"The plane crash (Neighbours)"},{"id":"42776159","text":"W291CL is a broadcast radio station licensed to Richmond, Virginia, serving Metro Richmond.

Between 150 and 200 people were on board at the time, of whom about 75 survived. As of 17 May, the official death toll stood at 54 with an unknown number of people missing. Background Ferry travel is common in Bangladesh as the country has many water ways. Enforcement of safety standards is poor ‚Äì an estimated 95% of small and medium-sized boats do not meet minimum code ‚Äì and accidents are common. Overcrowding and poor maintenance are often a contributing factor to accidents and the government has regularly vowed to strengthen enforcement of safety standards after fatal accidents. The difficulty of predicting storms, known locally as Kalboishakhi, often causes incidents in the months of April and May. In 2012, sank at roughly the same spot as the MV Miraj-4, killing at least 145 people. Accident On 15 May 2014, the double-decker ferry MV Miraj-4 was hit by a large wave as it traveled in the Meghna River, southeast of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Survivors said the captain had refused to take cover as a storm began to make the waters rough. \\"The sky became black and dozens of us pleaded with [the captain] to take the ship to the nearest shore as we saw the storm coming\\", remarked a survivor. \\"The storm unleashed three huge waves. The ferry survived the first two, but the third tilted and then sank the vessel within minutes.\\" After the accident, about 40 passengers swam to the shore. An additional 35 were rescued by fishing boats shortly after the accident. On 17 May, the wreckage of the boat was recovered and searched for bodies, bringing the official death toll to 54 when search of the wreckage was called off. Efforts to find further bodies in the river were ongoing. Miraj-4 had a listed capacity of 122 people. However, eyewitnesses said the actual number on board was close to double that. No log was kept, so the exact number of passengers is unknown. Initial reports said as many as 350 were on board, but, as of 17 May, the government estimated between 150 and 200 people had been on the ship at the time of the accident. Rescue efforts and aftermath The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) led rescue efforts, overseeing navy, coast guard, and police resources. An official investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accident. Initial reports said the surviving crew may have fled the scene after the disaster. BIWTA chief Shamsuddoha Khandaker said charges against the boat's captain would likely be filed. Relatives of the accident victims gathered on the beaches of the Meghna where victims were laid for identification. As rescue efforts drew on without success, the crowd grew angry, chanting slogans against the BIWTA. Some members of the crowd attempted to attack the salvage vessels when the search of the wreckage was called off. Compensation of 20,000 taka (~US$256) was offered to families of the dead.

Geography  The ruins of the Ramburg stand on the Schlossberg (\\"castle hill\\") at a height of above the village of Ramberg in the Palatinate region. The river Dernbach, the left-hand headstream of the Eisbach) flows through the valley. Other castle ruins in the vicinity are: Modeneck Castle (ca. 2 km east-northeast), Frankenfelsen Castle (ca. 2.5 km east-northeast) and Neuscharfeneck Castle (ca. 2 km southeast).  History  The Ramburg was built in the 12th century under the House of Hohenstaufen as an imperial castle for the protection of Trifels Castle. It is recorded as the seat of imperial ministeriales from 1163. In 1519, Hans of Ramburg, the last member of the House of Ramburg, sold his castle to the Dalbergs. Six years later the castle was completely razed during the Peasants' War. In 1540 the ruins were sold to the counts of L√∂wenstein. After being totally destroyed by a lightning strike in 1560 it was rebuilt as a residential castle again. The castle was plundered during the Thirty Years' War, but not destroyed. Until 1638 it remained occupied as district office (Amtsitz), but fell into increasing disrepair and was used as a quarry in the early 18th century.

The tab√≤ () is the traditional Filipino hygiene tool primarily for cleansing, bathing, and cleaning the floor of the bathroom. The tabo could most commonly be found in the provinces though it is also widely used in the cities. The word may be related to the word cebok in neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia, which describes the process of cleansing oneself using a tab√≤. The tabo can sometimes be translated into English as a \\"dipper\\" or \\"pitcher\\", but according to Michael Tan, chancellor at the University of the Philippines-Diliman and a columnist at the Philippine Daily Inquirer, that translation is weak. In his opinion article entitled Tabo' Culture\\", which was posted online at the Philippine Daily Inquirer website on May 24, 2011, Tan said that the tabo is much more than a dipper. For a stronger translation, use Tubby he said. The plastic tabo is an almost indispensable fixture in the Filipino home. Filipinos living overseas will bring their own tabo or even ask their relatives to send one over if ever they forget. During the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak, which resulted in panic-buying of toilet paper in some nations, the tabo became a source of internet humor. Tabo is also widely used anywhere in a household such as a measuring tool. 1 tabo is 1 liter. Usually, the old tabo is the used plastic container of 1 liter motor oil. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, it is possible that the Japanese took inspiration from the Filipino hygienic tool and implemented Hishaku (ÊüÑÊùì), a water handle made of bamboo. Other countries connote the use of the tabo akin to the a large Ladle (spoon).  History  The tabo is the Filipino's version of dipper that is also well known in other Southeast Asian countries that use their own version of a dipper. The \\"modern\\" tabo was created during the introduction of plastic by the Americans, using modern material to create the dipper instead of traditional coconut and bamboo. Back then, the tabo was called a sartin, from the Spanish sart√©n. In the past, sources of water were sometimes few and far between, causing the ancestors of today's Filipinos to develop the \\"sartin\\". Instead of standing up each time to be able to reach the water source and wash their hands, the sartin is passed around to save time and essentially, water, according to historian Lito Nunag from the University of the Philippines- Diliman. = Early use = The early tab√≤ dating back to the pre-colonial period used to be made out of coconut shell and bamboo, and it was not used as a toilet implement. The tab√≤ and its equivalent in many traditional homes in Southeast Asia is not so much a toilet item as an all-purpose household object. It is found at the entrance of the house, next to a terracotta water jar, a palay√≥k, so guests can wash their hands and feet before entering the house. There, the tabo speaks of courtesies, the host's as well as the guest's. In the traditional kitchen, the tabo is again found with the palay√≥k, which keeps and cools drinking water. The tab√≤ is strategically located there for the purposes of taking out water to drink and of washing of hands and/or dishes. The tab√≤ reflects an obsession with cleanliness, one which seems to have declined over time as the palay√≥k and the tab√≤ disappeared, or, in the case of the tab√≤, was relegated to the toilet and limited to its present, less sanitary function.  Usage  The plastic tabo is kept mainly in the bathroom and is used as a water dipper for various functions. The emphasis is on properly utilizing the tabo or else a mess will be made in the toilet. Its primary purpose is to clean. It is used to clean the toilet floor, to get water to flush the toilet, and most importantly, to get water for personal cleanliness: for washing the anus after using the toilet, for washing hands, for shampooing, or for bathing the whole body. Filipinos use the tabo in addition to or instead of toilet paper to wash after using the bathroom. Not all toilets in the Philippines have an automatic flush, so instead, a timb√¢ (generally a plastic pail with a metal handle) and a tab√≤ kept floating inside it is used. Upon entering the toilet, the pail should be checked if it has enough water. Filipinos thoroughly wash their hands after going to the toilet, using water and any available cleansing agent be it soap or a laundry detergent bar.  Culture  = Language = Michael Tan mentioned that in the 17th century, the Jesuit Ignacio Alcina noticed how different words were used in the Visayan languages to refer to washing the feet, the hands, and the genitalia. One of Tan's readers wrote to confirm this, giving the many verbs for different types of washing, many of which probably involved the tab√≤. = Adaptation to the environment = The tabo is crafted out of two of the more ubiquitous items in the Philippine natural environment: coconut and bamboo. The use of the tabo is ecological in the way it recycles coconut shells. More importantly with regards to the toilet, it allows an economical use of water, often a scarce resource in many of the homes of Filipino families. For this purpose, the traditional tabo loses in terms of effectivity in saving water to the modern plastic version. The traditional tabo was developed in a pre-toilet era. It takes less water than the plastic one, not enough for flushing the toilet. The plastic tabo takes just about the right amount of water, which can have enough force for flushing, but that also requires some degree of artistry in the way one douses the water. = Cultural issues = Non-Filipinos (apart from non-Filipino Muslims who use similar hygiene practices, or others from places in Asia and Africa where the use of water is normal) might find the practice strange but Filipinos may also find only using toilet paper strange. A controversy sparked in January 2009 when in a Filipino machine operator was reportedly sacked by an engineering firm in Australia allegedly for his toilet habits. A Townsville Bulletin report posted on news.com.au said that Amador Bernabe, 43 years old, who is a Filipino machine operator, was kicked out of his job by the Townsville Engineering Industries (TEI) for using water, instead of toilet paper, to clean himself during toilet visits. After conducting due investigation, the Filipino, in the end, got his job back in the firm.

The Deerfield attack was part of the decade-long Queen Anne's War (the 1702-1713 War of Spanish Succession on the Continent). Rebecca was eight years old. Eunice Williams was captured in this same raid, as was her father, the Rev. John Williams who wrote about his captive experience in The Redeemed Captive. Like Eunice and several other children from Deerfield, Rebecca Kellogg was adopted by Haudenosaunee Mohawks in the town of Kahnawake. She married and she raised children. Unlike Eunice, Rebecca Kellogg returned to British colonial territory as an older woman. She married Ben Ashley and she translated for several Congregational missionaries in Indian missions, including the Rev. Jonathan Edwards at the Stockbridge Indian Mission. Edwards expressed in many letters his admiration of her faith and of her interpretation skills. Although she had left Kahnawake, she often lived with the Haudenosaunee and identified as a member of the Mohawk. Rebecca Kellogg Ashley died in 1757 with the Oneida Haudenosaunee in Oquaga, New York. She did not leave any writings that are known but her life is visible in the writings of the missionaries with whom she worked. The Rev. Gideon Hawley wrote that the Haudenosaunee ‚Äúgreatly lamented‚Äù her death.

The precise date of his birth is not known: the directory of Cambridge University students identifies that he was aged 19 when he was admitted to Jesus College in February 1842, but also states that he was aged 72 at his death in 1896. Dowell batted and bowled in his first-class cricket matches, but neither his batting nor his bowling style is known. He played minor matches for Norfolk teams from 1844 through to 1870. He became a Church of England clergyman and was vicar of Dunton in Norfolk from 1855 to 1896. He had family cricketing connections: his daughter married Cambridge University and Surrey player Charles Tillard and their son, Elliot Dowell Tillard, played for Somerset and for teams in India.

Early life The eldest daughter of George Paton, a writing-master at Edinburgh and amateur violin, and his wife, n√©e Crawford, was born in Edinburgh in October 1802. She and her sisters received a good musical training: they were singers also, Isabella making her d√©but at Mary Ann's benefit at Covent Garden Theatre, 1824, as Letitia Hardy, and Eliza sing at the Haymarket Theatre in 1833. Mary Ann, aged eight, appeared at public concerts as a singer, performer on the harp and pianoforte (Giovanni Battista Viotti's concerto in G), and recited William Collins's Ode to the Passions and Alexander's Feast. The family settled in London in 1811, and she gave some concerts; but then took a break from performing. She had instrumental lessons from Samuel Webbe the younger, and after six years, began a career as a vocalist, appearing in 1820 at Bath, and in 1821 at Huntingdon. On the London stage Artaxerxes In 1822 Paton joined the Haymarket company, and on 3 August tried the role of Susanna in the Marriage of Figaro. With critical success she took the roles of the Countess in the same opera, of Rosina in the Barber of Seville, Lydia in Morning, Noon, and Night (George Frederick Perry), and Polly in the Beggar's Opera. She went on to Covent Garden, as Mandane in Artaxerxes, Rosetta in Love in a Village, Adriana in the Comedy of Errors, and Clara in The Duenna. Paton's reputation as a dramatic singer grew when, in 1824, she took the part of Agatha in Der Freisch√ºtz. A major triumph was her Rezia in Oberon, for which Weber conducted the 16 rehearsals, besides the performance on 12 April 1826, two months before his death. From that time she was considered at the head of her profession. In 1831 she was engaged at the King's Theatre, where she sang in La Cenerentola and other Italian operas. Returning to Drury Lane, she took the part in 1832 of Alice in Robert le diable. Later life As Mrs. Wood, she then went to reside at Woolley Moor in Derbyshire, with her husband. In 1840 they visited America for the first time. After their return she retired to a convent for a year, but she reappeared at the Princess's Theatre and at concerts, in which her husband was also engaged. The Woods finally settled at Bulcliffe Hall, near Chapelthorpe, in Yorkshire, and it was there that Mary Ann Wood died, on 21 July 1864, aged 62. Family Paton's father had insisted on her breaking off an engagement with a young medical man named Blood, who went upon the stage for a short time under the name of Davis. She married on 7 May 1824 Lord William Pitt Lennox; they were divorced in the Scottish courts in 1831. In the same year she married Joseph Wood, a tenor singer. She left a son, born in 1838.

The museum exhibits the history of Hawaiian sugarcane plantations and Alexander & Baldwin and its role in the sugarcane industry in Hawaii. The company itself continues in business and though it has diversified, it continues to produce sugarcane. The museum itself in the former mill manager's house. History Samuel T. Alexander (1836‚Äì1904) and his family in the 1880s Henry Perrine Baldwin Samuel Thomas Alexander (1836‚Äì1904) was a reverend and co-founder of an agricultural company. He met Dwight Baldwin in Hawaii. Alexander became manager of the Waihee sugar plantation near Wailuku in 1863 and hired Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842‚Äì1911) as assistant. In 1870 he formed the PƒÅia plantation under the name Samuel T Alexander & Co. With Baldwin, he purchased (2.3 km¬≤) between PƒÅia and Makawao, where they cultivated sugarcane. As of 1871 he also managed the Ha ªik≈´ sugar mill which had been constructed in 1861 by Castle & Cooke. The Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 removed tariffs on sugar exported to the United States. But to raise their production a steady supply of water was needed for the semi-arid dry forests of PƒÅia. Rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of HaleakalƒÅ mountain, so Alexander proposed a irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of HaleakalƒÅ to their plantation. Alexander knew about irrigation systems used since ancient Hawaii while he was at Lahainaluna, but this was on a much larger scale. He negotiated a lease of water rights from King KalƒÅkaua and raised financing from other partners. It was initially a 20-year lease for $100 per year. His brother James did a survey. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878 (at over three times the estimated cost), just before a deadline in the lease. In 1883 the Alexander family moved to Oakland, California, to get medical attention for his father, who died there August 13, 1884. After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew by selling water to adjacent plantations, and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. In 1884 Alexander arranged for the partners to buy the small American Sugar Refinery in California and later organized a group of Hawaiian planters called the Sugar Factors which became the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H;). Between 1872 and 1900, the company took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S;) from Claus Spreckels. By 1899, the company bought two of Maui's railroad lines. On June 30, 1900, Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd. was incorporated. Alexander eventually left off running the company and became an adventurer. In 1893 he bicycled through Europe. He traveled through the Pacific Ocean in 1896, including the Marquesas Islands where his parents traveled before he was born, China, and Japan. He also had a winter home on Maui called Olinda, and a summer home in Shasta County, California. Growing the business Paiia Sugar Mill The irrigation projects became so profitable that the Alexander and Baldwin partnership was able to buy out other planters and enlarge their holdings. By 1877 Baldwin had the Hamakuapoko Mill built on the southwestern side of Maliko Gulch near the irrigated fields, . The Haiku mill shut down in 1879. The Paia Mill opened in 1880, In 1881 the Kahului Railroad allowed the sugar to travel by train to the growing port of Kahului. In 1882 Alexander moved to Oakland, California, and enrolled his children in the schools there before returning in 1883 to become manager of the Haiku plantation. In 1888, Henry Baldwin and a few businessmen from Honolulu formed the Haleakala Ranch, consisting of on the slopes of the dormant volcano HaleakalƒÅ. Piiholo Ranch is part of that acreage, now used for tourism. Henry Baldwin hired Louis von Tempsky to manage Haleakala ranch in 1899, and Louis' daughter Armine von Tempski (1892‚Äì1943) wrote several novels and an autobiography about life on the Baldwin ranch. In 1889 the McKinley Tariff act raised tariffs on sugar exported to the U.S. market, and its price dropped to two cents a pound. Baldwin took advantage of the lower land prices and built an irrigation project on Kauai island called the Hanapepe ditch for the Hawaiian Sugar Company. He moved his family to Kauai for a few months before moving back to Maui in 1893. In 1894 a partnership with Alexander was launched to sell the sugar in California. In 1900, the partnership became officially incorporated as Alexander & Baldwin (A&B;). With offices in both Honolulu and San Francisco, it acted as an agent for other plantations as well. Eventually A&B; would evolve into a holding company for many other ventures, including shipping line Matson Navigation Company. In 1899, Baldwin supervised another irrigation project at Kihei. In 1903 he built another house called Maluhia at a higher elevation near Olinda, Hawaii surrounded by fruit trees. Keahua Ranch Company in 1909 became the Maui Pineapple Company. In 1905, he became an owner of The Maui News. His descendants continued to own the paper until 2000. =Legacy= Alexander & Baldwin became one of the \\"Big Five\\" corporations that dominated the economy of the Territory of Hawaii. A&B; is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and was added as part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average after purchasing Matson Navigation Company.

(2009). Der grosse Kosmos Hundef√ºhrer, 229. Kosmos: Stuttgart. Neither the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale nor the local Clube Portugu√™s de Canicultura has officially recognized it. It is an ancestor to both the C√£o Fila de S√£o Miguel and the Fila Brasileiro. This breed is fully different from the Barbado da Terceira.  History  The Terceira Mastiff comes from the island of Terceira, located in the Azores. It descends from local dogs, old Spanish and English mastiffs and bulldogs, the Dogue de Bordeaux and the Bloodhound. According to a legend, it once was very popular among the pirates of the region and soon became a popular fighting dog as well. In the 1880s, veterinarian Dr. Jose Leite Pacheco wrote the first breed standard and intended to make the nickname rabo torto as the official name of the breed instead of the c√£o de fila da Terceira. The Terceira Mastiff was already extremely endangered that time, which was one of the reasons why - despite of the Portuguese standard - it was never accepted by the FCI. In the 1960s there was an attempt to revive the breed with the aid of the Portuguese government. However, there was disagreement between government officials and breeders, which led to the project's failure. After this, the future of the Terceira Mastiff depended solely on local farmers and breed fanciers. In the 1970s, it was already declared extinct, although there were still some individuals left in the Azores. With these few individuals, the recreation of the breed finally began.  Appearance  Mastiff-type Terceira Mastiff, 20th century The Terceira Mastiff is a medium-sized molosser that represents the Fila or Dogo type and resembles the C√£o Fila de S√£o Miguel. One of its most remarkable features is an innately short, corkscrew-like tail. Its nose can be either black, pink or even brown. The colour of the short, smooth coat can be either fawn or yellow, always with a light mask. Red, brindle and black individuals are usually considered to be impure. The height is approximately .

In 2012, between his first and second brain surgeries, he was introduced to Rex Burkhead, then a football player for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team. Subsequently, a close connection developed between Hoffman and the team. On April 6, 2013, at the annual Nebraska spring game, Hoffman at age 7 entered the game during the fourth quarter and ran for a touchdown that received national and international attention. He subsequently met with President Barack Obama, received a Best Moment ESPY Award for 2013, and the United States Senate approved a motion recognizing his role in raising awareness of pediatric brain cancer. The Team Jack Foundation was formed by his parents, Andy and Bri Hoffman, to raise money for pediatric brain research. Background Hoffman was born and is growing up in Atkinson, Nebraska. His parents are Andy and Bri Hoffman and he has two sisters, Ava and Reese. On April 22, 2011 Hoffman was having breakfast with his parents when he became unresponsive. He was rushed to the local hospital in Atkinson, Nebraska, where he had a grand mal seizure lasting 30 minutes. He was then flown to Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, due to the life-threatening seizure. He was subsequently diagnosed with a brain tumor. While at the hospital, Hoffman continued to have up to 10 to 12 seizures per day even though he was taking anticonvulsant medication. On May 20, 2011 he had surgery, but the neurosurgeon could only remove a small portion of the tumor. Subsequent pathology showed that it was a cancerous glioma, pediatric brain cancer. Hoffman's parents then consulted Boston Children's Hospital for a second opinion. Neurosurgeon Liliana Goumnerova told the Hoffmans that she could remove the golf-ball sized tumor. On October 10, 2011, Hoffman had a second surgery. Over 90% of the tumor was removed and the seizures stopped. Surgery was followed by another 60 weeks of chemotherapy. In October 2013, Hoffman's father reported that an MRI revealed that the remaining tumor was the same as in an MRI done in June, 2013, indicating that the cancerous tumor was not growing. As of April 2014, his cancer was still in remission. Touchdown run During the time between Hoffman's first and second surgeries, his father called Keith Zimmer who was the associate director of Life Skills at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Athletic Department. He wanted to get a picture of his son with his favorite Nebraska football player, Rex Burkhead. Burkhead agreed and met the family in September 2011. He had lunch with the Hoffman family, showed them Memorial Stadium, and decided he wanted to keep in touch with Hoffman. On Friday, October 7, 2011, Burkead called Hoffman before his second surgery to wish him well. The next day Nebraska played Ohio State in a game nationally televised by ABC, and ABC announcers mentioned Hoffman's story. At halftime of the game, Nebraska trailed Ohio State 20-6. At that time Burkhead thought about Hoffman and he said to his teammates \\"Jack's not giving up and we're not giving up.\\" Nebraska ended up winning the game, 34-27, which was the largest comeback in Nebraska football history. In September 2012, Hoffman walked with the Nebraska players on to the field for their game against Wisconsin. In April 2013, as the spring football game neared, Jeff Jamrog (Assistant Athletic Director for Football) had the idea of getting Hoffman into the spring game. He ran the idea by football coach Bo Pelini the night before the game and Pelini approved. Jamrog told the Hoffmans about their plan to get Jack into the game that night and the Hoffmans quickly made a uniform for him to wear the next day. During the game, the Hoffmans were on the sidelines with the team. As the fourth quarter began, the Red team had fourth down and one yard to go on their own 32 yard line. Pelini called timeout and sent Hoffman into the game wearing number 22 (Rex Burkhead's number). As the play began, Nebraska quarterback Taylor Martinez initially guided Hoffman in the right direction and then he ran for a touchdown. When he reached the end zone, the players lifted him onto their shoulders in front of 60,174 people at Memorial Stadium. The story leading up to the touchdown run and the video of the run were covered extensively nationally and internationally. By April 16, 2013, a YouTube video of the touchdown run had been viewed over seven million times. Team Jack After Rex Burkhead met Hoffman, a bond began to grow between him and the Nebraska football team. The players decided to start an initiative to raise money for cancer research they called \\"Team Jack.\\" Team Jack sold 30,000 T-shirts and collected $275,000 in donations, which they gave to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. The Hoffman family subsequently established the Team Jack Foundation, which has raised almost $1.5 million for pediatric brain cancer research. Awards, celebrity, and influence President Barack Obama greets Jack Hoffman, April 29, 2013 in the Oval Office On April 29, 2013, the Hoffman family and Rex Burkhead met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office for 15 minutes. Obama told Hoffman that he was proud of him and gave him a football. When asked about his meeting with the president, Hoffman replied \\"I thought it was awesome.\\" In May, 2013, Upper Deck Company made a \\"Star Rookie\\" trading card for Hoffman. Upper Deck's sports marketing manager explained why they created the trading card: \\"Jack is the type of inspirational athlete who absolutely deserves an Upper Deck rookie card.\\" The sale of the cards has brought in $50,000 for the Team Jack Foundation. After attending the May 16, 2014, 19th Annual Dick Vitale Gala, where Hoffman signed a trading card for Dick Vitale, the Sarasota Herald- Tribune wrote: \\"Yes, he may be an 8-year-old celebrity, but really, he‚Äôd much rather be a regular kid.\\" Hoffman won an ESPY Award for Best Moment ESPY Award in 2013. Hoffman's touchdown run was listed fifth in The Best Emotional Moment in sports for 2013 by USA Today. Hoffman was also one of five nominees for Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated in 2013. Senator Deb Fischer offered a resolution to the Senate that states that pediatric brain cancer is a leading cause of death. The resolution also singles out Hoffman's touchdown run for increasing awareness of pediatric brain cancer: Cancer returns On August 5, 2014, Hoffman found out that his tumor had grown since his April, 2014 MRI. His father reported that in April, there was a spot in his scan, but that they had hoped that it was nothing. Hoffman will likely undergo further chemotherapy or surgery. After consultation with Hoffman's medical team, in mid-August 2014, his parents decided to pursue a clinical trial in Boston involving a genetic therapy approach in part because the cancer has spread to the brain stem making surgery difficult. After the 13-month clinical trial, Hoffman has been off cancer treatment since 2015.

Featuring a Latin-influenced East Coast hip hop sound that revealed the duo's Puerto Rican heritage, Stop the Music met with positive critical reception from critics. Lyrics and style AllMusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that Stop the Music \\"showcased Macho and Elsie's bold rhymes and decidedly Latin flavor.\\" Tom Semioli in his AllMusic review explained that the duo's use of sound blasts \\"tethers rhythms and harmonic motifs with funky bass samples and an in-the-pocket back-beat that echoes reggae and disco.\\" He described \\"Verse of the City\\" and \\"Stand\\" as expressing the duo's pride in its \\"ghetto savvy and learning\\", while \\"Stop the Music\\" at first tackles class conflict before unexpectedly veering inward to address fellow rappers. \\"Song Speaks\\", according to Semioli, \\"declares the spiritual importance of rap via jazzy piano riffs, scat singing, and thought provoking stream of conscious dialogue\\". CMJ New Music Monthly stated that > From tales of everyday struggle ('Stop the Music'), to lighter, feel-good > joints like 'Think' and the more spoken-word, jazzy flavor of 'Song Speaks,' > the album flows from the aggressive to mellow with ease, showcasing the wide > range of the duo's talent and its all-encompassing musical vibe. Cross Rhythms' Peter Bate proclaimed that > Unlike many of their peers, the siblings offer a vertical dimension thanks > to their faith which is forcefully expounded though never rammed down the > audience's throat. Listener suffocation is prevented by Latin-flavored > interludes, sparing blasts of soulful vocals and Fender Rhodes, most > effective on woozy closing track 'Outro'. Matt Jost from RapReviews.com said that > Clearly rocking an East Coast steelo and drawing influence from their Puerto > Rican heritage, New Breed spit hard rhymes over hard beats. Yet at the same > time you'll hardly get to hear a rap album as elegant as 'Stop the Music' > this year. Jost wrote that the Latin anthem \\"My People\\" > contains the token Latin instruments, rhythms and melodies that have > permeated contemporary pop music, but it sounds incredibly raw and real. > Further flavor is added by singer Dax Reynosa, who shares some of his > passion for his people with us (with Macho right behind him translating). Critical reception Stop the Music met with a warm reception from critics. AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, with Tom Semioli calling the album \\"a powerful debut disc of poetry, imagery, and melody.\\" Lisa Hageman of CMJ New Music Monthly in the conclusion of her review considered the album \\"An impressive, multi-dimensional debut from a duo to keep an eye on.\\" Peter Bate of Cross Rhythms rated the album nine-out-of-ten squares and concluded that \\"Rarely has keeping it in the family sounded so good.\\" Matt Jost of RapReviews.com scored the album eight out of ten, writing \\"highly professional on all levels, \\"Stop the Music\\" is based on the stable chemistry this brother/sister duo has developed over the years.\\" Jost found the album's production > a testament to the days of the boom bap, with every drum beat and every > bassline falling into place, producing the sonic boom that your speakers > love. Instead of raiding other people's sound libraries, producer Dert comes > up with his very own line of sound effects, presenting them in a fashion > that is guaranteed to provoke all kinds of body movements, from a reluctant > nod to joyous jumping - which both fall in line with the strongly felt > physical presence of the music itself. Jost concluded that > New Breed have a message, and it's got something to do with Christ. But let > me say they get props for incorporating it so wisely. As Elsie says: 'Search > what you want, but integrity's what you'll find.' So think of \\"Stop the > Music\\" as an album free of petty beefs, with music tight like that, think of > that historic album that never got its due props, an album Bob Marley would > nod his head to, an album that spreads wealth instead of hoarding it, an > album that is, in its own way, 'bigger than hip-hop'.

The disclosures and the handling of the disclosures, led to the resignation of Ireland's Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter. It led to the resignation of the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and the retirement of his successor N√≥ir√≠n O'Sullivan. McCabe was found to be subject to a smear campaign orchestrated by senior Garda officials, namely Dave Taylor, the Garda Press Officer, and former Commissioner Martin Callinan. The scandal had huge ramifications for both the Garda Siochana and the Irish government. It led to the resignation of Martin Callinan in March 2014, and Shatter from the Cabinet in May 2014. A new 'Policing Authority' was established to ensure that scandal within Garda Siochana remained at a minimum and that the Government could have more involvement with the daily operations of the organisation. The Irish government also pledged to launch a \\"new era of policing\\". Enda Kenny, who was Taoiseach for the majority of the scandal, apologised in D√°il √âireann for the damage caused to Maurice McCabe by Garda officials. The Disclosures Tribunal continued the investigation into the campaign against McCabe and O'Sullivan subsequently resigned after the tribunal's findings were published. Frances Fitzgerald, a later T√°naiste, resigned over apparent mishandling of emails that discussed details of the scandal. She was later proven to have acted appropriately as Minister for Justice and Equality by the Charleton Tribunal. Whistleblowers =Maurice McCabe= Maurice McCabe was a Garda Sergeant, who came to national attention as a whistleblower on corruption within the Garda S√≠och√°na, Ireland's national police force. During the early 2000s, he served as sergeant-in-charge at the Garda station in Bailieborough, County Cavan. There had been a number of concerns expressed by McCabe during his time as station sergeant. Incidents such as off-duty Gardai attempting to deal with a suicide situation. Among other incidents were Gardai making use of unmarked Garda vehicles while off-duty, along with issues over the number of hours the guards were actually working. McCabe lodged multiple complaints about slipping police standards in Bailieborough and the lack of initiative of several Gardai. McCabe resigned as sergeant-in-charge of the station in January 2006 after an investigation into an assault in Crossan's Pub in the town was mishandled. The Garda in charge of handling the situation had failed to investigate the incident properly and subsequently contacted the victim in the case. The victim was asked to withdraw the charges against the perpetrator. McCabe, who heard about this afterwards, was shocked and had \\"never seen anything like it within the force\\". McCabe lodged a complaint through the \\"confidential recipient\\" system. This system, which was part of PULSE, a computer program used by the Gardai, was restricted from Maurice McCabe on the 14 December 2012. Two senior Gardai travelled from Westmeath to his home in Cavan to communicate this to the Sergeant - an action that was unheard of within the force. McCabe later approached Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Transport Minister Leo Varadkar, who passed details on to Justice Minister Alan Shatter. Shatter asked for an internal garda inquiry into the penalty points complaints, with Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney failing to even interview McCabe. A letter from McCabe, read onto the Oireachtas record, said the way the matter had been handled had \\"destroyed me, my career and my family\\".Clifford, Michael. \\"Maurice McCabe's noble attempt to police garda√≠\\". Irish Examiner, 25 January 2014. Retrieved 25 January 2014 Shatter later wrongly accused McCabe of refusing to co-operate with his inquiry, a claim for which McCabe unsuccessfully sought an apology. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, at the time a TD, suggested McCabe be appointed Callinan's successor as Garda Commissioner. On 31 October 2018, Sergeant McCabe announced he was retiring from the Garda S√≠och√°na that night. =John Wilson= John Wilson (born 17 April 1963) is a former Garda, recognised for blowing the whistle on Penalty Points system irregularities within Ireland's national police force. Wilson first brought information of Garda penalty points malpractice to the attention of members of D√°il √âireann under the Garda Sioch√°na Act 2005 in 2012, having been unable to have the matter adequately handled within the Garda Complaints System. He left the force the following year, having served for more than 30 years (since 1982). In 2013, Wilson brought a High Court challenge to findings that he breached Garda discipline, but lost. Wilson later approached Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Transport Minister Leo Varadkar, who passed details on to Justice Minister Alan Shatter. Shatter asked for an internal garda inquiry into the penalty points complaints, with Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney failing to even interview Wilson. Wilson has recommended no tribunal, but has called for an independent public inquiry. \\"Maybe an independent High Court judge; I would settle for that.\\" He has asked that motorists who benefited from the alleged \\"corruption of Garda√≠\\" be interviewed. He also called for an apology from Shatter (who later resigned over the scandal) and from Kenny, saying that Shatter and Callinan \\"ridiculed\\" him for his actions. Guerin Report In response to growing concern at mismanagement within the Garda√≠ arising from the whistleblower's allegations, the Guerin Report into corruption within the Garda S√≠och√°na (Ireland's national police force) was published on 9 May 2014. This looked only at issues raised by the serving Garda, Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The report, compiled by Sean Guerin SC, investigated allegations that serious crimes were improperly investigated by the police and was critical of the treatment of whistleblower McCabe, who was harassed and subjected to death threats after attempting to disclose information. Alan Shatter resigned as Minister for Justice and Equality in advance of its publication. His successor Frances Fitzgerald immediately announced the establishment of a Commission of Investigation. Guerin recommended the establishment of a comprehensive Commission of Investigation whose terms of reference ought to include ‚Äúdefinite matters of urgent public importance‚Äù such as the case of Jerry McGrath, who was convicted of murdering Sylvia Roche-Kelly in Limerick while on bail in 2007. Guerin concluded: \\"No complex organisation can succeed in its task if it cannot find the means of heeding the voice of a member whose immediate supervisors hold in the high regard in which Sgt McCabe was held. Ultimately the Garda S√≠och√°na does not seem to have been able to do that. Nor does the Minister for Justice and Equality, despite his having an independent supervisory and investigation function with specific statutory powers. The same appears true of GSOC (Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission), although this review is hampered in that regard by the fact that GSOC has not made documentation available.\\" On 13 May 2014, the government discussed the report at cabinet. Maurice McCabe, the whistleblower whose work prompted the report, spoke of feeling vindicated \\"after six years of fighting the system\\". McCabe's fellow whistleblower John Wilson described the contents of the report as \\"disgusting, truly disgusting\\". On 15 May 2014, during a D√°il debate on the issue, Pearse Doherty named Garda Keith Harrison as the latest whistleblower. Disclosures Tribunal On 9 February 2017, a report in the Irish Examiner, and a subsequent Prime Time special, revealed how Maurice McCabe was treated in the aftermath of the scandal, including when he was reported to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, for child sexual abuse. This provoked outrage, with McCabe stating his intention to sue the State over the accusations. In February 2017, the government promised another commission of investigation into the 2017 allegations, to be chaired by Peter Charleton, a judge of the Supreme Court. McCabe demanded a Tribunal of Inquiry, which would take evidence in public rather than in private, and the government agreed to this after opposition pressure. Charleton formally opened the Disclosures Tribunal (Tribunal of Inquiry into protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and certain other matters following Resolutions) with an introductory statement on 27 February 2017. Public sittings commenced on 4 July 2017. The first week of this module examined the circumstances surrounding the creation of an incorrect sexual abuse report and whether it was seized upon by senior gardai to blacken Sergeant McCabe's name. At the end of November 2017, the second interim report of the Disclosures Tribunal found that claims by Garda Keith Harrison and his partner Marisa Simms were \\"entirely without any validity\\", that their allegations against social workers and police had \\"simply collapsed\\", and that social workers accused of abuse of office by them were \\"entitled to feel deeply upset at being targeted with such allegations\\". Garda Harrison said he was disappointed but not surprised by the findings. On 11 October 2018, the third interim report of the Tribunal was released by Judge Peter Charleton. It vindicated Sergeant McCabe, former Commissioner N√≥ir√≠n O'Sullivan and former Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald. It severely criticised former Commissioner Martin Callinan and former Garda press officer, Superintendent David Taylor.

During World War II, he served in the US Army as an intelligence officer. Levine was among the first Allied Forces to enter the Dachau concentration camp in Germany. He would eventually rise to the rank of Major General. After the war, he was active in the Chicago Jewish community.  Early life  Levine was born in Duluth, Minnesota, to Joseph and Sadie Levine. He was the eldest of four brothers. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1937. After graduation, he worked in retail sales before being drafted into the Army in 1942.  Military career  Levine graduated from the Army's Officer Candidate School in May 1943. He served with the 34th Anti- Aircraft Artillery Group as an intelligence officer. His unit participated in the D-Day invasion on Utah Beach, as well as the liberation of Dachau. The horrors Levine witnessed at Dachau would trouble him for the rest of his life. For a short time after the war, Levine assisted in the operation of a displaced persons camp. He assisted with the provision of food and clothing for, and the eventual resettlement of, more than 5,000 Holocaust survivors. During his military service, the Army sent him to engineering school so that he could acquire the skills to command a company of engineers. Levine was discharged from active military service in 1946. He continued his service in the Army Reserve, as executive officer of the XIV Corps in 1960 and rising to commanding officer in 1962. When the XIV Corps was deactivated in 1967, Levine was appointed commanding general of the U.S. Army's 84th Division (Training). He was promoted to Major General later that year, the rank he would retire with in 1975. In retirement, Levine served as chairman of a retired officers association for the Army in the Midwest. During his military career, Levine was awarded the Legion of Merit and Distinguished Service Medal.  Civilian career  In 1946, Levine, his brothers, and his cousins founded a small plastics company in Duluth that molded advertising and display signs. In 1948, he moved to Chicago to establish the Lakeside Plastics Sales Co., a separate sales division for the plastics firm. He retired in 1975. After his retirement, Levine served as the construction project manager for many north suburban Jewish organizations. He supervised the building of the Solomon Schechter Day School in Northbrook as well as two synagogues in Deerfield, Moriah Congregation and B'nai Tikvah. Levine also supervised the renovation of North Suburban Synagogue Beth El in Highland Park.  Holocaust speaker  The scenes Levine witnessed when he entered Dachau concentration camp on April 29, 1945 were so terrible that he refused to speak about them, even to his family. However, Levine believed, \\"the most important and effective method of preventing another Holocaust is truth and education\\". It was this belief that led to his speaking about his experience at Dachau nearly 40 years later. Levine attended a 40th anniversary memorial ceremony for the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. While at the cemetery, Maurice Pirot, a Belgian Jew, recognized Levine as one of his saviors, the soldier who had rescued him by carrying him in his arms. In May 1990, Levine recorded an oral history with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. He spoke about his life, wartime experience, and work with Holocaust victims. He also spoke at Chicago's 1995 annual Holocaust Remembrance Day. He spoke about his experience and the experiences of the victims he met there. Personal life Levine married twice. His first wife, Leah Goldberg, died in 1975. In 1980, he remarried Rhoda Kreiter, who survived him. He had one son and four daughters. Levine died of respiratory failure on March 29, 2013 in Highland Park, Illinois, at age 97.  Legacy  The Pritzker Military Museum & Library maintains a William P. Levine Collection containing an assortment of Levine's World War II-era military documents, maps, photographs, and artifacts. Per the Chicago Firearms Ordinance, Levine's German Walther PP 7.65-mm. handgun, which he brought back to the United States after obtaining permission from the US Army, cannot be housed at the museum; it is stored with other handguns at a gun range in Lombard, Illinois. The Moriah Congregation in Deerfield, Illinois, has a flag circle dedicated to Levine. The flag circle and garden landscaping were dedicated on June 4, 2006 in the presence of then-US Congressman Mark Kirk and Illinois State Representative Karen May.

Gilmer (n√©e Ford; b. Baltimore, Maryland) is an American mathematician and educator, notable for being the first African American woman to publish a non-PhD thesis.  Early life and education  Gilmer was born in Baltimore, Maryland. She studied for her Bachelor of Science degree at Morgan State University,, where she was part of the class of 1949. While there, she published two papers with her supervisor Luna Mishoe; these were the first two research papers published by an African American woman, being published in 1956, under her maiden name of Gloria C. Ford. She was also a student of Clarence Stephens while there. After receiving her MA in Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, she went to work on ballistics research at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and later to teach at six HBCUs. She studied for a PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but left after a year, later citing \\"a marriage, children, and the necessity to earn a living\\". She subsequently gained a PhD from Marquette University, in Education Administration. The title of her dissertation is \\"Effects Of Small Discussion Groups On Self-Paced Instruction In a Developmental Algebra Course\\".  Post- doctoral career  Much of Gilmer's work has been in ethnomathematics; she was described as a \\"leader in the field\\" by Scott W. Williams, a mathematics professor at SUNY Buffalo. An example of this research is when, based on fieldwork in New York and Baltimore, Gilmer and her assistants, 14-year-old Stephanie Desgrottes and teacher Mary Potter, observed and interviewed both hair stylists and customers in the two cities' salons, inquiring about tessellations in box braids (box-shaped tessellations resembling brick walls) and triangular braids (tessellations resembling equilateral triangles), two styles that restrict the movement of the hair when the head is tossed. While these hair stylists do not generally think of what they do as mathematical, Gilmer detailed the many mathematically-based patterns in these and other types of braiding and how they are found in nature, such as the tessellating hexagons found in braids that resembles the flesh of pineapples and the honeycombs in beehives. As an educator, Gilmer used these results to create classroom activities for students to understand the mathematics of hair braiding. In the early 1980s, Gilmer was the first African American woman to be on the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America. Between 1981 and 1984, Gilmer was a research associate at the United States Department of Education, where she was part of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement. In 1985 she co-founded and the Executive Board of International Study Group on Ethnomathematics (ISGEm), of which she was the President from 1985 to 1996. She was also the second person, and first women, to give the National Association of Mathematicians' Cox-Talbot lecture, which was named in honour of the first and fourth African Americans to receive PhDs in mathematics. As of 2008, was the president of Math-Tech, a corporation that aims to take new research material and create more effective mathematics curricula, particularly with respect to women and minorities.  Personal life  Gilmer married and had two children; her son became a lawyer, and her daughter became the president of Math-Tech. As of 2011, Gilmer lived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

It is 7.46 kilometres long and forms the left- hand, northern headstream of the Eisbach.  Course  The southern part of the Dernbach runs through the central Palatine Forest. Its source is located on the eastern slopes of the Langentalkopf, the summit of which is 526 m above sea level. From its origin, the Dernbach flows in a mainly southerly direction and picks up the waters of several other small streams as well as the Waltersbach, which is just several hundred metres long and joins it from the north, before reaching the village of Ramberg. In the village itself the Ohlsbach empties into it from the east. Next, the Dernbach flows through its eponymous village where, at the northern edge of the settlement, it is joined by the Leinbach coming from the east. Below the Vogelstockerhof farm, in the parish of Annweiler am Trifels, the Dernbach merges with the Eu√üerbach, which arrives from the right coming from the northwest, to form the Eisbach, a feeder of the Rhine tributary, the Queich.

It is analogous to aromaticity. It is based on the computed enthalpy of hydrogenation when compared to the reference compounds dimethylacetamide and azaadamantane-2-one. If an amidicity value is close to 100%, then the compound has very good amidic character (and is perfect at 100%); if the value is close to, or below, 0%, then the compound has a lack of amidic character. The scale is not restricted to these values; compounds with weaker amide bonds than azaadamantane-2-one will have amidicities below 0%, while compounds with stronger amide bonds than dimethylacetamide will have amidicities of above 100%. If the amidicity value is altered during an acylation, then this will act as a key thermodynamic component of the reaction.

It was written by The Kinks' primary songwriter, Ray Davies. Lyrics and music Like the two albums of the Preservation rock opera before it and Schoolboys in Disgrace after it, Soap Opera follows a storyline throughout the album. In \\"Everybody's a Star (Starmaker)\\", Ray Davies portrays the main character of the album, Starmaker. Starmaker describes himself as \\"a creator, inventor and innovator\\" who watches \\"the ordinary people, no matter what [their] occupation is.\\" He goes on to say that \\"everybody's a celebrity, and we've all got personality and individuality. We all read lines, and we all act a part, we all need a script and an audience to play to. No matter what you do, or who you are, everybody's a star.\\" He also claims that he \\"can turn the most ordinary man in the world into a star,\\" \\"no matter how dull or simple\\" he is. The track opens with a guitar, and goes on to have a short guitar solo later in the song. It also features female vocalists in the background (like many other songs that The Kinks recorded in their theatrical phase). Release and reception One month prior to its release on the Soap Opera album, \\"Everybody's a Star (Starmaker)\\" was released as the only American single from Soap Opera in April 1975. The single was not released in the United Kingdom, and it was backed with \\"Ordinary People\\" (the track that follows \\"Everybody's a Star (Starmaker)\\" on Soap Opera). It did not chart. However, the single edit appeared as a bonus track on the 1998 CD version of Soap Opera. AllMusic cited the track as a highlight from Soap Opera.

Due to his reclusiveness, he was known as \\"the millionaire with no face\\". Yoo was the chairman of Chonghaejin Marine, which operated the MV Sewol ferry en route from Incheon towards Jeju when it sank. The sinking of the vessel would later become known as the Sewol ferry disaster. After the Incheon District Court issued an arrest warrant on 22 May 2014, Yoo had gone into hiding and was South Korea's most- wanted fugitive. In June 2014, a male body was found in a field and on 21 July, it was reported that it was Yoo's.  Early life and education  Yoo was born in Kyoto, Japan to Korean parents on 11 February 1941. Yoo's family returned to Korea following the liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 and settled in Daegu, where Yoo graduated from Seonggwang High School.  Career  = Religious call = According to the U.S.-based non-profit organization Evangelical Media Group created by Yoo in 2001, \\"he first began to live for the sake of the gospel in 1961,\\" and that he \\"worked as an inventor and businessman to support the spreading of the gospel all over the world\\". Yoo was one of 11 students admitted to the Good News Mission Bible school established in Korea by American and English missionaries, but he was expelled. He founded what later became the Evangelical Baptist Church of Korea, also known as the Salvation Sect, in 1962 with his father-in-law, Pastor Kwon Shin-chan (; 192396). The church was held to be a cult by a conservative Christian denomination, the General Assembly of Presbyterian Churches, in 1992. = Acquisition of Samwoo Trading and founding of Semo Corp. = Yoo, while still serving as a pastor, got his start in business when acquiring the bankrupt textile company Samwoo Trading Co. () in 1976. He took over as CEO in 1978, and turned it into a toy manufacturing and export company. Yoo went into shipping when he founded Semo Corp. () in 1979, a holding company that came to span shipping, shipbuilding, domestic ferry businesses, electronics, real estate, cosmetics, paint, stuffed toys, pewter, and various other ventures. Semo started operating ferries on Seoul's Han River in 1986, two years before the city held the Summer Olympics. = Odaeyang mass suicide = Yoo came to public attention in connection with the Odaeyang mass suicide in 1987. Police were investigating accusations against a 48-year-old woman, Park Soon-ja, saying that she had swindled billion (~ million) from about 220 people. Odeyang Trading Co. was a firm that established by Park who used to attend Evangelical Baptist Church of Korea and Jehovah's Witnesses in the past. Yoo has denied any link to the group. On 29 August 1987 thirty-two members of the sect who believed in doomsday, including Park Soon-ja and her three children, were found dead, bound and gagged. Police assumed the event was a murder‚Äìsuicide pact, and the prosecution initially suspected that Yoo was linked to the case; but he was never charged, and the police closed the case as a mass suicide. After six people, including a former follower of Park named Kim Do-hyun, surrendered to authorities on 10 July 1991, the case was reopened and found money transactions between Odaeyang Trading Co. and a member of Evangelical Baptist Church. However, the money transactions revealed that they had nothing to do with Odaeyang Trading Co. case, and private loan of Odaeyang Trading Co. Those were normal payment remittances of goods between Park and the member of Evangelical Baptist Church before establishment of Odaeyang Trading Co. Yoo was arrested and, in 1992, convicted of \\"habitual fraud under the mask of religion\\" for his role in colluding with one of his employees to collect donations from church members in the amount of billion (~ million) and invest them in his businesses. He served a 4-year prison term. In November 2014, report says Incheon District Prosecutor's Office confirm in May there was no connection between Yoo and Odaeyang incident. = Semo Corp. bankruptcy = By 1990, Semo Corp. had 1,800 employees, but the ferry businesses suffered maritime accidents. In 1990, 14 Semo workers were killed when their cruise ship on the Han River was hit by another ship. The company was cleared of any liability for the incident. Semo grew into the biggest ferry operator by 1994, operating 30 ships, and once had nearly 3,000 employees. Semo Group filed for bankruptcy with more than billion (~ million) in debts amidst the 1997 Asian financial crisis, in the wake of a series of highly publicized scandals, citing business diversification as the cause of a cash shortage that had fuelled a rise in debts in its bankruptcy protection petition, and was liquidated. After Semo's bankruptcy, Yoo's family continued to operate ferry businesses under the names of other companies, including one that eventually became Chonghaejin Marine, and grew to become the monopolistic operator of ferries linking Incheon and Jeju. Chonghaejin Marine Company Ltd. was set up two years later on 24 February 1999, a day before a court approved the restructuring of the bankrupt Semo, and became a key entity to consolidate Semo's shipping business, taking over ships and assets held by Semo Marine, and had its debts written off. = Other ventures = According to Chaebul.com, an online information provider on large businesses, Yoo and his family own 30 business operators, with 13 doing business abroad such as in the U.S., Hong Kong and France. Their combined assets amount to some billion (~ million). The collective assets of the 13 overseas operations surged to billion (~ million) at the end of 2013. In France in 2012, Yoo made headlines prior to his photo exhibition in the Tuileries Garden at The Louvre when he through his public relations company, Ahae Press, bought the abandoned village of Courbefy for (, million). Yoo had seen it on CNN, and wanted to set up an \\"environmental, artistic and cultural\\" project in the village. Yoo has a wide range of other business interests according to official documents and information on company websites. He owns a plantation in the United States called 123Farm, one of the largest organic lavender farms in California started in 2001 at the site of the Highland Springs Resort, a property consisting of a 56-room hotel, conference center, and restaurants. Yoo was chairman of the board of the company that bought the resort in May 1990 for million. I-One-I Holdings subsidiary Dapanda owns 9.9percent of the Highland Springs Conference and Training Centre at the resort, according to regulatory filings. = Inventions = As an inventor, Yoo holds multiple patents, one being for a colonic irrigation system, for which he received an International Federation of Inventors' Associations' prize at the 2006 Seoul International Invention Fair. The invention is marketed in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, South Korea, Philippines, and Malaysia by NaeClear, and is sold in South Korea by the company Dapanda. It \\"arose from the concept of Hemato-Centric Health, which revolves around the blood as being the center of life.\\" supposedly a concept created by Yoo and his non-profit research organization Hemato-Centric Life Institute (New York) chaired by his younger son Keith H. Yoo (Yoo Hyuk-kee, ; born 1972); sponsored by NaeClear Co., Ltd. and daughter Yoo Som-na's company Moreal Design Inc., Yoo delivered keynote speeches at the 2010‚Äì13Hemato- Centric Life Forum meetings in Seoul organized by Hemato-Centric Life Foundation. = Ahae = Ahae (), which means \\"child\\" in old Korean language, was a nickname used in reference to Yoo in correspondence on an Evangelical Baptist Church website EBC World (). Through his PR companies Ahae Press, Inc. in New York, Ahae Press France in Paris, and Ahae Press Ltd. UK in London, Yoo has exhibited and marketed himself as the photographer who goes by the name Ahae. Yoo was unknown as a photographer before 2011. The project titled Through My Window began in early spring 2009 and continued for 4 years, during which time Yoo allegedly took about 2.7 million photographs, all through one window, which equates to a rate of roughly one photo every 60 seconds. The collection mainly consists of natural scenes shot through the window of Yoo's own studio. The location is the rural commune belonging to the Evangelical Baptist Church called \\"Geumsuwon\\" () east of Anseong south of Seoul, where Yoo lives. Yoo first exhibited Through My Window in the Vanderbilt Hall of Grand Central Terminal, New York City, in April 2011; co-produced by daughter Yoo Som-na's company Moreal Design, it was organized by Hemato-Centric Life Institute, and sponsored by Highland Springs Resort and Bear Family Green Club. His exhibition Through My Window: Vibrancy and Serenity was on display on the same location in October 2011. Yoo did not attend the exhibition that was unveiled by his second son, Yoo Hyuk-kee, known outside South Korea as Keith H. Yoo. Keith, as CEO of Ahae Press, curated his father's exhibitions. As a travelling exhibition, Through My Window was then on display in Europe at the National Gallery in Prague, Clarence House Gardens, Lancaster House, and Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, Vremena Goda Galleries in Moscow, Museo Nazionale Alinari della Fotografia in Florence, and in Magazzini del Sale, Venice. \\"Ahae\\" etched in stone at the Louvre in Paris, as one of its patrons. From June to August 2012, Through My Window (De ma fen√™tre) was displayed in a , four-story bespoke exhibition pavilion erected in the Tuileries Garden, that is administratively attached to The Louvre, in Paris. English film composer Ilan Eshkeri was commissioned to write a twelve-part tone poem. Pre-recorded in Abbey Road Studios by the London Metropolitan Orchestra the 46 minutes composition played alongside the exhibition, and was later released on Blu-ray Disc. For the gala dinner in the exhibition pavilion on 25 June 2012 Keith H. Yoo had commissioned British composer Michael Nyman to write a 26 minutes long piano quintet in four movements titled Through the Only Window. The work was subsequently recorded by Nyman Quintet in the Abbey Road Studios, and released on Nyman's record label. Herv√© Barbaret, deputy to former director of The Louvre Henri Loyrette, disclosed to L'Express in 2014 that \\"The Louvre did not pay a penny to organize this event. The artist paid the production entirely and paid a little more than (~, ~ million) to exhibit himself in the Tuileries\\". Ahae further donated million (~ million, ~ billion) to The Louvre. French magazine A nous Paris in its 25 June 2012 edition asked Keith H. Yoo the question: \\"The exhibition is a significant cost. Do you have any sponsors?\\" To which Keith answered: \\"No. We are funding everything with the money from our different companies. We are not interested in outside pressure and want to enjoy total freedom.\\" For his second solo exhibition in France, Fen√™tre sur l'extraordinaire (Window on the Extraordinary), Ahae rented the Orangerie Hall of the Palace of Versailles from 25 June to 9 September 2013. To mark the end of the exhibition, Michael Nyman was again commissioned, and wrote a 32 minutes long symphony in four movements for the occasion, Symphony No. 6\\"AHAE\\", representing the four seasons in nature as depicted by Ahae. French composer Nicolas Bacri was commissioned to write a 29 minutes long symphonic piece, his opus 130 titled \\"Ahae's Day (Four Images for Orchestra)\\". The London Symphony Orchestra was hired to premiere both pieces at L'Op√©ra of the Palace of Versailles in Paris on 8 September 2013. Both pieces have been recorded for a planned future release. Ahae was the sole patron of the Bosquet du Th√©√¢tre d'Eau (Water Theatre Grove) (fr) currently being recreated with sculptures by Jean-Michel Othoniel in the area of the Gardens of Versailles, donating million (~ million, ~ billion). Catherine P√©gard, head of the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles who administer the Palace of Versailles, disclosed that the exhibition was on a sponsorship basis, saying \\"The artist himself wanted to rent the Orangerie. But we never communicate the numbers.\\" Spurred by investigative reporting initially published by Bernard Hasquenoph, French Le Monde and British The Times wrote that Ahae gave million (~ million, ~ billion) to Versailles. Financial Times in its review of the Versailles exhibition wrote: The Economist wrote: Parisian newspapers Le Monde and Lib√©ration, several French art magazines, as well as Korean expatriates in France in an open letter on 12 June to French Minister of Culture Aur√©lie Filippetti, Catherine P√©gard, president of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles, Henri Loyrette, ex-president of the Louvre and co-president of the French-Korean Year, and Bruno Ory-Lavoll√©, director of the Forest Festival in Compi√®gne, have raised their concerns over French cultural institutions accepting self- financed exhibitions in return for donations. La Croix on 3 July wrote that French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius would write to Versailles to demand the termination of the Ahae sponsorship there. Ahae, through his company Ahae Press, was a patron of the Forest Festival, a classical music festival in the forests of Compi√®gne, northern France. His photographs were to be projected during a gala concert at Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial de Compi√®gne on 4 July 2014. The sponsorship commitment was (~, ~ million). Following the open letter on 12 June from Korean expatriates in France to, among others, Minister of Culture Aur√©lie Filippetti and the director of the Forest Festival, and subsequent talks between the festival and the Ministry of Culture, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on 30 June gave written notice to the festival suggesting the projection should be renounced \\"out of sensitivity and respect for the Korean people mourning [following the sinking of Sewol], in particular the families of the young victims, and in the interest of the Festival and of France\\"; the projection and the sponsorship was cancelled on 2 July. An Ahae exhibition produced by Ahae Press titled Les √©chos du temps de pr√®s et de loin (Echos of Time: Far and Near) for the opening season of the new Philharmonie de Paris was scheduled for 5 May to 28 September 2015, and a concert sponsored by Ahae Press on 15 June 2015 in Philharmonie de Paris featuring Nyman's Symphony No. 6 \\"Ahae\\" and Beethoven's Symphony No. 6 \\"Pastorale\\" was announced; both have been cancelled.

It was carrying 476 people, mostly secondary school students from Danwon High School who were travelling from Incheon towards Jeju. The sinking resulted in 304 deaths, and is the worst ferry disaster in South Korea since 14 December 1970, when the sinking of the ferry Namyoung cost 326 people out of 338 their lives. Sewol was operated by the company Chonghaejin Marine. = Ownership = Before his death, Yoo had widely been described as \\"the owner of\\" or \\"the de facto owner of\\" the sunken ferry Sewol, and was former chairman of Chonghaejin Marine. Son Byong-ki, Yoo's lawyer, stated on 25 April that Yoo \\"has no financial ties to Chonghaejin or its subsidiaries.\\" A press release from Yoo's U.S. publicist, Ahae Press Inc., stated that \\"[Mr. Yoo] does not own any shares, direct or indirect, of Chonghaejin.\\" Financial filings confirmed that Yoo had no stake in the shipping company. Yoo was the head of the family who partially own Chonghaejin Marine, and is believed to have exercised influence through a web of company cross-shareholdings. His two sons, Yoo Dae-kyun (; born ), and second son Yoo Hyuk-kee, are controlling the shipping firm through a majority stake in the investment vehicle I-One-I Holdings as well as 13 unlisted affiliates which through a tangled web of ownership structure own each other, a structure prosecutors describe as pyramid-like, and ultimately is controlled by individuals‚Äï Yoo's two sons and seven of his friends. Chung Sun-seop, editor of Chaebul.com, a website that analyses South Korea's chaebol business groups, said that \\"This kind of shadow management through his children or close aides is not uncommon among chaebol companies.\\" On 23 April investigators of the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office raided the head office of Chonghaejin Marine, and some 20 offices of its affiliates, as well as the office of the Evangelical Baptist Church in Yongsan, central Seoul. Prosecutors suspected that funds from members of the religious group had been used in business operations of Chonghaejin Marine and Yoo Byung-eun. The prosecution found more than 100 bogus companies, many of them set up and operated by followers of a Yoo's religious group, had paid Yoo and his two sons at least billion (~ million) for their \\"consulting services,\\" and had purchased photos taken by Yoo. Yoo's religious group denied cross- border transactions with affiliates of the ferry operator. The Prosecution secured video footage of a lecture Yoo delivered to the sect's believers in April 2010, in which Yoo admitted to have registered properties under the names of other persons. A lawyer representing Yoo Dae-kyun and Yoo Hyuk-kee said on 22 April that \\"If there is any legal responsibility, the owners are willing to offer their wealth and assets to help compensate the victims.\\" = Leadership = Michael Ham, managing director of Ahae Press and co-director of Evangelical Media Group, in a press release 25 April 2014 said: \\"Mr. Yoo does not have any involvement in the management or day-to-day operations of Chonghaejin Marine Co. ... I know that he has been spending every single day of the past four to five years focusing on his photography work.\\" Yoo's lawyer said that Yoo has been not been involved in corporate management since Semo went bankrupt in 1997. Investigators have obtained evidence indicating Yoo as the de facto leader of the company. One piece of evidence is a detailed list of all the company's staff prepared on 15 April 2014, a day before the sinking of the MV Sewol, which named Yoo as chairman of Chonghaejin Marine with employee number A99001, or employee No. 1 at the company, which was established in 1999. They also discovered a pay stub that records a payment of million (~) monthly over more than a year. They have also obtained testimony from others that Yoo was directly involved in managing the ferry operator. Sewol was remodeled between October 2012 and February 2013 to increase the number of passenger cabins and add a fifth floor, mainly used as an exhibition hall for photographs by Yoo (Ahae). The employee of Chonghaejin who was in charge of the refitting testified that he carried out the expansion under the direction of Yoo. Investigators found that Yoo has glossed over critical problems with the stability of the refurbished vessel. According to the prosecution, the regular captain of the Sewol testified that he had warned Chonghaejin Marine of serious stability problems with the vessel, and Kim Han- shik, the chief of Chonghaejin Marine notified Yoo of the risks of overloading it with freight in January 2014. Kim reportedly pointed out the ferry's weakened ability to recover left-and-right balance when tilted due to the extension in the number of cabins, and advised Yoo to sell off the ferry. Yoo allegedly told them to keep running Sewol as usual and put up for sale both the sister ship Ohamana and Sewol in March. On 20 May it was confirmed that the overloading and remodeling of the ship compromised its ability to maintain stability during the time of the accident. = Allegations and charges = Based on the evidence, prosecutors concluded that Yoo was the one who directs operation and execution of business, and planned to hold Yoo vicariously liable for the acts of the operator's crew members. Accordingly, the prosecution was poised to cite \\"negligent homicide\\" in its coming application of criminal law against Yoo. Yoo was charged with embezzlement, breach of trust and tax evasion. He is suspected of embezzling billion (~ million) from his companies, including billion (~ million) transferred overseas illegally, as part of a scheme to sell his nature photographs to his companies for tens of millions of won. He also owes an estimated billion (~ million) in taxes for the photos sold. Prosecutors also found evidence that Yoo's family set up several paper companies with no consultants, which then collected some billion (~ million) in consulting fees from companies related to Semo Group over the last few years. They are also looking into circumstantial evidence that Yoo's family has claimed commission fees of tens of billions of won from the related companies for the use of trademark rights for names like Sewol. On 30 June, the Prosecution announced its intention to indict Yoo, irrespective of whether or not he was apprehended, citing \\"homicide by negligence\\" in the charges. = Investigation = Yoo made no known public appearances since the Sewol sank. Within the first week of investigation the Ministry of Justice banned Yoo, his eldest son Yoo Dae-kyun, and more than 60 other employees in various companies owned by Yoo or his sons from leaving South Korea. Son Byeong-gi, a lawyer representing both Yoo, Chonghaejin Marine, and I-One-I Holdings, said on 22 April that \\"If there is any legal responsibility, the owners are willing to offer their wealth and assets to help compensate the victims.\\" The Park Geun- hye administration pledged to exercise the right to indemnity against Yoo and Chonghaejin Marine as soon as the state compensates victims' families. The combined damages from the sinking of the Sewol are estimated to reach trillion (~ billion). The accumulated value of the assets owned by Yoo and his family is estimated at over billion (~ million). It includes an estimated billion (~ million) held by Yoo himself, billion (~ million) by eldest daughter Yoo Som- na, billion (~ million) by eldest son Yoo Dae-kyun, and billion (~ million) by the second son Yoo Hyuk-kee. Son Byeong-gi representing Yoo told the Chosun Ilbo on 24 April that reports that Yoo's assets total billion were not true, but that Yoo had \\"voiced his willingness to donate his entire billion (~ million) estate due to his deep sorrow for those who lost their lives aboard the Sewol.\\" A prosecution official investigating Yoo's holdings said there was a \\"huge gap\\" between what the former chairman claimed he was worth and what investigators had found out so far. Son claimed on 25 April that he had been misunderstood and by billion had meant \\"tens of billions\\" of won, and that Yoo was willing to donate his \\"entire\\" assets, whatever their size. Son later resigned as lawyer for the family on 15 May. A financier of the Evangelical Baptist Church of Korea was summoned for questioning on 24 April to trace deals between the sect and companies run by Yoo and his two sons. Transcripts of land registers showed that four days later Yoo and his family signed over some 24 properties worth around billion (~ million) to the Evangelical Baptist Church of Korea on 28 and 29 April. On 13 May, the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office summoned Yoo to appear for questioning by 16 May, but he failed to heed the call, and was presumed hiding in the church compound Geumsuwon south of Seoul. All of Yoo's children and a number of key suspects had ignored the summons. Yoo failed to appear at a court hearing on 20 May. On 22 May the Incheon District Court issued an arrest warrant and Korean authorities offered a million () reward for information leading to the arrest of Yoo. On 25 May the reward was raised tenfold to million (). Prosecutors warned on 24 May that anyone who helps Yoo in hiding faces up to three years in prison. Four members of Yoo's religious group were arrested 25 May for assisting Yoo to escape detection by the police. On 26 May Yoo's religious group, in an apparent move to confuse investigators, said that Yoo might have returned early in the morning to Geumsuwon, the church commune in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province. Geumsuwon is known as the main residence of Yoo. A spokesperson for the sect later announced that Yoo had not returned, further saying, \\"We hope Yoo doesn't get arrested. A 100,000 followers will protect Yoo. Even if the entire congregation of 100,000 believers is arrested, we won't hand him over.\\" Lee Jae-ok, another member of Yoo's religious group, chairman of Yoo's Hemato-Centric Life Foundation, and one of Yoo's close aides, was arrested on 26 May on charges of planning Yoo's life as a fugitive and helping him evade detection for weeks. President Park Geun-hye during a Cabinet meeting on 27 May ordered a quick arrest of the fugitive Yoo saying he and his family \\"is ridiculing the law and causing indignation among the people.\\" Beginning 27 May, police doubled the number of officers deployed for the search for Yoo from 24,000 to almost 50,000.  Yoo Som-na  Yoo's eldest daughter, Yoo Som-na (; born 1966), was summoned for questioning multiple times by the Prosecution, but evaded the Office's investigation. She heads the interior design and consulting firm Moreal Design with offices on New York's Park Avenue and in Seoul, Moreal Design which has done design work for many of Semo's affiliates, Debauve & Gallais, Hemato-Centric Life Institute, and NaeClear, and has sponsored Yoo's photographic exhibitions. On 9 May 2014, police raided the firm's office in southern Seoul on suspicion it had been involved in forming the family's slush funds and managing them in overseas accounts. On 11 May, the authorities issued an arrest warrant for Som-na after she failed to appear for questioning. Som-na has been staying in France since February 2013 on a temporary residence visa. She is accused of embezzling billion ( million) from her affiliates including Dapanda since 2003 while working as the head of Moreal Design in Seoul. On 23 May an Interpol Red Notice was issued, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Som-na to surrender her passport, while the Ministry of Justice dispatched local investigators to France to discuss potential extradition. French law enforcement authorities arrested Som-na under the international arrest warrant on 27 May in her Paris apartment, reportedly worth billion (US$2.44 million), near Champs-√âlys√©es. The Ministry of Justice said that it will repatriate Som- na following a repatriation trial in France. She appeared before a judge on 28 May, who decided against releasing her on bail. Through her French lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, Som-na has said she is innocent of the charges brought against her. An appeal court on 11 June rejected Som-na's request for bail citing flight risk. A renewed request to be released pending the extradition decision 17 September was rejected by a Paris judge on 9 July. She is being held at the Fresnes Prison and is projected to bring her extradition case to the French Supreme Court, or even to judicial authorities of the European Union, which could delay her repatriation up to one year. On 2 June 2017 the appeal on the extradition order for Yoo Sum-na was rejected by the highest administrative court in France, and on 7 June 2017 she was arrested by South- Korean officials at the Charles de Gaulle airport, aboard a plane from Korean Airlines bound for Korea.  Eight aides  During the month of May, numerous persons were questioned and arrested, among them eight people who held top positions at subsidiary companies in Yoo's sphere of influence. * Song Kook-bin (; born ) was summoned for questioning on 30 April. He is CEO of Chonghaejin affiliate Dapanda, a direct-sales company distributing health supplements and cosmetics, and previously served as an CEO of I-One-I Holdings. Yoo's first son, Dae-kyun, is the biggest shareholders of Dapanda. Dapanda holds a 16.2 percent stake in Chonhaeji, the largest shareholder of Chonghaejin Marine, the operator of the ferry Sewol. Song was subsequently arrested, detained, and on 21 May indicted on charges of embezzling company funds and channeling the money to Yoo and his family, including suspicions of purchasing photographs taken by Yoo for as much as million (~) each, dealing significant damages to the company. * Lee Jae-young (; born ), Ahae Corp CEO, was arrested on 9 May, on charges of breach of trust and facilitating financial irregularities by buying millions of dollars worth of Yoo's photos at prices far higher than market values, thus funding his photography career. * Lee Gang-se (; born ), former Ahae Corp CEO, was questioned in early May over suspicions of aiding Yoo in the establishment of slush funds. Lee admitted that his former company Ahae Corp had paid bogus consultation fees to a shell company operated by Yoo, but said these actions were company custom and had taken place before he became CEO. Lee allegedly received orders to invest Ahae Corp money in the firm Ahae Press France, a company established to publish Yoo's photographs. Lee was arrested on 23 May and charged for extracting more than billion (~ million) from Ahae Corp through an illegal lending scheme. * Park Seung-il (; born ), auditor of I-One-I Holdings and Yoo's close aid was indicted on 23 May on charges of embezzling billion (~ million) in company money. * Byeon Ki-choon (; born 1972), CEO of both Semo's shipbuilding unit Chonhaiji and of I-One-I Holdings, and Go Chang-hwan (; born ), the CEO of Semo, were in early May suspected of causing tens of billions of won (tens of millions of dollars) in losses to their companies by paying large sums of company funds to purchase photographs by Yoo at excessively high prices and for consulting services from a paper company owned by Yoo's family. They were on 28 May indicted on charges of inflicting a total of billion (~ million) worth of losses on their firms to help Yoo's family create slush funds. * Kim Dong-hwan (; born ), auditor of Dapanda and senior executive at I-One-I Holdings, was arrested in mid May, and indicted on embezzlement charges on 29 May. * Oh Kyung-seok (; born ), CEO of Hemato-Centric Life Institute and in charge of selling Yoo's photography works, was indicted on embezzlement charges on 31 May. The criminal trial of the eight (8) defendants started at Incheon District Court on 16 June, the eight being accused of embezzlement, breach-of-duty and other instances of corruption, with prosecutors alleging that the defendants inflicted between billion (~ million) and billion (~ million) worth of losses on their firms to help Yoo's family create slush funds. Three of the defendants denied their charges, the others admitted to irregular intragroup trading, saying that they acted on the orders of Yoo's eldest son, Dae-kyun, and Yoo's close aide Kim Phil-bae, who both reportedly have fled to the United States. Next court meeting is on 9 July.  Kwon Oh-kyun  Yoo's brother-in-law, Kwon Oh-kyun (; born ), the younger brother to Yoo's wife, Kwon Yun-ja, was arrested at his home in southern Seoul on charges of negligence on 6 June. Kwon, a key leader of the Salvation Sect, is CEO of the construction firm Trigon Korea, a core affiliate of Chonghaejin Marine, and suspected of embezzling company funds to illicitly transfer to Yoo and Yoo's children. On 8 June, a court warrant was issued to detain Kwon, inhibiting he fled the country or destroyed evidence. Kwon became the first relative of Yoo to be indicted on 24 June. He is accused of funneling funds of nearly billion (~ million) into his business after taking out loans with assets of the Evangelical Baptist Church as collateral in 2010, according to prosecutors.  Yoo Byung-il  Yoo's older brother, Yoo Byung-il (; born ), was the first member of Yoo's family who, on 11 May, appeared for questioning. Byung-il was the managing director of the religious facility called Geumsuwon. Prosecutors said they believed that Byung-il had received consultation fees of million (~) from Chonghaejin Marine each month, and that they had testimonies that he had illegally intervened in the company's management. Byung-il was arrested one month later on 13 June, near Geumsuwon. The prosecution team requested and was granted a pretrial detention warrant for Byung-il on 16 June. On 2 July Byung-il was indicted on embezzlement charges suspected of having received a combined million (~) from Chonghaejin Marine as consulting fees between June 2010 and April 2014.  Shin Myung-hee  Shin Myung-hee (; born ), a member of the Evangelical Baptist Church called \\"Mother Shin\\" by devotees of the sect, had been wanted by law enforcement authorities under suspicion of masterminding Yoo's escape, and on 13 June turned herself in to authorities in Suwon, Gyeonggi. Shin was detained and in July indicted on charges of playing a major role in helping Yoo evade capture.  Oh Gabriel  An unnamed person acting for Yoo contacted the Embassy of France in Seoul in late May and asked about the possibility of Yoo seeking political asylum. The embassy declined the request due to Yoo's status as a criminal suspect. Local media outlets said Yoo's middleman also made asylum enquiries at the embassies of the Philippines, the Czech Republic, and Canada. Yoo's eldest brother-in-law, Oh Gabriel (; born ), married to Yoo's younger sister, Yoo Gyeong-hee (; born ), was arrested with his wife on 19 June, allegedly for aiding Yoo's escape. The arrest came following testimony provided by two key adherents of the Evangelical Baptist Church that were arrested earlier in June, saying Oh drove Yoo out of the religious group's commune, Geumsuwon, on 23 April after police surrounded the compound. Oh, who served as the Korean ambassador to the Czech Republic from January 2010 through June 2013, reportedly played a significant role in garnering support for Yoo's photo exhibitions in France. Oh is currently under review by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's disciplinary committee for allegations that he abused his authority to help Yoo hold a photo exhibition in France and other European countries. The Prosecution suspect that Oh contacted the French Embassy on behalf of Yoo. When questioned, Oh testified that Yoo's family and followers funded and gave him information about the authorities' movements. Oh and his wife were released on 26 June reportedly with the expressed willingness to actively cooperate with the investigation and mediate the surrender of Yoo, and because under Korean criminal law family members to a fugitive cannot be punished for hiding or aiding the suspect.  Kwon Yun-ja  Yoo's wife, Kwon Yun-ja (; born ), was put on the nation's most wanted list in June. She has been the CEO of a door-to-door sales company, Dalgubeol (), in the southern city of Daegu. Kwon was detained in an apartment in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province on 21 June and taken in for questioning on charges of embezzling funds from the Evangelical Baptist Church and her company, reportedly amounting to more than billion () that had been handed over to her husband and her son to expand their business. To keep her in custody, the prosecution asked on 23 June the Incheon District Court to issue an arrest warrant, which was granted on 24 June. On 14 July prosecutors filed embezzlement charges against Kwon.  Yoo Byung-ho  Yoo's younger brother, Yoo Byung-ho (; born ), father-in-law of singer Park Jin-young, was arrested at his residence in Daegu on 22 June. The Court issued a custody warrant on 24 June. Byung-ho is suspected of embezzlement, totaling at least billion (~ million), from Chonghaejin Marine's sister firms, and to have borrowed billion (~ million) from one of the family affiliates, and allegedly made members of the religious group pay back billion (~ million) on his behalf while the affiliate suffered losses of billion (~ million).  Lee Seok-hwan  On 25 June Lee Seok-hwan (; born ), considered Yoo's \\"right-hand man,\\" was arrested in a parking lot in Suwon, south of Seoul, after avoiding a manhunt for weeks. An influential member of the Evangelical Baptist Church, Lee is suspected of helping Yoo avoid arrest. A court-issued warrant on Lee was sought on 27 June.  Ongoing investigation  In mid June 2014, Chonhaiji Co. Ltd., a ship block maker controlled by Yoo's sons, and the major shareholder of Chonghaejin Marine Company with 39.4%, lodged its application for receivership at the Changwon District Court. Chonhaiji had billion (~ million) in outstanding debt to main creditor Korea Development Bank. On 27 June the Government of South Korea had calculated the costs in connection with the sinking of the ferry Sewol to billion (~ million), and lodged a claim to any properties held directly or by proxy by Yoo and Chonghaejin Marine at the Seoul Central District Court to cover compensation payments for the victims. The Court on 4 July ordered the sequestration of assets owned by Yoo Byung- eun, four officials of Chonghaejin Marine, and eight crew members aboard Sewol. Yoo while on the run purchased around of land near a property in South Jeolla Province where he sought refuge in May, according to prosecutors. He paid million (~) and registered it under the names of the married couple, members of his religious group, who run a rest stop and restaurant near Suncheon and are suspected of aiding Yoo's escape from the law. The Incheon District Court on 2 July ordered in its third decision to temporarily seize assets the confiscation of an additional billion (~ million) worth of assets owned by Yoo and his family, including the newly acquired property as well as 10 stores in Gangnam District, Seoul, valued at billion (~ million), an apartment owned by Yoo's son Hyuk-kee valued at billion (~ million), and cameras confiscated from a restaurant run by his other son Dae-kyun valued at million (~). ;Yoo Dae-kyun Yoo's first son, Yoo Dae-kyun, was involved in the day-to-day operations of Chonghaejin Marine. He was the biggest shareholder of four affiliates of the family businesses including the holding company of the operator of Sewol, I-One-I Holdings. Prosecutors found evidence proving that Dae-kyun received monthly wages from affiliates that he did not own shares of. He is suspected of collecting billions of won in \\"consulting fees\\" from the firms and creating a slush fund. Dae-gyun also registered the name \\"Ohamana\\" for a sister ferry of the Sewol. Dae-gyun is wanted for a string of corruption charges and irregularities that are believed to have contributed to the sinking of the Sewol. Dae-kyun bought an airplane ticket to France and was reportedly spotted at Incheon International Airport on 19 April, but didn't board the plane. He was supposed to appear for questioning at the Incheon District Prosecutors' Office, but failed to show up. Prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant for Dae-kyun on 13 May, but investigators were unable to find him. He was placed on the most-wanted list amid fears that he would flee the country. The Court approved on 20 May a proposal by the Prosecution and the National Tax Service to place real estate assets worth billion (~ million) under confiscation. Among the properties was land in the Seocho District and Gangnam District of southern Seoul and two business offices in Gangnam-gu. All properties had been registered in the name of Yoo Dae-kyun. On 22 May the Korean authorities labeled Yoo Byung-eun and Yoo Dae-kyun as fugitives, and initially offered a million (~) reward for Yoo and a million (~) reward for Dae-kyun for information leading to their arrest. On 25 May the rewards were raised to million (~) for the older Yoo and to million (~) for the son, the largest amount ever offered by an investigative authority as a reward in South Korea. ;Yoo Hyuk-kee Yoo's second son, Yoo Hyuk-kee, reportedly was involved in the day-to-day managing of Chonghaejin Marine. Hyuk-kee, apart from his stake in I-One-I Holdings, owns some 10 percent stake in Ahae Corp., a paint manufacturing company, and a stake in Ahae Press Corp. As CEO of Ahae Press Inc. in New York, Ahae Press France in Paris, and Ahae Press Ltd. UK in London, he has built up his fathers image as a talented photographer, and has curated his exhibitions. Hyuk-kee had been summoned for questioning by 8 May, but ignored the summonses. On 23 May an Interpol Red Notice was issued. He is suspected of helping his father establish a slush fund through paper companies. Hyuk-kee, who is known outside Korea as Keith H. Yoo, is based in the U.S. and, according to sources, either has permanent residence status or holds a U.S. citizenship. He left South Korea for the U.S. shortly after the sinking of the Sewol on 16 April, and attempted to make his way to France but didn't get on his booked flight. Hyuk-kee and his wife allegedly own at least three apartments on Manhattan and near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris estimated to be worth around million (~ billion) altogether. The prosecutors have asked the United States Department of Homeland Security's Investigations Directorate to track down real estate and deposits under the names of the siblings or affiliates of the family business.  Personal life  Yoo was known, due to his reclusiveness, as \\"the millionaire with no face.\\" He married Kwon Yun-ja (; born ), the daughter of Kwon Shin-chan, in 1966. He had four children with her: daughter Yoo Sum-na (; born 1966), also known as Ennette Yoo, daughter Yoo Sang-na (; born ), son Yoo Dae-kyun (; born ), and second son Yoo Hyuk-kee (; born 1972), also known as Keith H. Yoo. = Reported death = South Korean authorities initially offered a million (~) reward for information leading to the arrest of Yoo. On 25 May the reward was raised tenfold to million (~). South Korean police reported in July 2014 that a body found in June in a field about south of Seoul is believed to be Yoo's. The body was wearing a winter sweater and was \\"seriously decomposed.\\" Preliminary DNA analysis indicates a \\"fair match\\". The death was later confirmed.

Contributions to Archival Theory and Notable Achievements  Terry Cook was instrumental in the development of archival theory at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. His scholarship covered archival appraisal, theories of the archive, total archives, postmodernism, community archives, the fonds and series systems of arrangement and description, the contrast between analogue and digital thinking and relations between archivists and historians. Cook revealed the agency of the archivist and pushed archivists to deeply consider their role in the shaping of the historical record. He also urged archivists to be transparent in their interventionsCook, T. and J. M. Schwartz. (2002). \\"Archives, Records, and Power: From (Postmodern) Theory to (Archival) Performance.\\" Archival Science 2:171‚Äì185. Cook's most noted contribution to archival appraisal theory was the development of macroappraisal, which he developed during his time at the Library and Archives Canada from 1975-1998 and received international acceptance. It is a method for deciding which small percentage of archived materials should be kept while destroying the rest. In 2002, he earned the Society of American Archivists' Fellows' Ernst Posner award. In 2009, he was named a Fellow of the Association of Canadian Archivists, and of the Royal Society of Canada in 2010.

Harris, is an American orthopaedic surgeon, Founder and Director Emeritus of the Massachusetts General Hospital Harris Orthopaedics Laboratory, and creator of the Advances in Arthroplasty course held annually since 1970. Much of Harris' research focuses on osteolysis, the deterioration of bone tissue around joint replacement implants, and developing highly cross-linked polyethylene to counter the issue of osteolysis. Fifteen years of wide spread use of highly cross-linked polyethylene in patients have shown it to be very effective in preventing osteolysis. Harris is also recognized for performing the world's first successful total hip replacement in a patient with a total congenital dislocation of the hip and for developing the first effective cement-free acetabular component. In addition, Harris is known for developing the Harris Hip Score which rates a patient's progress on pain and function following surgery. His work inspired surgical techniques, implant design, development of new operations, prevention of blood clot formation, and other leading advances in hip surgery. Early life and education Harris was born in 1927 in Great Falls, Montana and raised in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He received his B.S. from Haverford College in 1947 with High Honors and his M.D. from Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1951. Harris interned at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and completed a one-year general surgery residency there.  Career  He completed orthopedic training at the Boston Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. Harris performed one of the first femoral head autograft procedures and one of the first femoral head allograft procedures: two techniques that are now widely used. Along with his research staff at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harris was the first to centrifuge cement. The Total System, introduced in 1983, was designed by Harris and was the first integrated system offering an entire range of cemented and cementless implants. Harris was one of the two designers to create the first successful cementless acetabular component. This was the first time screws were put through the acetabular component to fix it to the skeleton. He is also the designer of one of the most successful long-term cemented femoral components. Harris was Chief of the Adult Reconstructive Surgery and Director of the Harris Orthopedic Laboratory of the Massachusetts General Hospital. He has been Clinical Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at the Harvard Medical School since 1974 and was awarded the Alan Gerry Chair as Clinical Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School in 1997. Harris is a founding member of The Hip Society of North America and served as the organization's first president. He went on to be a founding member and president of the International Hip Society. The Hip Society granted Dr. Harris a record ten honorary awards for outstanding contributions to hip surgery, and he has twice won the Kappa Delta Award of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons for outstanding orthopedic research. Dr. Harris is the author of some 520 scientific publications and three textbooks dealing with hip surgery, arthritis and diseases of the skeleton.

The Supreme Court of Hawaii handed down several opinions and judgments over several years regarding the estate of Charles Kanaina, who died on March 13, 1877 in Honolulu, Oahu in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Petitions began to be filed the day after the death in probate court and lasted until 1882. Many relatives came forward to petition the courts to be named as an heir. The final adjudication found eight individuals or family groups, largely from Moana Wahine, to be legitimate claims. Background Miriam KekƒÅuluohi Charles Kanaina was from a secondary chiefly line however, he was related to the Kamehameha's as a cousin and through marriage to Miriam KekƒÅuluohi. They had one son who survived to adulthood, William Charles Lunalilo who eventually became monarch of the kingdom shortly before his death. All the lands Lunalilo owned were passed to him from his mother, who was a former wife of Kamehameha I and II. All her lands were handed down from KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie, KekƒÅuluohi's mother, also a wife of Kamehameha I and from the king's half brother, Kala ªimamahu. Since no child between the union of Kamehameha I and KaheiheimƒÅlie had survived by their mother's death, her lands passed to the woman's only surviving daughter by Kala ªimamahu, who was KekƒÅuluohi. Her aunt was Kaahumanu, her mother's sister and another wife of Kamehameha I who was the first Kuhina Nui. KekƒÅuluohi would also become Kuhina Nui for a short period until the must direct heir to the position, Victoria KamƒÅmalu came of age. KekƒÅuluohi collected a number of lands from the position. KekƒÅuluohi died June 7, 1845 and left no will that was located. Her lands were split in a matter agreed in court, leaving some land to her son LunaLilo as well as some land to other close relatives. When Lunalio died, between what was already gifted to him from the Mahele, left to him from his mother and purchased (even after giving up a sizable amount) he was the largest land owner of the islands. He died in 1874 leaving a willhttp://www.lunalilo.org/admin/wp- content/uploads/2013/07/KINGS-WILL.pdf bequeathing everything to his father during only his life, that would in turn, then be left to Kamehameha V for his lifetime. It was never intended for Kanaina to inherit the lands of his higher ranking wife. After both men had passed with no issue, the remaining lands were to become part of the Lunalilo Trust.King Lunalilo The first three trustees included J. Mott Smitth and Sanford B. Dole. The will could not be carried out until after the death of Kanaina since the entire estate was his for life. Kanaina died 3 years later on March 13, 1877. Attorney General, Alfred S. Hartwell applied for the appointment of trustees shortly after the death under the articles of the Lunalilo will. Article three of that will bequeathing the entirety of his estate to be handled by three trustees appointed by the Justices of the Supreme Court of the Hawaiian Kingdom. The property was to be sold and invested until the sum of $25,000.00 was raised to fund a home for the poor and destitute. Petitions for letters of administration Hartwell petitioned Chief Justice Charles Coffin Harris for Letters of Administration of the Kanaina Estate to be issued to William C. Parke on March 14, 1877. Harris ordered a hearing for April 5, 1877 to hear the petition pertaining to the estate of the late Charles Kanaina and anyone who could show reason not to grant it. Sanford B. Dole provided a sworn affidavit to the death of Charles Kanaina and of seeing his body at his home at the Palace walk. On March 16, 1877 another Notice of Order of Petition was read and filed by Justice Lawrence McCully for William Stevens Pahukula from his attorney Edward Townsend O'Halloran. An order for a hearing on April 11, 1877 was made but canceled when the Justice discovered another hearing for another petition was already ordered. Pahukula stated that he was the sole heir to the Charles Kanaina estate through Kanaina's sister, who he states was his grandmother and that the estate was indebted to him for over $3000.00. First hearing There were many new petitions submitted during the first hearing. New petitions included * Pahua (w), through attorney Edward Preston * Kaaua (k) also represented by E. Preston * Leialoha through E.T O'Halloran, * Kealalaina Meheiwa and Kauimakaole Lazarus represented by W.C. Jones * J.S. Kekukahiko and relatives through attorney Kalauli * Esetera Kipa through Kalaaukane and Mahelona * Kaaua and Pahaw through attorney's L. Keliipio and Kj Unauma Various creditors were represented as well, such as the estate of creditor, James Robinson represented by E. Preston. The Lunalilo trust was represented by trustee, Sanford B. Dole. Attorney General Hartwell presented the Last Will and Testament of Charles Kanaina that was in the physical possession of Charles Reed Bishop, also named as the executor of that will which named Lunalilo as the sole heir. Bishop knew of no other will. The court ordered W.C. Parke as the temporary administrator of the estate at that time with a $5000 bond due. An inventory of the deceased's property was also ordered Petitions =William Stephens Pahukula claim= William Stephens Pahukula claimed to be an heir through Eia's second wife, Kaheluuaaukai, the mother of Nakookoo, the claimant's mother. =Pahau and Kaaua claim= Pahau and her husband Kanoelehuaher petitioned the court for administration to the estate based on Pahau's claimed genealogy to Kanaina through Eia, his father, as did Kaaua: Their claims were confirmed by the courts and a distribution of 1/9 of the estate was eventually awarded to them. =Leialoha claim= Leialoha claimed to be a first cousin of Kanaina on his mother's side through her brother, Keholo, as his daughter. =Kealaina and Kauimakaole= Kealalaina Meheiwa and Kauimakaole Lazarus filed a petition claiming to be the only issue of Kamoakeawe, a collateral family line from Kana'ina's maternal line. =Kalakaua claim= King Kalakaua A petition was filed by King David Kalakaua, Lydia K. Dominis, Archibald Scott Cleghorn and Miriam K. Cleghorn for quiet title by right of inheritance. A hearing was set by Justice Lawrence McCully. The hearing took place on October 17, of 1877 and further hearings continued the rest of the year with another hearing scheduled for January 26, of 1878. =Haalelea, Kahuakaiola, A.W. Haalilio and Kilinahe claim= In January another petition was made. Levi Haalelea, Kahuakaiola and A.W. Haalilio filed through their representatives, Jno. Lota Kaulukou. Their petition was through a brother (named Keholo) of kanaina's Mother, Kauwa. In July 1878, Justices Harris, Judd and McCully heard an appeal from the king and his two sisters. On August 17, 1878 they handed down their decision. The Justices felt Kalakaua failed to prove his case, on behalf of himself and his siblings however, they were very impressed with the claim of Kilinahe, Kanaina's first cousin whose first petition was declined as being too late to be filed, but permitted during the case's appeal.Charles and Bernice Bishop They felt that Kilinahe had carried himself in the manner of a chief and that his statements, witnesses and genealogy were very strong. They also found in favor of several others. The court decreed for the estate to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k), who were to receive one quarter of the estate. The claim of Pahua (w) was granted one quarter share as well as Kaahua (k) who received the same one quarter amount. Kilinahe died before the adjudication of his claim. The court named his widow and children his heirs and allotted them a one quarter share. Claimants made petitions to the court under the act of 1874 to quite land titles. The act was later deemed unconstitutional and a new decree of heirship was made. By December 1879 disbursement of land in trust with William Cooper Parke, (Marshal of Hawaii from 1853 to 1884) and owned by heirs, could not be agreed upon for settlement. Most supported the sale of the lands, so an order was made and all land sold at auction. Final adjudication of probate found eight parties as heirs to the Kana'ina estate with some of lesser relationship. Most of the heirs were descended from Moana and one of her four husbands. The probate records include a great deal of information from the 4 years of litigation. A great number of people petitioned the courts to claim title as heir. Final list of heirs includes Bernice Pauahi Bishop, receiving two - 1/9th shares because her genealogy is derived from two separate people who were half siblings. Ruth Keelik≈çlani, received a single 1/9th share, as did remaining heirs, Haalilio, Haalelea, Kilinahe and 5 other parties.

Like other members of this class of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites, it possesses strong anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activity. PD1 is an aliphatic acyclic alkene 22 carbons in length with two hydroxyl groups at the 10 and 17 carbon positions and one carboxylic acid group at the one carbon position. Specifically, PD1 is an endogenous stereoselective lipid mediator classified as an autocoid protectin. Autacoids are enzymatically derived chemical mediators with distinct biological activities and molecular structures. Protectins are signaling molecules that are produced enzymatically from unsaturated fatty acids. Their molecular structure is characterized by the presence of a conjugated system of double bonds. PD1, like other protectins, is produced by the oxygenation of the œâ-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and it is found in many tissues, such as the retina, the lungs and the nervous system. PD1 has a significant role as an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective molecule. Studies in Alzheimer's disease animal models, in stroke patients and in human retina pigment epithelial cells (RPE) have shown that PD1 can potentially reduce inflammation induced by oxidative stress and inhibit the pro-apoptotic signal, thereby preventing cellular degeneration. Finally, recent studies examining the pathogenicity of influenza viruses, including the avian flu (H5N1), have suggested that PD1 can potentially halt the proliferation of the virus, thus protecting respiratory cells from lethal viral infections. Biosynthesis of PD1 In vivo, PD1 is mainly produced as a response to inflammatory signals and it is found in various tissues, such as the retina pigment epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neural tissues. Studies in PBMC have shown that endogenous DHA, the main precursor of PD1, is released by the activity of phospholipase A2. According to these studies, PD1 is preferentially synthesized in PBMC cells skewed to the Type 2 T helper cell phenotype (TH2). This suggests that T-cell differentiation plays an important role in the activation of the PD1 biosynthetic pathway. The interaction of PBMC with interleukin 4 (IL-4), a potent inflammatory signal, leads to the differentiation of PBMC to TH2 type lymphocytes. In addition, activated TH2 cells further release IL-4, leading to the up-regulation of the enzyme 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1). 15-LO-1 is a non- heme iron-carrying dioxygenase that adds oxygen atoms in a stereospecific manner on free and esterified œâ-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA. Overall, the biosynthesis of PD1 proceeds through three distinct steps throughout which the activity of 15-LO-1 is essential. In the first step of the biosynthetic pathway, the binding of 15-LO-1 to its substrate (DHA) leads to the formation of the (17S)-hydro(peroxy)-DHA intermediate. This intermediate is rapidly processed to form a 16(17)-epoxide-containing molecule, which is the second intermediate. Finally, in the third step of the pathway, enzymatic hydrolysis of the 16(17)-epoxide-containing intermediate leads to the formation of PD1. Protectin D1 (PD1) Biosynthesis Functions of PD1 In general, PD1 in vivo exhibits a potent anti-apoptotic and anti- inflammatory activity in the tissues in which it is localized. DHA, the main PD1 precursor, is mostly found in tissues such as the retinal synapses, photoreceptors, the lungs and the brain, suggesting that these tissues are more likely to be benefited from the protecting activity of PD1. =Activity of PD1 in the retina= RPE are essential in the survival and renewal of the photoreceptors in the retina. These cells exhibit a potent phagocytic activity that ensures the proper function of the retina. Therefore, oxidative stress can potentially damage the RPE cells and cause vision impairment. Studies in human RPE cells have suggested that the presence of oxidative stress triggering molecules, such as H2O2 causes the fragmentation of the DNA that in turn triggers apoptosis. These studies have proposed that PD1 acts as a signaling molecule and through its ligand-receptor interaction down-regulates the expression of genes, such as the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B. The inhibition of NF-Œ∫B results in the down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory gene COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) which is responsible for the release of prostaglandins, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator. In addition, PD1 has an important role in regulating the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax and Bad) that precedes the release of the cytochrome c complex from the mitochondria and the formation of the apoptosome. The presence of PD1 up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, while it inhibits the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. Specifically, PD1 regulates this protein family by promoting the dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at residue Ser-62 which in turn heterodimerizes with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inactivates it. Consequently, the activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins results in the inhibition of the caspase 3 enzyme, thus preventing apoptosis and promoting RPE cell survival. =Effects of PD1 in Alzheimer's disease= Among others, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the reduced concentration of PD1 and by the increased concentration of the amyloid-Œ≤ peptide (AŒ≤42) that is responsible for the formation of senile plaques and also induces inflammation and apoptosis in neuronal tissues. AŒ≤42 is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of the Œ≤-amyloid precursor protein (Œ≤ŒëPP) through Œ≤- and Œ≥- secretases. Like other pro-inflammatory mediators, AŒ≤42 induces inflammation through the activation of the pro-inflammatory enzyme COX-2 and the release of prostaglandins. Moreover, the release of AŒ≤42 down-regulates the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and up-regulates the pro- apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad that ultimately lead to the formation of the apoptosome. PD1 in human neuronal glial cells (HNG) has been shown to trigger the down-regulation of Œ≤ŒëPP, thus decreasing the AŒ≤42 content in neuronal tissues and reducing inflammation and apoptosis. Specifically, PD1 in Alzheimer's disease models has been shown to respond to the increased concentration of the pro-inflammatory molecule AŒ≤42 by binding and activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARŒ≥) either directly or via other mechanisms. According to some models the activation of PPARŒ≥ leads to increased ubiquitination and degradation of Œ≤APP, thus reducing the release of AŒ≤42. Furthermore, PD1 inhibits the production of AŒ≤42 peptide by down-regulating Œ≤-secretase-1 (BACE1), while up-regulating the Œ±-secretase ADAM10 and the secreted amyloid precursor protein-Œ± (sAPPŒ±). Overall, the above mechanism leads to the cleavage of Œ≤APP protein though a non- amyloidogenic pathway that halts the formation of AŒ≤42 and prevents the premature neuronal degeneration. =Antiviral activity of PD1= Studies in cultured human lung epithelial cells infected with the influenza virus H1N1 or H5N1 have found that endogenous production of PD1 decreases dramatically during infection due to the inhibition of 15-LO-1. Furthermore, the same studies have shown that in vivo administration of PD1 to H1N1 infected mice can potentially inhibit both the proliferation of the virus and the inflammation caused by the infection, thus increasing survival. PD1 protects against viral infections by disrupting the virus life cycle. Specifically, PD1 inhibits the binding of viral RNA to specific nuclear export factors in the host cells, thus blocking the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. The nuclear RNA export factor 1(NXF1) is of particular interest in the attenuation of viral infections via the activity of PD1. Specifically, the NXF1 transporter through its middle and C-terminal domains binds to the phenylalanine/glycine repeats in the nucleoporins (Nups) that line the nuclear pore. In the absence of PD1, influenza viral RNA binds to the NXF1 transporter that later binds specifically to Nup62 nucleoporin and exports the viral RNA into the cytosol. However, the administration of PD1 has shown that this lipid mediator specifically inhibits the binding of the viral RNA to NXF1, thus disrupting the proliferation of the virus. Laboratory Synthesis of PD1 The large scale industrial production of PD1 is of great interest for pharmaceutical companies in order to harvest the potent anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities of this lipid mediator. So far, very few stereoselective laboratory syntheses of PD1 have been reported, but with a relatively low yield. =Convergent Stereoselective Synthesis= According to one method, PD1 is synthesized in 15% yield through an 8-step convergent stereoselective process. Initially, the alkyne, (Z)-3-tertbutyldimethylsiloxy- oct-5-en-1-yne reacts with bromo-E,E,Z,Z-tetraene ester in a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction at room temperature in the presence of Pd-(PPh3)4 and CuI using diethylamine as a solvent which produces the bis-hydroxyl-protected methyl ester. Removal of the two tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers (TBS- protecting groups) is attained with an excess of TBAF in THF at 0 ¬∞C which produces a diol containing a conjugated alkyne. The conjugated alkyne is reduced to the methyl ester. In addition, the diol is hydrogenated using the Lindlar catalyst, with 1-octene added as a sacrificial olefin, to produce a highly stereoselective triene, while water is eliminated from the diol through a Boland reduction. Finally, the methyl ester undergoes saponification at 0 ¬∞C with dilute LiOH (aq.) in methanol followed by acidic work-up with NaH2PO4 (aq.) in order to produce PD1. Convergent Stereoselective Synthesis of PD1 =Alternative Stereoselective Synthesis= Alternatively, PD1 laboratory synthesis proceeds through a different stereoselective method. Initially, hydroboration of a TBS-protected acetylene with Sia2BH produces a TBS- protected vinylborane. The TBS-protected vinylborane reacts with vinyliodide in the presence of a Pd-catalyst, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and THF to produce a TBS-protected alcohol. Later treatment of the TBS-protected alcohol with TBAF removes the protecting group and produces a diol. Finally, the diol is hydrolyzed with LiOH in THF (aq.) to produce PD1. Laboratory synthesis of Protectin D1 (PD1) Other PDs =22-hydroxy-NPD1= 22-hydroxy-PD1 (22-OH- PD1; i.e. 10R,17S,20-trihydroxy-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) is an omega oxidation product of PD1 probably formed in cells by the action of an unidentified Cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylase (see specialized proresolving mediators#Protectins/neuroprotectins). While the omega oxidation of many bioactive fatty acid metabolites such as leukotriene B4, 5-HETE, 5-oxo- eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 5-oxo-ETE) results in a ~100-fold fall in their activity, the omega oxidized product of PD1 has been shown to possess potent ease exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions by inhibiting PMN chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro and decreased pro-inflammatory mediator levels in inflammatory exudates of an animal model at levels comparable to PD1. =Protectin DX= Protectin DX (PDX; i.e. 10S,17S-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) is the 13Z,15E,19Z isomer of NPD1 (which has the 13E,15Z,19Z double bond configuration)(see specialized proresolving mediators#Protectins/neuroprotectins). An early study mistakenly used PDX instead of PD1 in attributing anti-replicative and clinically beneficial effects in viral influenza disease in a mouse model to PD1. PDX also inhibits influx of circulating leukocytes into the peritoneum in a mouse model of inflammation. PDX has other anti-inflammatory actions. It inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 thereby blocking the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins; it also inhibits the platelet-aggregating action of thromboxane A2 thereby blocking the platelet aggregations responses to agents that depend on platelets to release thromboxane A2. =Aspirin-triggered PD1= Aspirin- triggered PD1 (AT-PD1 or 17-epi-PD1: i.e. 10R,17R-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) is the 10R-hydroxy isomer of PD1 (which has the 10S hydroxy residue) (see specialized proresolving mediators#Protectins/neuroprotectins). AT-PD1 has been shown to a) reduce the infiltration of neutrophils into the peritoneum in a mouse model of inflammatory disease; b) stimulate the Efferocytosis (i.e. engulfment and removal) of neutrophils; and c) reduce brain infarction and stroke in a rodent model. =10-epi-PD1= 10-Epi-PD1 (ent-AT-NPD1: i.e. 10S,17S-Dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) is the 10S-hydroxy isomer of AT-PD1 (which has a 10R-hydroxy residue) (see specialized proresolving mediators#Protectins/neuroprotectins). 10-Epi-PD1 was detected in only a small amount in human PMN extracts but was more potent than PD1 or PDX in blocking the inflammatory response to zymosan A-induced murine acute peritonitis.

You can tell what the tree \\"feels\\". I feel their anguish. I see their passion, pain and bare senses. And they see mine. I live with them. Pain is inseparable from beauty. Trees have so much faith. I can't stop being fascinated by their eternal greatness. I feel their inner struggle, aspirations of freedom, fearlessness and courage. It is as if I am drawing myself... the self-portraits of my inner self‚Ä¶ my soul. You end a tree's life by confining it to a canvas at the same time giving it a new life. You feel its breath. They die and continue living. They die in order to continue living. We have so much to learn from them... I have so much to learn from them. Quotes About Gagik Siravyan \\"For Gagik Siravyan, as was the case for many in his generation, Shorzha played a defining for shaping his artistic path. It is no longer considered a mere geographical site; it is rather an environment that shapes artistic viewpoint, where the creative \\"self\\" is in constant renewal thanks to the confrontation with the continuously transforming nature. Gagik experienced his father's ‚Äì Henrik Siravyan's pantheistic art firsthand and started using elements of nature to depict his own allegorical landscapes already in his earlier works of art. Shorzha, a unique combination of natural elements, is a recurring theme in his autobiographic images. The rocks, mountainous skies, shining water and running dachshunds are all statements of the surrealism that Gagik consistent lypursues through his expressions. The series of paintings \\"My Tress\\" are the artist's current renderings of the aforesaid tendencies. The only difference is that the tree serves as a medium, a key, a transition link to new creations. In Mondrian's case, the tree is a key defining the imagery limits of intersection of force, color and line. While Gagik's earlier works present trees within their own meaning or imagery domain, in the later works his trees ‚Äì unlike Mondrian's impersonalized trees ‚Äì become multi-layer ideological and visual entities. The artist's desire to turn the tree base into winding bodies presents a visual dilemma for the viewer. The series, therefore, demonstrate the complexity of intentions and challenges the artist pursues. With time the artist's works become more and more refined and defined through a distinct creative experience\\".

A kaiseki-and- type restaurant. Ika somen. A washoku eatery at an airport. refer to a type of sashimi made from raw squid cut into fine strips, vaguely resembling s≈çmen type noodles. They are typically served with grated ginger and soy sauce or a soy sauce-based mentsuyu sauce. They are slurped up, much in the way that noodles are eaten according to Japanese custom. It is considered a specialty of Hokkaido, especially Hakodate, a fishing port where large catches of squid are hauled, though this regional notion has been challenged by availability in wider markets driven by commercialism. Nomenclature The ika s≈çmen is not sashimi according to some sources, one such culinary reference making the comparison that while the squid is suited for the ika s≈çmen, the thicker-fleshed cuttlefish is more palatable for making into sashimi. However, it has also been pointed out that ika s≈çmen is synonymous with ito-zukuri or \\"thread cut\\", which is a technique in sashimi- slicing. The name gained currency only in modern times. Hokkaido native and author Junichi Watanabe remarked in Kore wo tabe nakya--watashi no shokumotsushi (\\"Gotta eat this, my food history\\", 1995) that the term ika s≈çmen came into popular use only recently, adding that it is \\"nothing more than thinly sliced squid sashimi\\". In 1970, poet described a dish identical to ika s≈çmen (\\"a bowl (donburi) full of raw squid sliced like tokoroten noodles, with grated ginger and soy sauce\\") but mentioned that it went by the nickname umi no s≈çmen or \\"s≈çmen noodles of the sea\\".  Preparation  The squid's fillet is cut into half (or into thirds) and then into strips. Some cookbooks insist that the strips must be cut vertically along the \\"length of the squid along the grain\\" to prevent it from becoming overly chewy. The name suggests the strips resemble s≈çmen, i.e., as thin as vermicelli. Even though some sources take this literally, the description above likening it to \\"tokoroten\\" noodles suggest thicker strips, as do recipes that call for \\"5 mm (1/5 inch) widths.\\" The typical way it is served is to have these \\"noodles\\" heaped in a bowl (donburi), accompanied by grated ginger and soy sauce, or a soy sauce- based noodle sauce, called mentsuyu. Lately it may also be served on a flat dish even in Hakodate, Hokkaido, and eaten with wasabi and soy sauce, which is then no different from squid sashimi ito-zukuri style. At port towns where the caught squid are brought ashore, the freshly caught squid are semi- translucent, have excellent texture, and are \\"marvelously sweet, especially the morning-caught squid shipped alive\\". In Japan, the abundantly caught surume ika or Japanese flying squid, available from early summer onwards, is used to make this dish. In practice, other (more expensive) squid species are sometimes substituted, such as the yari ika () or the aori ika (bigfin reef squid). The ika s≈çmen has also become widely available prepacked in Japan. As with uncooked seafood in general (see Sashimi#Safety), eating this dish made from raw untreated squid poses some risk of contracting anisakiasis, since the parasite when present in the animal infests the flesh of its body (mantle).

This school was named in honor of Dr. James H. Carlisle, who was the president of Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina (1875‚Äì1902) and one of the most preeminent educators in the history of South Carolina. Dr. Carlisle stated that \\"The student ought to be educated not simply or chiefly because he intends to become a farmer, lawyer, or statesman, but because he is a human being - with inlets of joy, with possibilities of effort and action that no trade or calling can satisfy or exhaust\\". History =Carlisle Fitting School= left The Carlisle Fitting School was authorized by the South Carolina Methodist Conference in 1892 as a preparatory school for Wofford College. While the decision to open a second fitting school for Wofford (The Wofford Fitting School was opened in 1887 on the Wofford campus) was strongly promoted by Wofford's financial administrator John Carlisle Kilgo (who also laid the cornerstone of Carlisle's first building), Carlisle was largely a town of Bamberg enterprise and gifts for its financial support were largely local. This was probably a chief reason why Carlisle enrolled girls as well as boys during this time. As an added benefit, the Carlisle Fitting School also prepared students for entrance into Wofford's sophomore class. But Carlisle was unfortunate in that its leadership changed so often ‚Äì out of nine headmasters during its nearly forty years under the Methodist Church and Wofford College trustees, only John C. Guilds (for whom a building on the Carlisle campus was named, and who later became President of Columbia College (South Carolina)) served as headmaster longer than five years. Guilds had gone to Carlisle as a teacher after his graduation from Wofford in 1906, and he was elected headmaster in 1910. The Guilds' administration was a most successful one, as he had taken over the administration of a school which was at the point of failure with only 3 teachers and 60 students. Under his eleven years as headmaster, he left Carlisle with 10 teachers and 225 students. Also during his administration, and largely due to World War I, a Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program was formally established - setting the stage for what the future would hold for Carlisle. 150px However, in the next eight years there were three more headmasters: Duncan, Hagood, and Gault. And in 1928, as the need for fitting schools had passed (the Wofford Fitting School was closed in 1924), the Methodist Church decided that Carlisle would no longer be affiliated with Wofford College. =Carlisle School transition to Carlisle Military School= Along with this major shift in direction in 1928, Colonel James F. Risher (who had arrived at Carlisle in 1924, serving as a science teacher and quartermaster) was elected as headmaster. Colonel Risher would prove to be the right man at the right time in Carlisle's history. It was indeed a testament to Colonel Risher's (as well as his wife Emma's) faith in Carlisle that ‚Äì even as the \\"Great Depression\\" was deepening ‚Äì he leased Carlisle from the Methodist Church in 1932. Then in 1938, as the Methodist Church was considering to close Carlisle entirely, Colonel Risher - again taking a \\"leap of faith\\" ‚Äì offered to purchase Carlisle from the Methodist Church, even while the entire nation was still in the grips of the Great Depression. The future of Carlisle was secured when Colonel Risher's offer was accepted, and Carlisle School was thereafter known as Carlisle Military School. Colonel Risher established his vision of \\"developing manly men\\" serving as headmaster of Carlisle until 1958, when his son (William R.) was named as his successor. Another major event occurred in 1958 when Colonel Risher purchased Camden Academy (Camden, S.C.), naming another son, (Lanning P.), as the headmaster of what would henceforth be known as Camden Military Academy. Colonel Risher carried his \\"life's calling\\" forward as president of both institutions until his death in 1973. 150px =Closure= In addition to the loss of Colonel Risher as its central guiding force for nearly half a century, Carlisle faced the effect of a dwindling enrollment in the post- Vietnam era of the 1970s and closed its doors at the end of the 1977 school year. Since 1979 the property has been used as a U.S. Department of Labor Job Corps Training Center, continuing its relevance as an educational institution in the Bamberg community and beyond. =Heritage= However, the history of Carlisle did not die with its closure, because all the cadets who ever walked through her doors, as well as those from Camden Military Academy, carry with them the lasting heritage, and eternal values, this institution endowed on them. From its foundation built upon the legacy of its namesake, James Henry Carlisle - who once replied to a group of Wofford students presenting him a gift on his birthday, that they simply remember him with the epitaph \\"He aways meant to do me good\\". Through John Caldwell Guilds, who brought Carlisle back from the brink of closure and once succinctly stated his view that Carlisle \\"has always been run for the good it can do and never as a money-making enterprise\\". And lastly, the \\"Old Colonel\\" who saw his life intertwined with Carlisle as a \\"calling\\", not unlike that of a minister. On the grave marker for James Franklin Risher are written the sublime words that very likely describes the vision he had in mind for all his Carlisle boys to aspire to: \\"Here Lies A Man\\". In a letter to his charges, Colonel Risher once wrote: \\"Gentlemen, Let me urge each of you to follow the simple Path of Duty. It leads through valleys of disappointment, up hills of difficulty, through deserts of doubts and self-denial, and sometimes down into the darkness of an unknown tomb. It does not end there, but leads into the glorious sunlight of an eternal Resurrection; to joy, and true success. Faithfully yours, James F. Risher, Head Master\\" =Commemoration and Reunion= On April 14, 2018, a commemoration of Carlisle Military School's history was held in Bamberg, SC, on its former campus (now a Federal Department of Labor Job Corps Training Center). A commemorative plaque was dedicated that will be erected as part of the City and County of Bamberg Veterans Memorial Trail. Additionally, the South Carolina House of Representatives passed a Resolution (H.5183) \\"To Honor The Significant History Of The Carlisle Military School In The Celebration Of The School's Rich Legacy With A Reunion On April 14, 2018\\".

Life Harriett Ball was born in Harriett Jane Hill in 1946 in Rosenberg, Texas. She grew up in poverty, living with her mother, brother, and three sisters. Her mother worked tirelessly to provide for them all. Ball wanted to be a teacher from an early age, modeling herself after her mother's sister. She received her degree in teaching from Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Ball was married three times. Ball had four children, and has nine grandchildren. She loved horses and crossword puzzles. She died at the age of 64 from a heart attack. Career & Innovation Ball taught in Houston, Texas as a public school elementary school teacher. After fifteen years of teaching, she discovered that her students were struggling to read, and she developed a song to help them read. She called her technique \\"Rap, Rhythm, & Rhyme.\\" She got her students to chant and rap along to their lessons, which she referred to as meeting the children at their level of learning. Her style was not always appreciated as it deviated from the norms of teaching, but her measures were quickly shown to be effective. In 1992, her colleague David Levin worked for Teach For America and was struggling in the same public school Ball worked in, Bastian Elementary, located in Houston. He asked her for mentorship. She also mentored Mike Feinberg, who was also working for Teach For America. Together, Levin and Feinberg shadowed Ball and asked her for mentorship, and the two went on to found the Knowledge is Power Program. Feinberg cited Ball's mentorship as integral to the creation and initial idea of KIPP, and spoke highly of her teaching abilities. Feinberg and Levin called her the best teacher they had ever seen working. Ball's chant of \\"Knowledge is power, power is money, and I want it,\\" became the namesake of KIPP. KIPP now serves about 27,000 children in 20 different states, and the District of Columbia, and 99 schools. Ball went on to teach in the Houston and Austin, Texas school districts for a total of 35 years. In 1996, she invested her pension, borrowed on her mortgage, and started her own business to help other teachers improve. She started Harriett Ball Enterprises and went on to lead workshops to teach educators and personnel about how to reach and teach at-risk students. She also taught students as well. Many school districts credited her with large increases in test scores after she came to deliver workshops. Appearances Ball appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, as well as other nationally televised programs. Footage of her also appeared in the documentary Waiting for \\"Superman\\". Honors Galveston, Texas named September 14 Harriett Ball Day, after she helped in their school district. In 2009, Ball was inducted into the National Public Charter School Hall of Fame. She was named by Wendy Kopp and Forbes as one of the world's 7 Most Powerful Educators.

He represented Maranh√£o in the Federal Senate from 2011 to 2015. He is a member of the PMDB. Graduated in Civil Engineering from the University of Brasilia and Economics from UniCEUB, he is the son and first substitute of Senator Edison Lob√£o and Federal Representative Nice Lob√£o. He assumed the vacancy in the Federal Senate temporarily from January 30, 2008, after his father was licensed to take over the Ministry of Mines and Energy. With the return of Lob√£o to the Ministry in 2011, Lob√£o Filho reassumes the mandate. 'Edinho', as it is also known, is one of the owners of the Communication Diffusion System, an affiliate of SBT in the state of Maranh√£o.  Polemics  = Loan at Banco do Nordeste = Since 2002, Banco do Nordeste has attempted to pledge the assets of Lob√£o Filho, as it has been guarantor of a loan made and not paid with the financial institution. The loan would have been made in 1997 by Bemar Distribuidora de Bebidas in which it was to be paid in thirty installments. Besides Lob√£o, his wife Paula and the members of the Maranh√£o distributor, Maria Luiza Thiago de Almeida and Ana Maria dos Santos, appear as guarantors. The Maranh√£o beverage company did not pay the debt and since then the bank has tried to pawn the goods of the then senator and other guarantors. At the beginning of the action, the debt was R $5.5 million.

Some sources assert Bolon was the first law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty in the territory that is now the state of Washington, though the Washington Peace Officers Memorial in Olympia, Washington lists a King County sheriff's deputy killed the year before Bolon's death. Early life Bolon was born in Pennsylvania, where he married, eventually emigrating west and settling in Vancouver, Washington. During the Cayuse War Bolon served in the Oregon militia. By May 1855 he was working as a Sub-Agent in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, reporting to Agent James Doty. Bolon had been assigned responsibility for the Yakima Reservation and spent the summer of 1855 meeting tribal leaders and learning the geography of the area. Bolon was well-liked by the Yakama and had forged a close friendship with Shumaway, Kamiakin's younger brother. Andrew Jackson Bolon, Curtis Short, Henry C. Morse (left to right), c. 1850 Death =Background= Treaties between the United States and several Indian tribes in the Washington Territory resulted in reluctant tribal recognition of U.S. sovereignty over a vast amount of land in the Washington Territory. The tribes, in return for this recognition, were to receive half of the fish in the territory in perpetuity, awards of money and provisions, and reserved lands where white settlement would be prohibited. While governor Isaac Stevens had guaranteed the inviolability of Native American territory following tribal accession to the treaties, he lacked the legal authority to enforce it pending ratification of the agreements by the United States Senate. Meanwhile, the widely publicized discovery of gold in Yakama territory prompted an influx of unruly prospectors who traveled, unchecked, across the newly defined tribal lands, to the growing consternation of Indian leaders. In 1855 two of these prospectors were killed by Qualchin, the nephew of Kamiakin, after it was discovered they had raped a Yakama woman. =The murder= Some confusion exists surrounding the death of Bolon. According to the most popular version of events, Bolon, receiving word of the prospector deaths, departed for the scene on horseback to investigate but was intercepted by Shumaway who warned him Qualchin was too dangerous to confront. Heeding Shumaway's warning, Bolon turned back and began the ride home. En route he came upon a group of Yakama traveling south and decided to ride along with them. One of the members of this group was Mosheel, Shumaway's son. Mosheel decided to kill Bolon for reasons that are not entirely clear. Though a number of Yakama in the traveling party protested, their objections were overruled by Mosheel who invoked his regal status. Discussions about Bolon's fate took place over much of the day (Bolon, who did not understand Sahaptian, was unaware of the conspiracy unfolding among his traveling companions). During a rest stop, as Bolon and the Yakama were eating lunch, Mosheel and at least three other Yakama set upon him with knives. Bolon yelled out in a Chinook dialect, \\"I did not come to fight you!\\" before being stabbed in the throat. Bolon's horse was then shot, and his body and personal effects burned. These details of Bolon's death were told to rancher Lucullus McWhorter sometime between 1911 and 1915 by the elderly Suleil, who claimed to have been witness to the event as a young man. A different version of events has Bolon murdered by Qualchin himself after threatening reprisals for the killing of the prospectors. This version of the story was more popular prior to the recording of Suleil's narrative by McWhorter. When Qualchin, toward the end of the Yakima War, was captured and hanged by Col. George Wright, it was under the assumption that he was the murderer of Bolon. =Aftermath= When Shumaway heard of Bolon's death he immediately sent an ambassador to inform the U.S. Army garrison at Fort Dalles, before calling for the arrest of his son, Mosheel, who he said should be turned over to the territorial government to forestall the American retaliation he felt would likely occur. A Yakama council overruled Shumaway, however, and began preparing for war. After receiving Shumaway's ambassador, U.S. Army district commander Gabriel Rains ordered Major Granville O. Haller to set out with an expeditionary column from Fort Dalles. Haller's force was met and turned back at the edge of Yakama territory by a large group of Yakama warriors. As Haller withdrew, his company was engaged and routed by the Yakama. News of the death of Bolon and the defeat of Haller's company sparked panic throughout the territory and fear that an Indian uprising was in progress. Rains appealed to the governments of Washington and Oregon for military aid. In response, two companies of Washington militia were mobilized to reinforce the 350 federal troops already under Rains' command, while Oregon Governor George Law Curry activated a cavalry regiment of 800 men, three companies of which crossed the Columbia River and into Washington territory in early November. The Yakima War had begun. After the end of hostilities, two of Mosheel's confederates in the murder of Bolon were arrested at Priest Rapids by a detachment of United States Army Indian Scouts who returned them to Fort Simcoe where they were hanged. Mosheel himself was captured and turned over to the U.S. Army by other Yakama as a peace offering. He was shot and killed by American soldiers while attempting escape. Personal life Bolon was married; at the time of his death, his wife was pregnant. Legacy George H. Hines (secretary of the Oregon Historical Society), Gen. Hazard Stevens, W.T. Bonney (secretary of the Washington Historical Society), rancher Lucullus McWhorter, and Klickitat tribesman William Charley unveil a monument to Andrew Bolon in 1918. Two monuments were established to Bolon in 1918 by the Washington State Historical Society. The first was placed at the site of his death in a remote area 24 miles outside Goldendale, Washington. (The site of Bolon's death had been revealed to McWhorter and a Klickitat, William Charley, by Suleil.) The second monument was placed at a more visible crossroads approximately four miles away from the first monument. Gen. Hazard Stevens, who was in frail health and would suffer the stroke that led to his death the following day, spoke at the dedication ceremony. During his address, Stevens eulogized Bolon as the best friend of the Yakama among the whites. Bolon's name is also inscribed on the Washington Peace Officers Memorial, located adjacent to the Washington State Capitol in Olympia, Washington.

A serious film about loneliness, loss, and aging, it is also filled with joie de vivre from beginning to end (and a very cheeky ending it is).\\" Justin Chang of Variety said that \\"Paul Eenhoorn and Earl Lynn Nelson give pitch-perfect performances in this gently elegiac road comedy from helmers Martha Stephens and Aaron Katz.\\" Todd McCarthy in his review for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film by saying that \\"A gently amusing odyssey with two old gents on the road in Iceland.\\" Chris Cabin of Slant Magazine, praised the direction by saying that \\"the filmmakers consistently catch the nuances of character that bind the two men to each other, rather than simply tracing the pros and cons of their dispositions, is what gives the film its melancholic yet vibrant resonance.\\" Dan Fienberg of HitFix said, \\"It's a funny and moving film about aging, but it's also a wacky journey across Iceland with two characters who are instantly likable and ultimately quite lovable.\\" References External links  Category:2014 films Category:2010s adventure comedy films Category:2010s buddy comedy films Category:2014 independent films Category:2010s road movies Category:American films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American independent films Category:American road movies Category:Icelandic films Category:Icelandic independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films about old age Category:Films directed by Martha Stephens Category:Films scored by Keegan DeWitt Category:Films shot in Iceland Category:Sony Pictures Classics films Category:Icelandic adventure films Category:Icelandic comedy films Category:2014 comedy films ","title":"Land Ho!"},{"id":"42777884","text":"Metamoris is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu promotion, founded by Ralek Gracie, that organizes events in Los Angeles, California.

The sermon has traditionally been considered as the beginning of the Oxford Movement of High Church Anglicans.Perry Butler, ‚ÄòKeble, John (1792‚Äì1866)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2006, accessed 16 May 2014. Background The previous five years had seen radical changes to the nature of the relationship between the Church of England and the state. In 1828 the centuries-old discrimination against Protestant Dissenters was repealed and in 1829 Catholic Emancipation was passed. In 1830 the Pittite-Tory regime fell and the first Whig government in a generation took office, dedicated to reform. Many Anglican churchmen, after the Whig triumph of the Reform Act 1832, believed that the Whigs were preparing to invade the rights and alter the constitution of the Church.R. W. Church, The Oxford Movement. Twelve Years, 1833-1845 (London: The University of Chicago Press, 1970), p. 68. In 1833 the Whigs passed the Church Temporalities Act. This reorganised the Church of Ireland and reduced its bishoprics from 22 to 12. This seemed to justify Anglican fears that the government was prepared to act against Church opinion.Church, p. 68. Sermon The text of the sermon was 1 Samuel 12:23: \\"As for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way\\".John Keble, The Christian Year, Lyra Innocentium and Other Poems together with His Sermon on ‚ÄúNational Apostasy‚Äù (London: Oxford University Press, 1914), p. 543. After talking about sin and God's punishment, Keble said: > The case is at least possible, of a nation, having for centuries > acknowledged, as an essential part of its theory of government, that, as a > Christian nation, she is also a part of Christ's Church, and bound, in all > her legislation and policy, by the fundamental rules of that Church‚Äîthe case > is, I say, conceivable, of a government and people, so constituted, > deliberately throwing off the restraint, which in many respects such a > principle would impose on them, nay, disavowing the principle itself; and > that, on the plea, that other states, as flourishing or more so in regard of > wealth and dominion, do well enough without it. Is not this desiring, like > the Jews, to have an earthly king over them, when the Lord their God is > their King? Is it not saying in other words, ‚ÄúWe will be as the heathen, the > families of the countries,‚Äù the aliens to the Church of our Redeemer?Keble, > p. 546. Keble claimed that this movement was always \\"traceable to the same decay or want of faith, the same deficiency in Christian resignation and thankfulness, which leads so many, as individuals, to disdain and forfeit the blessings of the Gospel. Men not impressed with religious principle attribute their ill success in life,‚Äîthe hard times they have to struggle with,‚Äîto anything rather than their own ill-desert: and the institutions of the country, ecclesiastical and civil, are always at hand to bear the blame of whatever seems to be going amiss\\". The Israelites of Samuel's time were guilty of this by demanding a change in their constitution.Keble, p. 547. Keble saw contemporary parallels to this: > And so, in modern times, when liberties are to be taken, and the intrusive > passions of men to be indulged, precedent and permission, or what sounds > like them, may be easily found and quoted for everything. But Samuel, in > God's Name, silenced all this, giving them to understand, that in His sight > the whole was a question of motive and purpose, not of ostensible and > colourable argument;‚Äîin His sight, I say, to Whom we, as well as they, are > nationally responsible for much more than the soundness of our deductions as > matter of disputation, or of law; we are responsible for the meaning and > temper in which we deal with His Holy Church, established among us for the > salvation of our souls.Keble, pp. 547-548. These were \\"omens and tokens of an Apostate Mind in a nation\\".Keble, p. 548. He gave further examples: > One of the most alarming, as a symptom, is the growing indifference, in > which men indulge themselves, to other men's religious sentiments. Under the > guise of charity and toleration we are come almost to this pass; that no > difference, in matters of faith, is to disqualify for our approbation and > confidence, whether in public or domestic life. Can we conceal it from > ourselves, that every year the practice is becoming more common, of trusting > men unreservedly in the most delicate and important matters, without one > serious inquiry, whether they do not hold principles which make it > impossible for them to be loyal to their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier? > Are not offices conferred, partnerships formed, intimacies courted,‚Äînay > (what is almost too painful to think of), do not parents commit their > children to be educated, do they not encourage them to intermarry, in > houses, on which Apostolical Authority would rather teach them to set a > mark, as unfit to be entered by a faithful servant of Christ? Keble claimed he was not speaking of \\"public measures only or chiefly...But I speak of the spirit which leads men to exult in every step of that kind; to congratulate one another on the supposed decay of what they call an exclusive system\\".Keble, pp. 548-549. This led him to say: > The point really to be considered is, whether, according to the coolest > estimate, the fashionable liberality of this generation be not ascribable, > in a great measure, to the same temper which led the Jews voluntarily to set > about degrading themselves to a level with the idolatrous Gentiles? And, if > it be true anywhere, that such enactments are forced on the Legislature by > public opinion, is APOSTASY too hard a word to describe the temper of that > nation?Keble, p. 549. Keble claimed this same tendency was apparent in \\"the surly or scornful impatience often exhibited...when Christian motives are suggested, and checks from Christian principles attempted to be enforced on their public conduct\\". Furthermore, there had been \\"observable a growing disinclination, on the part of those bound by VOLUNTARY OATHS, to whatever reminds them of their obligation; a growing disposition to explain it all away\\". People who thought of such conduct lightly were \\"indulging or encouraging a profane dislike of God's awful Presence; a general tendency, as a people, to leave Him out of all their thoughts\\".Keble, p. 550. Impatience under pastoral authority, Keble warned, was regarded by Jesus \\"as a never-failing symptom of an unchristian temper\\", quoted His words in Luke 10:16: \\"He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth Me\\". Keble claimed this as evidence that > ...disrespect to the Successors of the Apostles, as such, is an > unquestionable symptom of enmity to Him, Who gave them their commission at > first, and has pledged Himself to be with them for ever. Suppose such > disrespect general and national, suppose it also avowedly grounded not on > any fancied tenet of religion, but on mere human reasons of popularity and > expediency, either there is no meaning at all in these emphatic declarations > of our Lord, or that nation, how highly soever she may think of her religion > and morality, stands convicted in His sight of a direct disavowal of His > Sovereignty. Keble noted that Saul sinned by listening to the voice of the people rather than obeying God, citing 1 Samuel 15:24. Keble warned: > God forbid, that any Christian land should ever, by her prevailing temper > and policy, revive the memory and likeness of Saul, or incur a sentence of > reprobation like his. But if such a thing should be, the crimes of that > nation will probably begin in infringement on Apostolical Rights; she will > end in persecuting the true Church; and in the several stages of her > melancholy career, she will continually be led on from bad to worse by vain > endeavours at accommodation and compromise with evil. Sometimes toleration > may be the word, as with Saul when he spared the Amalekites; sometimes state > security, as when he sought the life of David; sometimes sympathy with > popular feeling, as appears to have been the case, when violating solemn > treaties, he attempted to exterminate the remnant of the Gibeonites, in his > zeal for the children of Israel and Judah (2 Sam. xxi. 2). Such are the sad > but obvious results of separating religious resignation altogether from > men's notions of civil duty.Keble, p. 551. Keble posed another question: \\"What should be the tenor of their conduct, who find themselves cast on such times of decay and danger? How may a man best reconcile his allegiance to God and his Church with his duty to his country, that country, which now, by the supposition, is fast becoming hostile to the Church, and cannot therefore long be the friend of God?\\" He pointed to the conduct of Samuel who was faced with similar circumstances and who combined \\"sweetness with firmness, of consideration with energy, [that] constitute[d] the temper of a perfect public man\\". Samuel was publicly dismayed at the Israelites' conduct and although he obeyed God in letting the people make their own way he protested \\"in the most distinct and solemn tone, so as to throw the whole blame of what might ensue on their wilfulness\\". He continued to serve but with a heavy heart: \\"God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way\\".Keble, pp. 551-552. Keble said that if \\"the Apostolical Church should be forsaken, degraded, nay trampled on and despoiled by the State and people of England, I cannot conceive a kinder wish for her, on the part of her most affectionate and dutiful children, than that she may, consistently, act in the spirit of this most noble sentence\\".Keble, p. 552. If such a calamity should happen, the Church would have to be constant in intercession. The second duty incumbent upon Christians would be remonstrance: \\"calm, distinct, and persevering, in public and in private, direct and indirect, by word, look, and demeanour, is the unequivocal duty of every Christian, according to his opportunities, when the Church landmarks are being broken down\\".Keble, p. 553. Keble countered against rebellion against an apostatised state: \\"On the same principle, come what may, we have ill learned the lessons of our Church, if we permit our patriotism to decay, together with the protecting care of the State. ‚ÄúThe powers that be are ordained of God,‚Äù whether they foster the true church or no. Submission and order are still duties. They were so in the days of pagan persecution; and the more of loyal and affectionate feeling we endeavour to mingle with our obedience, the better\\".Keble, p. 554. Instead, \\"the surest way to uphold or restore our endangered Church, will be for each of her anxious children, in his own place and station, to resign himself more thoroughly to his God and Saviour in those duties, public and private, which are not immediately affected by the emergencies of the moment: the daily and hourly duties, I mean, of piety, purity, charity, justice\\". Keble ended his sermon: > These cautions being duly observed, I do not see how any person can devote > himself too entirely to the cause of the Apostolical Church in these realms. > There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He > may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see > any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be > consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good > Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no > other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:‚Äîhe is calmly, > soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING > SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal. He need not > fear to look upon the efforts of anti-Christian powers, as did the holy > Apostles themselves, who welcomed the first persecution in the words of the > Psalmist: ‚ÄúWhy do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? > ‚ÄúThe kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, > against the Lord, and against His Anointed. ‚ÄúFor of a truth against Thy Holy > Child Jesus, Whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with > the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,‚Äî ‚ÄúFOR TO DO > WHATSOEVER THY HAND AND THY COUNSEL DETERMINED BEFORE TO BE DONE‚Äù.Keble, pp. > 555-556. Reception Historians such as R. W. Church in his classic study of the Oxford Movement have followed Newman in regarding Keble's sermon as the beginning of the Movement. However F. L. Cross disputed the sermon's importance as the starting point of the Movement.‚ÄòAppendix IV: The Myth of July 14, 1833‚Äô, F. L. Cross, John Henry Newman (London: Philip Allan, 1933), pp. 162-163.

High accuracy prediction of elastic, electronic, transport and phase properties is possible with modern methods. Ab Initio Calculations Ab initio or first principles calculations are any of a number of software packages making use of density functional theory to solve for the quantum mechanical state of a system. Perfect crystals are an ideal subject for such calculations because of their high periodicity. Since every simulation package will vary in the details of its algorithms and implementations, this page will focus on a methodological overview. =Basic Theory= Density functional theory seeks to solve for an approximate form of the electronic density of a system. In general, atoms are split into ionic cores and valence electrons. The ionic cores (nuclei plus non-bonding electrons) are assumed to be stable and are treated as a single object. Each valence electron is treated separately. Thus, for example, a Lithium atom is treated as two bodies ‚Äì Li+ and e- ‚Äì while oxygen is treated as three bodies, namely O2+ and 2e‚àí. The ‚Äútrue‚Äù ground state of a crystal system is generally unsolvable. However, the variational theorem assures us that any guess as to the electronic state function of a system will overestimate the ground state energy. Thus, by beginning with a suitably parametrized guess and minimizing the energy with respect to each of those parameters, an extremely accurate prediction may be made. The question as to what one's initial guess should be is a topic of active research. In the large majority of crystal systems, electronic relaxation times are orders of magnitude shorter than ionic relaxation times. Thus, an iterative scheme is adopted. First, the ions are considered fixed and the electronic state is relaxed by considering the ionic and electron-electron pair potentials. Next, the electronic states are considered fixed and the ions are allowed to move under the influence of the electronic and ion-ion pair potentials. When the decrease in energy between two iterative steps is sufficiently small, the structure of the crystal is considered solved. =Boundary Conditions= A key choice that must be made is how many atoms to explicitly include in one's calculation. In Big-O notation, calculations general scale as O(N3) where N is the number of combined ions and valence electrons. For structure calculations, it is generally desirable to choose the smallest number of ions that can represent the structure. For example, NaCl is a bcc cubic structure. At a first guess, one might construct a cell of two interlocked cubes ‚Äì 8 Na and 8 Cl ‚Äì as one's unit cell. This will give the correct answer but is computationally wasteful. By choosing appropriate coordinates, one might simulate it with just two atoms: 1 Na and 1 Cl. Crystal structure calculations rely on periodic boundary conditions. That is, the assumption is that the cell you have chosen is in the midst of an infinite lattice of identical cells. By taking our 1 Na 1 Cl cell and copying it many times along each of the crystal axes, we will have simulated the same superstructure as our 8 Na 8 Cl cell but with much reduced computational cost. =Raw Output= Only a few lists of information will be output from a calculation, in general. For the ions, the position, velocity and net force on each ion are recorded at each step. For electrons, the guess as to the electronic state function may be recorded as well. Finally, the total energy of the system is recorded. From these three types of information, we may deduce a number of properties. Calculable Properties =Unit Cell Parameters= Unit cell parameters (a,b,c,Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥) can be computed from the final relaxed positions of the ions. In a NaCl calculation, the final position of the Na ion might be (0,0,0) in picometer Cartesian coordinates and the final position of the Cl ion might be (282,282,282). From this, we see that the lattice constant would be 584 pm. For non-orthorhombic systems, the determination of cell parameters might be more complicated, but many ab-initio numerical packages have utilities to make this calculation simpler. Once the lattice cell parameters are known, patterns for single crystal or powder diffraction can be readily predicted via Bragg's Law. =Temperature and Pressure= The temperature of the system can be estimated by use of the Equipartition Theorem, with three degrees of freedom for each ion. Since ionic velocities are generally recorded at each step in the numerical simulation, the average kinetic energy of each ion is easy to calculate. There exist schemes which attempt to control the temperature of the simulation by, e.g. enforcing each ion to have exactly the kinetic energy predicted by the Equipartition Theorem (Berendsen thermostat) or by allowing the system to exchange energy and momentum with a (more massive) fictitious enclosing system (Nose-Hoover thermostat). The net force on each ion is generally calculated explicitly at each numerical step. From this, the stress tensor of the system can be calculated and usually is calculated by the numerical package. By varying the convergence criteria, one can either seek a lowest energy structure or a structure that produces a desired stress tensor. Thus, high pressures can be simulated as easily as ambient pressures. =Elastic Properties= The Young's modulus of a mineral can be predicted by varying one cell parameter at a time and observing the evolution of the stress tensor. Because the raw output of a simulation includes energy and volume, the integrated version of the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state is often used to determine bulk modulus. =Electronic Density of States= The electronic density functional is explicitly used in the calculation of the electronic ground state. Packages such as VASP have an option to calculate the electronic density of states per eV to facilitate the prediction of conduction bands and band gaps. =Thermal Transport Properties= The Green-Kubo relations can be used to calculate the thermal transport properties of a mineral. Since the velocities of the ions are stored at each numerical step, one can calculate the time correlation of later velocities with earlier velocities. The integral of these correlations is related to the Fourier thermal coefficient. =Diffusion= By recording the ionic positions at each time step, one can observe how far, on average, each ion has moved from its original position. The mean squared displacement of each ion type is related to the diffusion coefficient for a particle undergoing Brownian motion.

In 1964 they published an article titled \\"The applicability of the third integral of motion: Some numerical experiments\\". Their original idea was to find a third integral of motion in a galactic dynamics. For that purpose they took a simplified two- dimensional nonlinear axi-symmetric potential and found that the third integral existed only for a limited number of initial conditions. In the modern perspective the initial conditions that do not have the third integral of motion are called chaotic orbits. Introduction  The H√©non‚ÄìHeiles potential can be expressed as : V(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \\\\lambda \\\\left(x^2y - \\\\frac{y^3}{3}\\\\right). The H√©non‚ÄìHeiles Hamiltonian can be written as : H = \\\\frac12 (p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \\\\lambda \\\\left(x^2y - \\\\frac{y^3}{3}\\\\right). The H√©non‚ÄìHeiles system (HHS) is defined by the following four equations: : \\\\dot{x} = p_x, : \\\\dot{p_x} = -x - 2\\\\lambda xy, : \\\\dot{y} = p_y, : \\\\dot{p_y} = -y - \\\\lambda(x^2 - y^2). In the classical chaos community, the value of the parameter \\\\lambda is usually taken as unity. Since HHS is specified in \\\\R^2, we need a Hamiltonian with 2 degrees of freedom to model it. It can be solved for some cases using Painlev√© analysis. Quantum H√©non‚ÄìHeiles Hamiltonian In the quantum case the H√©non‚ÄìHeiles Hamiltonian can be written as a two-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation. The corresponding two-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation is given by :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\Psi(x,y) = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + \\\\frac12 (x^2 + y^2 ) + \\\\lambda \\\\left(x^2 y - \\\\frac13 y^3\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\Psi(x,y). Wada property of the exit basins  H√©non‚ÄìHeiles system shows rich dynamical behavior. Usually the Wada property cannot be seen in the Hamiltonian system, but H√©non‚ÄìHeiles exit basin shows an interesting Wada property. It can be seen that when the energy is greater than the critical energy, the H√©non‚ÄìHeiles system has three exit basins. In 2001 M. A. F. Sanju√°n et al. had shown that in the H√©non‚ÄìHeiles system the exit basins have the Wada property.

Early life and career Laura Malin was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1974, the only child of Ana Maria B. Malin and Mauro Malin. Because of political issues, she spent part of her early childhood moving from place to place: first Petropolis, then Salvador (both in Brazil), then to Santa Barbara, California, and finally Paris. She returned to Brazil in 1980 when she wrote her first (still unpublished) book ‚ÄúThe Case of the Punjabi List‚Äù to give as a Christmas present to her family. At age of 15 she spent the summer of 1990 in a kibbutz, in Israel, and the following year she returned to France to pursue her studies in French literature. Once there, she developed an interest in cinema while attending the Cannes Film Festival. In 1997 she graduated in Journalism from the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. During the early 1990s Laura worked as a translator and journalist. In 1998 she moved back to California to study writing and screenwriting at UC Berkeley. After completing her courses she moved to Los Angeles for two years, and then back to Brazil in 2000.  Journalism  Laura‚Äôs first job as a reporter was at Jornal do Brasil while still a university student, in 1993. She remained away from the field for some 20 years, until she was hired to work at Globo Network‚Äôs Journalism Department in 2012. Laura is currently a senior editor to the broadcaster‚Äôs website.  TV series creator  Laura debuted her first TV show as a creator and screenwriter in 2002 with Turma do Gueto (Rede Record). The TV drama series, a revolutionary project about the ‚Äústreet favelas,‚Äù was an instant hit. In 2005, Laura collaborated in the creation of Cilada, a Brazilian sitcom that lasted for six seasons and was aired on cable channel Multishow and later as part of Globo Network primetime magazine Fant√°stico. In 2010 and 2011 Laura created two documentary TV shows that aired on Bandeirantes Network, Turma da Biblioteca and Tempo e Movimento.  Book author  At age of 30, Laura published her first novel, Julio & Juliano, a thriller drama set up in Rio de Janeiro. Her second book, a biography about Brazilian actress D√©bora Duarte, came eight years later. In 2011 she released Livro de Joaquim, Review of O Livro de Joaquim, Livros em S√©rie the first book of the epic saga Tempo Perdido. In 2013, the second volume came out, Livro de Leah. The same year Laura also released a biography about the top model Luiza Brunet. Her first children‚Äôs book, Nada D+, written with singer Gabriel O Pensador, will be released in 2014.  Working abroad  Laura started writing for film and television projects out of the country, in Angola, where she wrote the TV series called Novos Quilombos; Paris, where she developed a drama series for mobiles; and in the US. Laura worked as a screenwriter on the set of The River Murders, a feature film she adapted for a Brazilian character on location (Spokane, WA). In 2009, Laura was Artistic Director at the first edition of the Hollywood Brazilian Film Festival‚Äôs first edition in Los Angeles.

This includes excluding job applicants, patients at hospitals, and turning away customers all on the basis of race. Restrictive housing covenants while they were legally effective from the early 1900s until the 1960s restricted non-white residents of Seattle's ability to own or rent homes in many neighborhoods and suburbs in Seattle. As a result, African-Americans in Seattle were concentrated into Seattle's Central District. On March 31 and April 1, 1966 thousands of Seattle Public School students boycotted the Central District in search for equality in the school systems. Many believed that the problems in the schools stemmed from almost 10,000 students being pushed into a limited amount of space. These locations were often underfunded and understaffed which resulted in poor test schools and low graduation rates. The number of protesters soon grew, including thousands of white students, and three public school teachers. The outpouring support for the issue forced the Seattle School Board to grant the public with a real solution to the problem.

He ran the Greater New York Circuit of first-class venues. Williams was known for giving generous pay and good working conditions to performers. At his death, he endowed his Long Island house as a retirement home for aged and destitute actors. Early years Percy Garnett Williams was born on May r, 1857, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the son of John B. Williams, a doctor and editor of the Baltimore Family Journal. Percy Williams was expected to also become a doctor, and after graduating from Baltimore College he studied medicine for a while. However, he was fascinated with theater. He organized and became the manager of the Courtland Dramatic Club. He played at the Front Street Theatre and Colonel Sinn's Theatre in Baltimore, then moved to Brooklyn in 1875, where he performed with Colonel Sinn's Park Theatre. He spent two seasons in Brooklyn, then returned to Baltimore and was the leading comedian in the Holliday Street Theater stock company. He performed in a traveling production of Uncle Tom's Cabin that received good reviews. In 1880 Williams launched a travelling medicine show, hawking \\"liver bags\\". These contained various herbs plus a charged battery attached to a belt. Williams would enlist a local citizen in each town he visited to try wearing a liver bag, and to then tell the public how much better he felt. At first the show was just a blackface song and dance routine by Williams accompanied by a banjo player. Williams sold the liver belts in the intermissions. Later the show expanded and was staged in a tent. Williams began organizing other acts to sell the liver belts. He would book halls and put on variety shows. Eventually he had sixty acts working for him, often as part of another travelling show. Bergen Beach Boardwalk of Bergen Beach Williams began investing in real estate around the end of the 1880s. He partnered with Thomas Adams, the chewing gum magnate, to buy what is now Bergen Beach, Brooklyn. This was of marshland in Brooklyn west of Rockaway and south of Flatbush on Jamaica Bay. Williams and Adams had meant to build housing, but decided to emulate the successful Coney Island. They converted Bergen Island into a resort. It was accessible via the Flatbush Avenue streetcar, now the B41 bus route. The resort opened in 1893 with a dance hall, concessions, rides and a pier. The Percy Williams Amusement park opened in June 1896, later just called Bergen Beach. Williams also opened Zip's Casino, a beer hall in Manhattan's Lower East Side. In March 1902 the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company offered to buy the Bergen Beach resort, but would not meet Williams' price. For a while trolley service to the beach was cut and business suffered, but trolley service was later improved again. The resort was damaged by two fires in 1904 and 1910. It was open again by 1915, but had closed by 1919. Theaters Gotham Theatre - 1907 postcard Orpheum Theatre - 1907 postcard Williams bought the Brooklyn Music Hall in 1897, later changing its name to the Gotham. He also ran the Novelty in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, sometimes shuttling acts by carriage so they could play both theaters on the same day. The Vaudeville Managers Association was formed in 1900 in an attempt to contain the salaries paid to performers. Williams refused to join. He believed in paying well and giving the performers good conditions. Performers found him a modest and approachable man, and enjoyed working for him. Williams' third theatre was the Orpheum in Brooklyn. He opened the Orpheum in 1901 on a plot of land he had bought in 1895. At the time it was thought to be the most beautiful theater in the world. Percy Williams continued to expand his operation, partnering with wealthy and well-connected men who could overcome problems with permits and licenses. He built or leased the Greenpoint, Crescent and Bushwick theaters in Brooklyn, the Bronx Opera House, the Circle and Colonial theaters in Manhattan, the Alhambra in Harlem, a theater in Philadelphia and another in Boston. As of 1905 the theater owners who booked through the William Morris Agency seemed likely to become dominant in the vaudeville industry. They included Williams, Frederick Freeman Proctor, Timothy Sullivan and Willie Hammerstein. However, E.F. Albee was building up the Keith-Albee circuit into the largest vaudeville chain east of the Mississippi. Albee created the United Booking Office (UBO) to coordinate and regulate vaudeville, and became the UBO general manager. Williams resisted joining the UBO, but was eventually persuaded to become the UBO business manager. He was pushed into this move by competition from A. L. Erlanger and Lee Shubert. The city of New York had \\"Blue Laws\\" that banned theatrical performances on Sundays, but did not enforce them strictly. Mayor George B. McClellan ordered their enforcement in 1907. In protest, the theaters closed down until the mayor was forced to ease up. Williams took the city to court over the laws, and won his case before the New York State Supreme Court. Poster for Breaking into Society (1905), a musical farce William's Orpheum Company advertised \\"Clean Shows in Clean Houses.\\" In 1907 Mae West performed at the Gotham Theater as a child actor in Hal Clarendon's stock theater company. Williams looked for acts in Europe, and signed contracts with Vesta Victoria, Vesta Tilley and Marie Lloyd among others. In 1909 Williams joined The Lambs, the famed theatrical club. In 1910 Williams staged a production called The Wow-Wows at the Alhambra, Bronx, Orpheum, Greenpoint and Colonial Theatres. Players who appeared in this show included Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. In 1910 Williams was managing more vaudeville theaters in New York City than any other. He had two in Manhattan and one each in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. He said that after several trips to the Old World to search for talent he found that all he was looking for was in the USA. He said of vaudeville performers, Last years By 1912 Williams was financially involved in eight highly profitable theaters in New York City. He was sick, suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, and lived in Florida part of the year. Both Albee and Martin Beck of the Orpheum Circuit wanted these theaters, Albee so his circuit would gain a dominant position in New York, and Beck so his circuit would become the first coast-to-coast vaudeville operation in the USA. Albee made the higher bid, and acquired Williams' theater interests for $5.25 million. Percy Williams became a thirty-second degree Mason and grand treasurer of the Elks for the United States. He died on 21 July 1923 at East Islip, New York, on Long Island. He was aged 66. His will said \\"I made my money from the actors; I herewith return it to them.\\" He bequeathed his home in East Islip as a home for aging and destitute actors, with a fund for their maintenance. Most of the property, including a nine-hole golf course, was sold by the trustees in 1973 so they could expand the Actors Fund Home in New Jersey. Bergen Beach was sold off in lots after 1925. Bergen House was razed around 1930. What was left of the boardwalk and amusement park were torn down in 1939. The Belt Parkway now runs through the area. The Gotham closed in 1934 and was demolished to make way for a parking lot. The Orpheum became part of the RKO chain, and was converted to showing only films after the Albee Theatre opened in 1925. It was closed early in the 1950s and was left unused until it was demolished. The 1,265-seat Colonial Theatre on Broadway, which Williams bought in April 1905 shortly after it opened, was renamed Keith's Colonial in 1912 and continued as a big-time vaudeville venue. Later it became Hampden's Theatre, the RKO Colonial cinema, an NBC and then ABC television studio, and in 1974 briefly became home of the Harkness Ballet. The theater closed in 1977. It was torn down and replaced by condominiums and a plaza.

The main focus of the theory is to detect and measure a singular point of an algebraic variety (cf. resolution of singularities). Because of this aspect, valuation theory, Rees algebras and integral closure are intimately connected to multiplicity theory.  Multiplicity of a module  Let R be a positively graded ring such that R is generated as an R0-algebra and R0 is Artinian. Note that R has finite Krull dimension d. Let M be a finitely generated R-module and FM(t) its Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series. This series is a rational function of the form :\\\\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)^d}, where P(t) is a polynomial. By definition, the multiplicity of M is :\\\\mathbf{e}(M) = P(1). The series may be rewritten :F(t) = \\\\sum_1^d {a_{d-i} \\\\over (1 - t)^d} + r(t). where r(t) is a polynomial. Note that a_{d-i} are the coefficients of the Hilbert polynomial of M expanded in binomial coefficients. We have :\\\\mathbf{e}(M) = a_0. As Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series are additive on exact sequences, the multiplicity is additive on exact sequences of modules of the same dimension. The following theorem, due to Christer Lech, gives a priori bounds for multiplicity.

The Battlefield Coordination Detachment (US Army), or BCD, is the senior United States Army liaison element of the Army Air Ground System. The BCD serves as a bridge between the senior US Army headquarters element and the senior Air Force headquarters in each respective US combatant command or theater of operations. The BCD enables the coordination of Army-Air Force mission command, fire support, integrated air and missile defense, intelligence sharing, airspace management, and airlift. Additional space, cyber, and electronic warfare augmentation allow the BCD to further enable the designated Army force commander across the complete spectrum of warfare. Simplified graphic depiction of the Theater Air Ground System/Army Air Ground Systems as they relate to BCD functions  History  When the National Security Act of 1947 removed the Air Corps from the US Army it effectively disrupted the development of doctrine supporting fixed-wing close air support (CAS) and deep strike coordination as capabilities improved. As aircraft capabilities increased, so did the demand by the US Army for additional support for combat and mobility operations. During the Korean War, CAS and Air Interdiction (AI) provided significant contributions to the war effort in disrupting enemy logistics, but failed to prove decisive according to US and PLA sources. Although the Air and Land Wars were generally aligned, they were not well coordinated. The Vietnam War saw the US Army increase its reliance on helicopter gunships for CAS in addition to the development of Tactical Air Control Parties to provide terminal attack guidance at the tactical levels. Operational planning systems remained undeveloped and Air-Ground Integration continued to perform at sub-optimal levels as helicopter gunship support provided the intermediate solution to the US Army‚Äôs Air-Ground Integration dilemma. The 1980s witnessed the development of AirLand Battle Doctrine, which relied heavily on US Air Force capabilities to shape the attack of numerous echelons of Soviet Forces in Europe where US Army Artillery could not reach or provide an accurate means of attack. General Wilbur L. Creech, USAF, assisted in the Airland Battle doctrinal development and saw it as a means to prevent the US Air Force from losing tactical mission aircraft to the US Army. The paradigm shift away from the US Air Force from only supporting CAS missions for the Army to meet the operations needs required close coordination between the components at the operational level. A provisional organization called a Battlefield Coordination Element (BCE) was established and in 1984 a Memorandum of Agreement between the two branches of service continued to codify the support requirements needed to unify efforts. The BCE was first officially employed in combat during Operation Just Cause, Panama, in 1989. Following the Gulf War, COL James Crigger, 9AF DCS Ops/CENTAF, specifically underscored the importance of the incorporation of the BCE into the Tactical Air Control Center for force synchronization. In November 1995, an agreement between the US Air Force and US Army formerly established the requirement for liaison elements between the components to allow better air to ground coordination. The 1995 agreement defined the BCE as an Army liaison team that operated in the US Air Force Tactical Air Control Center (TACC), which was later re-designated the Air Operations Center. The BCE structure remains nearly identical to the BCD of today, although there are now five established BCDs aligned with each US Geographic Combatant Command and the Korean theater of operations and their respective Combined/Joint Air Operations Centers. The development of joint doctrine codifying a comprehensive Theater Air Control System and Army Air Ground System allowed both the US Army and Air Forces to coordinate horizontally and laterally from operational staffs and tactical warfighters. BCEs or BCDs have supported US Army warfighters in every major joint military operation since Operation Just Cause and continue to evolve with the changing information environment. BCDs continue to work with partner Armies and Air Forces to build their capacity and interoperability to support humanitarian assistance/disaster relief operations as well as major combat operations. Organization  =Headquarters= Each BCD is Commanded by a US Army Field Artillery Colonel. The Headquarters Section additionally provides communications and administrative support to the organization. =Plans Section= The BCD Plans Sections works in the AOC Combat Plans Division to integrate Army Force requirements into the Joint Air Tasking Cycle (ATC) and ultimately the Air Tasking Order (ATO) distributed from the Air Operations Center to each subordinate flying wing. Typical requirements supported are: US Army Force Air Interdiction Target Nominations, Air Support Requests (ASRs), Airspace, Airlift, Intelligence, and Air Defense to US Army elements. =Operations Section= The BCD Operations Section operates within the AOC Combat Operations Division (COD) on the operations floor to monitor the execution of US Army Air Support in the ATO. The Operations Section provides ground situation updates to the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) and Chief of AOC Combat Operations to allow expeditious decision making pertaining to Air Force support to the US Army. The Operations Section also coordinates US Army Fire Support to the Air Force, personnel recovery, dynamic targeting. The Operations Section also coordinates with the Navy, Marine, and Special Force Liaisons to the AOC to provide additional means of joint coordination. The BCD Operations Section placement in the AOC and integration into ARFOR planning/execution cycles as well as ABCS systems, allows it to have maximum situational awareness in the joint fight and provide very significant (albeit unseen) contributions to the ARFOR effort. =Intelligence Section= The BCD Intelligence Section works with the Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Division, Combat Plans Division, and Combat Operations Division of the AOC to support US Army intelligence collection requirements and exchange ground/air intelligence between components. =Airspace Section= The BCD Airspace Section works with the Combat Plans and Combat Operations Divisions of the AOC to incorporate US Army Airspace requirements into planning and execution of the ATO. The Airspace section is critical to the clearance of airspace for US Army artillery fires as well as the airspace deconfliction in support of rotary wing and unmanned systems. =Air Defense Section= The BCD Air Defense Section works in both Combat Plans and Combat Operations Divisions to serve as the advocate for US Army air defense as the ground battle develops as it pertains to critical asset defense. As the US Army ground component situation changes and units adjust to the operating environment, the BCD Air Defense Section informs the AOC of updated air defense requirements to ensure adequate defensive coverage by air and ground-based, defensive platforms. The BCD Air Defense section works in conjunction with the Area Air and Missile Defense Commands (AAMDC)to support US Army Force defense requirements. =Airlift Section= The BCD Airlift section works within the Air Mobility Division (AMD) of the AOC to ensure US Army Air Mobility requests are serviced in both the planning and execution phases of each air tasking order. The BCD Airlift section placement with the AOC AMD leverages the US Army's ability to coordinate the movement of personnel and equipment throughout the command and assist in sourcing assets. Pro-active communication between the Ground Liaison Detachment, the BCD Operations Section, and the Airlift section can greatly enhance mission command to US Army theater/corps/division HQs during complex, time sensitive airborne operations. =Ground liaison detachments (GLD)= GLDs typically consist of a Field Artillery captain and a Field Artillery sergeant first class to provide the ground scheme of maneuver to a supporting air wing. GLDs are administratively under the control of the BCD, but work at their designated air wings or carrier strike groups supporting US Army operations. GLDs provide ground intelligence, coordinating data and maneuver information directly to the pilots who will fly a given close air support or airlift mission. The terminal control of missions are coordinated with US Air Force tactical air control parties assigned to US Army units and the US Army ground liaisons back at the Air Force wing will debrief pilots for any information pertaining to the result of the mission.

It stars Clarence Nash as the voice of Donald and Gloria Blondell as the voice of Daisy, respectively. The cartoon features Donald going to visit Daisy, but his temper control problems cause him to wreck the house and get kicked out. To cure himself of his temper, he gets a machine that proceeds to deliver physical and angering abuse. Plot Donald decides to visit Daisy at her home. Daisy is first annoyed by Donald blowing smoke from his cigar into her face. Daisy asks Donald to open the windows. Donald struggles and strains to open it, but it won't budge. Donald strains so hard his face sweats, turns red with anger, and he nearly tears the house apart with his straining, but still the window doesn't move. This causes Donald to enter an uncontrolled and maniacal rage. He smashes the window, tears down curtains, rips a refrigerator off its base, destroys a sofa, destroys some dishes, and even rips telephones and power lines through the wall, virtually wrecking the house. Daisy is appalled at his behavior and shows Donald that he just needed to turn the little knob atop the frame to open it. Disappointed, she tells him, \\"Temper, temper, shame on you. You never see me lose my temper, do you?\\" Upset at how easily he got angry, she orders Donald to leave and she refuses to go out with him until he can control his temper. While trudging through the streets, Donald sees an ad in a newspaper, from the Tootsberry Institute, promising a way to cure temper issues. They send an \\"anger control machine\\" to Donald which promises that if Donald can take its taunts for 10 minutes, and still control his temper, he'll be cured forever. The machine abuses Donald in numerous ways, from punching him, clipping the buttons off his sailor suit (a clever, in-universe explanation for why his buttons never re-appear after this cartoon: they were eliminated to increase animation pencil mileage), pummeling his feet with a brick, and even blaring loud sounds into his ear. After 10 minutes, Donald is still standing, and has not lost his temper. At this point, the machine declares that he's done it! Donald eagerly races back to Daisy's, to tell her that he's changed. She decides to test this by having him open the window. Donald manages to turn the little knob atop the window, but still struggles to get it open. He eventually uses a fire cleaning tool to hold the window open again, but it still falls down. Just when it seems he's succeeded, the glass in the window pane falls out and smashes over his head. But even though this happens, Donald still remains in good spirits. Daisy is pleased, and decides to go out with Donald. She rushes upstairs, and returns wearing a strange-looking hat for their date. Donald laughs at her hat, only to have her lose her temper - for the first time ever - and begins hitting Donald with her broom. Notes This is not the first episode where Donald tries to find a way to cure his temper; the first one was Self Control (1938). However, this one differs from Self Control in that Donald has better luck learning to control his temper (he returns to his old angry self at the end of the former episode). His curing in Cured Duck seems to be more successful; Donald does not have any large temper outbursts in cartoons following this episode (though he still seems to be easily agitated).

Inspired by his inability to fulfill his dying father's final wish to once again visit his homeland, Rigdol risked incarceration to smuggle 20,000 kg of Tibetan soil from Tibet through the Himalayas to Dharamshala, in India. With it, he created an unprecedented interactive installation, Our Land, Our People, to literally bring Tibet closer to its people.

The planet is located at right ascension declination at a distance of . Properties An orbital revolution around its parent star (which is 1/3 the mass of the Sun) or \\"year\\", would take approximately 163,000 years to complete, considering a circular orbit with 2000 AU as the semi-major axis. It is a gas giant located in the constellation of Pisces, 155 light-years from the Solar System, and estimated to have a mass nine to thirteen times that of Jupiter, and a surface temperature of 1000 K. It is a relatively young stellar system, part of the AB Doradus moving group of ca. 30 main stars created from the same molecular cloud less than 100 million years ago, and the only one found among the 90 stars of the group examined. Discovery The discovery was made by an international team of astronomers led by Marie-Eve Naud of the Universit√© de Montr√©al in Quebec, combining observations from telescopes of the Gemini Observatory, the Mont M√©gantic Observatory (OMM), the Canada‚ÄìFrance‚ÄìHawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the W. M. Keck Observatory. Its large distance away from its parent star permitted the use of combined infra-red and visible light images to detect it, a technique astronomers hope to reproduce to discover much closer planets with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) in Chile. Near-infrared spectroscopy of the companion was obtained with the GNIRS spectrograph on the Gemini North Telescope, which shows evidence of low surface gravity confirming the planet's youth. Weak methane absorption was detected in H and K band corresponding to a spectral type of T3.5.

As of July 17, 2013, it had more than 200,000 articles, making it the fourth-largest Korean-language wiki, following Korean Wikipedia, Korean Wiktionary and the Namuwiki, forked of Rigveda Wiki. It focuses on a wide range of topics. History On August 2, 2013, Rigveda Wiki opened its beta service, and the layout of the website was changed. Since then, people have been able to use Rigveda Wiki from mobile devices. As of December 2014, the front page of the websites advertised three main avenues of participation: a wiki, a web forum or BBS (wikibbs) and an Android app. The front page of the wiki advertised the site as running on muniwiki, a fork of MoinMoin, and as having a CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0 South Korea license. As of June 2015, only the wiki section was in the front page. The site was offline between April 25, 2015 and May 17, 2015, due to controversies between the site owner and the community about the copyright status of the wiki. When the website came back online, only owners and registered users could contribute. After April 2015, almost all users left Rigveda Wiki and moved to Namuwiki, a fork which used the same CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0 South Korea license. This is considered one of the biggest forks in the history of wikis.  Features  Rigveda Wiki is a wiki system open for contributions by both registered and unregistered users (recorded by their IP address). Its policies are more permissive than Wikipedia's and allow personal opinions as well. As a result, Rigveda Wiki has many articles about pop culture topics such as cartoons, animations, games, and television programs. It has a board for discussing, questioning, and answering subjects relevant to articles. Rigveda Wiki can have strikethrough or deletion lines. This is a line in the middle of text that means 'whispering', or something a person wants to say but not have high visibility.  Wiki Neet  This term is used to describe people who spend a lot of time in Rigveda Wiki. It includes people who think that they do not have any special purpose in their lives and spend their time just doing nothing.  Preserving memory  Rigveda Wiki also serves as a place to preserve social memories. For example, the sinking of the MV Sewol, on 16 April 2014, was deemed an unforgettable accident by some South Koreans. Rigveda Wiki was one of the websites where people recorded their thoughts on the incident. In one week 34,000 words were added to the related article on the wiki.

It is used in applications in which the inlet pressure of a pump is close to the vapor pressure of the pumped liquid. Inducers are frequently included in design of turbopumps for liquid propellant rocket engines, although they are used in other applications which require high suction performance. It does not increase NPSHa but increases NPSHr for Pump. An inducer operating in an experimental water tunnel. The tip vortex cavitation phenomenon can be clearly identified.  Use in rocketry  In order to achieve high delta-v, the structural mass of a launch vehicle should be as low as possible. Liquid fuel tanks can be constructed lighter if the pressure within those tanks is kept low. Typically, for pump-fed rocket engines, the propellant tank pressures (and masses) are 1/10 to 1/40 of those in a pressure-fed rocket. The structural weight constraint also makes the rotating speed of the turbopump rotor as high as possible. For example, the rotating speed of the oxygen turbopump of the Japanese LE-7 rocket engine is 18300rpm. These two factors above combine to make the pump impeller very susceptible to cavitation. If cavitation occurs in the impeller, the performance of the pump will be severely degraded and the pump itself may be damaged.

In his youth he was commonly known as Yamada Ichinoj≈ç; however, he changed his name frequently during the Bakumatsu period. Biography =Early career as a samurai= Yamada was born in Abu District, Nagato Province (in what is now part of the city of Hagi, Yamaguchi), and was the son of a 102 koku samurai official of the Ch≈çsh≈´ Navy. After studies at the domain's Meirinkan academy (where he studied the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ school of Japanese swordsmanship), he joined the Sh≈çkasonjuku Academy run by Yoshida Sh≈çin in June 1857. He was the youngest student of the Sh≈çkasonjuku. He was in the retinue of Ch≈çsh≈´ daimy≈ç in Kyoto in the autumn of 1862. A strong supporter of the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement, he signed his name in blood (together with Takasugi Shinsaku, Kusaka Genzui, It≈ç Hirobumi, Inoue Kaoru, Shinagawa Yajir≈ç) to a petition to rid Japan of the foreigners. After Ch≈çsh≈´ forces were driven from Kyoto by supporters of the k≈çbu gattai movement, he went into exile with Sanj≈ç Sanetomi. During this period, he studied western military science under ≈åmura Masujir≈ç. He soon had the opportunity to put his training to practical use during the Kinmon incident, Shimonoseki Campaign, and Second Ch≈çsh≈´ expedition. Despite his youth, he subsequently played a major role in the Boshin War, commanding a group of 700 men under the authority of Ch≈çsh≈´ daimy≈ç M≈çri Takachika, starting with the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi, and also commanding Satch≈ç Alliance naval forces in Mutsu Bay. =Meiji restoration= In June 1869, Yamada was received in an audience (together with Kuroda Kiyotaka) and appointed Hy≈çbu no dai-j≈ç (senior staff officer in the Ministry of War). This rank became that of major general in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army in July 1871. On 22 October 1871, he set sail for the United States as a member of the Iwakura Mission. Visiting San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Chicago, and Washington DC, he also went to Philadelphia to view the Philadelphia Naval Shipyards. He then returned to Japan via Paris, Berlin, the Netherlands, Belgium, Lausanne, Bulgaria and Russia. He also visited the 1873 Vienna World Exposition, returning to Japan 2 June 1873. On his return, he was named Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Qing China to negotiate the opening of diplomatic relations, however, Kido Takayoshi went in his place, as Yamada was called upon to use military force to suppress the Saga Rebellion and subsequently the Satsuma Rebellion by disgruntled ex-samurai. page 175 On 5 July 1874 he was appointed Justice Lord under the daij≈ç-kan system, which he held to 10 September 1879. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 2nd class in 1875, and was promoted to lieutenant general in November 1878. The following year, Yamada was appointed a sangi (councillor), and served as head of the Minister of Industry (1879‚Äì1880), Home Minister (1881‚Äì1883) and Minister of Justice under the first It≈ç, Kuroda, first Yamagata and Matsukata cabinets (1883‚Äì1891). In addition, he helped develop the modern Japanese legal code/ page 175 During his visit to France as a member of the Iwakura Mission, he was convinced that the Napoleonic Code of \\"law takes precedence over the military\\", was necessary for Japan. He also helped establish both the Koten Kokyusho (present-day Kokugakuin University) and the Nihon Horitsu Gakko)(present-day Nihon University). Yamada was elevated to count (hakushaku) in the kazoku peerage on July 7, 1884, and served as a member of the House of Peers (Japan) from its establishment in 1890. On January 28, 1892, he was appointed to a seat in the Privy Council but died in November of the same year at the age of 49, while inspecting the Ikuno Silver Mine in Asago, Hy≈çgo.page 48 He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers. His grave is at the Buddhist temple of Gokoku-ji in Tokyo. He was posthumously promoted to the honorific title of Senior Second Court Rank.

The company was founded in 1991 and was headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. As of January 2017, the company had a market capitalization of $3.47 billion with an enterprise value of $5.9 billion. The company was formerly known as Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and changed its name to Alere Inc. in 2010. History The company was founded in 1991 by Ron Zwanziger under the Name SelfCare, which went public in 1996. The company changed its name from SelfCare to Inverness Medical Technology (IMT) in 2000. One year later, it sold its diabetes business to Johnson & Johnson, and split off a new company called Inverness Medical Innovations. That company subsequently expanded its business by acquiring many companies, including Unipath, Clondiag, Ionian Technologies, TwistDx, Wampole Laboratories, Ostex International, Binax, Biosite, HemoSense, Cholestech, Redwood Toxicology, Concateno, BBI Holdings, eScreen, Standard Diagnostics, and hhh Axis-Shield. In 2007, Alere entered into a joint venture, named Swiss Precision Diagnostics, with Procter & Gamble for the sales and marketing of its consumer diagnostics products. In 2009, Alere won two awards in the 16th Annual National Health Information program, which recognizes the U.S.‚Äôs best consumer health information programs and materials. In 2010, the company changed its name to Alere and began trading under the ticker ALR in NYSE. In 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Epocal, Inc. In July 2014 Ron Zwanziger resigned as CEO and COO Namal Nawana took over as interim CEO. In September 2014, Zwanziger offered to take the company private for $3.82 billion. In October 2014, the Board of Directors voted and instated Namal Nawana as the permanent CEO of Alere, Inc. In early 2015, Alere divested its Alere Health management activities to Optum. In February 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire Alere Inc for $5.8 billion. However, in April, Abbott requested of Alere that this deal be terminated, a proposal rejected by Alere's board of directors. On October 3, 2017, Abbott closed the Alere acquisition at the reduced price of $5.3 billion, making the surviving entity the market leader player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover. With the acquisition of Alere, the company also obtain the subsidiary Arriva Medical, which is the largest mail-order diabetic supplier. Business Alere operated three business units focused on cardiometabolic, infectious disease, and toxicology testing. The company was a pioneer in manufacturing rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and provided products to healthcare professionals and patients worldwide. In 2004, the company launched the world's first digital pregnancy test under Clearblue¬Æ Digital Pregnancy Test. In 2010, Alere launched the Alere CD4 analyser, the world‚Äôs first to provide absolute CD4 results at the Point of Care, making the management of HIV patients easier and more effective. October 2012, the company received a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its inadequate response to FDA‚Äôs earlier observations on its manufacturing process of the Triage products. In 2014 Alere received clearance from US FDA for the Alere i Influenza A&B;, a rapid molecular point-of-care test to detect and differentiate Influenza A&B; virus in less than 15 minutes. In Jan 2015, Alere received US CLIA waiver for the Alere i Influenza test. In April 2015, Alere received FDA clearance for its second test on the Alere i platform, the Alere i Strep A test for Group A Streptococcus, which provides results in 8 minutes or less. In March 2015 Alere received IVD CE mark for Alere q HIV analyser, a fully automated nucleic acid testing platform which brings the power of molecular testing to bench tops in any healthcare setting. In August 2016 Alere received FDA Clearance for Alere i RSV Rapid Molecular Test which detects RSV infections in 13 minutes or less. In 2016 the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into Alere's role in potential Medicaid and Medicare fraud.

The first blast came from a minibus and the second from within the market. Two people were reportedly arrested at the site of the explosions. Shortly after the attacks, hundreds of people swarmed onto the crime scene despite police efforts to stop them. Background Shortly before the blasts, 400 British holidaymakers had been evacuated from Mombasa, the country's second largest city, due to the British Foreign Office declaring an \\"unacceptably high\\" threat level. The day before the blasts, the United States had also issued a similar warning, which stated: \\"The U.S. government continues to receive information about potential terrorist threats aimed at U.S., Western, and Kenyan interests in Kenya, including the Nairobi area and the coastal cities of Mombasa and Diani.\\" It had also said that their embassy in Kenya was going to increase its security in the week preceding the bombings. Uhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya, dismissed these warnings, saying they \\"strengthen the will of terrorists\\" and that terrorism is a problem in many other countries as well. In the week prior to the blasts, Kenya's government required all bus passengers to be screened before boarding buses and required all buses have clear glass windows. Reactions Uhuru Kenyatta, the President of Kenya, reacted to the explosions by saying that \\"All of us around the world must be united to ensure that we are able to fight this particular terror.\\" Kenya's government, convinced that the perpetrators were Somalian terrorists, reacted to the attacks by rounding up thousands of immigrants, refugees and members of Kenya‚Äôs large Somali community. =Flight cancellations= The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all but essential travel to Mombasa Island off Kenya's coast. Thomson Airways and First Choice Airways cancelled all their flights to Mombasa until the end of October, citing the FCO's advice. =Economic impact= After the Gikomba explosions, which were the latest in a long line of attacks occurring in Kenya in recent months, the value of the Kenyan shilling decreased by 0.2% that day. =United States Embassy= The United States Department of State announced on the day of the bombings that it was planning on reducing the number of staff it would employ at its embassies in Kenya. Perpetrator While no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, Kenyatta stated that terrorists were responsible. Suspicions have, in particular, fallen on Somalia-based terrorist group al-Shabaab, since they were responsible for several previous terrorist attacks in Kenya due to Kenya sending troops to Somalia in 2011. The Gikomba attack occurred two miles from Al-Shabaab's so-called \\"Little Mogadishu\\" stronghold in Nairobi.

He is credited with inventing an early version of the zone defense used in modern basketball. During his coaching career, he amassed an overall record of 226 wins and 143 losses. His 1919‚Äì20 team finished the season with a 21‚Äì1 record and was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Jourdet's win total was the highest in Penn men's basketball history until Fran Dunphy surpassed him in 2001‚Äì02, and his seven conference titles are second to Dunphy's 10. As a student athlete at the University of Pennsylvania, Jourdet played on the football and basketball teams. He lettered in basketball from 1910‚Äì11 to 1912‚Äì13, while in football he lettered from 1910 to 1912. As a senior during the 1912 season, Jourdet was named a football All-American. The reason for his extended absence as Penn basketball's head coach between 1920 and 1930 was summed up by The Pennsylvania Gazette in its December 3, 1920 issue, which said Jourdet \\"on account of a business transfer to another part of the country, has been obliged to give up coaching.\\" He transferred to Kentucky and became engrained in both high school and college basketball there. Jourdet even officiated some of the University of Kentucky men's basketball games. Upon returning to the Philadelphia area, Jourdet coached the Quakers for 13 more seasons and won three more Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League championships (the conference precursor to the modern Ivy League). From 1949 to 1959, Jourdet worked in a state liquor store in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In mid-August 1959, he was admitted to the Samuel G. Dixon Tuberculosis Hospital. On August 31, he jumped out of the third-story window of the hospital, suffering a broken neck. Jourdet was 70 years old at the time of his suicide.

It was invented by Armel Le Bail around 1967.  Background  The Le Bail method extracts intensities (Ihkl) from powder diffraction data. This is done in order to find intensities that are suitable to determine the atomic structure of a crystalline material and to refine the unit cell and has the added advantage of checking phase-purity. Generally, the intensities of powder diffraction data are complicated by overlapping diffraction peaks with similar _d_ -spacings. For the Le Bail method, the unit cell and the approximate space group of the sample must be predetermined because they are included as a part of the fitting technique. The algorithm involves refining the unit cell, the profile parameters, and the peak intensities to match the measured powder diffraction pattern. It is not necessary to know the structural factor and associated structural parameters, since they are not considered in this type of analysis. Le Bail can be used to find phase transitions in high pressure and temperature experiments. It generally provides a quick method to refine the unit cell, which allows better experimental planning. Le Bail analysis provides a more reliable estimate for the intensities of allowed reflections for different crystal symmetries. Crystallographic structural determination can be accomplished in multiple ways. Le Bail technique is relevant for diffraction studies that involve using a radiation source, which may be neutron or synchrotron, to collect a high resolution, high quality powder diffraction profile. Initially, peak positions are found in the data. Next, the pattern is indexed in order to determine the unit cell or lattice parameters. Then, space group determination follows based on symmetry and the presence or absence of certain reflections. Then, either Le Bail or Pawley technique may be used to extract intensities and refine the unit cell.  Refinement  Le Bail analysis fits parameters using a steepest descent minimization process. Specifically, the method is least squares analysis, which is an iterative process that is discussed later in this article. The parameters being fitted include the unit-cell parameters, the instrumental zero error, peak width parameters, and peak shape parameters. First, the Le Bail method defines an arbitrary starting value for the intensities (Iobs). This value is ordinarily set to one, but other values may be used. While peak positions are constrained by the unit cell parameters, intensities are unconstrained. The equation to calculate intensities is: I_{obs}(1) = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum y_i(obs) y_i(1)}{y_i(calc)} In the equation, Iobs is the intensity observed at a particular step and yi(obs) is the observed profile point. yi(calc) is the A single intensity value may contain more than one peak. Other peaks may be calculated similarly. The final intensity for a peak is calculated as y(calc) = yi(1) + yi(2). The summation is carried out over all contributing profile points for a particular 2-theta bin. The summation process is known as profile intensity partitioning, and it works over any number of peaks. Le Bail technique works especially well with overlapping intensities since in this method the intensity is allotted based on the multiplicity of the intensities that contribute to a particular peak. The somewhat arbitrary choice of starting values produces a bias in the calculated values. The refinement process continues by setting the new calculated structure factor to the observed structure factor value. The process is then repeated with the new structure factor estimate. At this point, the unit cell, background, peak widths, peak shape, and resolution function are refined, and the parameters are improved. The structure factor is then reset to the new structure factor value, and the process begins again. Structural refinement can continue with whole profile fitting techniques or further treatment of peak overlap. Probabilistic approaches may also be used to treat peak overlap.  Advantages  Some authors suggest the Le Bail technique exploits prior information more efficiently than Pawley method. This was an important consideration at the time of development when computing power was limited. Le Bail is also easily integrated into Rietveld analysis software, and is a part of a number of programs. Both methods improve subsequent structural refinements  Available software  Le Bail analysis is commonly a part of Rietveld analysis software, such as GSAS/EXPGUI. It is also used in ARITVE, BGMN, EXPO, EXTRACT, FullProf, GENEFP, Jana2006, Overlap, Powder Cell, Rietan, and TOPAS.

Joseph Benda was born in Ben√°tky nad Jizerou, the son of a weaver Jan Ji≈ô√≠ Benda and his wife Dorota Brixi, daughter of the village cantor from Slasko and member of the large Czech musical family. Five of Joseph's siblings achieved success as musicians; older brothers Franti≈°ek, Jan Ji≈ô√≠ and Ji≈ô√≠ Anton√≠n as violinist composers, and younger sister Anna Franziska as an operatic soprano. In 1742, during the First Silesian War, Joseph was presented before Frederick II of Prussia, who was stationed at his winter quarters at Schloss Lissa. Upon hearing the 18-year-old Joseph, the King immediately sent him to Potsdam where he was to finalise his training as a violinist with his brother Franti≈°ek, who was already a violinist in Frederick's Hofkapelle along with Jan Ji≈ô√≠. Benda's remaining family in Ben√°tky nad Jizerou were also invited by Frederick to take up residence in Potsdam. Joseph's parents, along with their children Jan Ji≈ô√≠, Anna Franziska and Viktor settled in the Bohemian quarter of Potsdam called Nowawes (now Babelsberg) where his father and brother Viktor opened a weaving mill. Later that year, Joseph had already achieved a position in Frederick's Hofkapelle. The English music journalist Charles Burney recorded two meetings with Joseph Benda in 1775. On the first occasion, on 29 September, Joseph performed a \\"pleasing solo, composed by his brother, which he executed with great neatness and delicacy\\". With the ailing health of his older brother Franti≈°ek, Joseph became his amanuensis and assistant concert master. He succeeded his brother as concert master after his death in 1786. C√∂lln: Br√ºderstra√üe and Petrikirche in the 19th century, by Eduard Gaertner Joseph was active into old age, participating in the so-called Liebhaberkonzerte founded by his son. He also organised a performance on 22 December 1793 as part of the extensive celebrations upon the arrival of Crown Princess Luise in the Corsicaischen Saale, opposite Monbijou Palace. He remained concertmaster following the accession of King Frederick William II of Prussia in 1786 but was placed into retirement by the following king, Frederick William III of Prussia in 1798 with a pension of 800 Thaler. He lived with his family at Br√ºderstra√üe 19 (cnr Breiterstra√üe) and his death was recorded in the church records of the nearby Petrikirche. Upon his death in 1804, he was succeeded by his nephew (the son of Franz), Karl Hermann Heinrich. Joseph's two sons Ernst Friedrich Benda (1749‚Äì1785), Carl Friedrich Franz Benda (1754‚Äì1816) were both violinists in the Hofkapelle. Works There are only two surviving works by Joseph Benda.

Early life Sufott was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford, where he pursued Oriental Studies. Sufott and his parents were firm believers in Zionism. He was wounded during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War shortly after the creation of Israel. Sufott enrolled in the Chinese studies program at Yale University, where he learned Chinese more than forty years before becoming Ambassador to China. He was posted in Washington D.C. during the 1960s, where he enrolled in African studies courses at Howard University and received a doctorate in political science from Georgetown University. Career Zev Sufott joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1950, beginning a diplomatic career that lasted more than forty years. He was posted to the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C., where he served as First Secretary and Counselor, and London as Consul General. He then served as the Israel Ambassador to the Netherlands, and afterwards as Deputy Director for Europe at the Foreign Ministry. In 1990, Sufott was approached by the then Director General of the Foreign Ministry, Reuven Merhav, who informed him that Israel intended to open a liaison office of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Beijing, the capital of China. It was the first step to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the People's Republic of China. Merhav appointed Sufott as Special Advisor at the liaison office in 1991. In 1992, the two countries established full diplomatic relations and Sufott was appointed as Israel's first Ambassador to China. In 1997, Sufott published a book, A China Diary: Towards the Establishment of China-Israel Diplomatic Relations, detailing the history of China‚ÄìIsrael relations. He further reflected on fledgling relations between the nations in a 2000 article for Israel Affairs, writing, \\"In the four decades before diplomatic relations, and even after their establishment in 1992, China has never been a priority on Israel's foreign policy agenda‚Ä¶ On the contrary, Israel's foreign policy vis-√†-vis China has been influenced, and at times dictated, by policy priorities and interests in other regions.\\" Death Zev Sufott died from cancer in Tel Aviv on 18 April 2014, at the age of 86.

The procedure was first described by French surgeon Dr. Michel Latarjet in 1954. Mechanism The mechanism of action has been described as a triple blocking effect: # conjoint tendon acting as a sling on the subscapularis and capsule with the arm abducted and externally rotated; # increasing or restoring the glenoid bone; and # repair of the capsule to the stump of coracoacromial ligament. Procedure The Latarjet procedure involves the removal and transfer of a section of the coracoid process and its attached muscles to the front of the glenoid. This placement of the coracoid acts as a bone block which, combined with the transferred muscles acting as a strut, prevents further dislocation of the joint.http://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/article.asp?section=914 In layman's terms, this procedure involves removing a piece of bone from another part of the shoulder, and attaching it to the front of your shoulder socket. The bone will then act as a barrier which will physically block the shoulder from slipping out of the socket, while the muscles which are transferred with the bone will give additional stability to the joint. Effectiveness While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. The failure rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair has been shown to dramatically increase from 4% to 67% in patients with significant bone loss. The same authors subsequently reported much improved results when the Latarjet operation was used in patients with bone loss. A number of technical variations have been proposed including both open and arthroscopic variations. Complication rates are between 15 - 30%, with long term issues such as graft osteolysis continuing to be an issue with the procedure. With appropriate patient selection, the Latarjet procedure can be expected to prevent recurrent anterior instability in approximately 94-99% of cases. Full recovery can take 6 months, however the majority of activities can be resumed after 3. The main long term side effect is reduced external rotation range in the shoulder. The Latarjet operation has also been demonstrated to be successful in contact athletes and rugby players. In summary, the Latarjet operation may ideally be suited as the shoulder reconstruction procedure of choice for contact athletes, patients with increased shoulder laxity, failed previous shoulder reconstructions or if there is significant bone damage.

Built about 1802 by an early surveyor of the region, it is a well-preserved example of high-quality second-generation frontier architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Bradbury Jewell House stands near the end of Ferncroft Road in the remote northeastern corner of Sandwich; this area is only accessible via Tamworth, and is bordered on the north by the White Mountain National Forest. The house stands in a clearing on the north side of the road, opposite Squirrel Bridge Road, a private lane. The house is fairly small (30' by 40'), five bays wide, 1-1/2 stories in height, with a central chimney. There is a small gable-roofed ell attached to the east side of the house. Its central entry is flanked by sidelight windows; the house otherwise has vernacular styling, but is remarkably little changed since its construction. The property includes a barn built in 1805, and a garden shed built c. 1975. The barn Bradbury Jewell was a surveyor hired by a Sandwich landowner in 1768 to survey the Ferncroft area. In 1780 he settled in what is now Tamworth, where he built the first frame house, but moved to the New Hampshire coast a few years later. He returned to Sandwich in 1802, and had by the following year built this house. Its relatively modest styling is reflective of the frontier nature of the property, but also shows evidence in its interior features of more sophisticated architectural knowledge Jewell would have acquired during his years on the coast. Jewell is known to have business dealings with John Langdon, whose 1786 house is one of the most sophisticated houses of the period in Portsmouth.

The eggs are boiled slowly in water mixed with salt, soy sauce, shallot skins, teak leaf and other spices. Due to its origins, it bears striking similarities with Chinese tea eggs. However, instead of black tea, this version uses leftover shallot skins, teak leaves or guava leaves as dark brownish coloring agents.  Terminology  The term pindang refer to the cooking process of boiling the ingredients in salt together with certain spices that contains tannin, usually soy sauce, shallot skin, guava leaves, teak leaves, tea or other spices common in Southeast Asia. This gives the food a dark brown color and lasts longer compared to plainly boiled eggs, thus pindang is an Indonesian traditional method to preserve food, usually employed for fish and eggs. The technique is native to Java and Sumatra. Other preserving method includes asin or cured and dried in salt, and dendeng which is cured and dried in sugar, acar (pickling), and also asap (smoked).  Variations  = Indonesia = Telur pindang in lontong cap go meh Today, the telur pindang is widely spread throughout Indonesian archipelago, however it is found more prevalent in Javanese cuisine of Central and East Java, and also South Sumatra. Despite sharing similarities with Chinese tea eggs that employs tea leaves, this Indonesian version favours the use of teak leaves, guava leaves or spared shallots skin instead. The use of teak leaf as coloring agent might suggest its Javanese origin, since Java is famous for its teak wood for centuries. The teak leaf is also used to give reddish color in Yogyakarta's gudeg, or even as dyeing material in traditional Javanese batik-making. Indonesian cuisine favour the use of shallots than common onion, and subsequently the peeled shallot skins are usually collected and spared as key ingredient to make pindang eggs later. The telur pindang is often served as part of tumpeng, nasi kuning or nasi campur. In Yogyakarta, telur pindang often served with gudeg or just steamed rice. It is also part of Chinese Indonesian lontong cap go meh. Those dishes, the tumpeng, nasi kuning, and lontong cap go meh, are important ceremonial dishes for each respective cultures, since eggs are traditionally symbolize fertility, regeneration and luck. = Malaysia = Telur pindang prepared for a wedding Telur pindang in Malaysia is most popular in Johor, the southern-most state in Peninsular Malaysia. The true origins of the dish is unclear, however the cuisine most likely originated from Chinese merchants and settlers who came to the country in the 19th century through the once independent sultanate, having significant similarities to tea eggs. Another possible theory suggests that it was probably brought by Javanese immigrants instead, that settled in Johor about a century ago. The recipe might have caught on due to its preserved nature. With Johor being a hub of international trade, it would be useful to the many merchants at sea who can benefit from such an easily stored food item that lasted for weeks. The common ingredients of telur pindang are shallot skins, tamarind, fennel, coriander, soysauce, and various leaves such as guava leaves or mangosteen leaves, although different recipes have different mixes of these ingredients or even additional ingredients, giving it a unique flavor. The notable difference between Malaysian and Indonesian telur pindang is the use of teak leaves, which are replaced with other leaves in most traditional Malaysian telur pindang recipes. Telur pindang has a deep cultural heritage within Johorean, and in turn Malaysian, society. However, the daily use of telur pindang is now far more uncommon today due to its complicated and time- consuming method of cooking, restricted to mostly festivities or commercial sale. In turn, this creates an appreciation for the cuisine, regarded as an important part of Malay tradition.

Plot Anne Shirley takes up a teaching position in a town where she finds herself unaccountably in conflict with the founding family and its sour matriarch. The movie opens with Gilbert and Anne on a train as she travels to Pringleton. They mention that she has taken the job as vice principal and in a year she will come back and marry Gilbert. When she arrives at Pringleton, she meets Mrs. Stephen Pringle who tells her she can't board with her as expected. Leaving Anne to fend for herself at the train station, Anne takes a carriage to Windy Poplars, which reminds her of Green Gables. Her hosts at Windy Poplars tell Anne that Hester Pringle, who owns the house across the way, is a bitter old woman- and is also the one who is blackballing her in town. Jabez, a workman at the school, gives her a heads up that Hester is adamant that she will make Anne give up her job. The principal, Mr. Gibson overloads Anne with work in addition to teaching and berates her when Jen Pringle's father complain about her.

Anne has a conversation with Betty, a little orphan girl, longing for her parents to come home and take her from her aunt Ernestine Pringle. She makes the comment that she can't wait until tomorrow so hopeful her parents come but her aunt tells her tomorrow never arrives. This saddens Anne and she writes home, missing Gilbert. She talks with Catherine Pringle who says Anne hates everyone Pringle. Back at Windy Poplars, Matey gives Anne a diary that gives her ammunition to start a conversation with Hester Pringle. Anne and Hester talk about them. Hester is her haughty self and Anne says she pities the family insomuch that their ancestor was a nasty piece of work and they are all bitter. Hester is astounded when Anne leaves the diaries with her, remarking they were the one thing that would have let her win. Anne rushes out and meets Tony Pringle, who is drunk, near the cemetery. He confides he is miserable and knows she is too. He said that Catherine must hate her because the dramatic society was taken from her upon Anne's arrival. They part ways, with him calling her Annie and asking her why she doesn't give up and realizing she isn't a quitter. Anne approaches Catherine about a play she wrote based on Cinderella and promised her full control. Catherine declines at first and then says she would think about it. Anne primes Jen to play the lead. Preparations ensue. Gilbert shows up with presents and Anne is happy. Anne goes to get Betty to take her to the play and she finds the girl sick and her family unwilling to help her. Anne puts her to bed and promises to visit the next day. Tony Pringle shows up looking for Anne. Catherine tells him to leave. Tony says there won't be a play and says that Jen is sick. Anne shows up and they try to shield her from the truth. Catherine goes to Hester's home. The doctor is treating Hester and Catherine sneaks upstairs with the blessing of the doctor and sneaks Jen out of the house. The show goes on with Jabez reading lines through the air vents. The play is a great success. Anne rushes over to see Betty during the show with Gilbert. Betty is very sick so Anne acts out the play for her though crying most of the time. Meanwhile, Hester climbs the stairs and finds Catherine in Jen's place. She locks Catherine in the room. As Hester leaves, she has an attack and falls down the stairs. Gilbert and Anne discuss Betty, who seems to have improved. They meet Tony on the road and they tell her that Catherine never made it back. In the distance, they see Hester's home, Maplehurst, burning. Tony said Jen told him Catherine was locked in her room. They hurry to the house. The folks at Windy Poplars see Maplehurt burning and hurry over. Catherine is pulled from the building. Jen is safe. Everyone watches in silence as the building burns with Hester's body inside. In the spring, a picnic brings the town together. Anne's wedding is one day away. Anne and Gilbert talk with Betty. Gilbert asks her what yesterday was and what today is. She answers, \\"Tomorrow.\\" and he tells her that her parents have come which makes them all happy.

It performs better than the Vatti clipping algorithm, but cannot handle degeneracies. It can process both self-intersecting and non-convex polygons. It can be trivially generalized to compute other Boolean operations on polygons, such as union and difference. The algorithm is based on the definition of the \\"inside\\" of a polygon based on the winding number. It considers regions with odd winding number to be inside the polygon; this is known as the even‚Äìodd rule. It takes two lists of polygons as input. In its original form, the algorithm is divided into three phases: * In the first phase, pairwise intersections between edges of the polygons are computed. Additional vertices are inserted into both polygons at the points of intersection; an intersection vertex holds a pointer to its counterpart in the other polygon. * In the second phase, each intersection is marked as either an entry intersection or an exit intersection. This is accomplished by evaluating the even‚Äìodd rule at the first vertex, which allows you to know whether the first vertex is inside or outside the other polygon. Then, following the polygon's borders, the intersections are marked with alternating flags (the next intersection after an entry intersection must be an exit intersection). * In the third phase, the result is generated. The algorithm starts at an unprocessed intersection and picks the direction of traversal based on the entry/exit flag: for an entry intersection it traverses forward, and for an exit intersection it traverses in reverse. Vertices are added to the result until the next intersection is found; the algorithm then switches to the corresponding intersection vertex in the other polygon and picks the traversal direction again using the same rule. If the next intersection has already been processed, the algorithm finishes the current component of the output and starts again from an unprocessed intersection. The output is complete when there are no more unprocessed intersections. The algorithm is not restricted to polygons and can handle arbitrary parametric curves as segments, as long as there is a suitable pairwise intersection procedure. A major shortcoming of the original Greiner‚ÄìHormann algorithm is the fact that it cannot handle degeneracies, such as common edges or intersections exactly at a vertex. The original paper suggests perturbing the vertices to remove them.

History Franciscan missionaries first arrived to establish a parish in Taytay in 1579 and built a chapel made of light materials near the shores of Laguna de Bay named \\"Visita de Sta. Ana de Sapa,\\" dedicated to its patron saint, John the Baptist. Jesuit missionaries took over the administration of the parish in 1591, with Rev Pedro Chirino becoming parish priest. Under Chirino, the parish was relocated from the flood-prone shores of Laguna de Bay to a higher location in a hill which was called San Juan del Monte where the parish has remained to this day. It was during his stint as parish priest that Rev Chirino began to document the Tagalog language as well as the way of life of Filipinos from his interactions with the inhabitants, forming the basis for his book \\"Relaci√≥n de las Islas Filipinas\\". A new church made of stone was built in 1599. Completed in 1601, it was considered to be the first church built by the Jesuits out of stone outside Manila. A larger church was constructed in 1630 by Fr Juan de Salazar. In 1632 typhoon blew away the roofing of the new church, which was soon replaced with the help of the townspeople. The church sustained significant damage in 1639 when the Chinese set fire to the church in their revolt against Spanish authorities. =Blessed Diego de San Vitores and St. Pedro Calungsod= Diego Luis de San Vitores was a Jesuit missionary who was assigned to Taytay from 1662 to 1668. In 1666, the Jesuits assigned a young boy named Pedro Calungsod as an altar boy in the church. Calungsod would eventually become San Vitores' assistant throughout the latter's assignment in Taytay. San Vitores was eventually assigned to be a missionary in the Marianas Islands in 1668 and Calungsod went with him as his assistant. It was in the Marianas where they would meet their martyrdom in 1672. San Vitores was among the martyred missionaries in the Mariana beatified by the Catholic Church in 1985. Calungsod was beatified in 2000 and canonized in 2012. =Later works and expansion= thumb Additional works were made to the church in 1768 and 1864. Both the Church and the convent were reduced to ruins during the Philippine-American War. The church remained in such state until it was reconstructed after the War. The present church is built from concrete and no trace of the old Jesuit Church.

City of Portland was a lawsuit filed by the United States Department of Justice against the City of Portland, Oregon on December 17, 2012, alleging a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force by the Portland Police Bureau against individuals with actual or perceived mental illness. The lawsuit was filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, against the City of Portland.  Background  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon and the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, based their findings on more than a year of investigation, and sought injunctive and declaratory relief. Specifically, the DOJ claimed: (1) Portland police encounters with such individuals too frequently resulted in a higher level force than necessary; (2) Portland police employed Tasers more times than necessary on such individuals, or in circumstances where such force was not justified; and (3) Portland police used a higher degree of force than justified for low level offenses. U.S. v. City of Portland is notable because of its finding persons with mental illness are primary recipients of police use-of-force. In a widely publicized press conference June 8, 2011, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas E. Perez announced the launch of an investigation to determine whether the Portland Police Bureau engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive or unnecessary use-of-force in their interactions with persons in a protected class, people with actual or perceived mental health disabilities, and whether such conduct deprived individuals of their rights secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The 18-month-long investigation was prompted by the high number of Portland police officer-involved deaths that involved individuals with mental illness, including Kendra James, James Jahar Perez, James Chasse, Raymond Gwerder, Keaton Otis, Jack Dale Collins, Aaron Campbell, Darryel Ferguson, Thomas Higginbotham, and Brad Morgan. On September 13, 2012, DOJ issued a Findings Letter with the results of the investigation, stating investigators found reasonable cause to believe Portland police had engaged in unconstitutional conduct. The letter identified serious deficiencies in policy, training, and officer accountability measures that substantially contributed to the unconstitutional conduct by police. That same day, DOJ and the City of Portland released a joint statement declaring the parties' mutual intent to reach a negotiated settlement agreement to resolve these issues. On October 13, 2012, in a joint press conference, the DOJ and the City of Portland announced a settlement had been reached. On November 15, 2012, Portland City Council unanimously approved the settlement agreement. On November 27, 2012 Portland City Council approved a new tax on service providers of telephone land-lines to pay for police reforms. On December 17, 2012 ‚Äî the same date the complaint was filed ‚Äîthe parties filed a joint motion to enter a settlement agreement and conditionally dismiss the action, subject to the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The proposed settlement agreement includes detailed provisions addressing Portland Police Bureau policies and practices regarding: (1) use of force; (2) dealing with persons perceived as or actually suffering from mental illness or mental health crises; (3) dealing with persons suffering from addictions and mental health challenges; (4) crisis intervention; (5) identifying at-risk employees; (6) officer accountability; (7) training; (8) supervision; (9) misconduct complaint intake, investigation, and adjudication; (10) transparency and oversight; and (11) community engagement. The proposed settlement agreement also includes provisions regarding the implementation and enforcement of its terms. On December 18, 2012, the Portland Police Association, the labor union representing officers of the Portland Police Bureau, filed a motion to intervene. On January 8, 2013, the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform also moved to intervene. Both interveners asked to participate in any negotiations of the proposed settlement agreement. On February 19, 2013, the Judge Michael H. Simon fully granted the Portland Police Association's motion, and granted the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform \\"enhanced amicus status for remedy purposes.\\" Ultimately, both parties were allowed to participate in the settlement negotiations.

One item is the defendant (The City of Portland) must hire a compliance officer-community liaison (COCL) and form a Community Oversight Advisory Board (COAB). After soliciting only three eligible applicants for the $315,000 per year position, on November 8, 2014 Portland City Council selected a team of academics led by Dennis Rosenbaum of the University of Illinois at Chicago. During community meetings Rosenbaum's team received the lowest rating, but boosted their viability to Mayor Charlie Hales by agreeing to hire former Oregon state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul De Muniz. De Muniz resigned April 8 citing poor health. All parties reached a tentative agreement regarding the terms of the proposed settlement in December 2013. Subsequently, the court held a fairness hearing for the general public for February 18‚Äì19, 2014. Parties filed their post-hearing memoranda on July 2. Judge Michael Simon approved the agreement August 29, stating the city must give him annual updates on reforms for up to five years. City Council, led by Mayor Charlie Hales and Commissioner Amanda Fritz, with support from the police union, appealed Simon's decision on October 22, 2014. After months of talks between city and federal officials, they reached an agreement that the sessions won't be called \\"evidentiary hearings\\" but instead \\"status conferences,\\" and the appeal was withdrawn in August 2015. In September 2015 the DOJ released its first Compliance Status Assessment Report for the Settlement Agreement in United States v. City of Portland. The report found the bureau was in \\"partial compliance\\" but also listed significant outstanding problems which were not addressed, including failure to track data on use of force, failure to write reports on shootings, and investigating officers sharing information - such as video recordings of shootings - with officers under investigation. The DOJ's October 2016 Report cited progress on most items of the Agreement but excoriated Portland Mayor Charlie Hales and Police Chief Larry O'Dea for not informing investigators that O'Dea shot a friend while drinking alcohol and playing with firearms. Community oversight of the Agreement was stymied by hostility and poor facilitation by the Rosenbaum team causing the DOJ to allow city attorney Tracy Reeve to adjourn COAB meetings for 60 days on August 19. Mayor Ted Wheeler disbanded the COAB on February 1, 2017 and after months of meetings with the DOJ, proffered an amended plan, stripped of independent community assessment of the implementation of the settlement agreement. In August 2017 Portland City Council agreed to amend the Settlement Agreement to create a new community oversight group, the Portland Committee on Community- Engaged Policing, bypass the Police Review Board when an officer accepts discipline for less-serious offenses, remove a 180-day deadline for an appeal ruling on alleged police misconduct before the Citizen Review Committee, ensure officers who use deadly force are interviewed within 48 hours, change to how use of force data is measured and collected, and allow the COCL to report on one or two comprehensive elements of the settlement instead of addressing every single element. No changes directly benefited people with mental illness harmed by police. In December 2017, Portland dropped a legal challenge to court-ordered hearings. On April 19, 2018 Judge Simon gave a six- month conditional agreement to the amendments. The City failed to start a new community oversight group before the October 4 status conference and Simon extended the 'conditional' approval until June 2019. In a June 2019 status conference the city failed to show the oversight group had yet accomplished anything beyond being formed. In a February 2020 status conference, again the city failed to show the amendments to the agreement were fair, reasonable, and adequate. Amicus testified about the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing, highlighting it's attrition of members, lack of broad community outreach and respect for recommendations offered by members with mental illness, and Judge Simon gave the city another year to resolve issues.

Among the victims were several Laotian politicians travelling to attend a ceremony celebrating the 55th anniversary of the second division of the Lao People's Army.  Accident  Between 6:15 and 07:00 (IC T), local time on 17 May 2014, or from the destination in Xiang Khouang, the Xieng Khouang Airport, the aircraft crashed in Nadee, Xiang Khouang, from where it left in Vientiane at the Vientiane-Wattay Airport. The aircraft was too low on final approach, and its landing gear clipped some trees just short of the runway, resulting in the crash, which was attributed to a technical error.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a Ukrainian-built Antonov An-74TK-300 twinjet, registered as RDPL-34020.  Passengers  Initial reports suggested that there were fourteen passengers, but later reports gave the figure as twenty on board at the time of the accident, only three were reported to have survived, according to official sources. Once the situation became clearer, the passenger count was given as seventeen and the death toll was given as sixteen, with one survivor after the other two original survivors died from their wounds.

The defence ministry permanent secretary in Thailand said that the Defence Minister of Laos and four others had been killed, and a witness also said that the Defence Minister had died, and gave the figure of fourteen deaths. Reactions The death of \\"arguably the two most powerful people in the security apparatus\\" was reported to be a significant blow to the ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party. After the crash, the ceremony was cancelled, and a three-day period of national mourning was announced.

The shrine was built in 1602‚Äì1604 by the Dominicans on land that was donated to the order. Both the church and convento were burnt and destroyed during the Chinese insurrection of 1639, and later rebuilt in 1641. It was again destroyed in July 1763 as Britain briefly occupied Manila during the Seven Years' War. The current church and convento were built in 1774, and used as a shelter by Katipuneros during the 1898 Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire. It has since been renovated many times until the 1990s. The shrine is the seat of the Cofradia del Sant√≠simo Cristo de San Juan del Monte (\\"Confraternity of the Holy Christ of Saint John of the Mountain\\"), which received papal approval on March 4, 1648. History =Arrival of the Dominicans= The Dominicans arrived in the Spanish East Indies in 1587 and had founded the Santo Domingo Convent in Spanish Manila (now known as Intramuros). Fifteen years after their arrival, the Dominicans went to the hill country east of Manila in what is now San Juan, and found clusters of small nipa huts. The area was the property of a certain Spaniard named Captain Julian de Cuenca, who had been granted an encomienda along the banks of the San Juan River where cattle were bred and raised. The heavy work and hot climate were taking their toll on some of the ageing friars, who had been in the colony for several years already. While the order's vow of poverty stood in contrast with the concept of a convalescent and retirement home for Dominicans working in Manila and in the provinces, it was decided that it would be in order under three conditions: # The land would have to be donated; # It should be in a healthy place, with a climate cooler than Manila's; and # Nearness to and accessibility from Manila It so happened that Captain Cuenca had heard about the Dominicans' plan; he lived in Manila and before that Mexico, where he had befriended some of the Order's members. He and his wife thought it the right time to show their family's gratitude to the Dominicans, and so they offered a nearly three-hectare plot of wooded land in his hacienda along the San Juan River. The property was at a higher elevation than Manila and close to the city (\\"one legua\\", or five kilometres to the east). It was also easily accessible by banca (outrigger canoe): up the River Pasig, then into the San Juan River and finally landing at the embarcadero Captain Cuenca had built at the confluence of the San Juan and Maytunas Creek. The Order gratefully accepted the offer, and the work began, with a small chapel to San Juan Bautista del Monte built after several months. At first it was a \\"filial house\\" of the friary in Manila, from where it was administered, until it became a religious house in its own right in 1616. Independent of Santo Domingo Convent, it was then called the House of San Juan Bautista del Monte. Fathers Huete, Oriol, and Samaniego were assigned to the new house in 1617. =Arrival of the Santo Cristo= The Santo Cristo image, its feet encased in glass, in the Calvario above the main altar. In 1641, Fr Sebasti√°n de Oquendo, OP, the Prior of Santo Domingo monastery in Intramuros, decided to send to San Juan the image of the Santo Cristo that was then venerated in Binondo Church (another Dominican possession). The venerable image was brought to the reconstructed church in San Juan and placed on the main altar, displacing the image of John the Baptist, since the image, which was \\"nine palmos in height\\" (approx. 1.80 metres) would not fit. From then on, devotion to the Santo Cristo spread to nearby communities. The shrine itself gained popularity when the image began to perform miracles, thus earning the shrine the name Santuario del Santo Cristo. News of the image's miracles spread to Manila and the surrounding areas, particularly the neighbouring Franciscan parish and town of Santa Ana, to which the present-day San Juan Mandaluyong once belonged to. The Confraternity of the Santo Cristo was established and approved by Pope Innocent X in 1648, roughly 45 years after the arrival of the Dominicans in San Juan. Prominent citizens of Manila and other towns became members of the Confraternity and made yearly pilgrimages to the shrine. Others decided to settle in the vicinity of the shrine, forming the nucleus of the present city of San Juan. = Feast Day = The local feast day of the Santo Cristo is observed every May 3, the former date of Roodmas. On this day, the image is removed from the Calvario and mounted on a carroza (carriage) for the procession and then returned to its shrine. Since 2016, a replica has been used for the public processions at the request of Fr. Jesus Prol, after cracks were seen in the original image. =The Convento and Santuario= The first convento and the church on the site must have been simple and unpretentious, in keeping with the rustic surroundings, and yet well suited as a places for convalescing and aged Dominicans from Manila. In 1639, the Chinese insurrection took place in Manila, with the very first church and convento destroyed in the ensuing chaos. When the rebels were defeated by the Spanish- Filipino troops, the former retreated to Marikina and the mountains beyond, passing by San Juan. For some time the rebels occupied the convento and the church and, when they decided to flee to the mountains, torched the church complex and the few houses in the vicinity. The buildings went up in flames, the column of smoke visible from a distance for several days. In 1641, Oquendo decided to rebuild the church and convento of San Juan using solid materials such as adobe, which was found in the area. The church became a Santuario (shrine) with the transfer of the Santo Cristo, and it increased in popularity when a spring of good drinking water was discovered within the shrine grounds. An aqueduct was built to bring the spring water from the shrine to the San Juan River, from where it was collected in big tinajas (large, porous jars that cooled water) and brought by banca (outrigger canoe) to Manila. The buildings of the shrine complex were improved with the passage of time. A certain Fr Peguero, who was the vicar of San Juan, described the shrine as \\"the biggest in the Islands and the refuge and consolation of all.\\" He described the shrine further as \\"built on a mountain of solid rock and, thanks to that, it had not been damaged by earthquakes. It has been repaired well recently. It is all ‚Äî the convent and the church ‚Äî of stone quarry, and both are strong, firm, beautiful and devout. All in all they are the most perfect structures (of their kind) that exist in the Philippines.\\" He further notes: \\"It is all painted al oleo en jaspe (imitation marble) from the floor to the ceiling and adorned with many Latin and Spanish verses and texts from the Holy Scriptures. There are three altars with artistic and proportionate retablos. It has five rich ternos ‚Äî some better than others ‚Äî and six ordinary ones. It has not much silver, but what it has is enough for the service of the altar.\\" As British troops sacked Manila in 1763, the shrine was destroyed as the city's churches and other public buildings were looted and vandalised. The shrine and the convento, along with many houses in San Juan del Monte, did not fare any better, as these were ransacked then set alight by British soldiers. After the end of the Seven Years' War and the islands' return to Spanish control, reconstruction began. It is unknown whether the present image is the same one brought from Binondo, or a replica. =Founding of the parish= Negotiations on elevating the shrine's status to that of a parish began in 1941 between Michael J. O'Doherty, the 27th Archbishop of Manila, and the Dominicans. The creation of the Santuario del Santo Cristo Parish and its bounds were agreed upon at a meeting in the Archbishop's Palace on November 4, 1941. Present there was the parish priests of Pinaglabanan and Mandaluyong, from which the territory of the new parish would be excised. Before the resolution could be put into effect, however, the Second World War broke out in the Pacific in December 1941. The following year, Imperial Japan occupied the islands and established the Second Republic. The parish was canonically erected on May 3, 1942, fifty years after the establishment of Saint John the Baptist Parish at Pinaglabanan. Fr Peregrine de la Fuente OP, formerly parish priest for 18 years in Dominican ministries of Louisiana in the United States and later the first Apostolic Prelate of Batanes and the Babuyanes, was appointed first parish priest. The official inauguration of the parish and the installation of its parish priest was led by Archbishop O'Doherty, in a ceremony coinciding with the Feast of the Holy Cross, the shrine's titular. In the decree for erection, signed on March 28, 1942, the parish bounds were set as: to the north, R. Pascual Street and its continuation eastwards to the Ermita√±o Creek (also known as Salap√°n Creek); to the west, San Juan River; to the southwest, Shaw Boulevard; and to the east, Ermita√±o Creek. Archbishop O'Doherty said that he erected the new parish due to \\"the insistence of the people of San Juan, for several years already that the Santuario be made a Parish, the great increase in population and the request of the Parish Priest of Pinaglabanan Church himself, Father Artemio Casas\\". Santuario 75th Anniversary logo (2017-2018) = 75th (diamond) anniversary as a parish = The shrine celebrated its diamond jubilee as a parish in 2017. The yearlong celebration began on Saturday, March 4, 2017 with recitation of the rosary and a concelebrated Mass. The date was chosen as it was the anniversary of the May 3, 1942 reception of the decree of erection signed by Archbishop O'Doherty. Though signed earlier, its delivery was hampered by the Second World War and other transportation issues. On the right side facing the church are the century-old acacia trees recently declared as heritage trees by DENR NCR. =Timeline of the present Santuario= * 16 February 1963 ‚Äì The cornerstone of the new Santuario was blessed by Rufino Cardinal Santos, the 29th Archbishop of Manila. The stone, together with other documents, was kept in a concrete box and displayed to the public for eight years. On 8 September 1971, it was finally buried beneath the main altar. * 13‚Äì14 November 1967 ‚Äì Arte Espa√±ol, Inc. delivered ten chandeliers to the shrine, which were immediately installed. * 9 January 1968 ‚Äì The molave wooden crosses marking the Stations of the Cross were blessed and installed by Fr Jos√© Mart√≠nez, a Franciscan from the church of Santa Ana, Manila. These were made from the beams of the old church. * September 1968 ‚Äì Arrival of 16 stained glass windows, depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross, Our Lady of the Rosary and the Dominican saints Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great and Vincent Ferrer. Six smaller windows, depicting the Four Evangelists and preaching, were later mounted in the apse. These depict, from left to right: Saints Matthew and Luke; an allegory of the Sermon on the Mount; Saint Paul Preaching to the Gentiles; and finally Saints Mark and John. They were designed by Cenon Rivera, former Dean of Fine Arts at the University of Santo Tomas and made by Kraut Art and Co. * 8 May 1973 ‚Äì Construction began on the church's ceiling, finishing by 12 December; the architect was Adolfo Benavides. At about the same time, the narra ceiling of the Chapel of the Resurrection was mounted. * 6 April 1974 ‚Äì The painting of the church's exedra, which had begun 6 February 1974, was completed. The initial plan was to decorate the exedra with a mosaic of the Resurrection, but the idea was abandoned due to the high cost and other considerations. A painting with the same theme was later executed by Ireneo Robles, a young artist from the University of Santo Tomas. It depicts the Risen Christ flanked by the Virgin Mary, John the Apostle, Saint Joseph, Mary Magdalene, an angel, Roman soldiers, and the Dominican saints Catherine of Siena and Saint Dominic. * November 1978 ‚Äì Work on the fa√ßade was finished, having begun on 10 October 1977. Architect Lorenzo del Castillo's concept was accepted out of many proposals. The old fa√ßade was retained, and a twin of the existing tower was built at the right side. Both towers were linked by two arches, surmounted by a shrine containing a cross. Stones from the old convento were used in the new parts of the fa√ßade. * 1979 ‚Äì Two bells, one weighing 267 kg. and the other 207 kg., arrived from Quintana's Factory in Salda√±a, Palencia, Spain. Following tradition, one is named after the Santo Cristo and the other after Our Lady of the Rosary. * November 1990 ‚Äì concrete statues of eight Dominican saints--Louis Bertrand, Antoninus of Florence, Albertus Magnus, Catherine of Siena, Saint Dominic, Thomas Aquinas, Rose of Lima (a patron saint of the Philippines) and Vincent Ferrer--were installed in the niches of the fa√ßade.  Historical recognition  Historical marker * The church was recognized as a Historic Structure by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), with a cast-iron plaque that was issued and placed in 1937. * The two century-old acacia trees beside the church were declared as heritage trees by DENR NCR last April 24, 2016.

Elena, Marikina Santa Elena is a barangay of Marikina City, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 6,954 people. Bordered by San Roque and Jesus Dela Pe√±a, Sta. Elena is said to be one of the first towns established by the Augustinians in what was known as the Marikina Valley and home for the heritage sites such as the Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish and the Kapitan Moy Residence. History Capitan Venciong house, one of Marikina's oldest houses. Records have shown that the barrio has traced its beginning in the year 1687, when the Jesuit missionaries crossed the river from Jesus dela Pe√±a, in search for a place to build a new church. According to a legend, the barrio got its name when the people saw a huge cross floating down the Marikina River. Many people dove into the water to get it ashore, but failed to do so. They then decided to build a chapel in honor of the mysterious cross. At first, the cross stood alone, but later the image of Sta. Elena appeared beside it. The last renovation for the chapel was done in 1945. The peaceful life in the barrio was occasionally disturbed by minor natural catastrophes such as the earthquake in 1825 and 1880 and the fire of 1887 which nearly gutted down the house of Capitan Venciong. But the people considered the bombing of the combined soldiers of the American liberation Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops on February 10, 1945 as the worst tragedy in Sta. Elena's history. Because of the construction of the Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish by the Augustinians in 1791, Sta. Elena soon emerged as the town's religious center. Famous people from Sta. Elena Sta. Elena is known for its distinguished, if not illustrious sons. Marikina's shoe legacy also began as it eventually grows into a prominent town center. Kapitan Moy, the father of Marikina shoe industry. * Laureano \\"Kapitan Moy\\" Guevara - pioneer of the shoe-making industry. * Potenciano Deguanco - the first pharmacist who graduated in the University of Santo Tomas in 1892. He then opened the first drug store, \\"FARMACIA MARIQUINA\\" in his house which was constructed during the Spanish period. * Catalino Cruz - mayor of Marikina from 1912-1918. He also became the board member of the Provincial Board from 1919-1922 and was acting governor of Rizal in 1921-1922. * Congressman Emilio de la Paz - lawyer- newspaperman who served as Representative of the 2nd district of Rizal for four terms. * Wenceslao de la Paz - Founder of the Marikina Academy (1933), now Roosevelt College, mother school of many other educational institutions. Notable Places at Sta. Elena Sta. Elena, being one of the earliest settlements developed by the Augustinian friars, is home to famous landmarks and cultural sites of Marikina.

Dushyant Chautala was in a turf war over leadership of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) with his uncle Abhay Chautala. Matters came to a head when Abhay Chautala dissolved the student wing of the INLD, the INSO, which triggered Dushyant to announce the formation of the JJP. Youth employment, senior citizen pension, fair support price for farmers,and women safety are the main issues of JJP. Under the leadership of Dushyant Chautala, Jannayak Janata Party fought its first election for Jind legislative assembly seat by-election. In the Jind by-election, JJP got 37631 votes and secured the second position pushing the Congress party to the third spot. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal not only praised Dushyant Chautala but also supported the JJP in its early days.

According to an announcement by the Hainan Maritime Safety Administration of China, the drilling work of the Hai Yang Shi You 981 would last from May 2 to August 15, 2014. On July 15, China announced that the platform had completed its work and withdrew it fully one month earlier than originally announced. The standoff is regarded by analysts as the most serious development in the territorial disputes between the two countries ever since the Johnson South Reef Skirmish in 1988 in which 64 Vietnamese soldiers were killed. It has also triggered an unprecedented wave of anti-China protests in Vietnam and attracted political commenters and scholars to re-evaluate Vietnam's diplomatic, security, and domestic policies towards China. Historical origin of conflict  Territorial claims in the South China Sea The Paracel Islands have been a subject of territorial dispute between China, Taiwan and Vietnam in the 20th century. In 1974, China and the US-backed South Vietnam fought the Battle of the Paracel Islands in which China took over the entire archipelago. South Vietnam never relinquished its claims, while Chinese and Soviet-backed North Vietnam (which did not administer the islands) supported the 1958 Declaration by China claiming all of the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, Macclesfield Bank and Pratas Islands. However, when North Vietnam reunited the country following the Vietnam War it repeated the former South Vietnamese claims. China claims the sea and land inside the \\"nine-dashed line\\" which covers about 80% of the South China Sea as its territory, which includes the Paracel Islands. On the other hand, Vietnam has attributed China's forceful occupation of the Paracel Islands as an illegitimate way to gain possession of the Paracel Islands, and denounced the gross violation of Vietnam's sovereignty by the People's Republic of China. Vietnam's claims to the Paracel Islands stem from their early historical rights, as well as the economic heritage value of the Islands to Vietnam. The Vietnamese have claimed to had knowledge of the Hoang Sa Islands long before Westerners arrived to the South China Sea and publicised the name of \\"Paracels\\" internationally. It has also been scientifically determined that the Vietnamese presence on the Paracel Islands started in the 15th century. The oldest Vietnamese document on national heritage, done sometime between 1630 and 1653 by a scholar named Do Ba, has identified the Paracel Islands, then known as \\"yellow sand\\", as a destination frequented by the Vietnamese authorities to obtain big quantities of gold. Since the normalisation of Sino-Vietnamese relations in 1991, China and Vietnam have improved mechanisms to manage border disputes, which should be seen as a progressive move in the region. However, there is still a lack of agreement on the scope of dispute, which has caused discussions on the Paracel archipelago to be excluded from dispute management talks. Background of crisis On 2 May 2014, China National Offshore Oil Corporation moved its $1 billion Hai Yang Shi You 981 oil rig to a location 17 nautical miles from Triton Island, the southwesternmost island of the Paracel Islands. According to Vietnam, its location has been shifted 3 times since then. The initial location was about 17 nautical miles off Triton Island (part of the Paracel Islands), 120 nautical miles east of Vietnam's Ly Son Island and 180 nautical miles south of China's Hainan Island, in which the last two nearest undisputed features generate a continental shelf. Up till now, it has been sitting on Vietnam's claimed continental shelf and on the Vietnamese side of any median line generated from the coastlines of the two countries. The location is also at the edge of hydrocarbon blocks 142 and 143 which were already created by Vietnam but had not been offered for exploitation to foreign oil companies, nor had been acknowledged by other disputed parties of South China Sea. China's move in the region has violated several multilateral agreements, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ASEAN-China Declaration of Conduct in the South China Sea, and bilateral agreements between the leaders of China and Vietnam. Soon after China moved its oil rig to the south of Paracel Islands and established an exclusion zone around it, Vietnam vociferously protested the move as an infringement of its sovereignty. It sent 29 ships in an attempt to disrupt the rig's placement and operations. The ships met resistance from Chinese ships escorting the rig, and Vietnam stated that its ships were repeatedly rammed and sprayed with water, resulting in six people being injured, while China stated that its ships were also rammed and it sprayed water in self-defense. On May 26, a Vietnamese fishing boat sank near the oil rig after being rammed by a Chinese vessel; the incident was shown by a video footage from Vietnam a week later. Internationally, Vietnam attempted to garner support at the ASEAN summit which took place on May 10‚Äì11. Domestically, the tensions with China resulted in people protesting against Chinese actions, which was considered rare in a communist country where the government clamped down on public protests. On May 13 and 14, anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam escalated into riots, where many foreign businesses and Chinese workers were targeted. Businesses owned by foreign investors from China, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and South Korea were subjected to vandalism and looting due to the confusion by protesters who believed the establishments to be Chinese.2014-05-17, Vietnam still a safe destination: envoy , Taipei Times2014-05-15, Protestors torch factories in southern Vietnam as China protests escalate , CNN However, the scale and extent to which the riots played out have also caused commenters to highlight the contributing factor of growing discontent among Vietnam's rapidly-growing industrial workforce. Domestic reaction Vietnamese anti-Chinese protests in Hanoi The 2014 oil rig incident has unleashed a series of anti-China protests and demonstrations in Vietnam. The demonstrations were initially peaceful in nature and displayed popular support for the government's tough rhetoric towards China. These demonstrations were seen to embody pro- government nationalism. However, the pro-government nationalism has evolved into anti-government sentiment as peaceful protests escalated into violent riots. Analysts have suggested that the riots, which occurred predominantly in industrial parks and have targeted both Chinese and non-Chinese factories, were influenced by several factors. Beyond anti-China sentiment, the riots were also seen to reflect the growing discontent among Vietnam's rapidly growing industrial workforce, as well as the wider dissatisfaction towards the Vietnamese leadership. = Pro-government nationalism = The Vietnamese leadership has built its political legitimacy by branding itself as defenders of Vietnam against external threats, and has employed the historical narrative of constant and prolonged animosity in Sino-Vietnamese relations to illustrate the political will and ability of the Communist Party to defend the country. Similarly, the Vietnamese's official response to the oil rig incident was carefully curated to maintain its popular support. In a press briefing on 15 May, Vietnamese Ministry of Affairs spokesman, Le Hai Binh, said that \\"Vietnam demand China to withdraw the oil rig Haiyang 981 and all of its ships and aircraft from Vietnam's waters and not to repeat similar actions\\" and that \\"Vietnam will take all measures in line with international law to protect its legitimate rights and interests\\". The tough stance taken by the Vietnamese government to oppose China's aggression, in the form of verbal opposition and threat of legal action, was in line with the leadership's commitment to maintain the narrative of its position as defenders of the nation against external threats.Lye, Liang Fook and Ha, Hoang Hop. (2018) \\"Vietnam‚Äôs Responses to China's Maritime Assertiveness in the South China Sea\\", Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Perspective, Issue. 2018, No. 50, pp. 1-10 The Vietnamese demonstrations in front of the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi and the Chinese Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City, which were relatively peaceful and were, therefore, seen as a display of popular support for the government's tough stance towards China.Amer, Ramses. (2015) \\"Vietnam in 2014: Crisis with China Makes Headlines\\", Southeast Asian Affairs, Vol. 2015, pp. 385-401 Furthermore, there are suspicions that the Vietnamese leadership has deliberately condoned the demonstrations as public demonstrations of such scale are highly unusual in Vietnam. Officers in plain clothes were reportedly handing out signage and the state television covered the protests extensively. Analysts have suggested that the Vietnamese government's tactful approach to direct negative domestic sentiment against China towards a more positive and effective form of pro-government nationalism which would improve national unity was in the light of Vietnam's sluggish economic performance, which has threatened the communist regime's legitimacy.Bui, Nhung. (2017) \\"Managing anti-China nationalism in Vietnam: evidence from the media during the 2014 oil rig crisis\\", The Pacific Review, Vol. 30, No. 2, pp. 169-187 The South China Sea dispute has, therefore, provided an avenue for the Vietnamese government to divert domestic attention away from its poor governance by portraying itself as a victim of China's malicious ambitions, thereby gaining sympathy from both the international community and its citizens.Tseng, Katherine. (2014) \\"The China-Vietnam Clashes in the South China Sea: An Assessment\\", East Asian Institute, Background Brief No. 928, Singapore: National University of Singapore = Anti-government sentiment = However, the peaceful demonstrations escalated into violent riots on May 13. In B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng and Dong Nai, industrial parks and factories with Chinese characters on their signboards were attacked. Following which, other foreign plants belonging to American, German, Taiwan and South Korean companies were also vandalised and attacked, with several factories burnt down overnight. Consequently, other foreign factories in these industrial zones were forced to close, resulting in a significant drop in profits and a decline of investor confidence in Vietnam's international image and the government's ability to ensure domestic stability. Analysts have, therefore, suggested that the anti-China protests were symbolic as they challenged the state's domestic legitimacy by undermining the government's efforts to attract foreign investment and portray Vietnam as a politically safe and stable destination for foreign investors. In addition, the industrial riots, while triggered by the oil rig incident, were also reflective of the growing discontent and grievances among Vietnam's rapidly growing industrial workforce. Sociological studies on riots have highlighted that the motivation behind riots typically stems from several grievances, and goes far beyond the initial resentment that has sparked the riot. In the case of the industrial riots in Vietnam, anti-China sentiment was also conflated with grievances among Vietnamese workers, who believe that they were exploited and subjected to harsh working conditions imposed by their foreign employers. Beyond industrial workers, interviews with Vietnamese residents in the wake of the oil rig crisis have reportedly found that the anti-China protests have also encompassed elements of anger and frustration towards the Vietnamese government.Lanin, Michael. (2017) \\"At the Intersection of History, Diplomacy, and Domestic Affairs: Vietnam's Difficult Position in the South China Sea Dispute\\", Independent Study Project Collection, 2611, Available online: https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/2611 Likewise, in the aftermath of the crisis, anti-government frustration intensified. This is due to the public's perception of the state's hypocrisy in its relations with China. Despite the bold rhetoric towards China, the Vietnamese leadership did not take any legal action. Furthermore, there is also a perception that the Vietnamese government is willing to sacrifice the country's territorial sovereignty in exchange for better economic ties with China. These grievances have fuelled a growing divide between the Vietnamese state and the general public, further eroding the people's trust and confidence in the government.Malesky, Edmund and Morris-Jung, Jason.

According to the newspaper, Vietnam, like Ukraine, \\"are targets for expansion plans by their big neighbors\\" because they are not \\"members in any mutual- defense treaty that binds many of the full-fledged democracies in Europe and Asia\\". The newspaper called on Vietnam to democratize and to have \\"the universal rights of freedom and a respect for the dignity of the individual\\" if it wants to ward off Chinese aggression. *The Oman Tribune, an influential English-language newspaper in Oman, in an editorial, called China's actions as \\"flexing its military muscle once again\\". The newspaper commented that \\"Beijing is not fooling anybody with its attempt to deflect blame for the tensions on the US.\\" *The Washington Post, in an editorial published on May 12, said that China's claim is \\"more tenuous\\" than Vietnam's claim and called its nine-dash line \\"audacious\\". The newspaper concluded, \\"most likely [China] will continue to act unilaterally in the region until it meets concerted resistance, whether diplomatic or military.\\" *The Financial Times, in an editorial published on May 13, said that \\"Beijing clearly bears prime responsibility for this sudden surge of tension\\" but also called on Vietnam to \\"be wary of triggering a conflict with China, given Beijing‚Äôs military strength.\\" The paper called ASEAN's reaction \\"feeble\\" and suggested that \\"all states with claims in the South China Sea should either cease exploration in disputed waters or share the spoils until final decisions about ownership are taken.\\" *The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, in an editorial published on May 13, called on the US not to intervene. The paper noted that Vietnam's failure to find support within ASEAN \\"raises questions about how seriously nations of the region take the threat of Chinese bullying.\\" The paper ended by asking \\"if nations near China aren‚Äôt willing to speak with one voice and defend their interests on issues of sovereignty, then why should the United States?\\" After anti-Chinese riots occurred in Vietnam, the paper reiterated its view in another editorial published on May 16, \\"[t]he complexity of this Southeast Asian problem, including its internal Vietnamese aspects, should be a caution to the United States to stay out of it. *The Straits Times, Singapore's largest newspaper, in an editorial published on May 15, called on China to \\"not ignore the balanced call made at the Asean Summit for all parties to refrain from taking actions that would escalate tensions further\\". The paper wrote, \\"[t]he reported ramming of Vietnamese patrol ships by Chinese vessels, which turned water cannon on them, is precisely the kind of provocation that could escalate into something far bigger than what the assertive side intends.\\" *The Jakarta Globe, an English-language Indonesian newspaper, in an editorial published on May 15, wrote \\"[w]e condemn attacks against Chinese people in Vietnam, and demand the Vietnamese government provide protection to foreign citizens in the country. However, we equally call on China to open a dialogue and stop bullying its smaller neighbors.\\" *The Yomiuri Shimbun, the newspaper with the highest circulation in Japan and the world, in an editorial published on May 20, said that \\"China‚Äôs self-serving acts undermine the stability of Asia and the Pacific region\\". While noting that \\"the anti-China protests [in Vietnam] have gone too far\\", the paper noted that damages on Japanese companies during China's anti-Japanese protests in 2005 and 2012 are still hardly compensated. *The English-language Bangkok Post, Thailand's oldest newspaper, in an editorial published on May 26, said that the anti- Chinese violence in Vietnam \\"was all about the insupportable actions of China\\". The paper said that \\"Hanoi now must move to clean up this situation, which was largely if not completely of its making\\" and that \\"[t]he assaults and arson of the southern Vietnam mob cannot be supported but, in the context of Chinese hassling, it is understandable. *The Globe and Mail, in an editorial published on May 29, wrote that both China and Vietnam should resolve their conflict through the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The paper concluded \\"As a rising power, China should not feel threatened by an international forum or international law...Beijing has no need to contend for every square kilometre of disputed seawater. The country‚Äôs future prosperity lies in good relations with its neighbours, growing trade and rising education and living standards among its people. It has nothing to gain from acquiring a few extra square kilometres of ocean or rocks.\\"  Crisis defused - implications and reflections  The oil rig crisis was defused on July 15, when the China National Offshore Oil Corporation announced that the platform had completed its work and withdrew it fully one month earlier than originally announced. Beijing publicly announced the operation was concluded \\"in accordance with relevant company‚Äôs plan\\" and had \\"nothing to do with any external factor\\". Vietnamese leaders have hailed the early withdrawal of the Chinese oil rig as a victory and thanked the international community for its support. The withdrawal of the drilling rig, which was regarded to have defused and ended the crisis, was an outcome that benefited both China and Vietnam. Both countries could claim to have achieved their goals - Vietnam's capability to sustain pressure on China and China's completion of its drilling operation. = Uncertainty in the future direction of international relations in Asia = The oil rig crisis has called into question the efficacy of dispute management strategies with respect to the South China Sea. Despite the presence of diplomacy and military channels between China and Vietnam to deal with crisis situations, the relatively long duration of the crisis implies that direct bilateral engagement is a limited approach to de-escalate tension. Furthermore, while China withdrew the oil rig one month earlier than its planned date, Beijing's statement on the completion of the drilling operation has suggested that the decision was not a result of effective Sino-Vietnamese engagement.Tran, Truong Thuy. (n.d.) \\"Vietnam‚Äôs Maritime Security Challenges and Responses\\", NIDS Joint Research Series, No. 13, pp. 85-100 Furthermore, the political will of ASEAN to address China's increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea is questioned given ASEAN's lukewarm response to the oil rig crisis and the avoidance of explicitly mentioning China in its statement. That said, China and ASEAN have since engaged in discussions to negotiate the terms of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. Speaking at the ASEAN-China Summit on 14 November 2018, Philippine President Duterte reaffirmed ASEAN's commitment to reach an agreement on the Code of Conduct in the disputed South China Sea (COC), and has implied that the Single Draft COC Negotiating Text would be completed by 2019. Analysts have also suggested that the oil rig crisis has given more clarity to Beijing's aims in the South China Sea. China's increasing military muscle-flexing in the South and East China Seas is seen to undermine the United States‚Äô credibility as a security provider in the Asia-Pacific region. China seeks to demonstrate to Asian states that Washington's security commitment to the region is limited as it is unwilling to risk a military clash with China. This will in turn allow China to advance its power and influence in the region. Others have also suggested that as Beijing's increasing aggressiveness in the region is carefully calculated to prevent Southeast Asian states from counterbalancing with the United States. China predicts that as its military power grows and Southeast Asian states become increasingly dependent on China for economic growth, the claimant states will eventually give in to China. Furthermore, China predicts that the Trump administration's pivot away from Asia implies that America is less likely to directly intervene in the South China Sea dispute.Storey, Ian. (2014) \\"The Sino-Vietnamese Oil Rig Crisis: Implications for the South China Sea Dispute\\", ISEAS Perspective, Vol. 52, pp. 1-11 = Legitimacy of the Vietnamese government = In addition, the oil rig crisis has implications on the domestic legitimacy of the Vietnamese government. The Vietnamese government's legitimacy rests on the pillars of economic growth, defending the country from external threats, and building an inclusive society (d√¢n gi√†u, n∆∞·ªõc m·∫°nh, d√¢n ch·ªß, c√¥ng b·∫±ng, vƒÉn minh). The oil rig crisis has surfaced cracks in the public's confidence towards the Vietnamese government's ability to take a hard line approach in its policy towards China. The anti-China protests and riots were also manifestations of the public's frustration towards their working conditions and the country's sluggish economic growth. This presents a dilemma for the Vietnamese leadership, as it seeks to promote economic growth by further cooperating and engaging with China, while being careful to ensure that economic development does not come at the expense of Vietnam's territorial sovereignty. The nationalistic enthusiasm which the Vietnamese government has fostered to strengthen national unity and party legitimacy has, in turn, made Vietnamese accommodations towards the South China Sea issue politically elusive.Taylor, Keith (2013).

Every year, more than ‚Ç¨1.4 billion ($1.8 billion) worth of goods are carried by Porteadoras into Morocco across the borders of Melilla and Ceuta.

In 2009 two women died at Ceuta Biutz border crossing, overwhelmed by an avalanche of 200 carriers, four policemen were also injured.

Traditionally it is made from the soft inner skin of cattle (cow or water buffalo), diced, and sun-dried until it hardens and loses most of its water content. The diced and dried skin are later fried in ample hot cooking oil until they expand in similar fashion with bubble and yield a crispy texture. This fried cattle skin is then sealed in vacuum plastic bags to ensure and prolong its crispiness. History Krupuk rambak or krupuk made from cow or buffalo skin, is the oldest-mentioned krupuk variant in ancient Java. According to a culinary historian, krupuk have been around in Java since the 9th or 10th century, which was written on the Batu Pura inscription as krupuk rambak, still exist today in Javanese cuisine and are usually used in krechek dish. Serving Javanese krechek made from krupuk kulit Krupuk kulit is often served as a crispy snack to accompany main meals. In Padang restaurants they are often offered as a side dish for nasi padang or sate padang, and often served with kuah gulai seasoning. In Java, krupuk kulit is the essential ingredients for krechek, a krupuk kulit dish in spicy coconut milk stew. Variations Most of krupuk kulit sold in Indonesia are made from cattle skin, ether cow or water buffalo (kerbau). However, in some areas with large non-Muslim populations such as Bali, Batak lands, and some Chinatowns in Medan and other cities, pork skin krupuk kulit is also available.

In the Middle Ages there was a fortified abbey by the middle reaches of the river which belonged to a Roman Catholic religious order and acted as the regional administrative centre or commandry.  Course  The Hainbach rises at a height of 400 m on the east flank of the Ro√überg mountain (637.0 m) in the Haardt, the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest range. It flows around the Teufelsberg (597.6 m), initially heading west and then south. After four kilometres it leaves the mountains between Frankweiler and Gleisweiler, passes through the narrow hill zone of the rift valley and enters the Upper Rhine Plain. Running initially eastwards, later northeastwards, it passes through B√∂chingen, Walsheim, Kn√∂ringen, Essingen and, on the southern edge of the G√§u region, the municipality of Hochstadt, the parishes of Zeiskam and Lustadt and the municipality of Weingarten. In Schwegenheim it turns northwards; from Harthausen it is called the Wooggraben and changes direction to head east. On the southwestern edge of Dudenhofen it is led under the Speyerbach (carried on an embankment) through a culvert, passing the village as the Krebsb√§chel in a largely canalised riverbed and discharges on the northeastern edge of Dudenhofen (elevation 101 m) from the right into the Woogbach, also called the Nonnenbach which is a left side arm of the Speyerbach.  History  In 1185 Emperor Frederick Barbarossa awarded extensive estates on the territory of Zeiskam north of the village on the Hainbach to the Knights Hospitaller. The order, whose Catholic successors after the Reformation period were called the Knights of Malta, founded a regional administrative centre, the Komturei of Heimbach, and named it after the stream, whose name was then spelt with an m. In 1525, during the Peasants' War the entire site including its church was burned down by rebellious farmers of the Nu√üdorf Haufen and permanently destroyed. In 2011 the municipality of Zeiskam inaugurated a monument near the few visible remains of the abbey, in the form of a Gothic sandstone arch.

HMC ceased operations in 1994 due to falling nickel prices. In 2001, despite fierce local opposition, mining resumed. In May 2001 protesting locals clashed with HMC. A Manicani local and two others were seriously wounded when a vehicle rammed the picket lines. Also in 2001, due to the destruction of the delicate ecosystem the HMC was issued a suspension order. In 2005 HMC was granted a permit to remove stockpiles. Allegations of human rights abuses arose when 70 protesters were violently dispersed by police. In June 2012 one of Nickle Asia's other subsidiaries, Samar Nickel Resource Corp, filed criminal charges when members of an anti-mining group blockaded the port to stop delivery of a vehicle meant to transport schoolchildren around the island. = Effects of mining = Open pit nickel mine mining, like the one used on Manicani has been outlawed in many countries due to the devastating ecological effects. > ‚ÄúManicani Island nickel mining has reduced the amount of land available to > farmers and siltation into the ocean has adversely impacted fishing; before > mining, agriculture and aquaculture could sustain the people of Manicani > Island but now they have been made poorer.‚Äù - Journal of Geography and > Geology, 2013Journal of Geography and Geology; Vol. 5, No. 4; 2013  See also  * List of islands in the Philippines  References  Category:Islands of Eastern Samar Category:Guiuan ","title":"Manicani Island"},{"id":"42780441","text":"Harinder Singh Khalsa is an Indian politician.

Tensions in the pre-Soviet period Soviet policy toward the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church cannot be understood simply in terms of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideology. The precedent for Stalinist church policy in Western Ukraine can be found in the treatment of the Greek-Catholic Church during centuries of tsarist rule and the pattern of relations between the Russian state and the Orthodox Church. Hostility toward the so-called \\"Uniate Church\\" dates back to the Union of Brest in 1596, when the majority of Orthodox bishops in Ukraine and Belarus (then part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) recognized the primacy of the Holy See. In return, papal guarantees recognized that the Uniates retained their Byzantine (Eastern) rite, the Church-Slavonic liturgical language, Eastern canon law, a married clergy and administrative autonomy. Coming only seven years after the establishment of the Moscow Patriarchate (which claimed jurisdiction over the Orthodox in the Commonwealth), this union was viewed by Muscovy not only as an ecclesiastical obstacle to its claim as the \\"Third Rome,\\" but also as an attempt to permanently separate Ukraine and Belarus from Muscovy. This opposition continued after the second and third partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, when the Russian Empire systematically carried out attempts to liquidate the Union of Brest. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church's incompatibility with Soviet Russian policy and social order stems from the church's title. As a \\"Ukrainian\\" church, the UGCC not only managed to maintain its ethnic individuality under foreign domination but also helped forge a modern national self-identity. As a \\"Catholic\\" church, the UGCC was closely tied to Rome and to other Catholic Churches. Attempts to liquidate the church in 1939-41 Without any efforts to conceal its intentions, the Soviet regime renewed earlier attempts to liquidate the Union of Brest following its occupation of Western Ukrainian lands in September 1939, prior to which they had belonged to Poland. A propaganda campaign against the Ukrainian Greek- Catholic Church was initiated by the magazine \\"Communist\\", which, in its 9 October 1939 issue, accused the church's infrastructure of Anti-Soviet agitation and collaboration with the \\"Polish Bourgeoisie.\\" At this same time, 20 Ukrainian Greek-Catholic publications were shut down by Soviet authorities who subsequently began confiscating religious literature from libraries and bookstores. Seminaries and monastic novitiates also witnessed the forced closure of their institutions. On 22 October 1939, the Peoples' Committees of Ukraine voted on and passed a decree calling for the nationalization of all Greek-Catholic property, including churches and monasteries. The day-to-day operations of all Greek-Catholic organizations were prohibited. Priests were deemed \\"unfit for society\\" and levied with exorbitant taxes, amounting up to 15,000 roubles per year. Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky personally met with Nikita Khrushchev regarding the tax burdens, and managed to secure a slight mitigation. On 9 October 9, 1939, Sheptytsky issued a pastoral letter in which he underscored the difficulty of the new situation for the church and emphasized the necessity of rearing children and youth in the spirit of the Greek-Catholic faith. A few months later, the metropolitan addressed the priests of the UGCC, requesting that they refrain from openly endorsing any political power to avoid further repressions. But, unsatisfied with the rate at which atheism was being implemented, the regime increased its anti- religious campaign by supplementing the budgets of the media and such organizations as the Komsomol and Association of Military Non-Believers. Schools became targets of increased pressure to introduce curricula featuring subjects on atheism, while traditional religious holidays were officially declared work days. The atheism campaign was augmented by the simultaneous attempt to introduce and embed the influence and authority of the Russian Orthodox Church on the territory of Galicia. On 17 October 1939, Panteleymon Rozhnovsky was appointed bishop of Grodno and authorized to conduct missionary work in Western Belarus and Ukraine. In the middle of the following year, Mykola Yarushevych became the exarch of Volhynia. On 28 October 1940, despite disapproval even from Orthodox hierarchs, who warned of possible difficulties stemming from planned religious conversions, the Moscow Patriarchate openly declared its desire to liquidate Greek-Catholicism. The expansion of the Russian Orthodox Church and the process of implementing atheism throughout the Ukrainian territories were interrupted by the outbreak of the Nazi-Soviet War of 22 June 1941. From the summer of 1941 until the summer of 1944, Western Ukraine was under Nazi occupation. Renewed pressure on the UGCC in 1944-1945 In the summer and fall of 1944, the Soviet Red Army re-occupied Eastern Galicia, as well as Transcarpathia, the seat of the Ukrainian Greek- Catholic Eparchy of Mukachiv-Uzhorod. In time, Communist forces extended their rule on all neighboring territories settled by ethnic Ukrainians-Uniates, including the Riashiv, Lemko and Priashiv regions of present-day Poland and Slovakia. In his letter to Cardinal Tisserant (March 1944), Sheptytsky expressed his deep concern over the return of Soviet occupying forces. At first, the Soviet regime did not openly concern itself with the question of implementing atheism in Western Ukraine. In fact, Sheptytsky, who died on 1 November 1944, was granted a solemn yet momentous funeral, the ceremony of which was attended by members of the new regime. At the close of World War II, the Greek-Catholic Church in the Ukrainian S.S.R. consisted of 4 eparchies with 2,326 parishes, over 4,000 structures and approximately 3.5 ‚Äì 4 million faithful. Pastoral duties were being fulfilled by 8 bishops and close 2,400 priests. The 4 eparchies administered theological academies, 4 seminaries with 565 seminarians, as well as 35 monasteries with 155 montks and 347 brotherhoods, and 123 convents with 979 nuns. By April 1945, Iosyf Stalin approved a 10-point plan ‚Äì developed by leaders of the Ukrainian Communist Party ‚Äì which called for the liquidation of the Greek-Catholic Church and the augmentation of Orthodox infrastructures in Ukraine. The Soviet press began to slander the priesthood and unleashed a campaign attacking the Greek-Catholic Church's history. In addition, the press renewed its accusations of Nationalism vis-√†-vis the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and organizing anti- Soviet resistance. The pro-Soviet articles of the Galician journalist Yaroslav Halan, a correspondent for the daily newspaper Vil'na Ukraina (A Free Ukraine), were particularly effective in harming the church's reputation. On 11 April 1945, the NKGB arrested Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj, Sheptytsky's successor, as well as 4 Galician bishops: Hryhory Khomyshyn, Ivan Liatyshevsky, Nikita Budka and Mykola Charnetsky. At a time when bishops and other members of the religious community who refused to \\"convert\\" to Orthodoxy were accused of fabricated political crimes and deported to concentration camps (where only Metropolitan Slipyj, and Bishops Charnetsky and Liatyshevsky, survived), the NKVD created a \\"voluntary\\" movement for the \\"reunion\\" (Rus. vossoiedyneniia) with the Russian Orthodox Church. This movement, in addition to the support of those priests who voluntarily strived for reunion, also relied on the official support of priests who were forced into such a position, often by torture. Almost immediately following the wave of arrests of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic hierarchs, the Russian Orthodox Church appointed Mykhailo Oksiiuk bishop of Lviv and Ternopil, expressly advising him to coordinate his actions with the \\"people's movement for the union of the Church.\\" \\"The Initiative Group\\" The so-called \\"Initiative Group for the Reunion of the Greek-Catholic Church with the Orthodox Church\\" was created on 28 May 1945, with the Rev. Havryil Kostelnyk at its helm. Two official letters were written on this day. The first letter was addressed to the government of Soviet Ukraine, requesting the Initiative Group's formal recognition as well as its authorization for the right to carry out the \\"reunion\\" campaign. The second letter informed the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic clergy that the group was created \\"by the will of the people\\" and that the group did not recognize any other administrative leadership of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. On 18 June 1945, Pavlo Khodchenko, the republican plenipotentiary of the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church, replied on behalf of the government of the Ukrainian S.S.R., recognizing the \\"Initiative Group\\" as the sole provisional organ of church administration, authorized to conduct all affairs of the Greek-Catholic parishes situated on the territory of Western Ukraine. This paved the way for proceeding in all matters concerning the reunion with the Russian Orthodox Church. The Initiative Group was authorized to \\"coordinate and comply with the government on all legal affairs pertaining to the administration of Greek-Catholic parishes.\\" The reply also instructed the Initiative Group to dispatch to Khodchenko \\"lists of all deans, parish priests and hegumens [superiors] of monasteries who refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the Initiative Group.\\" Khodchenko's letter is the only officially publicized document confirming the government's direct participation in the process of destroying the Uniate Church. A group of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic hierarchs who were not yet incarcerated ‚Äì under the leadership of Archimandrite Klymentiy Sheptytsky ‚Äì issued a formal protest against Khodchenko's directives. In their letter to Vyacheslav Molotov, they referred to specific clauses in Soviet law which guaranteed the freedom of religion and conscience. In addition, the letter of protest denoted the manipulative nature of the \\"Initiative Group\\" in its attempt to falsify the history of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. They demanded the release of Metropolitan Slipyj and other imprisoned clergy, while at the same time offering their assurance that Greek-Catholics have no intention to engage in anti-Soviet activity. However, none of these acts of protest were able to garner any positive results. In fact, the NKGB proceeded to arrest priests, particularly focusing its attention on members of the Order of St. Basil the Great. By the end of June 1945, the number of those incarcerated exceeded 200. The \\"Initiative Group\\" also began to engage in the so-called \\"political re-education\\" of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics. In August 1945, it distributed 5,000 copies of Kostelnyk's anti-papal brochure which condemned the Union of Brest and appealed for the conversion to Orthodoxy. During his many private meetings with members of the priesthood, Kostelnyk asserted that the issue of \\"reunion\\" would be limited only to a formal subordination to the Russian Orthodox Church; the ability to observe holy days and conduct religious services would be retained without any changes and such an arrangement, given the circumstances, would be in the best interest of the faithful. At the same time, representatives of the \\"Initiative Group\\" were systematically informing the government of recalcitrant priests. As a result, those priests who refused to sign the document certifying their conversion to Orthodoxy, were not only automatically relieved of their pastoral responsibilities, but often arrested as well. The \\"Initiative Group\\" considered the combination of various forms of pressure, to be effective ‚Äì in October 1945 Kostelnyk estimated that by year's end only a hundred priests would be negatively inclined towards \\"reunification.\\" Yet, he admitted that among those individuals who agreed to the conversion, there were many who committed this act out of fear or the desire to continue their pastoral activity under the pretext of subordinating to the regime. The activities of the \\"Initiative Group\\" were personally supervised by the then head of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU), Nikita Khrushchev, who informed Stalin on 17 December 1945 of the activities taken by the group under the supervision of the NKGB. The Synod of Lviv and its consequences The culmination of the \\"unification\\" campaign took place at the so-called Lviv Synod (Sobor) in March 1946, when an assembly of appointed hierarchs \\"annulled\\" the Union of Brest (although this 1946 congregation was not convened in accordance with canon law). Apart from the fact that the Stalinist regime never formally liquidated the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, by 1949 the Russian Orthodox Church had forcibly absorbed the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in Transcarpathia as well, and an analogous \\"union\\" had also occurred on the territory of the Greek-Catholic Eparchy of Priashiv in Eastern Slovakia. In 1948, the Union of Brest was abolished in Romania and Orthodoxy was also instituted in 10 Ukrainian Greek-Catholic parishes in those regions neighboring Transcarpathia. The Greek-Catholic Church was also de facto disbanded in Poland in 1947-1949. The forced \\"unification\\" did not eradicate the existence of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. The church survived within the formal infrastructure of the Orthodox Church as an \\"underground\\" Uniate Church, in the GULags, in exile, and clandestinely on the territory of Western Ukraine. However, the church received its formal legal right to exist only on the cusp of 1989-1990. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church after Stalin's death Stalin's death in March 1953, the internal struggle for power following his demise, and the so- called de-Stalinization campaign initiated by Nikita Khrushchev all had a significant impact on the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. A few months following the dictator's death, Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj ‚Äì whose 8-year sentence officially ended in April 1953 ‚Äì by Beria's order, was transferred from a camp in Mordova to Moscow. As he sought out allies during his struggle for power in Ukraine and the other non-Russian republics, Beria began to oppose the russification of Western Ukraine. His subordinates began secret negotiations with Josyf Slipyj regarding the normalization of relations with the Vatican and the legalization of the Greek-Catholic Church in Western Ukraine. Discussions with the metropolitan were abruptly discontinued after Beria's arrest. Slipyj did not accept the KGB's proposal of renouncing his loyalty to the Pope of Rome in exchange for freedom and a high position in the Russian Orthodox Church. As a result, he was sentenced to exile in Krasnoyarsk where he remained under the obscure status of a semi-prisoner until his subsequent arrest in 1958. In 1955-1956 following Khrushchev's dissolution of the GULag system, a few hundred Greek-Catholic priests and monks were released from the camps and permitted to return to Western Ukraine. Among those released were two bishops: Nicholas Charnetsky who returned to Lviv, and Ivan Lyatyshevskyi, the auxiliary bishop of the Stanislaviv Eparchy, who returned to Stanislaviv. Although they were forbidden to engage in pastoral activities, both bishops continued to fulfill their episcopal obligations and ordained a number of priests. Due to the fact that many Ukrainian Greek-Catholic priests ‚Äì now formally serving as Orthodox priests ‚Äì appealed to the bishops by requesting absolution and their re-acceptance into the Greek-Catholic faith, in 1956 Bishop Charnetsky came to the conclusion that the priests should continue to provide pastoral care to the faithful in the Orthodox Church, while secretly belonging to the Greek-Catholic Church. Thus, the banned Greek- Catholic Church ‚Äì without any possibility of legally serving its faithful ‚Äì managed to formally maintain its presence in the Orthodox Church in the form of a \\"clandestine\\" Greek-Catholic clergy. Furthermore, the Greek-Catholic Church was able to supplement, to some degree, the ranks of its priesthood through the \\"underground\\" Greek-Catholic seminaries. New tensions regarding the status of and policies towards the UGCC De-Stalinization, just like the transformation of the Greek-Catholic Church in Poland in 1956-1957, brought hope for yet another legalization of the Greek-Catholic Church in Western Ukraine. A large number of appeals regarding legalization were produced by the faithful, while a few parishes even rejected Orthodoxy. The publication in December 1957 of a resolution adopted in October of that year by the deans of the Lviv Eparchy during a conference held at the Pochaiv Monastery, quashed these aspirations. The resolution distinctly underscored the fact that the Soviet government's stance regarding the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church had not changed and that it [the church] will continue to be interpreted as an instrument in the hands of \\"enemies of the state.\\" Moreover, a clear signal of the regime's hard-line attitude towards the Greek-Catholic Church, was the arrest, in the spring of 1958, of exiled Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj under the premise of illegal contacts with members of the clergy and the smuggling abroad of the metropolitan's pastoral letters and other correspondence. Following lengthy hearings in June 1959, during a closed trial in Kyiv, the metropolitan was sentenced to an additional 7 years of imprisonment. It was only as a result of ongoing discussions between Pope John XXIII, Nikita Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy between 1961 and 1963, that the metropolitan was finally released from imprisonment in late January 1963. On 4 February 1963, after secretly appointing Vasyl Velychkovsky as bishop-exarch of Lviv, Slipyj departed Moscow en route to Rome. However, improved relations between the Vatican and Moscow did not benefit the status of the Greek- Catholic Church in Ukraine ‚Äì repressions against active, underground Uniate bishops and clergy commenced once again. The relative amelioration of Moscow- Vatican relations coincided with the final phase of Krushchev's \\"de- Stalinization\\" period, which nevertheless consisted of an ongoing Soviet anti- religious policy, the main target of which, since the late 1950s, was the Russian Orthodox Church. Prior to Khrushchev's ouster at the end of 1964, a large number of Orthodox churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed. Seeking to establish amicable relations with the Kremlin, the Moscow Patriarchate renewed its function as a supporter and defender of Soviet foreign policy. In 1960, the Russian Orthodox Church joined the World Council of Churches and initiated contact with the Vatican. The illegal status of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in the USSR became the key point of contention between the Vatican and the Moscow Patriarchate. In this respect, Moscow's greatest wish was for the pope to renounce the Uniates. At a minimum, the task was to maintain the status quo and keep the Vatican from legalizing the Greek- Catholic Church worldwide. The Moscow Patriarchate hoped that closer relations with the pope would neutralize the pressure induced by Uniate √©migr√© circles upon the Vatican, as well as demoralize the underground church in Ukraine. In both cases, the Moscow Patriarchate achieved a certain amount of success during the papacy of Paul VI, which coincided with the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. The Brezhnev Period The Greek-Catholic clergy ‚Äì undaunted by disciplinary sanctions in 1965-1966 ‚Äì in mid-1966 began celebrating liturgies on Sundays and religious holidays in officially non-functioning churches in Western Ukraine. The clergy's actions served as a test to monitor the regime's potential reaction to such activity. Thus, by August 1967, close to 200 churches were once again meeting the spiritual needs of Ukrainian Catholics in Galicia, while a large number of those priests who had been \\"accepted\\" into the Orthodox Church, were secretly seeking the opportunity to return to the Greek-Catholic Church. Countless appeals for the legal registration of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic parishes were rejected by the regime. Despite the regime's warnings, the majority of the active clergy openly continued pastoral activity. The restored legal status of the Greek-Catholic Church in neighboring Czechoslovakia in June 1968 (which was not rescinded following the Soviet invasion in August of that year) and the subsequent return of the majority of the parishes, which had been transferred in 1950 to the government-supported Orthodox Church, galvanized the Uniates in Galicia and inclined Cardinal Josyf Slipyj, that same year, to relay a memorandum to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine calling for the legalization of the Church. A meeting between the head of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mykola Pidhornyi and Pope Paul VI on June 30, 1969, produced no breakthrough regarding the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. However, just as in 1957, prospects for the UGCC's resurgence from the underground compelled the Russian Orthodox Church in 1968 to demand from the Soviet regime an assurance that this would never happen. In October 1968, a new wave of repressions was initiated against the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. The arrest of Bishop Velychkovsky and two underground priests was the culmination of this last crackdown on the cusp of 1968-1969. Empty churches throughout the countryside which at one time had been frequented by Greek Catholics, were now being either destroyed by the local authorities or utilized for secular purposes; a number of churches were transformed into museums of atheism. In some locales the situation came to a head between the militia and faithful, including incidents of violence where the faithful were brutally beaten or temporarily detained by the militia. Priests who were caught celebrating liturgical services were issued monetary fines. This renewed wave of repressions coincided with Moscow's crackdown on political demonstrations in Ukraine which manifested themselves in the form of Ukrainian dissidents' support for the renewal of the Greek-Catholic Church. The beginning of the 1970s was also characterized by a significant increase in defamatory and intimidating publications in the press. These new attacks divided the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic clergy vis-√†-vis the prospects for the legalization of their church. Many representatives of the clergy fell under the assumption that the regime would never recognize the Church and therefore a \\"compromise\\" ‚Äì as was often proposed by KGB operatives during interrogations ‚Äì would serve as a possible solution. Others, on the other hand, sought some kind of modus vivendi and hoped for some sort of Vatican-Moscow outcome which would benefit the status and further the recognition process of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Throughout 1972-1973, Ukrainian Catholics submitted to the [Soviet] government many declarations calling for the legalization of the Church. However, fear of repressions hindered the collecting of signatures. A petition relayed to Moscow in February 1973 via a delegation headed by Rev. Volodymyr Prokopiv garnered 1200 signatures. The initiative spearheaded by Rev. Prokopiv ‚Äì who attempted to secure the Church's registration under the hope of a compromise ‚Äì did not enjoy broad support amongst the clergy. Rev. Prokopiv's proposal appeared to be yet another attempt to implode the Church from within. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Helsinki in August 1975 served as an important step towards the implementation of international monitoring of Human Rights in the USSR, particularly the freedom of religion. For the underground Ukrainian Greek- Catholic Church ‚Äì the largest banned religious organization in the Soviet Union ‚Äì the Helsinki Accords initiated the practice of regularly held observational conferences. In addition, the engagement of foreign, independent monitoring organizations as well as unofficial Helsinki Groups in the USSR (the Ukrainian Helsinki Group was formed in November 1976), paved the way for the internationalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Beginning with the Belgrade conference in late 1977, the issue of the violation of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics' religious freedom was formally raised in the form of various presentations and documents issued by American, Canadian and Vatican delegations as well as by other Western powers. In late spring 1978, yet another initiative was undertaken ‚Äì most likely under the impetus of the Soviet Ukrainian government ‚Äì to resolve the legalization issue of the UGCC in the form of a \\"Roman Catholic Church of the Eastern Rite.\\" The initiative group drafted a statute of such a church and proposed that its head be a Roman Catholic bishop from Lithuania to be appointed by the Pope. In so doing, the clergy's activities would be limited to celebrating liturgies and performing other religious ceremonial functions. Finances and the administering of parochial affairs would be fulfilled by lay parish councils, as guaranteed by Soviet legislation under the category \\"religious beliefs.\\" On 5 June 1978, the draft statute was submitted to the Council for Religious Affairs in Moscow. The overall initiative, however, failed to receive further attention and development. Even if the authorities had chosen to provide a formal response, the uncertainty regarding the future course of the Vatican's \\"Ost-Politik\\" could have possibly decided the endeavour's ultimate fate. Following the death of Pope Paul VI on 6 August 1978, and the unexpected passing of the pontiff's immediate successor on 29 September of that year, John Paul II became pope on 16 October 1978. Pope John Paul II and tensions vis-√†-vis the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church John Paul II's ascension to the Holy See ushered in the Vatican's policy of support for the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. The Soviet authorities' concerns regarding the new pope's intentions were confirmed by the publication of a letter (dated 19 March 1979) addressed to Cardinal Josyf Slipyj regarding the Millennium of Ukraine's Christianity, scheduled to be commemorated in 1988. In his letter, John Paul II underscored the importance of preserving the Union of Brest, by expressing his respect for the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic episcopate, clergy, and faithful who bore witness to injustice and persecution in the name of Christ and professed their faith in God and their Church. Simultaneously directing his address at the Soviet government, the pope invoked the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by appealing to the authorities to allow each believer to profess his/her own faith and to participate in the communal life of the Church to which he/she belongs. The pope's letter to Slipyj not only sent shock waves and anxiety throughout the Vatican's Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity (headed at that time by Cardinal Johannes Willebrands), but also spurred a harsh reaction from Moscow. As a result, the Moscow Patriarchate immediately postponed a scheduled theological meeting with Roman Catholic hierarchs in Odesa. In addition, on 4 September 1979, the patriarchate's representative in charge of external ecclesiastical affairs, Metropolitan Yuvenaliy, wrote a letter to Cardinal Willebrands in which he threatened the latter with \\"public criticism,\\" if Willebrands did not immediately explain the \\"exact meaning\\" behind the papal missive to Slipyj. Unsatisfied with Willebrands's diplomatic response, Moscow once again expressed outrage when in March 1980 John Paul II convened an extraordinary synod of all the Ukrainian bishops. It was during this synod that the pope confirmed the selection of Archbishop Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky as coadjutor ‚Äì with the right of succession ‚Äì to Archbishop of Lviv, Josyf Slipyj, thereby guaranteeing the continuity of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Metropolitanate's leadership in Galicia. The already strained relations between Moscow and the Vatican were exacerbated even further, when later that same year the synod of Ukrainian bishops was once again summoned to Rome where, on 2 December 1980, it adopted a resolution which unanimously declared the Lviv Sobor of 1946 as uncanonical and void. The Russian patriarch's protest initiated a broad discussion within the Roman curia regarding the priorities of Vatican-Moscow political and ecumenical relations, and the effect of Moscow's dissatisfaction with the Roman Catholic Church's position in the Soviet bloc. The pope's response to Moscow was issued on 24 January 1981, and was considered a compromise, which could satisfy neither the Russian Patriarchate nor the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics: the Apostolic See ‚Äì by expressing its unwavering position in support of the rights of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church ‚Äì nevertheless wanted the resolution (of the 1946 Sobor) to initially be disseminated throughout the press and for the documents to be accessible for review. As a result, Rome immediately informed all of the papal nuncios in those countries where Ukrainian Catholics dwelled that the texts of the resolution did not receive formal approval and were therefore not considered official documents. In the spring of 1980, the Soviet press left no doubt that John Paul II was perceived as a serious threat. As a result, an anti-papal and anti-Uniate campaign was initiated, which in Ukraine was spearheaded by Leonid Kravchuk. He informed a conference of Orthodox bishops that authorities in Ukraine had embarked on a massive propaganda initiative and had taken certain administrative steps to counteract the \\"nationalist and religious subversive deeds\\" supported by the Vatican. The Period of Transition The final years of the Brezhnev regime and the transitional rule of Yuri Andropov and Kostyantin Chernenko were characterized in terms of an increase in political control. This included attacks against any manifestation of ideological deviation as well as an escalation of propaganda against such influences from abroad as: nationalism, Catholicism, religious fundamentalism, Zionism and American imperialism. At a time when a \\"patriotic\\" rapprochement between the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church was becoming more and more evident, the banned Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church was subjected to yet another wave of repressions. During the first half of 1980, three Uniate priests were murdered, while in early 1981 three additional priests were imprisoned. At this same time, Soviet Secret Service officials began using new, advanced methods of infiltration and internal manipulation with the intent of destabilizing the underground Church and undermining its status abroad. During the early 1980s, several priests and proactive lay youth groups outside Ukraine distributed information worldwide about the dramatic situation of the Uniates and their struggle for the legalization of their Church. Domestically, in September 1982, under the leadership of Iosyp Terelia, \\"The Initiative Group for the Defence of the Rights of Believers and the Church\\" was organized. Following Terelia's arrest and sentencing to a one-year term of incarceration in December 1982, the group's leadership was assumed by another lay activist, Vasyl Kobryn, who in turn was arrested and sentenced to a three- year term of hard labour in November 1984. Beginning in 1984, on an irregular basis, the group began issuing a bulletin titled \\"The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Ukraine,\\" edited for the most part by Terelia. One of the reasons behind the publication of the bulletin was the ever-deepening crisis because aging priests who were trained under \\"normal\\" circumstances (prior to the Church's destruction) could not be replaced by equally well-trained young clergymen. Another factor to contend with was the phenomenon of so-called \\"crypto-Catholics\\" who had evolved and increased in size over the course of the previous four decades by attending Orthodox services. Among them now functioned a new generation of Orthodox priests who had not undergone formation in the Uniate tradition and were thus increasingly distancing themselves from the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Given such circumstances, the concern was that this new generation of clergymen might not return to their original Church as long as it remained underground and was not officially recognized by the regime. Cardinal Josyf Slipyj died on 7 September 1984 in Rome. He was succeeded, as planned, by Archbishop Myroslav Lubachivsky, whom Pope John Paul II appointed cardinal on 25 May 1985. The status of the UGCC at the outset of the Gorbachev era Mikhail Gorbachev's ascension to the leadership of the Communist Party and the introduction of \\"Perestroika\\" paved the way for a number of political concessions. In 1986-1987 almost all Ukrainian prisoners of conscience were released. Their freedom became the basis for a revitalized movement in support of human, national and religious rights in Ukraine. As the fear of massive political repressions began to wane, the underground Church was becoming more assertive and visible. In the wake of Gorbachev's reforms, \\"The Initiative Group for the Defense of the Rights of Believers and the Church\\" renewed its activities. In late 1987 ‚Äì following Iosyp Terelia's relocation to Canada ‚Äì the Initiative Group's title was changed to the \\"Committee for the Defense of the Ukrainian Catholic Church\\" and its leadership was now assumed by the recently released political dissident Ivan Gel. The Committee began to publish an uncensored journal titled \\"The Christian Voice,\\" which replaced \\"The Chronicle.\\" With the arrival of \\"Glasnost,\\" Ukrainian Catholic activists organized a campaign for the return of the Church's pre-war status. As a result, the clergy began to celebrate liturgies in public for large congregations of Greek-Catholics, particularly at pilgrimage sites. In addition, activists began organizing petitions demanding the reopening of Greek-Catholic churches as well as the full rehabilitation and legalization of the Church. Furthermore, the faithful were being encouraged to publicly confront the authorities on the issue of the constitutional rights of Ukrainian Catholics' religious freedom. Through the intervention of non-Ukrainian dissident movements in the Soviet Union, the Committee also began to distribute to the Western media not only various printed as well as audio-visual materials attesting to the massive support for the renewal of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, but also evidence of the ongoing repressions by Soviet authorities. In early August 1987, a group consisting of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic priests, monks and lay people, including bishops Pavlo Vasylyk and Ivan Semedi, announced that it is \\"leaving the underground,\\" and called upon the pope to \\"support the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in the USSR in every possible way.\\" Soon afterwards, additional Ukrainian Catholic bishops, namely Metropolitan Volodymyr Sterniuk of Lviv and bishop Sofron Dmyterko of Ivano-Frankivsk, joined the group of activists demanding legalization. Pope John Paul II was now, on many an occasion, taking up the plight of Ukrainian Catholics in the USSR, and high expectations were being held in regards to the upcoming commemoration of the Millennium of Ukrainian Christianity. The Pope celebrated the Millennium together with the hierarchs of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in Rome in 1988, subject to the condition that he could make a pastoral visit to a Ukrainian Greek-Catholic church, to serve as a symbolic gesture of gratitude to the pontiff for approving a high-ranking delegation's participation in Millennium festivities in Moscow and Kyiv. This led to a planned meeting in Moscow scheduled for 10 June 1988 between cardinals Agostino Casaroli and Johannes Willebrands and a Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church delegation headed by bishops Fylymon Kurchaba and Pavlo Vasylyk. On 17 September 1988, bishop Pavlo Vasylyk was invited to Moscow to take part in a roundtable discussion regarding the UGCC's situation in the Soviet Union. Additional discussants at the meeting also included four US senators and members of the USSR's Supreme Soviet (Parliament). Nevertheless, Soviet authorities in Moscow and Ukraine, who consistently denied the UGCC's existence, rejected the latest initiatives for the Church's legalization. The Soviet press secretary argued that legalization is an internal matter of the Russian Orthodox Church, which itself is against any changes to the status quo in Western Ukraine. Furthermore, the authorities declared that the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church is not a religious organization but rather a \\"strictly political,\\" \\"nationalist,\\" and \\"separatist\\" entity and therefore does not qualify for registration as a religious denomination. In addition, the Uniate Church continued to be viewed as a supporter of nationalist leaders in Ukraine and abroad. The Russian Orthodox Church ‚Äì whose official status began to improve considerably starting in 1987 ‚Äì was now beginning to voice its protest, both domestically and abroad, against the possible repeal of the Stalinist-era prohibition officially forbidding activities of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. In addition, Russian church hierarchs were displeased with the ever-increasing threat by the Uniate eparchies and parishes in Galicia and Transcarpathia to leave the Moscow Patriarchate to which they had been forcibly annexed. In the summer of 1988, the authorities initiated new repressive measures regarding \\"unsanctioned\\" public gatherings and demonstrations. Such actions, taken against the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic clergy and lay people, included substantial monetary fines and administrative penalties in the form short-term arrests. At the end of 1988, Soviet authorities reacted to the now continuous efforts for the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church by transferring more than 700 soon-to-be- reopened provincial Uniate churches to hastily organized Orthodox so-called \\"Twentiers\\" (Ukr. dvadtsiatky) primarily in locations where Greek-Catholics constituted a majority. According to a Soviet ordinance of that time, 20 religious faithful constituted a sufficient number of believers to secure registration as a religious community. On 7 February 1989, a UGCC delegation headed by bishop Pavlo Vasylyk departed for Moscow to engage in negotiations at which it demanded the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church's recognition by the USSR's central authorities. Expectations were high that the new legislation on the freedom of conscience, which was about to go into effect, would help pave the way for the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. However, in May 1989, Kyivan Metropolitan Filaret's actions at that time hindered such possibilities. During a press conference in Lviv ‚Äì in the presence of the head of the Council for Religious Affairs in Ukraine (M. Kolesnyk) ‚Äì the metropolitan announced that the new law did \\"not legitimize\\" the Uniates. Furthermore, the Orthodox hierarch suggested that Ukrainian Greek-Catholics should attend services at functioning Roman Catholic churches, while those who felt a close affinity to the Eastern Byzantine Rite should attend Orthodox churches. Finally, Metropolitan Filaret remarked that the legalization of the Uniate Church could provoke clashes between the Orthodox and Greek-Catholics. Intensification for the legalization of the UGCC In response to Metropolitan Filaret's assertion that the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church would never attain legal status, on 16 May 1989, 4 bishops and 10 priests of the UGCC submitted a formal appeal to General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. In their declaration, the church officials refuted 160 political accusations aimed at the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, voiced their support for Gorbachev's reforms and demanded the legalization of the UGCC. On 16 May 1989, prior to the congress of USSR deputies, another delegation arrived in Moscow composed of bishops Pavlo Vasylyk, Sofron Dmyterko, Fylymon Kurchaba and Rev. H. Simkailo, Rev. Volodymyr Viytyshyn, Rev. T. Senkiw (at present the apostolic administrator of the Stryi Eparchy) and Rev. Ihor Vozniak, as well as a number of religious faithful to meet with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. On 17 May, after government officials did not appear for a scheduled meeting with the delegation, the UGCC bishops and priests began a hunger strike which caught the attention of the international broadcasting media and also appeared on the first pages of the press. On 18 May, the delegation was met by a representative of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR who received another formal appeal intended for Mikhail Gorbachev. Following the delegation's departure from Moscow, various groups of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics took turns participating in hunger strikes over the course of the next 4 months in Moscow. Such hunger strikes occurred simultaneously with public prayer services and efforts to entice the Ukrainian delegates of the congress of people's deputies of the USSR, 4 of which, unsuccessfully, attempted to raise the issue of the legalization of the UGCC during the congress's sessions. The Moscow activities of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics received not only the recognition of the international community but also the support of Russian Orthodox dissidents and various democratic circles. However, the hunger strikers' most significant achievement occurred when the reforms-oriented newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti began to publish objective and favorable reports. It raised doubts about the official Soviet version regarding the \\"unification of the Uniates\\" and accused the Russian Orthodox Church of condoning the repressive Stalinist methods being used against supporters of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. The legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church posed a serious threat to the status of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Ukraine. As a result, the Moscow Patriarchate and Volodymyr Shcherbytsky's party apparatchiks took decisive measures to prevent legalization. In May‚ÄìJune 1989, the question of the Uniate Church caused a schism amongst the ranks of Soviet politicians, which in turn delayed the legislative passage of the long-awaited \\"Law on the Freedom of Conscience.\\" Furthermore, the issue of the UGCC also led to the replacement of K. Kharchev by Y. Khrystoradnov as head of the Council for Religious Affairs of the USSR. In addition, Y. Kashliev, as head of the delegation at the Vienna conference, stated that every religious denomination had the right to be registered. The discussion surrounding the UGCC ‚Äì which hitherto was considered an internal issue of the Russian Orthodox Church ‚Äì now became the responsibility of the state. Kashliev also underscored the fact that the Uniate question should be settled as quickly as possible. On 17 September 1989, according to official accounts, close to 100,000 UGCC supporters took part in an unprecedented demonstration in Lviv. Large demonstrations began to take place in other cities of Western Ukraine at this time as well. The movement for legalization, headed by Ivan Hel, was now being augmented by the Ukrainian urban intelligentsia which began organizing itself into various informal associations, including The Popular Movement of Ukraine for Restructuring. On 20 September 1989, Scherbytsky and Viktor Chebrykov were ousted from the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. One week later (28 September) Volodymyr Ivashko replaced Shcerbytsky as 1st Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Officials in favor of a more conservative line regarding the UGCC were no longer in the top positions of the Ukrainian Communist Party. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (18 October 1989) reflected the Central Committee's deepening indecisiveness regarding the future status of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. On the heels of the increasingly tense atmosphere, the parish of Sts. Peter and Paul of the Russian Orthodox Church in Lviv had announced its allegiance to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) on 19 August 1989. Two additional Lviv parishes soon followed suit and subsequently the same steps were taken by a few hundred parishes throughout Galicia. At first, the authorities placed administrative sanctions on the parishes but then cancelled such directives hoping to avoid confrontations with parishioners and the local RUKH affiliates, which had already managed to spread their influence on the UAOC. It cannot be ruled out that Soviet authorities considered the supporters of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church as the \\"lesser of two evils\\" when taking into account the Uniates. It is quite possible that Soviet government officials were hoping for an open conflict between the Uniates and supporters of Ukrainian Autocephaly which in turn would cause a division within the Ukrainian national movement. On 22 October 1989, bishop Ivan Bodnarchuk of the Russian Orthodox Church (a native Galician) ‚Äì who had very recently relinquished his episcopal duties in Zhytomyr ‚Äì accepted leadership of the Autocephalous Church in Ukraine. On 29 October, Ukrainian Greek-Catholics under the guidance of a young priest, Fr. Yaroslav Chukhniy, peacefully took over one of the largest ecclesiastical structures in Lviv, the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord. Until the transfer of St. George's Cathedral to the faithful of the UGCC in August 1990, the parish of the Transfiguration served as the spiritual centre of Ukrainian Greek-Catholicism in Galicia. On 26 November ‚Äì one week prior to Gorbachev's meeting with Pope John Paul II in Rome ‚Äì over 100,000 UGCC faithful took part in a demonstration demanding the return of St. George's Cathedral to the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics. Partial recognition of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church The Apostolic See consistently raised the issue of the rights of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics during its numerous negotiations with the Kremlin ‚Äì despite minimal reciprocity ‚Äì ever since Soviet-Vatican relations experienced a thaw beginning in the early 1960s. In June 1988, the Vatican once again expressed its desire for the UGCC's legalization when a delegation to Moscow headed by Cardinals Casaroli and Willebrands took part in the festivities commemorating the Millennium of the Baptism of Kyivan Rus'. Gorbachev replied to the pope's proposal only in August 1989. Official correspondence had been established between the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate on one side and the Apostolic See on the other side. Gorbachev maintained that it was both the Vatican's and the Moscow Patriarchate's obligation to reach a consensus regarding the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic question. Shortly afterwards, in a letter addressed to Pope John Paul II on 16 August 1989, Patriarch Pimen put forth a proposal which was unacceptable to the Vatican. In his missive, the Russian Orthodox hierarch recommended the de facto liquidation of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church by way of adjoining the Uniates who place the Eastern Rite above Catholic dogma ‚Äì to the Orthodox Church, and those Uniates who favor Catholicism ‚Äì to the Roman Catholic Church. Moscow based its strategy on the hope of benefiting from the disparity within the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in the form of its \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Roman\\" orientations. Furthermore, the Russian Orthodox Church banked on taking advantage of the decades-long discord between the Vatican and the UGCC's √©migr√© activists who were demanding the appointment of a separate patriarch for Ukrainian Greek-Catholics outside Ukraine. A potential settlement in the form of a compromise had been discussed when Archbishop Angelo Sodano (the Vatican's Secretary of State) visited Moscow on 19‚Äì21 October 1989, and met with M. Gorbachev, Soviet Foreign Affairs Minister Eduard Shevarnadze, and the head of the Council for Religious Affairs, Y. Khrystoradnov. As a result of the meeting, the Vatican was assured that the new law on the freedom of conscience and religious organizations in essence will legalize the UGCC. Nevertheless, the Soviet authorities insisted that specific aspects of the legalization process be coordinated between the Vatican, the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate based on the principles of genuine ecumenical dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox Churches. The pope's expectations for the legalization of the UGCC in the Soviet Union were once again put forward in his response to Patriarch Pimen's August letter which in turn was presented to the Holy Synod on 1 November 1989, by Cardinal Willebrands and his successor as head of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, Cardinal Edward Cassidy. The Moscow Patriarchate had agreed only on the legal right of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics to practice their faith. The issue of permitting the UGCC clergy to obtain actual pastoral appointments, and other unresolved questions were to be set aside for future negotiations between the Vatican and the Moscow Patriarchate. This position was presented to the Pope in the form of a letter from Patriarch Pimen, delivered to Rome by Metropolitan Yuvenaliy on 27 November. Mikhail Gorbachev's meeting with Pope John Paul II on 1 December 1989, marked a rapprochement between the Vatican and the Kremlin. The Roman Pontiff once again expressed his will for Roman Catholics and Greek-Catholics to have the possibility of freely practicing their faith, while Gorbachev assured John Paul II that the future law on freedom of conscience would provide religious freedom to everyone in the USSR. The meeting laid the foundation for establishing bilateral diplomatic relations, and the pope accepted Gorbachev's invitation to visit the Soviet Union. Realizing that the outright legalization of the Uniate Church would cause religious unrest in Western Ukraine and would lead to conflict with the Moscow Patriarchate, Gorbachev refused to delegate direct responsibility to the government regarding the settlement of the UGCC question. Instead, the Soviet leader decided that these issues should be settled according to the principles of ecumenical dialogue between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Vatican. On 1 December 1989, the Soviet news agency Novosti (News) and news services in Western Ukraine outlined the key points of \\"The Declaration of the Council for Religious Affairs Addressed to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian S.S.R.,\\" dated 20 November. The Lviv municipal press labeled the \\"Declaration\\" a de facto recognition of the long-banned Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. At the same time though, the Declaration asserted that Ukrainian Greek-Catholics will be able to enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the law on registration of associations in the Ukrainian S.S.R., as long as they [the UGCC faithful] uphold the principles of the Constitution of the Ukrainian S.S.R. and the latter's legislation on religious beliefs. All religious structures arbitrarily appropriated by the UGCC faithful were to be returned to local administrative authorities. The transfer of such property to religious communities would take place according to the will of the faithful themselves. If necessary, the \\"Declaration\\" called for holding local referendums to be monitored by independent observers, and cautioned against undue influence on the faithful, to guarantee an objective and unbiased vote. At the same time, the head of the Council for Religious Affairs of the Ukrainian S.S.R., M. P. Kolesnyk, underscored that the council had not considered the canonical status of the infrastructure and hierarchies of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Instead, it had only taken into account the rights of a \\"community of believers\\" to apply for state registration (recognition) and the possibility for the denationalization (privatization) of inactive church structures. Furthermore, there was no talk of returning ecclesiastical structures and property ‚Äì nationalized by the state ‚Äì to the UGCC, nor of annulling the Lviv pseudo-Sobor of 1946, nor of a formal rehabilitation of the Church or even any kind of compensation for losses incurred over the decades. In response to the promise for legalization, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics reappropriated their former churches from the Russian Orthodox Church. By January 1990, over 120 churches in Galicia had been returned to the UGCC. By the end of the month, this number had increased to 230 churches on the territory of the Lviv and Ternopil eparchies, and to 140 on the territory of the Ivano-Frankivsk eparchy. By June 1990, 803 churches had been returned to the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics in newly established (albeit for the most part unregistered) Uniate parishes in the Lviv eparchy, including approximately 500 churches in the Ivano-Frankivsk eparchy and 12 in Transcarpathia. Close to 370 Orthodox priests had converted to the UGCC in Galicia. This increased the overall quantity of Greek-Catholic priests to 767 (including 186 monks). In general, 1,592 Greek-Catholic parishes had been established and 1,303 churches were taken over in Galicia by early summer 1990. In addition, newly established seminaries accepted 485 students, while approximately 700 nuns were active in the Ukrainian Greek- Catholic Church throughout Western Ukraine. At the same time, close to 500 Orthodox parishes converted to the UAOC. The massive reappropriation by the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics of their former churches spurred a wave of protests on the part of the Moscow Patriarchate. Supporters of the Russian Orthodox Church accused the Uniates of illegally taking over churches, threatening the Orthodox faithful and persecuting the clergy. The change in the party and governmental leadership of the Ukrainian S.S.R. impacted the Russian Orthodox Church as well. In 1989, the leadership of the exarchate found it necessary to make a number of concessions regarding the Ukrainian language. In January 1990, the Ukrainian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church was retitled the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Shortly after June 1990, the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church expressed its concern regarding the liquidation of its Church for the benefit of the Uniates and the autocephalous \\"schismatics\\" in Western Ukraine. As a result, a special commission of the Holy Synod visited Ukraine, headed by the newly appointed Moscow Patriarch, Aleksei II. In response to the Declaration of the State Sovereignty of Ukraine on 16 July 1990, in October the Russian Orthodox Church bestowed the right for \\"self-government\\" to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which, nevertheless, was to remain an integral component of the Moscow Patriarchate. The creation of the UAOC ‚Äì although limited at that time to the territory of Galicia ‚Äì posed a much greater, long- term threat to the ROC than the revival of the UGCC, because the autocephalous church boasted supporters in traditional Orthodox territories of Eastern Ukraine. On 19 August 1990, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church received possession of the historic Cathedral of St. George in Lviv. In September 1990, 250 students began their studies at the archeparchial seminary in Rudno, while 47 seminarians initiated their studies at the seminary in Drohobych. In addition, approximately 300 students were attending improvised lectures on theology in Ivano-Frankivsk. Similarly, the Basilians opened a minor seminary for 70 students and a novitiate at their monastery in Krekhiv. In a state of increasing tension between the Orthodox and Ukrainian Greek-Catholics, a Vatican delegation once again met with its counterparts from the Moscow Patriarchate on 10 September 1990, in Moscow. These delegations, in turn, were soon joined by three Ukrainian Greek-Catholic bishops and their Orthodox counterparts. However, on 14 September, the Russian Orthodox delegates exited the negotiations after the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic delegation unanimously rejected the demands of the Orthodox to return the reappropriated Uniate churches in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk. Soon afterwards, the trilateral, inter- denominational Lviv regional commission fell apart when representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church resigned their positions in the negotiating body after accusing the local authorities of favoring the UGCC in the settlement of church property ownership. In the fall of 1990, the head of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, declared his intention to visit the faithful in Ukraine in the spring of 1991.

Co-written by Imran Gasimov, Hasan Seyidbeyli, directed by Tofig Taghizade, the film portrays the life of the legendary Azerbaijani guerrilla of the Second World War Mehdi Huseynzade, who fought the Nazi forces in the present-day Italy and Slovenia, hence the film\`s name On distant shores referring to the Adriatic Sea. Plot Mehdi Huseynzade a.k.a. Mihajlo is the most wanted guerrilla in Yugoslavia and Trieste. Disguised as a Wehrmacht officer, Mehdi plots and successfully performs a terror act in a restaurant full of German officers. However, he is wounded by a spy (Carranti) infiltrated in the guerrilla forces. While recovering Mehdi is out of operations for a while. He occasionally paints and daydreams of returning to his native Baku after the war. While the Germans increase the award for Mihajlo, he carries out another daring operation on getting food supply from a wealthy Italian businessman for partisans. Mihajlo usually plans and carries out his operations with his brother-in-arm Veselin and a young girl named Anzhelika. The three are parts of a love triangle at the same time. Veselin loves Anzhelika, while she has a crush on Mihajlo. The latter also has some feelings to Anzhelika, but concentrates his attention on operations. During the next operation Anzhelika is detained by the Germans, but she still manages to pass the necessary information to Mihajlo and Veselin. Thanks to the information, the two successfully accomplish the mission of exploding a movie theater and killing hundreds of German officers and escape from the chasing soldiers. While the Germans start a massive search of Mihajlo, he encounters with Major Schulz, who is suspicious and about to detain him. However, claiming to be a poor, half-German, half-French painter by name Auguste Kraus, Mihajlo demonstrates his painting skills by creating a Schulz portrait. Believing that he is a painter, not a guerrilla, Schulz has no choice, but let go of Mihajlo. But when leaving Schulz\`s office, Mihajlo meets Veselin, and the two draw attention of nearby German soldiers and get engaged in a combat. The friends still manage to escape but mortally wounded Veselin dies in Mihajlo\`s arms. Back in the guerrilla camp, Mihajlo receives another bad news: Anzhelika was also murdered. The revenge of outrageous Mihajlo turns to be costly for the Germans, as he explodes several hotels and facilities. Mihajlo then finds Carranti and kills him before he manages to escape with a suitcase of money. Chased by the German soldiers, Mihajlo arrives in the village of Veselin\`s father. The Germans led by Schulz also come to the village and demand the local population reveal Mihajlo\`s whereabouts. While the locals do not betray him, Mihajlo does not want to put their lives under risk either. He leaves the house of Veselin\`s father and appears in front of Schulz, who to his horror realizes Mihajlo and Kraus are the same person. Mihajlo manages to murder Schulz but gets shot by the German soldiers. Again daydreaming of returning Baku in his last breathe, Mihajlo falls down, but the activated bomb on him explodes and kills the approaching soldiers.

The tallest of the flying birds, standing at a height up to , they are a conspicuous species of open wetlands in south Asia, seasonally flooded Dipterocarp forests in Southeast Asia, and Eucalyptus-dominated woodlands and grasslands in Australia. The sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by the overall grey colour and the contrasting red head and upper neck. They forage on marshes and shallow wetlands for roots, tubers, insects, crustaceans, and small vertebrate prey. Like other cranes, they form long- lasting pair bonds and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship displays that include loud trumpeting, leaps, and dance-like movements. In India, they are considered symbols of marital fidelity, believed to mate for life and pine the loss of their mates even to the point of starving to death. The main breeding season is during the rainy season, when the pair builds an enormous nest \\"island\\", a circular platform of reeds and grasses nearly 2 m in diameter and high enough to stay above the shallow water surrounding it. Increased agricultural intensity is often thought to have led to declines in sarus crane numbers but they also benefit from wetland crops and the construction of canals and reservoirs. The stronghold of the species is in India, where it is traditionally revered and lives in agricultural lands in close proximity to humans. Elsewhere, the species has been extirpated in many parts of its former range.  Description  In flight, the black primaries contrast with the otherwise grey wings (Bharatpur, India) The adult sarus crane is very large with grey wings and body, a bare red head and part of the upper neck; a greyish crown, and a long greenish-grey pointed bill. In flight, the long neck is held straight, unlike that of a heron, which folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long, pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, orange-red irises, and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a yellowish base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered. The bare red skin of the adult's head and neck is brighter during the breeding season. This skin is rough and covered by papillae, and a narrow area around and behind the head is covered by black bristly feathers. The sexes do not differ in plumage, although males are on average larger than females; males of the Indian population can attain a maximum height around , making them the world's tallest extant flying bird. The weight of nominate race individuals is , while five adult A. a. sharpii averaged . Across the distribution range, the weight can vary from , height typically from , and wingspan from . While individuals from northern populations are among the heaviest cranes, alongside the red- crowned and wattled cranes, and the largest in their range, birds from Australia tend to be smaller. In Australia, the sarus can easily be mistaken for the more widespread brolga. The brolga has the red colouring confined to the head and not extending into the neck. Body mass in Australian sarus cranes was found to average in males and in females, with a range for both sexes of . Thus, Australian sarus cranes average about 25% lighter than the northern counterparts and are marginally lighter on average than brolgas. Distribution and habitat The species has historically been widely distributed on the lowlands of India along the Gangetic plains, extending south to the Godavari River, west to coastal Gujarat, the Tharparkar District of Pakistan, and east to West Bengal and Assam. The species no longer breeds in Punjab, though it winters regularly in the state. Sarus cranes are rare in West Bengal and Assam, and are no longer found in the state of Bihar. In Nepal, its distribution is restricted to the western and central lowland plains, with most of the population occurring in Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, and Nawalparasi districts. Two distinct populations of sarus cranes occur in Southeast Asia: the northern population in China and Myanmar, and the southern population in Cambodia and Vietnam. The sarus used to extend to Thailand and further east into the Philippines, but may now be extinct in both these countries. In 2011, 24 captive-bred cranes raised from five founders were reintroduced into Thailand. A reasonably sized population of over 150 cranes has recently been discovered breeding in rice fields in the Ayeyarwadi delta, Myanmar with additional cranes confirmed in the states of Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine. In Australia they are found only in the north-east, and are partly migratory in some areas. The global range has shrunk and the largest occupied area, and the largest known population, is in India. Increasing paddy fields accompanied by an increase in the network of irrigation canals during and prior to the Green Revolution may have facilitated increases in the distribution and numbers of sarus cranes due to an increase in reliable moisture levels in various locations in India. Although now found mainly at a low elevation on the plains, some historical records exist from highland marshes further north in Harkit Sar and Kahag in Kashmir. The sarus crane breeds in some high elevation regions such as near the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, where populations may be growing in response to increasing rice cultivation along the reservoir. In rice-dominated districts of Uttar Pradesh, sarus crane abundance (estimated as occupancy) was highest in the western districts, intermediate in the central districts, and minimal in the eastern districts. Sarus crane abundance was positively associated with percentage of wetlands on the landscape, and negatively with the percentage of area under rice cultivation. Until recently, little was known of sarus crane ecology from Australia. Breeding records (confirmed sightings of nests with eggs, or of adult birds with flightless young) were known from only three locations, all in the Gulf Plains in Queensland. Two records are from near Normanton town: one of adults with flightless chicks seen about 30 km west of the town and another of adults incubating eggs seen 7-km south of the town. The third record is a one-month study that provides details of 32 nests located within 10-km around Morr Morr cattle station in the Gilbert River floodplains. A 3,000-km survey along the Gulf of Carpentaria located 141 territorial, breeding pairs spread out across the floodplains of the Mitchell, Gilbert, and Flinders Rivers. Carefully mapping of breeding areas of sarus cranes in Australia is needed to understand their distribution range. They are uncommon in Kakadu National Park, where the species is often hard to find among the more numerous brolgas. Flocks in the non-breeding season are commonly seen in the Atherton Tablelands in eastern Queensland. In India, sarus cranes preferentially use wetlands for nesting, but also nest in uncultivated patches amid flooded rice paddies (called khet-taavadi in Gujarat), and in the rice paddies especially when wetlands are not available to breeding pairs. Breeding pairs are territorial and prefer to forage in natural wetlands, though wetland crops like rice and wheat are also frequented. In south-western Uttar Pradesh, sarus cranes were found in wetlands of all sizes with larger numbers in larger wetlands. In Australia, wintering, non-breeding sarus cranes forage in areas with intensive agriculture (primarily maize, sugarcane, groundnuts) and smaller patches of cattle grazing areas in the Atherton Tablelands in eastern Queensland. They were observed to feed on grain, nuts, and insects from a range of crop fields, including stubble of maize and peanut crops, hay crops, fields with potato, legumes and seed crops, and after harvest in fields of sugarcane, grass, and fodder crops. Territorial, breeding sarus crane pairs in northern Queensland along the Gulf of Carpentaria use a range of habitats, but preferentially use low, open woodland on quaternary alluvial plains in outer river deltas and levees with a vegetation of Lysiphyllum cunninghamii, Eucalyptus microtheca, Corymbia confertiflora, Melaleuca spp., Excoecaria parvifolia, Atalaya hemiglauca, Grevillea striata, Eucalyptus leptophleba, C. polycarpa, C. confertiflora, and C. bella. Taxonomy and systematics All cranes have a raised and much reduced hind toe. This species was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae and placed it in the genus Ardea that included the larger herons. Edward Blyth published a monograph on the cranes in 1881, in which he considered the \\"sarus crane\\" of India to be made up of two species, Grus collaris and Grus antigone. Most modern authors recognize one species with three disjunct populations that are sometimes treated as subspecies, although the status of one extinct population from the Philippines is uncertain. The sarus cranes in India (referred to as A. a. antigone) are the largest, and in the east from Myanmar is replaced by a population that extends into Southeast Asia (referred to as A. a. sharpii). The sarus cranes from the Indian subcontinent are well marked and differentiated from the south-eastern population by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary remiges. The population in Australia (initially placed in A. a. sharpii (sometimes spelt sharpei but amended to conform to the rules of Latin grammar) was separated and named as the race A. a. gilliae, sometimes spelt gillae or even gilli), prior to a genetic analysis. A 2005 genetic analysis suggested that these three populations are representatives of a formerly continuous population that varied clinally. The Australian subspecies was designated only in 1988, with the species itself first noticed in Australia in 1966 and regarded as a recent immigrant. Native Australians, however, differentiated the sarus and the brolga and called the sarus \\"the crane that dips its head in blood\\". Sarus cranes of the Australian population are similar to those in Southeast Asia in having no white on the neck and tertiary remiges, but are distinguished by a larger grey patch of ear coverts. The Australian population shows the most recent divergence from the ancestral form with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within Australia. An additional subspecies A. a. luzonica was suggested for the population once found, but now extinct, in the Philippines. No distinctive character is known of this population. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, from a limited number of specimens, suggested that gene flow occurred within the continental Asian populations until the 20th-century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses on a large and widely distributed set of individuals in the sample. This study further suggests that the Australian population shows low genetic variability. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species. The sarus crane was formerly placed in the genus Grus, but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, four species, including the sarus crane, were placed in the resurrected genus Antigone that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853. =Etymology= The common name sarus is from the Hindi name (sƒÅras) for the species. The Hindi word is derived from the Sanskrit word sarasa for the \\"lake bird\\", (sometimes corrupted to sƒÅrhans). While Indians held the species in veneration, British soldiers in colonial India hunted the bird, calling it the serious or even cyrus. The generic and specific names ‚Äîafter Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, who hanged herself‚Äîmay relate to the bare skin of the head and neck.  Ecology and behaviour  Bharatpur) Unlike many other cranes that make long migrations, sarus cranes are largely nonmigratory and few populations make relative short-distance migrations. In South Asia, four distinct population-level behaviours have been noted. The first is the \\"wintering population\\" of a small number of sarus cranes that use wetlands in the state of Punjab during winters. The source of this population is unclear, but is very likely to be from the growing population in Himachal Pradesh. The second is the \\"expanding population\\" consisting of cranes appearing in new areas following new irrigation structures in semi-arid and arid areas primarily in Gujarat and Rajasthan. The third is the \\"seasonally migratory\\" population, also primarily in the arid zone of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cranes from this population aggregates in remaining wetlands and reservoirs during the dry summer, and breeding pairs set up territories during the rainy season (July ‚Äì October) remaining on territories throughout the winter (November ‚Äì March). The fourth population is \\"perennially resident\\" and found in areas such as southwestern Uttar Pradesh, where artificial and natural water sources enable cranes to stay in the same location throughout the year. Migratory populations are also known from Southeast Asia and Australia. In Southeast Asia, cranes congregate in few remnant wetlands during the dry season. In Australia, flocks aggregate on the Atherton Highlands, where agriculture is conducive for sarus cranes. File:Sarus_Dance_02.jpgBowing display File:Sarus_dance_03.jpg File:Sarus_Call_04.jpgLeap File:Sarus_Call_01.jpgUnison calling Breeding pairs maintain territories that are defended from other cranes using a large repertoire of calls and displays. In Uttar Pradesh, less than a tenth of the breeding pairs maintain territories at wetlands while the rest of the pairs are scattered in smaller wetlands and agricultural fields. Non-breeding birds form flocks that vary from 1‚Äì430 birds. In semi-arid areas, breeding pairs and successfully fledged juveniles depart from territories in the dry season and join non-breeding flocks. In areas with perennial water supply, as in the western plains of Uttar Pradesh, breeding pairs maintain perennial territories. The largest known flocks are from the 29 km2 Keoladeo National Park ‚Äì with as many as 430 birds, and from unprotected, community-owned wetlands in Etawah, Mainpuri, Etah and Kasganj districts in Uttar Pradesh, ranging from 245‚Äì412 birds. Flocks of over 100 birds are also reported from Gujarat in India and Australia. Sarus crane populations in Keoladeo National Park have been noted to drop from over 400 birds in summer to just 20 birds during the monsoon. In areas with perennial wetlands on the landscape such as in western Uttar Pradesh, numbers of non-breeding sarus cranes in flocks can be relatively stable throughout the year. In Etawah, Mainpuri, Etah and Kasganj districts, non-breeding sarus cranes form up to 65% of the regional population. Breeding pairs in Australia similarly defend territories from neighbouring crane pairs, and nonbreeding birds are found in flocks frequently mixed with brolgas. In their breeding grounds in north-eastern Australia, non-breeding sarus cranes constitute less than 25% of the population in some years. They roost in shallow water, where they may be safe from some ground predators. Adult birds do not moult their feathers annually but feathers are replaced about once every two to three years. = Feeding = feeding juvenile, Lumbini, Nepal Sarus cranes forage in shallow water (usually with less than depth of water) or in fields, frequently probing in mud with their long bills. In the dry season (after breeding), sarus cranes in Anlung Pring Sarus Crane Conservation Area, Cambodia, used wetlands with 8‚Äì10 cm of water. They are omnivorous, eating insects (especially grasshoppers), aquatic plants, fish (perhaps only in captivity), frogs, crustaceans, and seeds. Occasionally tackling larger vertebrate prey such as water snakes (Fowlea piscator), sarus cranes may in rare cases feed on the eggs of birds and turtles. Plant matter eaten includes tubers, corms of aquatic plants, grass shoots as well as seeds and grains from cultivated crops such as groundnuts and cereal crops such as rice. In the dry season, cranes flocking in Southeast Asian wetlands are in areas with an abundance of Eleocharis dulcis and E. spiralis, both of which produce tubers on whicn the cranes are known to feed. In their breeding grounds in north- eastern Australia, isotopic analyses on molted feathers revealed sarus crane diets to comprise a great diversity of vegetation, and restricted to a narrow range of trophic levels. = Courtship and breeding = The long, coiled trachea that produces the trumpeting calls A trumpeting pair Sarus cranes have loud, trumpeting calls. These calls are, as in other cranes, produced by the elongated trachea that form coils within the sternal region. Pairs may indulge in spectacular displays of calling in unison and posturing. These include \\"dancing\\" movements that are performed both during and outside the breeding season and involve a short series of jumping and bowing movements made as one of the pair circles around the other. Dancing may also be a displacement activity, when the nest or young is threatened. The cranes breed mainly during the monsoons in India (from July to October, although a second brood may occur), and breeding has been recorded in all the months. They build large nests, platforms made of reeds and vegetation in wet marshes or paddy fields. The nest is constructed within shallow water by piling up rushes, straw, grasses with their roots, and mud so that the platform rises above the level of the water to form a little island. The nest is unconcealed and conspicuous, being visible from afar, and defended fiercely by the pair. Data collated over a century from South Asia show sarus cranes nesting throughout the year. More focused observations, however, show nesting patterns to be closely tied to rainfall patterns. An exception to this rule was the unseasonal nesting observed in the artificially flooded Keoladeo-Ghana National Park, and in marshes created by irrigation canals in Kota district of Rajasthan, India. Based on these observations, unseasonal nesting (or nesting outside of the monsoon) of sarus cranes were thought to be due to either the presence of two populations, some pairs raising a second brood, and unsuccessful breeding by some pairs in the normal monsoon season, prompting them to nest again when conditions such as flooded marshes remain. A comprehensive assessment of unseasonal nesting based on collation of over 5,000 breeding records, however, showed that unseasonal nesting by sarus cranes in south Asia was very rare and was only carried out by pairs that did not succeed in raising chicks in the normal nesting season. Unseasonal nests were initiated in years with unusual rainfall patterns, when rainfall extended beyond the normal June‚ÄìOctober period, and when rainfall volume was higher than normal; or when artificial wet habitats were created by man-made structures such as reservoirs and irrigation canals to enhance crop production. Nest initiation in northern Queensland is also closely tied to rainfall patterns, with most nests being initiated immediately after the first major rains. Egg, Mus√©um de Toulouse The nests can be more than 2 m (6 ft) in diameter and nearly 1 m (3 ft) high. Pairs show high fidelity to the nest site, often refurbishing and reusing a nest for as many as five breeding seasons. The clutch is one or two eggs (rarely three or four) which are incubated by both sexes for about 31 days (range 26‚Äì35 days). Eggs are chalky white and weigh about 240 grams. When disturbed from the nest, parents may sometimes attempt to conceal the eggs by attempting to cover them with material from the edge of the nest. The eggshells are removed by the parents after the chicks hatch either by carrying away the fragments or by swallowing them. About 30% of all breeding pairs succeed in raising chicks in any year, and most of the successful pairs raise one or two chicks each, with brood sizes of three being rare. One survey in Australia found 60% of breeding pairs to have successfully fledged chicks. This high success rate is attributed to above-normal rainfall that year. The chicks are fed by the parents for the first few days, but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food. When alarmed, the parent cranes use a low korr-rr call that signals chicks to freeze and lie still. Young birds stay with their parents until the subsequent breeding season. In captivity, birds breed only after their fifth year. The sarus crane is widely believed to pair for life, but cases of \\"divorce\\" and mate replacement have been recorded. = Mortality factors = Velavadar Eggs are often destroyed at the nest by jungle (Corvus macrorhynchos) and house crows (C. splendens) in India. In Australia, suspected predators of young birds include the dingo (Canis dingo) and fox (Vulpes vulpes), while brahminy kites (Haliastur indus) have been known to take eggs. Removal of eggs by farmers (to reduce crop damage) or children (in play), or by migrant labourers for food or opportunistic egg collection during trips to collect forest resources are prominent causes of egg mortality. Between 31 and 100% of nests with eggs can fail to hatch eggs for these reasons. Chicks are also prone to predation (estimated at about 8%) and collection at the nest, but more than 30% die of unknown reasons. Breeding success (percentage of eggs hatching and surviving to fledging stage) has been estimated at about 20% in Gujarat and 51‚Äì58% in south-western Uttar Pradesh. In areas where farmers are tolerant, nests in flooded rice fields and those in wetlands have similar rates of survival. Pairs that nest later in the season have a lower chance of raising chicks successfully, but this improves when territories have more wetlands. Nest success (percentage of nests in which at least one egg hatched) for 96 sarus nests that were protected by locals during 2009‚Äì2011 via a payment-for- conservation program was 87%. More pairs are able to raise chicks in years with higher total rainfall, and when territory quality was undisturbed due to increased farming or development. Permanent removal of pairs from the population due to developmental activities caused reduced population viability, and was a far more important factor impacting breeding success relative to total annual rainfall. Breeding success in Australia has been estimated by counting the proportion of young-of-the-year in wintering flocks in the crop fields of Atherton Tablelands in north-eastern Queensland. Young birds constituted 5.32% to 7.36% of the wintering population between 1997 and 2002. It is not known if this variation represents annual differences in conditions in the breeding areas or if it included biases such as different proportions of breeding pairs traveling to Atherton to over-winter. It is also not known how these proportions equate to more standard metrics of breeding success such as proportions of breeding pairs succeeding in raising young birds. One multi-floodplain survey in Australia found 60% of all breeding pairs to have raised at least one chick, with 34% of successful pairs fledging two chicks each. Breeding success, and proportions of pairs that raised two chicks each, was similar in each floodplain.Age and plumage changesLittle is known about the diseases and parasites of the sarus crane, and their effects on wild bird populations. A study conducted at the Rome zoo noted that these birds were resistant to anthrax. Endoparasites that have been described include a trematode, Opisthorhis dendriticus from the liver of a captive crane at the London zoo and a Cyclocoelid (Allopyge antigones) from an Australian bird. Like most birds, they have bird lice and the species recorded include Heleonomus laveryi and Esthiopterum indicum. In captivity, sarus cranes have been known to live for as long as 42 years.Flower (1938) notes only 26 years in captivity Premature adult mortality is often the result of human actions. Accidental poisoning by monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos and dieldrin-treated seeds used in agricultural areas has been noted. Adults have been known to fly into power lines and die of electrocution, this is responsible for killing about 1% of the local population each year.  Conservation status  Two adults with a subadult in the middle There were about an estimated 15‚Äì20,000 mature sarus cranes left in the wild in 2009. The Indian population is less than 10,000, but of the three subspecies, is the healthiest in terms of numbers. They are considered sacred and the birds are traditionally left unharmed, and in many areas they are unafraid of humans. They used to be found on occasion in Pakistan, but have not been seen there since the late 1980s. The population in India has however declined. Estimates of the global population suggest that the population in 2000 was at best about 10% and at the worst just 2.5% of the numbers that existed in 1850. Many farmers in India believe that these cranes damage standing crops, particularly rice, although studies show that direct feeding on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to less than one percent and trampling could account for grain loss of about . The attitude of farmers tends to be positive in spite of these damages, and this has helped in conserving the species within agricultural areas. The role of rice paddies and associated irrigation structures may be particularly important for the birds' conservation, since natural wetlands are increasingly threatened by human activity. The conversion of wetlands to farmland, and farmland to more urban uses are major causes for habitat loss and long-term population decline. Compensating farmers for crop losses has been suggested as a measure that may help, but needs to be implemented judiciously so as not to corrupt and remove existing local traditions of tolerance. Farmers in sarus crane wintering areas in Australia are beginning to use efficient methods to harvest crops, which may lead to lowered food availability. Farmers are also transitioning from field crops to perennial and tree crops that have higher returns. This may reduce available foraging habitat for cranes, and may increase conflict with farmers in the remaining, few crop fields. A review of literature and assessment of abundance of sarus cranes in Nepal suggests that past field methods were either inadequate or incomplete to properly estimate abundances, and that the population of cranes in Nepal may be on the increase. The Australian population is greater than 5,000 birds and may be increasing, however, the Southeast Asian population has been decimated by war and habitat change (such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and draining of wetlands), and by the mid-20th century, had disappeared from large parts of its range which once stretched up to southern China. Some 1500‚Äì2000 birds are left in several fragmented subpopulations, though recent surveys in Myanmar have discovered previously-unknown breeding populations in several locations. Payment to locals to guard nests and help increase breeding success has been attempted in northern Cambodia. Nest success of protected nests was significantly higher than that of unprotected nests, and positive population- level impacts were apparent. However, the program also caused local jealousies leading to deliberate disturbance of nests, and did nothing to alleviate larger-scale and more permanent threats due to habitat losses leading to the conclusion that such payment-for-conservation programs are at best a short- term complement, and not a substitute, to more permanent interventions that include habitat preservation. The little-known Philippine population became extinct in the late- 1960s. The sarus crane is classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Threats include habitat destruction and/or degradation, hunting and collecting, as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species. The effects of inbreeding in the Australian population, once thought to be a significant threat due to hybridization with brolgas producing hybrid birds called \\"sarolgas\\", is now confirmed to be minimal suggesting that it is not a major threat. New plans for developing the floodplain areas of northern Queensland may have detrimental impacts on breeding sarus crane populations, and require to incorporate the needs of cranes via conservation of a diversity of habitats that are currently found in the region. The species has been extirpated in Malaysia and the Philippines. Reintroduction programs in Thailand have made use of birds from Cambodia. , attempts to reintroduce the birds to eastern Thailand have shown some promise.  In culture  The Floating Feather: a painting by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1680) of the birds in the menagerie of William III of England at the Het Loo Palace showing a sarus crane in the background. The species is venerated in India and legend has it that the poet Valmiki cursed a hunter for killing a sarus crane and was then inspired to write the epic Ramayana. The species was a close contender to the Indian peafowl as the national bird of India. Among the Gondi people, the tribes classified as \\"five-god worshippers\\" consider the sarus crane as sacred. The meat of the sarus was considered taboo in ancient Hindu scriptures. It is widely believed that the sarus pairs for life and that death of one partner leads to the other pining to death. They are a symbol of marital virtue and in parts of Gujarat, it is a custom to take a newly wed couple to see a pair of sarus cranes. A plate by Johann Michael Seligmann published between 1749 and 1776 based on a work by George Edwards Although venerated and protected by Indians, these birds were hunted during the colonial period. It was noted that killing a bird would lead to its surviving partner trumpeting for many days and it was traditionally believed that the other would starve to death. Even sport hunting guides discouraged shooting these birds. According to 19th-century British zoologist Thomas C. Jerdon, young birds were good to eat, while older ones were \\"worthless for the table\\". Eggs of the sarus crane are however used in folk remedies in some parts of India. Young birds were often captured and kept in menageries both in India and in Europe in former times. They were also successfully bred in captivity early in the 17th century by Emperor Jehangir, who also noted that the eggs were laid with an interval of two days and that incubation period was 34 days. They were also bred in zoos in Europe and the United States in the early 1930s. The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has declared the sarus crane as its official state bird. An Indian 14-seater propeller aircraft, the Saras, is named after this crane. Notes  References  Other sources * Matthiessen, Peter & Bateman, Robert (2001). The Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes.

Altenhus Fortress was intended to prevent Swedish incursions into the area, and secure the rich salmon fisheries for the Dano-Norwegian state. The structure only remained in military use for three years, before being abandoned and used as a prison until 1692, when the timber of the fortress' blockhouse was used in the construction of a church. Background Due to the ongoing struggles between Denmark-Norway and the Swedish Empire in the early 1600s, the Dano-Norwegian king, Christian IV wanted to secure the western areas of the border-less far northern region of Finnmark against Swedish incursions. By building a fortress on the island of √Ör√∏ya in the Altafjord, the rich salmon fisheries of the Alta River could also be protected. Christian IV had a strong interest in the Finnmark region, having personally led a naval expedition along the coast of Norway, as far as the then-disputed Kola Peninsula in present-day Russia. The king had also ordered the refurbishment of the old Vard√∏hus Fortress in eastern Finnmark.Andersen 1997, p. 24 Christian IV of Denmark-Norway ordered the construction of Altenhus Fortress By 1610, officials representing the Dano-Norwegian and Swedish empires had struggled for several years over who would tax the indigenous Sami people living in the Alta area of Finnmark, and who would control the rich salmon fisheries of the Alta River. The Dano- Norwegian governor of Finnmark had had built in the 1560s a Goahti (earthen hut) near the river to house one of his bailiffs during the salmon season. From 1605 onwards Charles IX of Sweden laid claim on equal taxation rights on the salmon fisheries in the Alta River as that of the Dano-Norwegian king, and from 1606 competing Dano-Norwegian and Swedish tax collectors demanded taxes and, in the case of the Swedes, labour from the Samis fishing in the river.Nielsen 1990, pp. 84-89 The conflict came to a violent confrontation in 1607, the Swedes being driven away by Norwegian fishermen. Further Swedish attempts at gaining a foothold near the river lead to further clashes in 1609, and in 1610 the Swedes made an unsuccessful attempt at bringing troops to Alta, intending to build a fortification there.Nielsen 1990, pp. 89-95 In response to the repeated Swedish incursions on territory claimed by Denmark- Norway in the north of Norway, and in order to secure the salmon fisheries in the Alta River, King Christian IV on 17 August 1610 ordered Governor Claus Gagge to build a fortification near Alta River.Nielsen 1990, pp. 97-98 Construction During the 1609 clashes, the Norwegians had captured and dismantled a church built by the Swedes in Alta. The timber from the church, some 10 ells in length, was employed when the construction of Altenhus Fortress began in 1610. The completion of the construction of the fortification, at various times called both Kongshus and Altenhus Fortress, by 14 labourers began in early May 1611 and lasted until mid-August of that year. Carpenters and other construction workers had to be brought in from Helgeland further south in Norway, as none could be found in Finnmark.Nielsen 1990, pp. 98-99Pettersen 1988, p. 95 The finished fortification was an enclosed two- storey cross-shaped blockhouse, with sides about long. The blockhouse had loopholes for observation and defensive firing. Earthen ramparts surrounded the blockhouse on three sides, with the fourth, eastern, side covered by a wooden palisade facing the sea.Nielsen 1990, p. 101 The ramparts were some high and long.Dahl 1948, p. 55 The construction of the fortress on √Ör√∏ya, led to a comparatively considerable immigration of Norwegians to the area, many arriving as carpenters and soldiers.Nielsen 1990, p. 107 Service as a fortress Altenhus Fortress on √Ör√∏ya was located midway in the Altafjord, enabling the structure to control shipping in the fjord. The fortress could also prevent intrusions from a northerly or southerly direction. Swedish spies described the fortification as \\"hard to bypass\\". To further increase the Dano- Norwegian control of the Altafjord, a gun-armed galley was based at the fortress.Nielsen 1990, pp. 101-102 The garrison manning Altenhus had two horses, which were probably the first horses in Alta.Nielsen 1990, p. 372 The garrison was commanded by a Thomas K√∏ningham (surname alternatively spelled Coningham or Cunningham). After the completion of the fortification, the Sami people in the area began calling the island on which Altenhus was located Latnesuolu, meaning \\"Fortress island\\". The Sami population of √Ör√∏ya had by 1613 disappeared, possibly by being forcibly moved by the Dano-Norwegian authorities.Nielsen 1990, p. 109 The fortress was abandoned after the end of the 1611-13 Kalmar War, when the Swedes abandoned their claims on the coastal areas between Tysfjord and Varanger, leaving the Altenhus without a purpose as a fortification.Nielsen 1990, p. 103 Use as a prison Following the abandonment of Altenhus as a fortress, the structure was employed as a prison. Arrested individuals were kept in the blockhouse until they could be brought before the ting at Hasv√•g on the island of S√∏r√∏ya. Despite the continued occasional use as a prison, the former fortress fell into decay and contained almost nothing in the way of furniture or goods.Nielsen 1990, pp. 127-128Nielsen 1990, p. 110 Amongst the people imprisoned at Altenhus were two Sami men accused in 1624 of theft of silver. The two accused argued that they had only come into possession of stolen goods after they had killed another Sami, Sarfe Finn, whom they claimed had been plotting a rebellion against the Dano-Norwegian authorities by planning to kill a number of notable Norwegians on √Ör√∏ya, and at Hammerfest, Hasv√•g and S√∏rv√¶r. The accused were sentenced to death for theft. During the decades that followed the abandonment of Altenhus as a fortress, it was at times debated what should be done with the structure. In 1690, the population of Talvik requested the use of the timber of the blockhouse at Altenhus for the construction of a church, so the local people would no longer have to travel to Hasv√•g for church services. Permission was granted, and in 1692-1694, the timber of the fortress was employed in the building of a church on √Ör√∏ya.Nielsen 1990, p. 164 Remains View of the island of √Ör√∏ya from the west in 2011 As of the early 2000s, there are still visible remains of the fortress on √Ör√∏ya. Of the blockhouse traces of both the foundation walls and the cellar remain.Andersen 1978, p. 6 The ramparts from the fortress are the oldest existent remains relating to the Dano-Norwegian efforts at gaining control of Finnmark, and as such have been declared as protected by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.Nielsen 1990, p. 102 References =Citations= =Bibliography= * (Access for Norwegian IPs) * * (Access for Norwegian IPs) * (Access for Norwegian IPs) * (Access for Norwegian IPs) Category:Alta, Norway Category:1613 disestablishments in Europe Category:1610 establishments in Norway Category:Military installations in Troms og Finnmark Category:Forts in Norway Category:Prisons in Norway Category:Protected areas of Troms og Finnmark Category:Kalmar War ","title":"Altenhus Fortress"},{"id":"42780730","text":"Zhang Xueliang The Former Residence of Zhang Xueliang () is a museum about Zhang Xueliang in Wufeng Township, Hsinchu County, Taiwan.

Chiang was unwilling to cooperate with the Communist Party of China to defend China against the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. On December 1936, in the event called the Xi'an Incident, Zhang took Chiang as hostage and demanded that he stop the civil war with the Communist Party and unite to fight against the Japanese. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Chiang imprisoned Zhang due to the incident and sent him to Taiwan under house arrest in Wufeng Township, Hsinchu County from 1946 to 1957. Zhang left Taiwan in 1993 to visit his relatives in the United States. In 1995, Zhang and wife settled in Hawaii until his death on 14 October 2001 at the age of 100. In the Chinese way of counting, his age was 101. The house where he was kept under house arrest was damaged due to a landslide in 1963.

A film adaptation was released in 1952. Plot summary Kees Popinga, a quiet, respectable Dutchman working as head clerk in Groningen becomes increasingly unhinged after discovering that his cynical employer has looted and ruined his firm and confides in him that he will fake a suicide in order to escape punishment. Accepting a large sum of money from his erstwhile employer, Popinga sets out for Amsterdam, hoping to ingratiate himself with his employer's mistress, Pamela: but she mockingly laughs in his face, infuriating him. Popinga assaults her and accidentally kills her. He then hurriedly leaves town, eventually making his way to Paris. There, every day, he buys the various newspapers which carry the story of the murder. Although Chief Inspector Lucas of the Police Judiciare confidently predicts that Popinga will be arrested at any moment, Popinga successfully evades them. He begins sending letters to the police and to the newspapers, playing a sort of cat and mouse game. Soon the man becomes more and more delusional, seeing himself as a master criminal and certain that the woman he has become involved with, a prostitute named Jeanne Rozier, is genuinely interested in him, rather than in her pimp/boyfriend, Louis. For a time, Popinga joins Louis's gang of car thieves and hides out with them. But his reputation as a dangerous murderer wanted by the French police, frightens them, and he takes off on his own. He wanders the streets of Paris and its outskirts, staying in cheap hotels with prostitutes by night, until a pickpocket steals his wallet containing all the money he has left. Just as he is attempting suicide, he is captured by the French police The French authorities send him back to Holland where he is put in a mental institution. Film adaptation The book was adapted for the screen in 1952 as The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, starring Claude Rains and M√§rta Tor√©n and directed by Harold French. The story was changed to make Kees Popinga into a more sympathetic character.

Produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films and directed by R Hu, this black-and-white film stars Raden Soekarno, Ratna Djoewita, Oedjang, and Soehaena. The story, written by Djojopranoto, follows two young men who compete for the affections of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Filmed in September and October 1941, Soeara Berbisa features keroncong music and was shot partly in western Java. It was released to coincide with the Eid al-Fitr holiday and rated for all ages. Advertisements emphasised the film's appeal to both native and Dutch audiences, and a review in De Indische Courant was positive. Although the film‚ÄîUnion's penultimate production‚Äîwas screened as late as 1949, it is now likely lost. Plot A young athlete named Mitra and his sweetheart Neng Mardinah are to be wed. However, a young man named Mardjohan has fallen in love with Mardinah, and to win her heart he spreads rumours about Mitra being the son of a convicted criminal. In the backlash over the rumours, Mitra abandons the city and his beloved, hoping to find peace in the countryside. There, Mitra finds work at a factory which is, coincidentally, owned by Mardjohan. Refusing the romantic advances of a worker there, he leaves the factory. One day, he comes across Mardjohan, gravely injured following an accident. Mitra saves the man, then takes him for treatment. Mardjohan's mother, seeing Mitra, believes that he is her son who went missing when he was aged three. She finds several witnesses who testify to the resemblance and is ultimately able to prove her suspicions. Meanwhile, Mitra's name is cleared, and he is reunited with Mardinah. Production The sixth production of Union Films, Soeara Berbisa was produced by Ang Hock Liem and directed by R Hu, an ethnic Chinese director who had worked for the company since 1940; the sound technician Boen Kin Nam served as assistant director. The screenplay was written by Djojopranoto, who replaced Union's former screenwriter Saeroen after he left for rival company Star Film following the completion of Wanita dan Satria (1941).; The film began production by September 1941, and by October it was nearly complete. Soeara Berbisa stars Raden Soekarno and Ratna Djoewita and features the actors Oedjang and Soehaena. Soekarno and Soehana were new hires, whereas Oedjang and Djoewita had previously done work for Union. Oedjang had been acting for Union since its first production, Kedok Ketawa, in 1940, and Djoewita had a role in Wanita dan Satria.; This black- and-white film includes several keroncong songs and was partly shot in the Preanger region of west Java. Release and reception Union announced that Soeara Berbisa would be released to coincide with the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which began on 22 October 1941, and advertisements for screenings in Medan, in northern Sumatra, date to early November 1941. A review in the Surabaya edition of De Indische Courant, however, indicates that the film had only premiered in the east Javan city on 14 January 1942. That newspaper gave a positive review, describing Soeara Berbisa as a tense film with humorous moments and beautiful scenery. Its review ended with a recommendation that young people and their parents see the film. Soeara Berbisa was open to audiences of all ages. To reach educated audiences, Union claimed to have \\"paid attention to dialogue, arranged it as best as possible in accordance with the wants of the Indonesian people\\". In Dutch-language newspapers, the film was advertised as \\"an interesting and fascinating tale of two young men in the world of indigenous sports\\", which nonetheless was produced in a \\"civilised\\" manner such that it could be appreciated by European audiences. Legacy Union's final production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and released in early 1942. It again starred Soekarno, though this time alongside the new find Sofiati. The company was closed after the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942,; and most of its employees never returned to the film industry. Soekarno was an exception; he continued to act until the 1970s, though he was generally credited as Rendra Karno. Soeara Berbisa was screened as late as February 1949. The film is likely lost. All movies at the time were shot on flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

As a species in the genus Accipiter, the goshawk is often considered a \\"true hawk\\". The scientific name is Latin; Accipiter is \\"hawk\\", from accipere, \\"to grasp\\", and gentilis is \\"noble\\" or \\"gentle\\" because in the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry. This species was first described under its current scientific name by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758. It is a widespread species that inhabits many of the temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. The northern goshawk is the only species in the genus Accipiter found in both Eurasia and North America. It may have the second widest distribution of any true member of the family Accipitridae, behind arguably only the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), which has a broader range to the south of Asia than the goshawk. The only other acciptrid species to also range in both North America and Eurasia according to current opinion, is the more Arctic-restricted rough- legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus). Except in a small portion of southern Asia, it is the only species of \\"goshawk\\" in its range and it is thus often referred to, both officially and unofficially, as simply the \\"goshawk\\". It is mainly resident, but birds from colder regions migrate south for the winter. In North America, migratory goshawks are often seen migrating south along mountain ridge tops at nearly any time of the fall depending on latitude. Distribution The northern goshawk has a large circumpolar distribution. In Eurasia, it is found in most areas of Europe excluding Ireland and Iceland. It has a fairly spotty distribution in western Europe (e.g. Great Britain, Spain, France) but is more or less found continuously through the rest of the continent. Their Eurasian distribution sweeps continuously across most of Russia, excluding the fully treeless tundra in the northern stretches, to the western limits of Siberia as far as Anadyr and Kamchatka. In the Eastern Hemisphere, they are found in their southern limits in extreme northwestern Morocco, Corsica and Sardinia, the \\"toe\\" of Italy, southern Greece, Turkey, the Caucasus, Sinkiang's Tien Shan, in some parts of Tibet and the Himalayas, western China and Japan. In winter, northern goshawks may be found rarely as far south as Taif in Saudi Arabia and perhaps Tonkin, Vietnam. In North America, they are most broadly found in the western United States, including Alaska, and western Canada. Their breeding range in the western contiguous United States largely consists of the wooded foothills of the Rocky Mountains and many other large mountain ranges from Washington to southern California extending east to central Colorado and westernmost Texas. Somewhat discontinuous breeding populations are found in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, thence also somewhat spottily into western Mexico down through Sonora and Chihuahua along the Sierra Madre Occidental as far as Jalisco and Guerrero, their worldwide southern limit as a breeding species.Monson, G. & Phillips, A.R. (1964). A check-list of the birds of Arizona. Tucson: Univ. of Arizona Press.Howell, S. N. G. & Webb, S. (1995). A guide to the birds of Mexico and northern Central America. New York: Oxford University Press. The goshawk continues east through much of Canada as a native species, but is rarer in most of the eastern United States, especially the Midwest where they are not typically found outside the Great Lakes region, where a good-sized breeding population occurs in the northern parts of Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and somewhat into Ohio; a very small population persists in the extreme northeast corner of North Dakota. They breed also in mountainous areas of New England, New York, central Pennsylvania and northwestern New Jersey, sporadically down to extreme northwestern Maryland and northeastern West Virginia. Vagrants have been reported in Ireland, North Africa (central Morocco, northern Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt); the Arabian Peninsula (Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia), southwest Asia (southern Iran, Pakistan), western India (Gujarat) and on Izu-shoto (south of Japan) and the Commander Islands, and in most of the parts of the United States where they do not breed.  Habitat Adult in the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, in a pine tree that typifies the habitat used locally Northern goshawks can be found in both deciduous and coniferous forests. While the species might show strong regional preferences for certain trees, they seem to have no strong overall preferences nor even a preference between deciduous or coniferous trees despite claims to the contrary. More important than the type of trees are the composition of a given tree stand, which should be tall, old-growth with intermediate to heavy canopy coverage (often more than 40%) and minimal density undergrowth, both of which are favorable for hunting conditions. Also, goshawks typically require close proximity to openings in which to execute additional hunting.Erickson, M. G. (1987). Nest site habitat selection of the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in the Black Hills of South Dakota (Doctoral dissertation, MS thesis. University of South Dakota. Brookings, South Dakota). More so than in North America, the goshawks of Eurasia, especially central Europe, may live in fairly urbanized patchworks of small woods, shelter-belts and copses and even use largely isolated trees in central parts of Eurasian cities.Link, H. (1977). Beitr√§ge zur Bestandssituation, √ñkologie, Brutbiologie und Beutewahl einer nordbayerischer Population des Habichts (Accipiter gentilis). PhD thesis. Access to waterways and riparian zones of any kind is not uncommon in goshawk home ranges but seems to not be a requirement. Narrow tree-lined riparian zones in otherwise relatively open habitats can provide suitable wintering habitat in the absence of more extensive woodlands. The northern goshawk can be found at almost any altitude, but recently is typically found at high elevations due to a paucity of extensive forests remaining in lowlands across much of its range. Altitudinally, goshawks may live anywhere up to a given mountain range's tree line, which is usually in elevation or less. The northern limit of their distribution also coincides with the tree line and here may adapt to dwarf tree communities, often along drainages of the lower tundra.Engelmann, F. 1928. Die Raubvogel Europas: Naturgeschichte, Kulturgeschichte und Falknerei. Neudamm, Germany. In winter months, the northernmost or high mountain populations move down to warmer forests with lower elevations, often continuing to avoid detection except while migrating. A majority of goshawks around the world remain sedentary throughout the year.  Description Juvenile (left) and adult by Louis Agassiz Fuertes The northern goshawk has relatively short, broad wings and a long tail, typical for Accipiter species and common to raptors that require maneuverability within forest habitats. For an Accipiter, it has a relatively sizeable bill, relatively long wings, a relatively short tail, robust and fairly short legs and particularly thick toes. Across most of the species' range, it is blue- grey above or brownish-grey with dark barring or streaking over a grey or white base color below, but Asian subspecies in particular range from nearly white overall to nearly black above. Goshawks tend to show clinal variation in color, with most goshawks further north being paler and those in warmer areas being darker but individuals can be either dark in the north or pale in the south. Individuals that live a long life may gradually become paler as they age, manifesting in mottling and a lightening of the back from a darker shade to a bluer pale color. Its plumage is more variable than that of the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), which is probably due to higher genetic variability in the larger goshawk.Newton, I. (1986). The Sparrowhawk. Poyser Monographs, Calton, UK. The juvenile northern goshawk is usually a solid to mildly streaky brown above, with many variations in underside color from nearly pure white to almost entirely overlaid with broad dark cinnamon-brown striping. Both juveniles and adults have a barred tail, with 3 to 5 dark brown or black bars. Adults always have a white eye stripe or supercilia, which tends to be broader in northern Eurasian and North American birds. In North America, juveniles have pale-yellow eyes, and adults develop dark red eyes usually after their second year, although nutrition and genetics may affect eye color as well. In Europe and Asia, juveniles also have pale-yellow eyes while adults typically develop orange-colored eyes, though some may have only brighter yellow or occasionally ochre or brownish eye color. Moulting starts between late March and late May, the male tends to moult later and faster than the female. Moulting results in the female being especially likely to have a gap in its wing feathers while incubating and this may cause some risk, especially if the male is lost, as it inhibits her hunting abilities and may hamper her defensive capabilities, putting both herself and the nestlings in potential danger of predation. The moult takes a total of 4‚Äì6 months, with tail feathers following the wings then lastly the contour and body feathers, which may not be completely moulted even as late as October. Although existing wing size and body mass measurements indicate that the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) and Meyer's goshawk (Accipiter meyerianus) broadly overlap in size with this species, the northern goshawk is on average the largest member of the genus Accipiter, especially outsizing its tropic cousins in the larger Eurasian races. The northern goshawk, like all Accipiters, exhibits sexual dimorphism, where females are significantly larger than males, with the dimorphism notably greater in most parts of Eurasia. Linearly, males average about 8% smaller in North America and 13% smaller than females in Eurasia, but in the latter landmass can range up to a very noticeable 28% difference in extreme cases. Male northern goshawks are long and have a wingspan. The female is much larger, long with a wingspan.Del Hoyo, J. E., & Elliot, A. A. & Sargatal, J.(eds.), 1994. Handbook of the Birds of the World.

In a study of North American goshawks (A. g. atricapillus), males were found to average in total length, against females which averaged . Males from six subspecies average around in body mass, with a range from all races of . The female can be up to more than twice as heavy, averaging from the same races with an overall range of .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor).

Adult goshawks may chatter a repeated note, varying in speed and volume based on the context. When calling from a perch, birds often turn their heads slowly from side to side, producing a ventriloquial effect. The male calls a fast, high-pitched kew-kew-kew when delivering food or else a very different croaking guck or chup. The latter sound has been considered by some authors similar to that of a person snapping the tongue away from the roof the mouth; the males produce it by holding the beak wide open, thrusting the head up and forward, than bringing it down as the sound is emitted, repeated at intervals of five seconds. This call is uttered when the male encounters a female. Two calls have been recorded mainly from brooding females in the race A. g. atricapillus: a recognition scream of short, intense notes (whee-o or hee-ya) which ends in harsh, falsetto tone; then a dismissal call given when the male lingers after delivering food, consisting of a choked, cut-off scream. Meanwhile, the adult female's rapid strident kek-kek-kek expresses alarm or intent to mob towards threatening intruders. This is often done when mobbing a predator such as a great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) and as it progresses the female's voice may lower slightly in pitch and becomes harsh and rasping. As the intensity of her attacks increases, her kakking becomes more rapid and can attain a constant screaming quality. Females often withdraw into the treetops when fatigued, and their calls are then spaced at longer intervals. Males respond to interlopers or predators with a quieter, slower gek gek gek or ep ep ep. A call consisting of kek‚Ä¶kek.kekk kek kek-kek-kek is used mainly by females in advertisement and during pre-laying mutual calling. Both sexes also may engage in kakking during copulation.. Vocalizations mainly peak in late courtship/early nesting around late March to April, can begin up to 45 minutes before sunrise, and are more than twice in as frequent in the first three hours of daylight as in the rest of the day. Occasionally hunting northern goshawks may make shrill screams when pursuing prey, especially if a lengthy chase is undertaken and the prey is already aware of its intended predator.. =Taxonomy= The genus Accipiter contains nearly 50 known living species and is the most diverse genus of diurnal raptors in the world. This group of agile, smallish, forest-dwelling hawks has been in existence for possibly tens of millions of years, probably as an adaptation to the explosive numbers of small birds that began to occupy the world's forest in the last few eras. The harriers are the only group of extant diurnal raptors that seem to bear remotely close relation to this genus, whereas buteonines, Old World kites, sea eagles and chanting-goshawks are much more distantly related and all other modern accipitrids are not directly related. Within the genus Accipiter, the northern goshawk seems to belong to a superspecies with other larger goshawks from different portions of the world.Kleinschmidt, O. (1923). Berajah, Zoografia infinita. Die Realgattung Habicht, Falco columbarius (KL). Gebauer-Schwetschke, Halle, Germany. Meyer's goshawk, found in the South Pacific, has been posited as the most likely to be most close related living cousin to the northern goshawk, the somewhat puzzling gap in their respective ranges explained by other Palearctic raptors such as Bonelli's eagles (Aquila fasciata) and short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus) that have extant isolated tropical island populations and were probably part of the same southwest Pacific radiation that led to the Meyer's goshawk.. A presumably older radiation of this group occurred in Africa, where it led to both the Henst's goshawk of Madagascar and the black sparrowhawk (Accipiter melanoleucus) of the mainland. While the Henst's goshawk quite resembles the northern goshawks, the black sparrowhawk is superficially described as a ‚Äúsparrowhawk‚Äù due to its relatively much longer and finer legs than those of typical goshawks but overall its size and plumage (especially that of juveniles) is much more goshawk than sparrowhawk-like. Outside of the presumed superspecies, the genus Erythrotriorchis may be part of an Australasian radiation of basal goshawks based largely on their similar morphology to northern goshawks. Genetic studies have indicated that the Cooper's hawk of North America is also fairly closely related to the northern goshawk, having been present in North America before either of the other two North American Accipiters. However, the much smaller sharp-shinned hawk, which has similar plumage to the Cooper's hawk and seems to be most closely related to the Eurasian sparrowhawk, appears to have occupied North America the latest of the three North American species, despite having the broadest current distribution of any Accipiter in the Americas (extending down through much of South America). The term goshawk comes from the Old English g≈çsheafoc, \\"goose-hawk\\". =Subspecies= Typical adult with a strong brownish-gray cast, from the nominate subspecies, A. g. gentilis Typical adult from the American subspecies (A. g. atricapillus) showing its strong supercilium, red eyes, black head, and blue-gray back The northern goshawk appears to have diversified in northern, central Eurasia and spread both westwards to occupy Europe and, later on, eastwards to spread into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. Fossil remains show that goshawks were present in California by the Pleistocene era. Two non-exclusive processes could have occurred to cause the notably color and size variation of northern goshawks throughout its range: isolation in the past enabled gene combinations to assort as distinct morphs that suited conditions in different geographical areas, followed by a remixing of these genotypes to result in clines, or subtle variation in modern selection pressures led to a diversity of hues and patterns. As a result of the high variation of individual goshawks in plumage characteristics and typical trends in clinal variation and size variations that largely follow Bergmann's rule and Gloger's rule, an excessive number of subspecies have been described for the northern goshawk in the past. In Europe (including European Russia) alone, 12 subspecies were described between 1758 and 1990.. Most modern authorities agree on listing nine to ten subspecies of northern goshawks from throughout its range. * A. g. gentilis (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì The nominate race is distributed through most of the species current European range, excluding northern Fennoscandia, northwestern Russia and possibly some of the Mediterranean islands they inhabit. Outside of Europe, this subspecies' range extends south to northwestern Africa (almost entirely Morocco) and east in Eurasia to Urals, the Caucasus and Asia Minor. It is a typically large subspecies, with high levels of sexual dimorphism. The wing chord of males ranges from and of females from . Body mass is variable, range from in males and from in females. In some cases, the largest adult females (including some exceptionally big females which are the heaviest goshawks known from anywhere) from within a population are up to four times heavier than the smallest adult males, although this is exceptional. The highest average weights come from central Fennoscandia, where the sexes weigh on average and , respectively. The lowest come from Spain, where goshawks of this race weigh a median of in males and in females. The nominate race is generally a dark slaty-brown color on its back and wing coverts with a blackish-brown head. The supercilium is thin and the underside is generally creamy with heavy dark barring. On average, in addition to their smaller size, nominate goshawks to the south of the race's distribution have thinner supericilia and broader and denser barring on the underside. An aberrant ‚Äúisabelline‚Äù morph is known mainly from central and eastern Europe, where the goshawk may be a general beige color (somewhat similar to the pale birds from the races albidus and buteoides), but such birds appear to be very rare. *A. g. arrigonii (Kleinschmidt, 1903) ‚Äì This is an island race found on the Mediterranean isles of Sardinia and Corsica. It averages smaller and weaker-footed than goshawks from the nominate race. The wing chord measures in males and in females. This race is typically a more blackish brown above with almost fully black head, while the underside is almost pure white and more heavily overlaid with black barring and conspicuous black shaft-streaks. This subspecies is not listed by all authorities but is often considered valid. *A. g. buteoides (Menzbier, 1882) ‚Äì This race is characteristic of the northern stretches of the western Eurasian range of goshawks, being found as a breeding species from northern Fennoscandia to western Siberia, ranging as far as the Lena River. In the eastern portion of its distribution, many birds may travel south to central Asia to winter. This is a large race, averaging larger than most populations of the nominate race but being about the same size as the big nominate goshawks with which they may overlap and interbreed with in Fennoscandia. The wing chord in males ranges from while that of females ranges from . The body mass of males has been reported from , with an average of , while that of females is reportedly , with an average of . Usually, this race is an altogether paler colour than the nominate, being blue-grey above with a dusky- grey crown and a broad supercilium. The underside is white with rather fine blackish-brown barring. Pale flecking on the feather shafts sometimes result in barred appearance on the contour feathers of the nape, back and upper wing. Many birds from this subspecies also have a tan to pale brown eye color. These two characteristics are sometimes considered typical of this race, but individuals are rather variable. In western Siberia, about 10% of birds of this race are nearly pure white (similar to albidus) with varied indications of darker streaking. *A. g. albidus (Menzbier, 1882) ‚Äì This race of goshawk is found in northeastern Siberia and Kamchatka. Many birds of this race travel south for the winter to Transbaikalia, northern Mongolia and Ussuriland. This race continues the trend for goshawks to grow mildly larger eastbound in Eurasia and may be the largest known race based on the midpoint of known measurements of this race, although limited sample sizes of measured goshawks shows they broadly overlap in size with A. g. buteoides and large-bodied populations of A. g. gentilis. The wing chord can range from in males and from in females. Known males have scaled from while a small sample of females weighed have had a body mass between . This is easily the palest race of northern goshawk. Many birds are pale grey above with much white about the head and very sparse barring below. However, about half of the goshawks of this race are more or less pure white, with at most only a few remnants of pale caramel flecking about the back or faint brownish markings elsewhere. *A. g. schvedowi (Menzbier, 1882) ‚Äì This race ranges from the Urals east to the Amurland, Ussuriland, Manchuria, west-central China and sporadically as a breeder into Sakhalin and the Kuril islands. A. g. schvedowi averages smaller than the other races on the mainland of Eurasia, with seemingly the highest sexual dimorphism of any goshawk race, possibly as an adaptation to prey partitioning in the exceptionally sparse wooded fringes of the desert-like steppe habitat that characterizes this race's range. The wing chord has been found to measure in males and in females. Body mass of 15 males was found to be merely with a mean of , the lowest adult weights known for this species, while two adult females scaled , respectively, or more than twice as much on average. Beyond its smaller size, its wings are reportedly relatively shorter and feet relatively smaller and weaker than other Eurasian races. In color, this race is typically a slate-grey above with a blackish head and is densely marked below with thin brown barring. *A. g. fujiyamae (Swann & Hartert, 1923) ‚Äì Found through the species' range in Japan, from the islands of Hokkaido south to the large island of Honshu, in the latter down to as far south as forests a bit north of Hiroshima. A fairly small subspecies, it may average slightly smaller than A. g. schvedowi linearly, but it is less sexually dimorphic in size and weighs slightly more on average. The wing chord is the smallest known from any race, in males and in females. However, the weights of 22 males ranged from , averaging while 22 females ranged from , averaging .. The coloration of this race is not dissimilar from A. g. schvedowi, but is still darker slate above and they tend to have heavier barring below, probably being the darkest race on average, rivaled only by the similar insular race from the opposite side of the Pacific, A. g. laingi. *A. g. atricapillus (Wilson, 1812) ‚Äì Sometimes simply referred to as the American goshawk. This subspecies occupies a majority of the species' range in North America, excluding some islands of the Pacific Northwest and the southern part of the American Southwest. American goshawks are generally slightly smaller on average than most Eurasian ones, although there are regional differences in size that confirm mildly to Bergmann's rule within this race. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in size is notably less pronounced in American goshawks than in most Eurasian races. Overall, the wing chord is in males and in females. Size within atricapillus based on body mass seems to be highest in interior Alaska, followed by the Great Lakes, is intermediate in the northwest United States from eastern Washington to the Dakotas as well as in southeast Alaska thence decreasing mildly along the Pacific in Oregon and California and smallest of all within the race in the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau states (i.e. Nevada, Utah and northern and central Arizona). Conspicuously, wing size did not correspond to variations in body mass and more southerly goshawks were frequently longer winged than the more massive northerly ones.Smith, J. P., Hoffman, S. W., & Gessaman, J. A. (1990). Regional Size Differences among Fall-Migrant Accipiters in North America. Journal of Field Ornithology, 192‚Äì200.Whaley, W. H. & White, C.M. (1994). Trends in geographic variation of Cooper's hawk and northern goshawk in North America: a multivariate analysis. Proc. West. Found. Vertebr. Zool. no. 5:161-209. Male atricapillus goshawk have been found to weigh from and females from .Henny, C. J., Olson. R.A. & Fleming, T.L. (1985). Breeding chronology, molt, and measurements of accipiter hawks in northeastern Oregon. J. Field Ornithol. no. 56: 97‚Äì112. The lightest reported mean weights were from goshawks in northern and central Arizona, weighing a mean of in males and while the highest were from a small sample of Alaskan goshawks which weighed some in males and in females.Mavrogordato, J. (1973). A Hawk for the Bush: A Treatise on the Training of the Sparrow-hawk and Other Short-winged Hawks. Spearman.Mueller, H. C., Berger, D.D. & Allez, G. (1976). Age and sex variation in the size of goshawks. Bird-Banding no. 47 (4):310‚Äì318. Almost identical mean weights for goshawks as in Alaska were recorded for goshawks from Alberta as well. This race is typically a blue-gray color above with a boldly contrasting black head and broad white supercilia. American goshawks are often grayish below with fine gray waving barring and, compared to most Eurasian goshawks, rather apparent black shaft streaks which in combination create a vermiculated effect that is all-together messier looking than in most Eurasian birds. From a distance, atricapillus can easily appear solidly all-gray from the front. Due to this, the adult goshawk in America is sometimes called the ‚Äúgray ghost‚Äù, a name also somewhat more commonly used for adult male hen harriers.Rashid, S. (2015). Northern Goshawk, the Grey Ghost: Habits, Habitats and Rehabilitation. Schiffer Publishing Ltd. Birds from mainland Alaska tend to be paler overall with more pale flecking than other American goshawks. *A. g. laingi (Tavernier, 1940) ‚Äì This insular race is found on the Queen Charlotte Islands and Vancouver Island. This subspecies is slightly smaller than the goshawks found on the mainland and is linearly the smallest race on average in North America. The wing chord of males can range from and that of females is and is on average nearly 5% smaller than those sampled goshawks from the nearby mainland. These goshawks are characteristically darker than mainland goshawks with the black of the crown extending to the interscapulars. The underside is a sootier gray overall.Iverson, G. C., Hayward, G. D., Titus, K. DeGayner, E., Lowell, R.E., Crocker-Bedford, D.C., Schempf, P.F. & Lindell, J.F. (1996). Conservation assessment for the northern goshawk in southeast Alaska. U.S. Dept., Agric., For. Serv. Publ. *A. g. apache (van Rossem, 1938) ‚Äì The range of this subspecies extends from southern Arizona and New Mexico down throughout the species' range in Mexico. This subspecies has the longest median wing size of any race, running contrary to Bergmann's rule that northern birds should outsize southern ones in widely distributed temperate species. In males the wing chord ranges from while in females it ranges from . However, in terms of body mass, it is only slightly heavier than the goshawks found discontinuously somewhat to the north in the Great Basin and the Colorado Plateau and lighter than the heaviest known American goshawks from Alaska, Alberta and Wisconsin despite exceeding the goshawks from these areas in wing size. The weight of 49 males ranged from , averaging , while that of 88 females from two studies ranged from , averaging .Ingraldi, M.F. (2005). A skewed sex ratio in Northern Goshawks: is it a sign of a stressed population? Journal of Raptor Research 39.3 (2005): 247‚Äì252. Aside from its overall larger size, apache reportedly averages larger in foot size than most other American goshawks. Birds of this race tend to be darker than other American goshawks aside from the laingi type birds. Due to its shortage of distinct features beyond proportions, this is considered one of the more weakly separated among current separate subspecies, with some authors considering it merely a clinal variation of atricapillus. Even the greater wing size in southern birds follows a trend for the wing chord to increase in size in the south on the contrary to body mass. =Similar species= Juvenile in flight, the most likely age and condition to mistake a goshawk for another species The juvenile plumage of the species may cause some confusion, especially with other Accipiter juveniles. Unlike other northern Accipiters, the adult northern goshawk never has a rusty color to its underside barring. In Eurasia, the smaller male goshawk is sometimes confused with a female sparrowhawk, but is still notably larger, much bulkier and has relatively longer wings, which are more pointed and less boxy. Sparrowhawks tend to fly in a frequently flapping, fluttering type flight. Wing beats of northern goshawks are deeper, more deliberate, and on average slower than those of the Eurasian sparrowhawk or the two other North American Accipiters.Cramp, S. and K. E. L. Simmons. (1980). Handbook of the birds of Europe and the Middle East and North Africa: the birds of the western Palearctic, Vol. 2. Hawks to bustards. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press. Kaufman, K. (1990). A Field Guide to advanced birding: birding challenges and how to approach them. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. The classic Accipiter flight is a characteristic \\"flap flap, glide\\", but the goshawk, with its greater wing area, can sometimes be seen steadily soaring in migration (smaller Accipiters almost always need to flap to stay aloft). In North America juveniles are sometimes confused with the smaller Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii), especially between small male goshawks and large female Cooper's hawks. Unlike in Europe with sparrowhawks, Cooper's hawks can have a largish appearance and juveniles may be regularly mistaken for the usually less locally numerous goshawk. However, the juvenile goshawk displays a heavier, vertical streaking pattern on chest and abdomen, with the juvenile Cooper's hawk streaking frequently (but not always) in a ‚Äúteardrop‚Äù pattern wherein the streaking appears to taper at the top, as opposed to the more even streaking of the goshawk. The goshawk sometimes seems to have a shorter tail relative to its much broader body. Although there appears to be a size overlap between small male goshawks and large female Cooper's hawks, morphometric measurements (wing and tail length) of both species demonstrate no such overlap, although weight overlap can rarely occur due to variation in seasonal condition and food intake at time of weighing.. Rarely, in the southern stretches of its Asian wintering range, the northern goshawk may live alongside the crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus) which is smaller (roughly Cooper's hawk-sized) and has a slight crest as well as a distinct mixture of denser streaks and bars below and no supercilia. Large juvenile Cooper's hawks such as this are at times mistaken for a goshawk Northern goshawks are sometimes mistaken for species even outside of the genus Accipiter especially as juveniles of each respective species. In North America, four species of buteonine hawk (all four of which are smaller than goshawks to a certain degree) may be confused with them on occasion despite the differing proportions of these hawks, which all have longer wings and shorter tails relative to their size. A species so similar it is sometimes nicknamed the ‚ÄúMexican goshawk‚Äù, gray hawk (Buteo plagiatus) juveniles (overlapping with true goshawks in the southwest United States into Mexico) have contrasting face pattern with bold dusky eye-stripes, dark eyes, barred thighs and a bold white ‚ÄúU‚Äù on the uppertail coverts. The roadside hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) (rarely in same range in Mexico) is noticeably smaller with paddle-shaped wings, barred lower breast and a buff ‚ÄúU‚Äù on undertail coverts in young birds. Somewhat less likely to confuse despite their broader extent of overlap are the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) which have a narrow white-barred, dark-looking tail, bold white crescents on their primaries and dark wing edges and the broad-winged hawk (Buteo playpterus) which also has dark wing edges and a differing tapered wing shape. Even wintering gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) juveniles have been mistaken for goshawks and vice versa on occasion, especially when observed distantly perched. However, the bulkier, broader headed yet relatively shorter tailed falcon still has many tell-tale falcon characteristics like pointed, longer wings, a brown malar stripe as well as its more extensive barring both above and below. Behavior =Territoriality= Adult goshawks maintain territories with display flights The northern goshawk is always found solitarily or in pairs. This species is highly territorial as are most raptorial birds, maintaining regularly spaced home ranges that constitute their territory. Territories are maintained by adults in display flights. During nesting, the home ranges of goshawk pairs are from and these vicinities tend to be vigorously defended both to maintain rights to their nests and mates as well as the ranges‚Äô prey base. During display flight goshawks may engage in single or mutual high-circling.Dobler, G. (1990). Brutbiotop und territorialit√®t bei habicht (Accipiter gentilis) und rotmilan (Milvus milvus) [Nesting habitat and territoriality in goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and red kite (Milvus milvus)]. J. Ornithologie no. 131:85‚Äì93. Each sex tends to defend the territory from others of their own sex. Territorial flights may occur almost through the year, but peak from January to April. Such flights may include slow-flapping with exaggerated high deep beats interspersed with long glides and undulations. In general, territorial fights are resolved without physical contact, often with one (usually a younger bird seeking a territory) retreats while the other approaches in a harrier-like warning flight, flashing its white underside at the intruder. If the incoming goshawk does not leave the vicinity, the defending goshawk may increase the exaggerated quality of its flight including a mildly undulating wave-formed rowing flight and the rowing flight with its neck held in a heron-like S to elevate the head and maximally expose the pale breast as a territorial threat display. Territorial skirmishes may on occasion escalate to physical fights in which mortalities may occur. In actual fights, goshawks fall grappling to the ground as they attempt to strike each other with talons. =Migration= Although at times considered rather sedentary for a northern raptor species, the northern goshawk is a partial migrant. Migratory movements generally occur between September and November (occasionally extending throughout December) in the fall and February to April in the spring. Spring migration is less extensive and more poorly known than fall migration, but seems to peak late March to early April. Some birds up to as far north as northern Canada and central Scandinavia may remain on territory throughout the winter. Northern goshawks from northern Fennoscandia have been recorded traveling up to away from first banding but adults seldom are recorded more than from their summer range. In Sweden, young birds distributed an average of in the north to an average of in the south.Fransson, T., & Pettersson, J. (2001). Swedish bird ringing atlas. Swedish Museum of Natural History & Swedish Ornithological Society. In northern Sweden, young generally disperse somewhat south, whereas in south and central Sweden, they typically distributed to the south (but not usually across the 5-km Kattegat straits). On the other hand, 4.3% of the southern Swedish goshawks actually moved north. Migrating goshawks seem to avoid crossing water, but sparrowhawks seems to be able to do so more regularly.Hoglund, N. H. 1964. The hawk Accipiter gentilis Linne in Fennos Kandia (English translation). Viltrevy no. 2:195‚Äì269. In central Europe, few birds travel more than throughout the year, a few juveniles have exceptionally been recorded traveling up to . In Eurasia, very small numbers of migratory northern goshawks cross the Strait of Gibraltar and Bosporus in autumn but further east more significant winter range expansions may extend from northern Iran & southern Turkmenia to Aral & Balkhash lakes, from Kashmir to Assam, extreme northwestern Thailand, northern Vietnam, southern China, Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands and South Korea. Migratory goshawks in North America may move down to Baja California, Sinaloa and into most of west Texas, but generally in non-irruptive years, goshawks winter no further south than Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina.Keane, J. J. & Morrison, M.L. (1994). Northern Goshawk ecology: effects of scale and levels of biological organization. Stud. Avian Biol. no. 16:3-11. Some periodic eruptions to nearly as far as the Gulf of Mexico have been recorded at no fewer than 10 years apart. In one case, a female that was banded in Wisconsin was recovered in Louisiana, a first ever record of the species in that state.Evans, D. L. & Sindelar, C.R. (1974). First record of the goshawk for Louisiana-a collected, banded bird. Bird-Banding no. 45: 270. Prey availability may primarily dictate the proportion of goshawk populations that migrate and the selection of wintering areas, followed by the presence of snow which may aid prey capture in the short-term but in the long-term is likely to cause higher goshawk mortality.Marcstr√∂m, V., & Kenward, R. (1981). Movements of wintering goshawks in Sweden. Swedish Sportsmen's Association.Doyle, F. I. & Smith, J.M.N. (1994). Population responses of northern goshawks to the 10-year cycle in numbers of snowshoe hares. Stud. Avian Biol. no. 16:122‚Äì129. Showing the high variability of migratory movements, in one study of winter movements of adult female goshawks that bred in high-elevation forests of Utah, about 36% migrated to the general south, 22% migrated farther than that distance, 8.3% migrated less far, 2.7% went north instead of south and 31% stayed throughout winter on their breeding territory. Irruptive movements seem to occur for northern populations, i.e. those of the boreal forests in North America, Scandinavia, and possibly Siberia, with more equal sex ratio of movement and a strong southward tendency of movements in years where prey such as hares and grouse crash. Male young goshawks tend to disperse farther than females, which is unusual in birds, including raptors. It has been speculated that larger female juveniles displace male juveniles, forcing them to disperse farther, to the incidental benefit of the species‚Äô genetic diversity. In Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, there were more than twice as many juvenile males than females recorded migrating.Mueller, H. C., D. D. Berger and G. Allez. 1977. The periodic invasions of goshawks. Auk no. 94:652-663. At the hawk watch at Cape May Point State Park in New Jersey, few adult males and no adult females have been recorded in fall migration apart from irruptive years, indicating that migration is more important to juveniles.Sibley, D. A. 1997. Birds of Cape May. 2nd ed. Cape May Point: New Jersey Audubon Soc. More juveniles were recorded migrating than adults in several years of study from Sweden. In northern Accipiters including the goshawk, there seems to be multiple peaks in numbers of migrants, an observation that suggests partial segregation by age and sex.Hoffman, S. W., W. R. DeRagon and J. C. Bednarz. (1992). Patterns and recent trends in counts of migrant hawks in western North America, 1977-1991. Unpubl. report. Dietary biology =Hunting behavior= Goshawks are particularly agile hunters of the woodlands As typical of the genus Accipiter (as well as unrelated forest-dwelling raptors of various lineages), the northern goshawk has relatively short wings and a long tail which make it ideally adapted to engaging in brief but agile and twisting hunting flights through dense vegetation of wooded environments.Wattel, J. (1973). Geographical differentiation in the genus Accipiter (No. 13). Harvard Univ Nuttall Ornithological. This species is a powerful hunter, taking birds and mammals in a variety of woodland habitats, often utilizing a combination of speed and obstructing cover to ambush their victims. Goshawks often forage in adjoining habitat types, such as the edge of a forest and meadow. Hunting habitat can be variable, as in a comparison of habitats used in England found that only 8% of landscapes used were woodlands whereas in Sweden 73-76% of the habitat used was woodland, albeit normally within of an opening. In North America, goshawks are generally rather more likely than those from Eurasia to hunt within the confines of mature forest, excluding areas where prey numbers are larger outside of the forest, such as where scrub-dwelling cottontails are profuse. One study from central Sweden found that locally goshawks typically hunt within the largest patches of mature forests, selecting second growth forest less than half as often as its prevalence in the local environment. The northern goshawk is typically considered a perch-hunter. Hunting efforts are punctuated by a series of quick flights low to the ground, interspersed with brief periods of scanning for unsuspecting prey from elevated perches (short duration sit-and-wait predatory movements). These flights are meant to be inconspicuous, averaging about 83 seconds in males and 94 seconds in females, and prey pursuits may be abandoned if the victims become aware of the goshawk too quickly.Fox, N., & Merrick, T. (1995). Understanding the bird of prey. Hancock House Pub Limited. More sporadically, northern goshawks may watch from prey from a high soar or gliding flight above the canopy. One study in Germany found an exceptional 80% of hunting efforts to be done from a high soar but the author admitted that he was probably biased by the conspicuousness of this method. In comparison, a study from Great Britain found that 95% of hunting efforts were from perches. A strong bias for pigeons as prey and a largely urbanized environment in Germany explains the local prevalence of hunting from a soaring flight, as the urban environment provides ample thermals and obstructing tall buildings which are ideal for hunting pigeons on the wing. Northern goshawks rarely vary from their perch-hunting style that typifies the initial part of their hunt but seems to be able to show nearly endless variation to the concluding pursuit.Kenward, R. E. (1982). Goshawk hunting behaviour, and range size as a function of food and habitat availability. The Journal of Animal Ecology, 69‚Äì80. Hunting goshawks seem to not only utilize thick vegetation to block them from view for their prey (as typical of Accipiters) but, while hunting flying birds, they seem to be able to adjust their flight level so the prey is unable to see its hunter past their own tails. Once a prey item is selected, a short tail-chase may occur. The northern goshawk is capable of considerable, sustained, horizontal speed in pursuit of prey with speeds of reported. While pursuing prey, northern goshawks has been described both ‚Äúreckless‚Äù and ‚Äúfearless‚Äù, able to pursue their prey through nearly any conditions. There are various times goshawks have been observed going on foot to pursue prey, at times running without hesitation (in a crow-like, but more hurried gait) into dense thickets and brambles (especially in pursuit of galliforms trying to escape), as well as into water (i.e. usually waterfowl).Wittenberg, J. (1985). Habicht Accipiter gentilis jagt zu Fu√ü in der Stadt. Anz. orn. Ges. Bayern 24, Heft 2 (3): 180. Anecdotal cases have been reported when goshawks have pursue domestic prey into barns and even houses. Prey pursuits may become rather prolonged depending upon the goshawk's determination and hunger, ranging up to 15 minutes while harrying a terrified, agile squirrel or hare, and occasional pair hunting may benefit goshawks going after agile prey. As is recorded in many accipitrids, hunting in pairs (or ‚Äútandem hunting‚Äù) normally consist of a breeding pair, with one bird flying conspicuously to distract the prey, while the other swoops in from behind to ambush the victim. When gliding down from a perch to capture prey, a goshawk may not even beat its wings, rendering its flight nearly silent.Beebe, F. L. (1974). \\"Goshawk.\\" In Field studies of the Falconiformes of British Columbia, 54-62. Br. Columbia Prov. Mus. Occas. Pap. Ser. no. 17. Prey is killed by driving the talons into the quarry and squeezing while the head is held back to avoid flailing limbs, frequently followed by a kneading action until the prey stops struggling. Kills are normally consumed on the ground by juvenile or non-breeding goshawks (more rarely an elevated perch or old nest) or taken to a low perch by breeding goshawks. Habitual perches are used for dismantling prey especially in the breeding season, often called ‚Äúplucking perches‚Äù, which may be fallen logs, bent-over trees, stumps or rocks and can see years of usage. Northern goshawks often leave larger portions of their prey uneaten than other raptors, with limbs, many feathers and fur and other body parts strewn near kill sites and plucking perches, and are helpful to distinguish their kills from other raptors such as large owls, who usually eat everything. The daily food requirements of a single goshawks are around and most kills can feed a goshawk for 1 to 3 days. Northern goshawks sometimes cache prey on tree branches or wedged in a crotch between branches for up to 32 hours. This is done primarily during the nestling stage. Hunting success rates have been very roughly estimated at 15‚Äì30%, within average range for a bird of prey, but may be reported as higher elsewhere. One study claimed hunting success rates for pursuing rabbits was 60% and corvids was 63.8%.S√¶ther, B. (2014). Prey handling and consumption by northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis): a feeding experiment. =Prey spectrum= Northern goshawks most often prey on birds, especially in Eurasia Northern goshawks are usually opportunistic predators, as are most birds of prey. The most important prey species are small to medium-sized mammals and medium to large-sized birds found in forest, edge and scrub habitats.Reynolds, R. T. & Meslow, E.C. (1984). Partitioning of food and niche characteristics of coexisting Accipiter during breeding. Auk no. 101:761‚Äì779. Primary prey selection varies considerably not just at the regional but also the individual level as the primary food species can be dramatically different in nests just a few kilometers apart. As is typical in various birds of prey, small prey tends to be underrepresented in prey remains below habitual perches and nests (as only present in skeletal remains within pellets) whereas pellets underrepresent large prey (which is usually dismantled away from the nest) and so a combined study of both remains and pellets is recommended to get a full picture of goshawks‚Äô diets. Prey selection also varies by season and a majority of dietary studies are conducted within the breeding season, leaving a possibility of bias for male- selected prey, whereas recent advanced in radio-tagging have allowed a broader picture of goshawk's fairly different winter diet (without needing to kill goshawks to examine their stomach contents). Northern goshawks have a varied diet that has reportedly included over 500 species from across its range, and at times their prey spectrum can extend to nearly any available kind of bird or mammal except the particularly large varieties as well as atypical prey including reptiles and amphibians, fish and insects. However, a few prey families dominate the diet in most parts of the range, namely corvids, pigeons, grouse, pheasants, thrushes and woodpeckers (in roughly descending order of importance) among birds and squirrels (mainly tree squirrels but also ground squirrels especially in North America) and rabbits and hares among mammals. Birds are usually the primary prey in Europe, constituting 76.5% of the diet in 17 studies. In North America, by comparison, they constitute 47.8% in 33 studies and mammals account for a nearly equal portion of the diet and in some areas rather dominate the food spectrum.Kennedy, P. L. (2003). Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus): A technical conservation assessment. USFS, Rocky Mountain Region, Species Conservation Project. Fort Collins, Colorado.Bosakowski, T. (1999). The Northern Goshawk: Ecology, Behavior and Management in North America. Hancock House Pub Limited.Jones, S. (1979). The accipiters: goshawk, Cooper's hawk, sharp-shinned hawk (No. 17). US Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. Studies have shown that from several parts of the Eurasian continent from Spain to the Ural mountains mammals contributed only about 9% of the breeding season diet. However, mammals may be slightly underrepresented in Eurasian data because of the little-studied presence of mammals as a food source in winter, particularly in the western and southern portions of Europe where the lack of snowfall can allow large numbers of rabbits. Staple prey for northern goshawks usually weighs between , with average prey weights per individual studies typically between . There is some difference in size and type between the prey caught by males and larger females. Prey selection between sexes is more disparate in the more highly dimorphic races from Eurasia than those from North America. In the Netherlands, male prey averaged whereas female prey averaged , thus a rough 45% difference . In comparison, the average prey caught by each sex in Arizona was and , respectively, or around a 26% difference.Boal, C. W., & Mannan, R. W. (1996). Prey sizes of male and female northern goshawks. The Southwestern Naturalist, 355‚Äì358. Northern goshawks often select young prey during spring and summer, attacking both nestling and fledgling birds and infant and yearling mammals, as such prey is often easiest to catch and convenient to bring to the nest. In general, goshawks in Fennoscandia, shift their prey selection to when the birds produce their young: first waterfowl, then quickly to corvids and thrushes and then lastly to grouse, even though adults are also freely caught opportunistically for all these prey types. This is fairly different from Vendsyssel, Denmark, where mostly adult birds were caught except for thrushes and corvids, as in these two groups, the goshawks caught mostly fledglings. =Corvids= Overall, one prey family that is known to be taken in nearly every part of the goshawk's range is the corvids, although they do not necessarily dominate the diet in all areas. Some 24 species have been reported in the diet. The second most commonly reported prey species in breeding season dietary studies from both Europe and North America are both large jays, the Eurasian jay (Glarius glandarius) and the Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri). These species were recorded in studies from northeastern Poland and the Apennines of Italy (where the Eurasian jays made up a quarter of the food by number) and in northwestern Oregon and the Kaibab Plateau of Arizona (where the Steller's made up 37% by number) as the main prey species by number. The conspicuously loud vocalizations, somewhat sluggish flight (when hunting adult or post-fledging individuals) and moderate size of these jays make them ideal for prey-gathering male goshawks. Another medium-sized corvid, the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica) is also amongst the most widely reported secondary prey species for goshawks there. Magpies, like large jays, are rather slow fliers and can be handily outpaced by a pursuing goshawk. Some authors claim that taking of large corvids is a rare behavior, due of their intelligence and complex sociality which in turn impart formidable group defenses and mobbing capabilities. One estimation claimed this to be done by about 1‚Äì2% of adult goshawks during the breeding season (based largely on studies from Sweden and England), however, on the contrary many goshawks do routinely hunt crows and similar species. In fact, there are some recorded cases where goshawks were able to exploit such mobbing behavior in order to trick crows into close range, where the mob victim suddenly turned to grab one predaceously.Sulkava, S. (1964). Zur Nahrungbiologies des Habichts, Accipiter gentilis L. Aquilo Seria Zoologica, 3: 1‚Äì103. In the following areas Corvus species were the leading prey by number: the hooded crow (Corvus cornix) in the Ural mountains (9% by number), the western jackdaw (Corvus monedula) in Sierra de Guadarrama, Spain (36.4% by number), the rook (Corvus frugilegus) in the Zhambyl district, Kazakhstan (36.6% by number) and the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in New York and Pennsylvania (44.8% by number).Karyakin, I. (2009). Goshawk in the Urals and adjacent territories. Raptor Conservation, A (4). Despite evidence that northern goshawks avoid nesting near common ravens (Corvus corax), the largest widespread corvid (about the same size as a goshawk at ) and a formidable opponent even one-on- one, they are even known to prey on ravens seldomly. Corvids taken have ranged in size from the Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis) to the raven. =Pigeons and doves= Adult on Corsica with its fresh prey, a common wood pigeon In Europe, the leading prey species numerically (the main prey species in 41% of 32 European studies largely focused on the nesting season) is the rock pigeon (Columba livia). Although the predominance of rock pigeons in urban environments that host goshawks such as the German cities of Hamburg (where they constituted 36% by number and nearly 45% by weight of the local diet) or Cologne is predictable, evidence shows that these development-clinging pigeons are sought out even within ample conserved woodland from Portugal to Georgia.Abuladze, A. (2013). Birds of Prey of Georgia. Materials towards Fauna of Georgia, Issue VI, Institute of Zoology, Ilia State University. In areas where goshawk restrict their hunting forays to field and forest, they often catch another numerous pigeon, the common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) (the largest pigeon the goshawk naturally encounters and is known to hunt). The latter species was the main prey in the diet of northern goshawks from in the Dutch-German border (37.7% of 4125 prey items) and Wales (25.1% by number and 30.5% by biomass of total prey).Opdam, P. F. M. (1980). Feeding ecology and niche \`1qdifferentiation in goshawk (Accipiter gentilis L.) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus L.) (Doctoral dissertation, [Sl]: PFM Opdam). It has been theorized that male goshawks in peri-urban regions may be better suited with their higher agility to ambushing rock pigeons in and amongst various manmade structures whereas females may be better suited due to the higher overall speeds to taking out common wood-pigeons, as these typically forage in wood- cloaked but relatively open fields; however males are efficient predators of common wood-pigeons as well.Br√ºll, H. (1964). Das Leben deutscher Greifv√∂gel. Fischer, Sttugart, Germany. Studies have proven that, while hunting rock pigeons, goshawks quite often select the oddly colored pigeons out of flocks as prey, whether the plumage of the flock is predominantly dark or light hued, they disproportionately often select individuals of the other color. This preference is apparently more pronounced in older, experienced goshawks and there is some evidence that the males who select oddly-colored pigeons have higher average productivity during breeding. Around eight additional species of pigeon and dove have turned up in the goshawks diet from throughout the range but only in small numbers and in most of North America, goshawks take pigeons less commonly than in Eurasia. One exception is in Connecticut where the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), the smallest known pigeon or dove the goshawk has hunted at , was the second most numerous prey species. =Gamebirds= Hawk and Black-Game (Bruno Liljefors, 1884), a painting of a goshawk at the moment of catching a black grouse The northern goshawk is in some parts of its range considered a specialized predator of gamebirds, particularly grouse. All told 33 species of this order have turned up in their diet, including most of the species either native to or introduced in North America and Europe. Numerically, only in the well-studied taiga habitats of Scandinavia, Canada and Alaska and some areas of the eastern United States do grouse typically take a dominant position. Elsewhere in the range, gamebirds are often secondary in number but often remain one of the most important contributors of prey biomass to nests. With their general ground-dwelling habits, gamebirds tend to be fairly easy for goshawks to overtake if they remain unseen and, if made aware of the goshawk, the prey chooses to run rather than fly. If frightened too soon, gamebirds may take flight and may be chased for some time, although the capture rates are reduced considerably when this occurs. Pre-fledgling chicks of gamebirds are particularly vulnerable due to the fact that they can only run when being pursued. In several parts of Scandinavia, forest grouse have historically been important prey for goshawks both in and out of the nesting season, principally the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) followed in numbers by larger western capercaillies (Tetrao urogallus) and the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) which replace the other species in the lower tundra zone. The impression of goshawks on the populations of this prey is considerable, possibly the most impactful of any predator in northern Europe considering their proficiency as predators and similarity of habitat selection to forest grouse. An estimated 25-26% of adult hazel grouses in Finnish and Swedish populations in a few studies fall victim to goshawks, whereas about 14% of adult black grouse are lost to this predator. Lesser numbers were reportedly culled in one study from northern Finland. However, adult grouse are less important in the breeding season diet than young birds, an estimated 30% of grouse taken by Scandinavian goshawks in summer were neonatal chicks whereas 53% were about fledgling age, the remaining 17% being adult grouse.Linden, H., & Wikman, M. (1983). Goshawk predation on tetraonids: availability of prey and diet of the predator in the breeding season. The Journal of Animal Ecology, 953-968. This is fairly different than in southeastern Alaska, where grouse are similarly as important as in Fennoscandia, as 32.1% of avian prey deliveries were adults, 14.4% were fledglings and 53.5% were nestlings. Goshawks sometimes become habitual fowl killers. This juvenile was caught pursuing chickens inside a hen house. Northern goshawks can show somewhat of a trend for females to be taken more so than males while hunting adult gamebirds, due to the larger size and more developed defenses of males (such as leg spurs present for defense and innerspecies conflicts in male of most pheasant species). Some authors have claimed this of male ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus cochilus), but these trends are not reported everywhere, as in southern Sweden equal numbers of adult male and female ring-necked pheasants, both sexes averaging , were taken.Marcstrom, V. & Widen, P. (1977). Hur skulle det ga for duvhoken om inte Fasan fanns? Svensk Jakt, 115: 98‚Äì101. While male goshawks can take black and hazel grouse of any age and thence deliver them to nests, they can only take capercaillie of up to adult hen size, averaging some , the cock capercaillie at more than twice as heavy as the hen is too large for a male goshawk to overtake. However, adult female goshawks have been reported attacking and killing cock capercaillie, mainly during winter. These average about in body mass and occasionally may weigh even more when dispatched. Similarly impressive feats of attacks on other particularly large gamebirds have been reported elsewhere in the range, including the Altai snowcock (Tetraogallus altaicus) in Mongolia and, in at least one case, successful predation on an estimated adult-sized young wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) hen in North America (by an immature female goshawk weighing approximately ), although taking adults of much larger-bodied prey like this is considered generally rare, the young chicks and poults of such prey species are likely much more often taken.Badarch, D., Zilinskas, R. A., & Balint, P. J. (2003). Mongolia today: science, culture, environment and development (Vol. 1). Psychology Press. At the other end of the size scale, the smallest gamebird known to be hunted by northern goshawk was the common quail. Domestic fowl, particularly chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are taken occasionally, especially where wild prey populations are depleted. While other raptors are at times blamed for large numbers of attacks on fowl, goshawks are reportedly rather more likely to attack chickens during the day than other raptors and are probably the most habitual avian predator of domestic fowl, at least in the temperate-zone. Particularly large numbers of chickens have been reported in Wigry National Park, Poland (4th most regular prey species and contributing 15.3% of prey weight), Belarus and the Ukraine, being the third most regularly reported prey in the latter two.Ivanovsky, V. V. (1998). Current status and breeding ecology of the Goshawk Accipiter gentilis in northern Belarus. Holarctic Birds of Prey, ADENEXWWGBP, Calamonte, Spain, 111‚Äì115. In a study of British goshawks, the red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), a race of willow ptarmigan, was found to be the leading prey species (26.2% of prey by number). In La Segarra, Spain, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is the most commonly reported prey species (just over 18% by number and 24.5% by weight). Despite reports that grouse are less significant as prey to American goshawks, the ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) is one of the most important prey species in North America (fourth most reported prey species in 22 studies), having been the leading prey species for goshawks in studies from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut (from 12 to 25% of prey selected) and reported as taken in high numbers elsewhere in several parts of their mutual range.Graham, R. T., de Volo, S. B., & Reynolds, R. T. (2015). Northern goshawk and its prey in the Black Hills: Habitat assessment. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-339. Fort Collins, CO: US, Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. The sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus) was reported as the leading prey species in southern Alaska (28.4% by number).The Shipley Group (2009). Goshawk Survey; Soule River Watershed, Southeast Alaska. Alaska Power & Telephone Survey. In the boreal forests of Alberta, grouse are fairly important prey especially in winter.Schaffer, W. W. 1998. Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) habitat characterization in central Alberta. Thesis, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. =Squirrels= Catching a red squirrel Among mammalian prey, indisputably the most significant by number are the squirrels. All told, 44 members of the Sciuridae have turned up in their foods. Tree squirrels are the most obviously co-habitants with goshawks and are indeed taken in high numbers. Alongside martens, northern goshawks are perhaps the most efficient temperate-zone predators of tree squirrels. Goshawks are large and powerful enough to overtake even the heaviest tree squirrels unlike smaller Accipiters and have greater agility and endurance in pursuits than do most buteonine hawks, some of which like red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) regularly pursue tree squirrels but have relatively low hunting success rates due to the agility of squirrels.McComb, A. M. (2004). Raptor Predation Attempts on Grey Squirrels Sciurus carolinensis (Gmelin). The Irish Naturalists' Journal, 27(12), 483‚Äì484. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) of Eurasia is the most numerous mammalian prey in European studies and the sixth most often recorded prey species there overall. In Oulu, Finland during winter (24.6% by number), in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, Poland (14.3%), in the Ch≈ôiby uplands of the Czech Republic (8.5%) and in For√™t de Berc√©, France (12%) the red squirrel was the main prey species for goshawks.Vaidie, F. (1999). L‚ÄôAutour des palombes (Accipiter gentilis) en Sarthe. In North America, tree squirrels are even more significant as prey, particularly the modestly-sized pine squirrels which are the single most important prey type for American goshawks overall. Particularly the American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is significant, being the primary prey in studies from Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana (in each comprising more than 30% of the diet and present in more than half of known pellets) but also reported everywhere in their foods from the eastern United States to Alaska and Arizona. Much like the American marten (Martes americana), the American distribution of goshawks is largely concurrent with that of American red squirrels, indicating the particular significance of it as a dietary staple.Clough, L. T. (2000). Nesting habitat selection and productivity of northern goshawks in west-central Montana. University of Montana. In the Pacific northwest, the Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii) replaces the red squirrel in both distribution and as the highest contributor to goshawk diets from northern California to British Columbia. The largest occurrence of Douglas squirrel known was from Lake Tahoe, where they constituted 23% of prey by number and 32.9% by weight.Promessi, R. L., Matson, J. O., & Flores, M. (2004). Diets of nesting northern goshawks in the Warner Mountains, California. Western North American Naturalist, 359‚Äì363. Larger tree squirrels are also taken opportunistically, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) was the third most significant prey species. Much larger tree squirrels such as western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) and fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), both weighing about , are taken occasionally in North America. Ground squirrels are also important prey species, mostly in North America, 25 of 44 of squirrel species found in the diet are ground squirrels. Particularly widely reported as a secondary food staple from Oregon, Wyoming, California and Arizona was the golden-mantled ground squirrel (Callospermophilus lateralis). In Nevada and Idaho‚Äôs Sawtooth National Forest, the Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi) fully dominated the food spectrum, comprising up to 74.3% of the prey by number and 84.2% by biomass. Even much bigger ground squirrels such as prairie dogs and marmots are attacked on occasion.Feldhamer, G. A., Thompson, B. C., & Chapman, J. A. (2003). Wild mammals of North America: biology, management, and conservation. JHU Press.Slobodchikoff, C., B. Perla, J. Verdolin. 2009. Prairie Dogs: Communication and Community in an Animal Society. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. Several hoary marmots (Marmota caligala) were brought to nests in southeast Alaska but averaged only , so were young animals about half of the average adult (spring) weight (albeit still considerably heavier than the goshawks who took them). In some cases, adult marmots such as alpine marmots (Marmota marmota), yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) and woodchucks (Marmota monax) have been preyed upon when lighter and weaker in spring, collectively weighing on average about or about three times as much as a female goshawk although are basically half of what these marmots can weigh by fall.Perrone, A., Macchi, E., & Durio, P. (1992). Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) predation on marmot (Marmota marmota). In Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Alpine Marmot (Marmota marmota) and on genus Marmota (pp. 239‚Äì240). About a dozen species of chipmunk are known to be taken by goshawks and the eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were the second most numerous prey species at nests in central New York and Minnesota. Squirrels taken have ranged in size from the least chipmunk (Tamias minimus) to the aforementioned adult marmots.Verts, B. J., & Carraway, L. N. (2001). Tamias minimus. Mammalian Species, 1-10. =Hares and rabbits= rabbit, by G. E. Lodge Northern goshawks can be locally heavy predators of lagomorphs, of which they take at least 15 species as prey. Especially in the Iberian peninsula, the native European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is often delivered to nests and can be the most numerous prey. Even where taken secondarily in numbers in Spain to gamebirds such as in La Segarra, Spain, rabbits tend to be the most significant contributor of biomass to goshawk nests. On average, the weight of rabbits taken in La Segarra was (making up 38.4% of the prey biomass there), indicating most of the 333 rabbits taken there were yearlings and about 2-3 times lighter than a prime adult wild rabbit. In England, where the European rabbit is an introduced species, it was the third most numerous prey species at nests. In more snowbound areas where wild and feral rabbits are absent, larger hares may be taken and while perhaps more difficult to subdue than most typical goshawk prey, are a highly nutritious food source. In Finland, females were found to take mountain hare (Lepus timidus) fairly often and they were the second most numerous prey item for goshawks in winter (14.8% by number). In North America, where mammals are more important in the diet, more lagomorphs are taken. In Oregon, snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are the largest contributor of biomass to goshawks foods (making up to 36.6% of the prey by weight), in eastern Oregon at least 60% of hares taken were adults weighing on average , and in one of three studies from Oregon be the most numerous prey species (second most numerous in the other two). This species was also the second most numerous food species in Alberta throughout the year and the most important prey by weight. Eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus), also averaging some in mass per the study (and thus mostly consisting of adult cottontails in their prime), were the most significant prey both by weight (42.3%) and number (13.3%) in Apache- Sitgreaves National Forest of Arizona. Eastern cottontails are also taken regularly in New York and Pennsylvania. In some parts of the range, larger leporids may be attacked, extending to the black-tailed (Lepus californicus) and the white-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii), the European hares (Lepus europaeus), as well as the mountain hare.Chapman, J. A., & Flux, J. E. (1990). Rabbits, hares and pikas: status survey and conservation action plan. IUCN. In Europe, males have been recorded successfully attacking rabbits weighing up to , or about 2.2 times their own weight, while adult mountain hares overtaken by female goshawks in Fennoscandia have weighed from or up to 2.4 times their own weight. Despite historic claims that taking prey so considerably larger than themselves is exceptional beyond a small region of Fennoscandia, there is evidence that as grouse numbers have mysteriously declined since 1960, adult mountain hare are increasingly the leading prey for wintering female goshawks, favoring and causing an increase of larger bodied females in order to overpower such a substantial catch. Asian and American goshawks also take about a half dozen species of pikas, much smaller cousins of rabbits and hares, but they are at best supplementary prey for American goshawks and of unknown importance to little-studied Asian populations.Bleisch, W. (2011). Asian Highlands Perspectives 18: Environmental Issues Facing Tibetan Pastoral Communities (Vol. 31). ASIAN HIGHLANDS PERSPECTIVES. =Other birds= Woodpeckers such as northern flickers often fall victim to goshawks Some 21 species of woodpecker have been reported from northern goshawk food studies around the world. With their relatively slow, undulating flight adult and fledged woodpeckers can easily be overtaken by hunting goshawks, not to mention their habitat preferences frequently put them within active goshawk ranges. Most of the widespread species from Europe and North America have been observed as prey, most commonly relatively large woodpeckers such as the greater spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) and the European green woodpecker (Picus viridis) in Europe and the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) in North America. Indeed, the flicker is the third most regularly reported prey species in America.Schreven, K. Een luchtbukskogeltje in een braakbal van een Havik Accipiter gentilis, in de context van jacht en loodvergifti-ging. De Takkeling, 225‚Äì229. In south-central Wyoming, the northern flicker was the second most numerous prey species and it was the main prey species in a study from New Mexico (here making up 26.4% of prey by number).Kennedy, P. L. (1989). The nesting ecology of Cooper's hawks and northern goshawks in the Jemez Mountains, NM: a summary of results, 1984-1988 (Final Report). Santa Fe National Forest: U.S.D.A. Forest Service. All sizes of woodpeckers available are taken from the lesser spotted woodpecker (Dryobates minor) to the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) in Europe and from the downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) to the pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) in North America. In many areas, northern goshawks will pursue water birds of several varieties, although they rarely form a large portion of the diet. Perhaps the most often recorded water birds in the diet are ducks. All told, 32 waterfowl have been recorded in their diet. In the Ural mountains, the nearly cosmopolitan mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) was third most numerous prey species. The ducks of the genus Aythya are somewhat frequently recorded as well, especially since their tree-nesting habits may frequently put them in the hunting range of nesting goshawks. Similarly, the wood duck (Aix sponsa) from America and the mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) from Asia may be more vulnerable than most waterfowl at their tree nests.Lever, C. (2013). The mandarin duck. Bloomsbury Publishing. Although etymologists feel that the goshawk is an abbreviation of ‚Äúgoose-hawk‚Äù, geese are seldomly taken considering their generally much larger size. Nonetheless, four species have been taken, including adults of species as large as the greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons).Madsen, J. (1988). Goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, harassing and killing brent geese Branta bernicla. Meddelelse fra Vildtbiologisk Station (Denmark).M√∏ller, A. P., Solonen, T., Byholm, P., Huhta, E., T√∏ttrup Nielsen, J. and Tornberg, R. 2012. Spatial consistency in susceptibility of prey species to predation by two Accipiter hawks. J. Avian Biol. 43. Adult common eiders (Somateria mollissima), the largest northern duck at , have also been captured by goshawks. Various other water birds reported as taken include red-throated loon (Gavia stellata) chicks, adult little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis), adult great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) (about the same size as a greater white-fronted goose), adult crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), black stork (Ciconia nigra) chicks and five species each of heron and rail. Among shorebirds (or small waders), goshawks have been reported preying on more than 22 sandpipers, more than 8 plovers, more than 10 species each of gull and tern, more than 2 species of alcids and the Eurasian stone-curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) and the long-tailed jaeger (Stercorarius longicaudus).Nethersole-Thompson, D. (2010). Waders: their breeding, haunts and watchers. A&C; Black. Juvenile in Japan with a young bird prey item Corvids as aforementioned are quite important prey. Although they take fewer passerines than other northern Accipiters, smaller types of songbirds can still be regionally important to the diet. This is especially true of the thrushes which are often delivered to nests in Europe. 17 species of thrush have been identified in goshawk food across their range. The numerous Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) is often most reported from this family and can even be the main prey at some locations such as in the Netherlands (23.5% of prey by number) and in Norway (just over 14% by number and two studies showed thrushes collectively make up nearly half of the prey items in Norwegian nests). All common Turdus species are taken in some numbers in Europe, being quite regular and conspicuous in the woodland edge zones most often patrolled by male goshawks, especially while singing in spring and summer. Even where larger, more nutritious prey is present such as at pheasant release sites, the abundant thrushes are more often delivered to the nest because of the ease of capture such as in Norway. Smaller numbers of thrush are taken in general in North America but the American robin (Turdus migratorius) are fairly regular prey nonetheless and were the most numerous prey in the Sierra Nevadas of California (30.7% by number and 21.4% by weight). Thrush taken have ranged in size from the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), the smallest bluebird and lightest North American thrush on average, to the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus), Europe's largest thrush. Beyond corvids and thrushes, most passerines encountered by northern goshawks are substantially smaller and are often ignored under most circumstances in favor of more sizable prey. Nonetheless, more than a hundred passerines have been recorded their diet beyond these families. Most widespread passerine families from North America and Europe have occasional losses to goshawks, including tyrant flycatchers, shrikes, vireos, larks, swallows, nuthatches, treecreepers, wrens, mimids, Old World warblers, Old World flycatchers, pipits and wagtails, starlings, waxwings, New World warblers, emberizine sparrows, cardinalids, icterids, finches and Old World sparrows. Avian prey has even ranged to as small as the goldcrest (Regulus regulus), the smallest bird in Europe. In North America, the smallest known bird prey is the American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). Among smaller types of passerines, one of the most widely reported are finches and, in some widespread studies, somewhat substantial numbers of finches of many species may actually be taken. Finches tend to fly more conspicuously as they cover longer distances, often bounding or undulating as they do, over the canopy than most forest songbirds, which may make them more susceptible to goshawk attacks than other small songbirds. Non-passerine upland birds taken by goshawks in small numbers include but are not limited to nightjars, swifts, bee-eaters, kingfishers, rollers, hoopoes and parrots.Roberson, A. M., Anderson, D. E., & Kennedy, P. L. (2003). The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) in the western Great Lakes Region: a technical conservation assessment. Minnesota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, University of Minnesota. =Other mammals= Outside of the squirrel family, relatively few other types of rodents are taken in many regions. In eastern Oregon, the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) (flying squirrels are not true squirrels) was the third or fourth most frequently caught prey species.Wells-Gosling, N. & Heaney, L.R. 1984. Glaucomys sabrinus. Mammalian Species No. 229. American Society of Mammalogists. Microtine rodents which are so essential to most northern non-accipiter hawks and a majority of owls are at best a secondary contributor to goshawk diets, even though 26 species have been reported in their diet. Exceptionally, in a study of the Carpathian mountains of the Ukraine, the common vole (Microtus arvalis) was the second most numerous prey species. Relatively high numbers of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) were reported in diets from Poland in Gmina Sob√≥tka and the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest.Gryz, J., & Krauze-Gryz, D. (2014). The influence of raptors (Falconiformes) and ravens (Corvus corax) on populations of game animals. Annals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW. Forestry and Wood Technology, 114‚Äì125. During summer in Alberta, the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) was the third most frequently reported prey species, the only known study where large numbers of microtine rodents were taken in North America.Reich, L. M. (1981). Microtus pennsylvanicus. Mammalian species, (159), 1-8. Microtine rodents taken by goshawks have ranged in size from the western harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis) to the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). Other miscellaneous rodents reported sporadically in the diet include dormice, porcupines, kangaroo rats, mountain beavers (Aplodontia rufa), jumping mice, Old World mice and rats, zokors, gophers and jirds.Begall, S., Burda, H., & Schleich, C. E. (2007). Subterranean rodents: news from underground. In Subterranean Rodents (pp. 3-9). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.Adamian, M. S., & Klem, D. (1999). Handbook of the Birds of Armenia. American University of Armenia. Insectivores are taken in low numbers including moles, shrews and hedgehogs.Curnutt, J. (2007). Conservation Assessment for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) Linnaeus in the Western Great Lakes. The smallest mammalian prey species known to be attacked by goshawks was the masked shrew (Sorex cinereus). Even more sporadically attacked by goshawks, given this prey's nocturnal habits, are bats. In one case a juvenile golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), which was successfully taken by a goshawk. Ungulates such as deer and sheep are sometimes consumed by goshawks but there is no evidence that they prey on live ones (as much larger accipitrids such as eagles can sometimes do), but these are more likely rare cases of scavenging on carrion, which may more regularly occur than once thought in areas with harsh winter weather. =Alternate prey= In a few cases, northern goshawks have been recorded hunting and killing prey beyond birds and mammals. In some of the warmer drier extensions of their range, reptiles may be available to them to hunt. Only one species of snake is recorded from their diet, the small innocuous grass snake (Natrix natrix), at ; however about a half dozen lizards are recorded in their diet, primarily from the Iberian peninsula but also from the Ural mountains and the American southwest. The only known location in the northern goshawk's range where reptiles were taken in large numbers was Sierra de Guadarrama, Spain, where the ocellated lizard (Timon lepidus) was the second most numerous prey species. Amphibians are even rarer in the diet, only recorded more than singly in one study each from Spain and from England. Fish are similarly rare in the diet, recorded twice each in Bavaria and Belarus. A few pellets have included remains of insects, much of which may be ingested incidentally or via the stomachs of birds that they have consumed. However, there is some evidence they at times will hunt large ground-dwelling insects such as dung beetles.Thiollay, J. M. (1967). Ecologie d‚Äôune population de rapaces diurnes en Lorraine. 116‚Äì183.Young, O. P. (2015). Predation on dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae): a literature review. Transactions of the American Entomological Society, 111‚Äì155. =Interspecies predatory relationships= Chasing an osprey, most likely to rob it of food, but the osprey is even considered possible prey Northern goshawks are often near the top of the avian food chain in forested biomes but face competition for food resources from various other predators, including both birds and mammals. Comparative dietary studies have shown that mean sizes of prey, both in terms of its size relative to the raptor itself and absolute weight, for goshawks is relatively larger than in most buteonine hawks in North America and Europe.Marti, C. D., Korpim√§ki, E., & Jaksiƒá, F. M. (1993). Trophic structure of raptor communities: a three-continent comparison and synthesis. In Current ornithology (pp. 47‚Äì137). Springer US. Studies show even buteonine hawks slightly larger than goshawks on average take prey weighing less than whereas average goshawk prey is usually well over such a mass. This is due largely to the much higher importance of microtine rodents to most buteonine hawks, which, despite their occasional abundance, are ignored by goshawks in most regions. Similarly, mean prey mass for sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks in North America is between about 10 and 30% of their own mass, whereas the mean prey of American goshawks is between about 25 and 50% of their own mass and therefore are the goshawks takes prey that is on average relatively much larger. In many of the ecosystems that they inhabit, northern goshawks compete with resources with other predators, particularly where they take sizeable numbers of lagomorphs. About a dozen mammalian and avian predators in each area all primarily consume European rabbits and snowshoe hares alongside goshawks in the Iberian peninsula and the American boreal forest regions where these became primary staple foods. Like those co-habitant predators, the goshawk suffers declines during the low portion in the lagomorph's breeding cycles, which rise and fall cyclically every 10 to 12 years. However, even where these are primary food sources, the northern goshawk is less specialized than many (even Bubo owls, some of the more generalist avian predators become extremely specialized lagomorph hunters locally, to a greater extent than goshawks) and can alternate their food selection, often taking equal or greater numbers of tree squirrels and woodland birds. Due to this dietary variation, the northern goshawk is less affected than other raptorial birds by prey population cycles and tends to not be depleted by resource competition. Despite their propensity to pursue relatively large prey and capability to pursue alternate prey, northern goshawks can be locally outcompeted for resources by species that are more adaptable and flexible, especially in terms of habitat and prey. Most northern buteonine hawks largely take small rodents such as voles (which are usually ignored by goshawks) but can adapt to nearly any other type of prey when the staple local rodent prey populations go down. Comparisons with goshawks and red-tailed hawk nesting in abutting areas of Arizona (other large common Buteos like Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsonii) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) utilize open habitats and so do not come into conflict with goshawks) shows the red-tailed hawks as being able to take a broader range of prey than goshawks and nest in more varied habitats, the latter species being perhaps the most commonly seen, widespread and adaptable of diurnal American raptors.Preston, C. R. (2000). Red-tailed hawk. Stackpole Books. On occasion, goshawks are robbed of their prey by a diversity of other birds, including harriers, other hawks, eagles, falcons and even gulls.Ponitz I. 1992. [White-tailed Eagle and Western Marsh Harrier steal prey from Northern Goshawk!] Falke 39. p. 209. Northern goshawks from North America are less prone to nesting outside of mature forests and take larger numbers of mammals as opposed to abundant birds than in Europe. This may be in part due to heavier competition from a greater diversity of raptors in North America. In Europe, the goshawk only co-exists with the much smaller sparrowhawk within its own genus, while in North America, it lives with the intermediately-sized Cooper's hawk. The latter species much more readily nests in semi-open and developed areas of North America than goshawks there and hunts a broad assemblage of medium-sized birds, whereas such prey is more readily available to male goshawks from Europe than to goshawks in North America. Although the Cooper's hawk usually avoids and loses individual contests against the larger goshawk, its adaptability has allowed it to become the most widespread and commonly found North American Accipiter.Kenward, R. E. (1996). Goshawk Adaptation to Deforestation: Does Europe Differ From North. Raptors in Human Landscapes: Adaptation to Built and Cultivated Environments, 233.Reynolds, R. T., & Wight, H. M. (1978). Distribution, density, and productivity of accipiter hawks breeding in Oregon. The Wilson Bulletin, 182‚Äì196. The slightly larger goshawks of Europe have been shown, in some but not all areas, to outcompete and possibly lower productivity of the slightly smaller common buzzard (Buteo buteo) when their ranges overlap. Usually, however, the dietary habits and nesting preferences are sufficiently distinct and thus effect neither buzzard or goshawk populations. Both can mutually be very common even when the other is present.Looft, V. & Biesterfeld, G. (1981). Habicht ‚Äì Accipiter gentilis. In: Looft, V. & G. Busche (Hrsg.). Vogelwelt Schleswig- Holsteins. Greifv√∂gel. Wachholtz, Neum√ºnster. On the other hand, American goshawks are slightly smaller on average than their European counterparts and can be up to 10% smaller in mass than red-tailed hawks. However, studies have indicated that the goshawk has, beyond its superior speed and agility, has stronger feet and a more forceful attack than that of the red-tailed hawk. All in all, individual competitions between red-tailed hawks and goshawks can go either way and neither is strongly likely to deter the other from nesting given their distinct nesting habitats.Goslow, G. E. (1971). The attack and strike of some North American raptors. The Auk, 815-827.Sprunt, A., & May, J. B. (1955). North American birds of prey. Published under the sponsorship of the National Aububon Society by Harper. Other raptors, including most medium to large-sized owls as well as red-tailed hawks and falcons, will use nests built by northern goshawks, even when goshawks are still in the area. Illustration of the formidable talons and beak, which are both proportionately large relative to their size, and give them a predatory advantage over many other raptors To many other raptorial birds, the northern goshawk is more significant as a predatory threat than as competition. The northern goshawk is one of the most dangerous species to other raptors, especially to those considerably smaller than itself. In many cases, raptors of any age from nestlings to adults are taken around their nests but free-flying raptors too are readily taken or ambushed at a perch.Sergio, F., & Hiraldo, F. (2008). Intraguild predation in raptor assemblages: a review. Ibis, 150(s1), 132‚Äì145. One example is a study from northern England, the common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), which average about , recorded as prey at goshawk nests (mainly in March and April) numbered 139, a larger number than kestrels recorded alive in the spring in the same area. In the Veluwe province of the Netherlands, the percentage of nest of European honey buzzards (Pernis apivorus), weighing on average , predated by goshawks increased from a little as 7.7% in 1981‚Äì1990 to 33% in 2000‚Äì2004. As their habitat preferences may overlap with goshawks, all other Accipiters encountered may be predated in multiple cases, including the Eurasian sparrowhawk, the levant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes), the sharp- shinned hawk, the Japanese sparrowhawk (Accipiter gularis) and the Cooper's hawk. Other assorted accipitrids of up to their own size to be predated by goshawks include the black kite (Milvus migrans), the red kite (Milvus milvus), the western marsh-harrier (Circus aeruginosus), the Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), the pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and Buteos of up to adults including the common buzzard, the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) and the red-tailed hawk.Snow, D. & Perrins, C. 1998.

Breeding biology of broad-winged and red- shouldered hawks in western New York (Doctoral dissertation, State University of New York at Fredonia, 1984--Department of Biology.) Even raptors somewhat larger than a northern goshawks have been considered as prey, although it is not clear whether adults are among the victims, including the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), crested honey-buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus) and the lesser spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina).Finlayson, C. (2011). Avian Survivors: the history and biogeography of Palearctic birds (Vol. 16). A&C; Black. Outside of the accipitrid group, heavy predation on different varieties of raptorial birds by northern goshawks can continue unabated. Many types of owl are taken and in Europe, the northern goshawk is the second most prolific predator of owls behind the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). In Bavaria, Germany, the long- eared owl (Asio otus) was the second most common prey species for nesting goshawks. In the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest of Poland, fairly high numbers of the tawny owl (Strix alucco) were taken. In all, some 18 species of owl have been recorded in the diet, ranging in size from the Eurasian (Glaucidium passerinum) and northern pygmy owls (Glaucidium gnoma) at and , respectively, to all the large northern Strix owls including adults and even the great horned owl. Whether adults have ever been killed as prey though is unknown but goshawks have been known to kill great horned owls that they've found near their nests. In addition, about eight species of falcon have been identified in the foods of goshawks. Adult falcons of small species such as kestrels and merlins (Falco columbarius) can be overpowered quite easily if they can manage to surprise the prey. Larger falcons have turned up in the diet as well, including the prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus) and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug), although possible only nestlings of these species. Brief aerial skirmishes between goshawks and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) have been described but neither species is known to have killed one another in the wild.Stewart, B.S. & DeLong, R.L. (1984). Black-shoulder kite and northern goshawk interactions with peregrine falcons at San Miguel Island, California. Western Birds 15:187‚Äì188, In Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, at least four small passerines species were recorded as nesting close to active goshawk nest, due to the incidental shelter that the fierce goshawks inadvertently provides from smaller raptors which are their main predators. Such raptors, including Eurasian kestrels, Eurasian sparrowhawks and long-eared owls, not only avoid goshawk activity where possible but also were found to have lower nest productivity any time they nested relatively close to goshawks per the study. A similar phenomenon, with goshawks inadvertently providing shelter to small passerines, has been recorded in North America as well. Prey selection frequently overlaps between goshawks and American martens, seldom will both species prey on the other Competition for northern goshawks can also come from mammalian carnivores. Martens, and to a lesser extent other weasels, are presumably one of their more major competitors as their diet often consists of similar prey primarily during spring and summer, tree squirrels and woodland birds, but little has been studied in terms of how the two types of predator effect each other. Most recorded interactions have been predatory, as the goshawk has been recorded preying on a dozen species, from the least weasel (Mustela nivalis) to the stone marten (Martes foina).Nowak, R. M. (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World (Vol. 1). JHU Press. Northern goshawks have also been recorded as feeding on much bigger predators such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), but it is not clear whether these were actual kills, as many may be encountered as already dead carrion.Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol. II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), V.G. Heptner and N.P. Naumov editors, Science Publishers, Inc. USA. 1998. Choate, J. R., Wilson, D. E., & Ruff, S. (2001). The Smithsonian book of North American mammals. Domestic carnivores are sometimes eaten, including dogs and cats, the latter of which has reportedly been taken alive by goshawks. The red fox is a surprisingly considerable competitor for resources with northern goshawks. It was found in Norway that goshawk numbers were higher when voles were at peak numbers, not due to voles as a food source but because foxes were more likely to eat the rodents and ignore grouse, whereas during low vole numbers the foxes are more likely to compete with goshawks over grouse as prey. A decrease of the fox population of Norway due to sarcoptic mange was found result in an increase of grouse numbers and, in turn, northern goshawks. In some areas, red foxes have been found to steal up to half of the goshawks‚Äô kills.Ziesemer, F. (1981). Methods of assessing goshawk predation. Understanding the goshawk, 144-150. Unlike the predators at the top of the avian food chain such as eagles and the largest owls, which are rarely endangered by predation as adults, the northern goshawk is itself susceptible to a fairly extensive range of predators. The most deadly are likely to be the Eurasian eagle owl and the great horned owl, which not only predate goshawks of any age and at any season but also opportunistically take over their own prior nests as their own nesting site. Of the two, the American horned owl nesting habits are more similar to goshawks, which most often consists of tree nests whereas the eagle owl usually nests in rock formations. Thus, the northern goshawk is more likely to victimized by the great horned owls, which can stage nightly ambushes and destroy an entire goshawk family as they pick off both adults and nestlings. In radio-tagging studies of adult and immature goshawks in the Great Lakes region and Arizona, up to half of the studied birds were killed by great horned owls at night, while the horned owls accounted for 40% of the nest failures in studies from Arizona and New Mexico.Ward, J. M., & Kennedy, P. L. (1996). Effects of supplemental food on size and survival of juvenile Northern Goshawks. The Auk, 200‚Äì208.Rohner, C. and F. I. Doyle. 1992. Food-stressed Great Horned Owl kills adult goshawk: exceptional observation or community process? Journal of Raptor Research, 26:261‚Äì263. In comparison, in Schleswig-Holstein, 59% of reintroduced eagle owls used nests built by goshawks and no goshawk pairs could successfully nest within of an active eagle-owl nest. 18% of nest failures here positively were attributed to eagle owl predation, with another 8% likely due to eagle-owls. Other larger raptorial birds can threaten them. The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in North America, have killed wintering goshawks, but given the discrepancy in their habitat preferences, such cases are presumably rare. Other avian predators known to have successfully preyed on goshawks including adults (usually in singular cases) include white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla), eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca), snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus), Ural owls (Strix uralensis) and red-tailed hawks.Voous, K. H., & Ad, C. (1989). Owls of the northern hemisphere. MIT Press. The same mammalian predators that sometimes compete for food with northern goshawks also sometimes kill them, with the nestlings, fledglings and brooding females, all with impaired flight due to their wing feather moults, seemingly the most vulnerable. In one case, the American marten, which at is the smallest marten and is sometimes taken as prey by the goshawks, successfully ambushed and preyed on a brooding female goshawk.Paragi, T. G. and G. M. Wholecheese. 1994. Marten, Martes americana, predation on a northern goshawk, Accipiter gentilis. Can. Field-Nat. no. 108:81-82.Holyan, J. A., Jones, L. L., & Raphael, M. G. (1998). American Marten Use of Cabins as Resting Sites in Central Oregon. Northwestern Naturalist, 68-70. In Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest of Wisconsin, the main source of mortality for northern goshawks is reintroduced fishers (Martes pennanti), which are the largest kind of marten at and capably kill many chicks, fledglings and brooding females.Aubry, K. B., & Raley, C. M. (2006). Ecological characteristics of fishers (Martes pennanti) in the southern Oregon Cascade range . USDA Forest Service‚ÄîPacific Northwest Research Station. Olympia Forestry Sciences Laboratory, Olympia, WA, In contrast, in Europe, the pine marten (Martes martes) has only been known to prey on young goshawks still in the nest and not adults.Link, H. (1986). Untersuchungen am Habicht (Accipiter gentilis). PhD thesis, Friedrich-Alexander Universitat, Erlangen- Nurnberg, Germany. Other mammals capable of climbing trees have been observed or inferred to predate goshawks, either mostly or entirely young in the nests, including wolverines (Gulo gulo), North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus) and American black bears (Ursus americanus).Doyle, F.

Management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the southwestern United States. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-217. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 90 p Overall, the range of nest predators is more extensive in North America than in Eurasia, in the latter continent most recorded nest depredations are by eagle owls, with martens and corvids usually only preying on goshawk nestlings when low food supplies cause the goshawks to have lower nest attendance (and presumably effect these predators to the extent that they take the risk of coming to the goshawk nest). Fledgling goshawks are also vulnerable to canids such as coyotes (Canis latrans), gray wolves (Canis lupus) and red foxes as they may perch lower to the ground and are clumsier, more unsteady and less cautious than older birds. In one case, a goshawk that was ambushed and killed at a kill by a mangy vixen fox was able to lethally slash the windpipe of the fox, which apparently died moments after partially consuming the goshawk. Apart from aforementioned predation events, northern goshawks have at times been killed by non-predators, including prey that turned the tables on their pursuer, as well as in hunting accidents. In one case, a huge group (or murder) of hooded crows heavily mobbed a goshawk that they caught in a relatively open spot, resulting in a prolonged attack that ended up killing the goshawk. In another instance, a goshawk drowned while attempting to capture a tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). One young goshawk managed to escape a red fox that had caught it with a chewed wing, only to drown in a nearby creek. Another, and rather gruesome, hunting mishap occurred when a goshawk caught a large mountain hare and, while attempting to hold it in place by grasping vegetation with its other foot, was torn in half.  Breeding Egg Collection Museum Wiesbaden The northern goshawk is one of the most extensively studied raptors in terms of its breeding habits. Adult goshawks return to their breeding grounds usually between March and April, but locally as early as February.Lee, J. A. 1981. Comparative breeding behavior of the goshawk and Cooper's hawk. Master's Thesis, Brigham Young Univ., Provo, UT. If prey levels remain high, adults may remain on their breeding ground all year. Courtship flights, calls and even nest building has been recorded in Finland exceptionally in September and October right after young dispersed, whereas in most of Fennoscandia, breeding does not commence any earlier than March and even then only when it is a warm spring.Sulkava, S., Huhtala, K., & Tornberg, R. (1994). Regulation of Goshawk Accipiter gentilis breeding in Western Finland over the last 30 years. Raptor conservation today, 67‚Äì76. Most breeding activity occurs between April and July, exceptionally a month earlier or later. Even in most areas of Alaska, most pairs have produced young by May. Courtship flights typical are above the canopy on sunny, relatively windless days in early spring with the goshawks‚Äô long main tail feathers held together and the undertail coverts spread so wide to give them an appearance of having a short, broad-tail with a long dark strip extending from the center. Display flights not infrequently escalate into an undulating flight, similar to a wood pigeon but with sharper turns and descents, and are sometimes embellished with sky-dives that can cover over . One study found undulating display flights more than three times more often done by males than females. After display flights have concluded, the male typically brings a prepared fresh prey item to the female as part of the courtship. In general, these displays are presumably to show (or reinforce) to the potential mate their health and prowess as breeding partner. Copulation is brief and frequent, ranging up to nearly 520 times per clutch (on average about 10 times a day or 100-300 throughout the season), and may be the male's way of ensuring paternity since he is frequently away gathering food by the time of egg-laying, although extra-pair copulation is extremely rare. Female solicits copulations by facing away from male with drooped wings and flared tail-coverts. The male, wings drooped and tail-coverts flared, drops from a branch to gain momentum, then swoops upward and mounts her back. Both birds usually call while mating.M√∏ller, A. P. (1987). Copulation behaviour in the goshawk Accipiter gentilis. Anim. Behav. no. 35:755‚Äì763.Gavin, T. A., R. T. Reynolds, S. M. Joy, D. G. Leslie and B. May. (1998). Genetic evidence for low frequency of extra- pair fertilizations in Northern Goshawk. Condor no. 100 (3):556-560. Fidelity studies from Europe show that about 80‚Äì90% of adult females breed with the same male in consecutive years, whereas up to 96% of males mate with the same female in consecutive years. In California, 72% of males retained relationship with the same mates in consecutive years while 70% of females did the same.Detrich, P. J. and B. Woodbridge. 1994. Territory fidelity, mate fidelity, and movements of color-marked northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in the southern Cascades of California. Stud. Avian Biol. no. 16:130-132. Males intruding in Hamburg, Germany territories were in some cases not evicted and ended up mating with the female, with the male of the pair not stopping it. In migratory, northernmost populations, mate retention in consecutive years is low. Males are sometimes killed by females during courtship and encounters can be dangerous especially if he does not bring food to courtship and he often seems nervous withdrawing with a trill at a given chance.Kollinger, D. (1964). Weitere Beobachtungen zur Biologie des Habichts. Deutscher Falkenorden: 9-18. =Nest characteristics= Nests are usually large structures placed quite high near the canopy on mature, tall trees, as seen on this birch in Norway Nesting areas are indefinite, a nest may be used for several years, also a nest built years prior may be used or an entirely new nest may be constructed. When nest constructing, the pair will often roost together. Males construct most new nests but females may assist somewhat if reinforcing old nests. While the male is building, the female perches in the vicinity, occasionally screaming, sometimes flying to inspect the nest.Holstein, V. (1942). Dueh√∏gen Astur gentilis dubius (Sparrman). Hirschprung, Copenhagen, Denmark. At other times, the female may take a more active role, or even the primary one, in new nest construction and this is subject to considerable individual variation. For the nesting tree, more than 20 species of conifer have been used including spruce, fir, larch, pine and hemlock. Broadleaf trees used including ash, alder, aspen, beech, birch, elm, hickory, hornbeam, lime, maple (including sycamore), oak, poplar, tamarack, wild cherry and willow. In some areas, the nests may be lined with hard pieces of bark and also with green sprigs of conifers. Often the tallest tree in a given stand is selected as the nest tree and this is often the dominant tree species within the given region and forest. Therefore, hardwood trees are usually used as the nesting tree in the eastern United States while conifers are usually used in the western United States.Speiser, R. and T. Bosakowski. 1991.

Tech. Ser (No. 11). In the dwarf trees of the tundra, nests have been found at only off the ground, and, in the tundra and elsewhere, very rarely on felled trees, stumps or on the ground.Bent, A. C. (1938). Life histories of North American birds of prey: order Falconiformes (No. 170). US Government Printing Office. In some studies from North America up to 15% of nests are in dead trees but this is far rarer in Eurasia.Porter, T. W., & Wilcox Jr, H. H. (1941). Goshawk nesting in Michigan. The Wilson Bulletin, 43-44. More significant than species is the maturity and height of the nesting tree, its structure (which should have ample surface around the main fork) and, perhaps most significantly, little to no understory below it. Multiple studies note the habit of nests being built in forests close to clear-fellings, swamps and heaths, lakes and meadows, roads (especially light-use logging dirt roads), railways and swathes cut along power cables, usually near such openings there'd be prominent boulders, stones or roots of fallen trees or low branches to use as plucking points. Canopy cover averaged between 60 and 96% in Europe. As is typical in widely distributed raptors from temperate-zones, those from cold regions faced south, 65% in Alaska, 54% in Norway and also in high latitudes such as sky-forests of the Arizona Rockies, otherwise usually nests face north and east.Crocker- Bedford, D. C., & Chaney, B. (1988). Characteristics of goshawk nesting stands. In Proceedings of the Southwest raptor management symposium and workshop. Nat. Wildl. Fed. Sci. Tech. Ser (No. 11, pp. 210‚Äì217). Nests, especially after initial construction, may average between in length and in width, and are around deep.Bijlsma, R.G. (1993). Ecologische atlas van de Nederlandse roofvogels. Haarlem, Schuyt & Co. After many uses, a nest can range up to across and in depth and can weigh up to a ton when wet. Northern goshawks may adopt nests of other species, common buzzards contributed 5% of nests used in Schleswig-Holstein, including unusually exposed ones on edges of woods and another 2% were built by common ravens or carrion crows, but 93% were built by the goshawks themselves. While colonizing peri-urban areas in Europe, they may displace Eurasian sparrowhawks not only from their territories but may actually try to use overly small sparrowhawk nests, usually resulting in nest collapse. One nest was used continuously by different pairs for a period of 17 years.Schioler, E.L. (1931). Danmarks Fugle III, Copenhagen, Denmark. A single pair may maintain up to several nests, usually up to two will occur in an area of no more than a few hundred kilometers. One nest may be used in sequential years, but often an alternate is selected. During an 18-year-study from Germany, many alternate nests were used, 27 pairs had two, 10 had 3, 5 had 4, one had five and one pair had as many as 11. Other regions where pairs had on average two nests were Poland, California and Arizona‚Äôs Kaibab Plateau. The extent of use of alternate nests is unknown as well as their benefit, but they may reduce significant levels of parasites and diseases within the nest. In central Europe, the goshawk's nest area can be as small of woods and less than 10 hectares are commonplace. Usually only 1 active nest occurs per , are they avoid edges as nest sites and occupied nests are seldom less than apart. The most closely spaced active nests by a separate pair on record was in central Europe, another case of two active nests apart in Germany was a possible case of polygamy. =Eggs= The eggs are laid at 2- to 3-day intervals on average between April and June (usually May), taking up to 9 days for a clutch of 3‚Äì4 and 11 days for a clutch of 5. The eggs are rough, unmarked pale bluish or dirty white. In A. g, atricapillus, the average dimensions of the eggs are reported at in height by in width, with ranges of x . In Spanish eggs, the average dimensions were compared to German ones, which averaged . Goshawks from Lapland, Finland lay the largest known eggs at x , while other Finnish goshawk eggs ranged from x . Weight of the eggs average in America, in Great Britain and in Poland and Germany, with extreme weights from the latter nations of .Glutz von Blotzheim, U., Bauer, K. & Bezzel, E. (1971). Hanbuch der Vogel Mittleeuropa. Vol. 4: Falconiformes. Akademische Verslagsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Clutch size almost always averages between 2 and 4 eggs, with a median around 3, rarely as few as 1 or as many 5‚Äì6 will be laid.Huhtala, K., & Sulkava, S. (1981). Environmental influences on goshawk breeding in Finland. Understanding the goshawk. The International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey, Oxford, United Kingdom, 89-104. In combination spring weather and prey population levels seem to drive both egg laying dates and clutch size. If an entire clutch is lost, a replacement can be laid within 15 to 30 days. =Parental behavior= Mother goshawk seldom leaves the nest in either the incubation or the brooding stage, until the young are about 2 weeks During incubation, females tend to become quieter and more inconspicuous. The mother can develop a brooding patch of up to on her underside. She may turn the eggs as frequently as every 30 to 60 minutes. Males may incubate as many as 1 to 3 hours, but usually less than an hour, early in incubation but rarely do so later on. During daylight females can do as much as 96% of the observed incubation. The incubation stage last for any time between 28 and 37 days (rarely up to 41 days in exceptionally big clutches), varying in different parts of the range. After hatching occurs, the male does not come directly to the nest but instead just delivers food (usually already plucked, beheaded or otherwise dismembered) to a branch near the nest which the female tears apart and shares between herself and the nestlings. Food deliveries by the male can be daily or as infrequent as every 3 to 5 days. In turn, the female must feed the young about twice a day in order for the chicks to avoid starvation. Caching of food has been recorded near the nest, but only before the young start feeding themselves. Food deliveries must average about per young goshawk per day for them to successfully fledge, or total daily and throughout the season for an average sized clutch of around three. Females will also start capturing prey later on, but usually only after the young have already fledged. In Europe, female goshawks may press down on their nest if a human approaches, others may unobtrusively leave the nest, although are more reluctant to leave the nest late in incubation. In North America, the behavior of parent goshawks differs, as they often vigorously defend their territories fiercely from all intruders, including passing humans. The northern goshawk has a reputation as the most aggressive American raptor when the vicinity of their nest is approached. Here, when the nest is approached (especially soon after hatching) the goshawk will engage in their defensive kakking vocal display accompanied by exaggerated swooping in flight which quickly phases into a violent attack, potentially causing painful (but usually minor) injuries and blood loss. Research has indicated that attacks on humans are mostly done by adult females (more than 80% of the time) and are rarely pressed unless a person is by themselves. However, large groups and loud noise can appear to irritate the female and may cause her to attack the next lone person who comes near the nest. The higher aggression towards humans in North America than in Europe has been linked to both a more extensive range of potential nest predators for American goshawks causing them to develop a more aggressive display or the lower rates of persecution in America than in Europe, which may account for the relative shyness in the latter continent. Occasionally, both males and females have been recorded abandoning the nest and their mates. There are a few rare cases where males successfully reared up to 4 young after the female abandoned the nest or was killed between the 2 and 3rd week. Otherwise male will continue delivering prey but without the female all the nestlings will starve to death and the food simply rots.Uttendorfer, O. (1939). Die Ernahrung der deustchen Raubvogel und Eulen und ihre Bedeutung in der heimischen Natur. Neumann,-Neudamm, Melsungen, Germany. In cases where the male abandons the female and the brood, she may be able to successfully brood but usually only one nestling is likely to survive to fledge without the male's contribution of prey. At other times the mother may be replaced, sometimes forcefully, by another female, usually an older mature one. Exceptional cases of polygamy, with a male mating with two females, have been reported in Germany and The Netherlands and typically these breeding attempts fail. =Hatching and development= Nestling northern goshawks in Germany Hatching is asynchronous but not completely, usually an average sized clutch takes only 2 to 3 days to hatch, although it may take up to 6 days to hatch a clutch of more than 4 eggs. Hatchlings start calling from within the shell as much as 38 hours before hatching, as a faint chep, chep, chack, peep, peep, peep may be heard. The young are covered with down and altricial (as are all raptors) at first but develop rapidly. Hatchlings measure about long at first and grow about in length each week until they fledge. The mothers typically brood the nestlings intensively for about two weeks, around the time grayer feathers start to develop through the nestlings‚Äô down. The most key time for development may be at three weeks when the nestlings can stand a bit and start to develop their flight feathers. Also at the three-week stage, they can reach about half the adults‚Äô weight and females start to noticeably outgrow the males. However, this growth requires increased food delivery so frequently results in lower nest attendance and, in turn, higher predation rates. Also rates of starvation at this stage can exceed 50% especially in the youngest of large clutches of 4 to 5. Nestlings at 4 weeks are starting to develop strong flight feathers, which they frequently flap; also they can start to pull on food but are still mainly fed by female and begin to make a whistling scream when she goes to fetch food from the male. More active feeding behavior by nestlings may increase their aggression towards each other. By the 5th week, they've developed many typical goshawk behaviors, sometimes mantling over food, testing balance by extending one leg and one wing at edge of nest (called \\"warbling\\" by falconers) and can wag their tails vigorously. Starvation risk also increases at this point due to their growing demands and, due to their incessant begging calls, vocal activity may court predators. In 6th week, they become \\"branchers\\", although still spend much of the time by the nest, especially by the edge. The young goshawks \\"play\\" by seizing and striking violent at a perch or by yanking off leaves and tossing them over their back. Wing feathers do not develop highly dimorphically, but male branchers are better developed than females who have more growing to do and can leave the nest up to 1‚Äì3 days sooner. The young rarely return to the nest after being 35 to 46 days of age and start their first flight another 10 days later, thus becoming full fledglings. Goshawk nestlings frequently engage in ‚Äúrunting‚Äù, wherein the older siblings push aside and call more loudly and are thus are feed more often at food deliveries, until the younger siblings may either starve to death, be trampled or killed by their siblings (referred to as siblicide or ‚Äúcainism‚Äù). There is some evidence that mother goshawks may lessen the effects of runting by delaying incubation until their last eggs are laid. Food supply may be linked to higher rates of siblicides and, in many locations with consistent prey levels, runting and siblicide can occur somewhat seldomly (meaning the northern goshawk is a ‚Äúfacultative‚Äù rather than ‚Äúobligate cainist‚Äù).Manosa, S. (1991). Biologia tofica, us de l'habitat I biologia de la rproduccio de l'Astor Accipiter gentilis (Linnaeus 1758) a la Segarra. PhD thesis, University of Barcelona, Spain.Boal, C. W. and J. E. Bacorn. 1994. Siblicide and cannibalism in northern goshawk nests. Auk no. 111:748-750.Estes, W. A., Dewey, S. R., & Kennedy, P. L. (1999). Siblicide at Northern Goshawk nests: Does food play a role? The Wilson Bulletin, 432‚Äì436. Nonetheless, either by predation, starvation or siblicide, few nests produce more than 2 to 3 fledglings. One pair in North America was able to successfully fledge all four of its young.Lee, J. A. (1981). Comparative breeding behavior of the goshawk and Cooper's hawk. Master's Thesis, Brigham Young Univ., Provo, UT. Somewhat larger numbers of female fledglings are produced in Europe with their larger size, but the opposite is true in North America where sexual dimorphism is less pronounced. When food supplies are very high, though, European goshawks actually can produce somewhat more males than females. Two juveniles from Pennsylvania after they've become \\"branchers\\", or have left the nest but are not yet flying competently At about 50 days old, the young goshawks may start hunting on their own but more often eat carrion either provided by parents or biologists. Most fledglings stay within of the nest at 65 days of age but can wander up to before dispersal at between 65‚Äì80 days old in sync with the full development of their flight feathers. Between 65 and 90 days after hatching, more or less all young goshawks become independent. There is no evidence that parents aggressively displace the young in the fall (as other raptorial birds have sometimes been reported to do), therefore the young birds seek independence on their own. Goshawk siblings are not cohesive together past 65 days, except for some lingering young females, whereas common buzzard broods are not recorded at their nests after 65 days but remain strongly cohesive with each other. 5% of radio-tagged young in Gotland, Sweden (entirely males) were found to disperse to another breeding area and join a different brood as soon as their flight feathers were developed enough. These seem to be cases of moving to a better food area. Parents and adoptive young seem to tolerate this, although parents do not seem to be able to tell the difference between their own and other young. It is only after dispersal that goshawks typically start to hunt and seem to drink more often than older birds, sometimes spend up to an hour bathing. =Breeding success rates= Nest success averages between 80 and 95% in terms of the number of nests that produce fledglings, with an average number of 2 to 3 fledglings per nest. About equal numbers of eggs and nestlings may be lost (6% lost in each the incubation and brooding periods per a study from Arizona) but according to a study from Spain large clutches of 4 to 5 had higher losses overall than medium-sized clutches of 2 to nearly 4. Total losses averaged 36% in Spain across clutches of 2‚Äì5. Similar results were found in Germany, with similar numbers of fledglings produced in very large clutches (more than 4) as in medium-sized ones (2‚Äì4). A grading of success from a study in Sweden found categories of competent and less competent pairs, with losses averaging 7% and 17% in these two groups, respectively.Wikman, M., & Linden, H. (1981). The influence of food supply on goshawk population size. Understanding the goshawk, 105‚Äì113. Studies from Finland and the Yukon Territory found that average number of fledglings varied dramatically based on food supply based on the cyclical nature of most prey in these northern areas, varying from average success rates of 0 to 3.9 fledglings in the latter region. Similar wide variations in breeding success in correlation to prey levels were noted at other areas, including Nevada (where the number of fledglings could be up to seven times higher when lagomorphs were at their population peaks) and Wisconsin. =Nesting failure= Poor weather, which consists of cold springs that bear late cold spells, snow, and freezing rain, causes many nests to fail, and may also hamper courtship and lower brood size and overall breeding attempts.Kostrzewa, A. and R. Kostrzewa. 1990. The relationship of spring and summer weather with density and breeding performance of the Buzzard Buteo buteo, Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, and kestrel Falco tinnunculus. Ibis no. 132: 550‚Äì559. However, the most important cause of nest failure was found to be nest destruction by humans and other predations, starvation, then bad weather and collapse of nests in declining order. On average, humans are responsible based on known studies for about 17% of nest failures in Europe. 32% of 97 nestlings in Bavaria, Germany died because of human activities, while 59% of 111 broods in England failed due to this factor.Marquiss, M., Petty, S. J., Anderson, D. I. K., & Legge, G. (2003). Contrasting Population Trends of the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in the Scottish/English Borders and North-east Scotland. Low food supplies are linked to predation, as it seems to cause greater risk of predation due to the lower nest attendance. Lower densities of pairs may actually increase nesting success, as per studies from Finland where the highest median clutch size, at 3.8, was in the area with the lowest densities. Similarly, in Schleswig-Holstein, nest failure was 14% higher where active nests were closer than apart compared to nests farther than this. Age may also play a factor in nest success, pairings where one mate is not fully mature (usually the female, as males rarely breed before attaining adult plumage) is less than half as successful as ones where both were mature, based on studies from Arizona. Overall, males do not normally breed at any younger than 3 years of age (although they are in adult plumage by two years) and females can breed at as young as 1 to 2 years old, but rarely produce successful, viable clutches. The age at sexual maturity is the same as other northern Accipiters as well as most buteonine hawks (eagles, on the other hand, can take twice as long to attain full sexual maturity). 6‚Äì9 years of age seem to be the overall peak reproductive years for most northern goshawks. However, some females can reproduce at as old as 17 years old and senescence is ambiguous in both sexes (possibly not occurring in males). Median values of brood success was found to be 77% in Europe and 82% in North America overall. Conversely, the median brood size is about half a chick smaller in North America than in Europe. In Europe, clutch size overall averages 3.3, the number of nestlings averages 2.5 and fledglings averages 1.9. Lifespan Goshawks may be killed by collisions with man-made objects The lifespan in the wild is variable. It is known that in captivity, northern goshawks may live up to 27 years of age. Wild birds that survive their first two years can expect a lifespan of up to 11 years.Fowler, S. (1985). Recoveries, foreign retraps, returns and repeats: 1983-1984. Ontario Bird Banding no. 17:30‚Äì34. There is one record (apparently sourced to the AOU) of a 16-year, 4-month-old goshawk. In Fennoscandia, starvation was found to account for 3-6% of reported deaths. In Norway, 9% of deaths were from starvation, but the percentage of demises from this increased to the north and affected juveniles more so than adults. In Gotland, Sweden, 28% of mortality was from starvation and disease. Both bacterial and viral diseases have been known to cause mortality in wild northern goshawks.Schroder, H. D. 1981. Diseases of birds of prey with special reference to infectious diseases. In Recent advances in the study of raptor diseases., edited by J. E. Cooper and A. G. Greenwood, 37‚Äì39. Keighley, W. Yorkshire, U.K: Chiron. Publ. Ltd. Variable numbers of goshawks are killed by flying into man-made objects such as power lines and buildings and by automobiles, although lesser numbers are affected by powerline collisions than larger types of raptor.  Status The breeding range of the northern goshawk extends over one-third of North America and Asia each and perhaps five-sixths of Europe, a total area of over . Densities in western and central Europe were recorded at 3‚Äì5 pairs per . In boreal Sweden, numbers vary from 1 to 4.5 pairs per , while in similar habitat in Alaska there were 0.3 to 2.7/. An average of only 1 pair per would give world population of 600,000 breeding birds, likely at least half as many immature and other non-breeders. Recent study found 145,000‚Äì160,000 in Europe or 1 pair/ to 1 pair/. The total population of northern goshawks in the world probably ranges well over a million. The total European populations, estimated at as many as 160,000 pairs, makes it the fourth most numerous raptor in the continent, after the common buzzards (>700,000 pairs), Eurasian sparrowhawk (>340,000 pairs) and common kestrel (>330,000 pairs). The most populated countries by goshawks in Europe were Sweden (an estimated 10,000 pairs), Germany (8,500 pairs), Finland (6,000 pairs) and France (5,600 pairs). The highest densities of breeding pairs per of land were in The Netherlands, Latvia and Switzerland, although this is biased due to the small land area of these countries. Russia has a roughly estimated 85,000 pairs of northern goshawk. In North America, there are a broadly estimated 150,000‚Äì300,000 individuals. In North America, most western populations at mid-latitudes have approximately 3.6‚Äì10.7 pairs. A total of 107 nesting territories (1991‚Äì1996) were located on a study area on the Kaibab Plateau, AZ, resulting in a density of 8.4 pairs/. The estimated density in Pennsylvania (1.17 pairs/) suggests that eastern populations may occur at lower densities than western populations, but densities of eastern populations may increase as these populations recover. Typically, populations at far northern latitudes may occur at lower densities than those of southwestern and western populations in North America.Kimmel, J. T. and R. H. Yahner. 1994. The northern goshawk in Pennsylvania: habitat use, survey protocols, and status (Final Report). Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park: School For. Resour. Although median densities was similar, populations are overall much denser in Europe than in North America. The hotspots of density for goshawks in Europe lie in east-central Europe (around Poland) and in west-central area (the Netherlands/West Germany).Rutz, C., Marquiss M., Bijlsma, R.G., Kenward, R.E. & Newtonn, I. (2005). Continental-scale abundance profile in an avian top predator. MS in Rutz, C. (2005). The northern goshawk: population dynamics and behavioural ecology (Doctoral dissertation, D. Phil. thesis, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). Per the IUCN, the global population is estimated to consist of 1 million to nearly 2.5 million birds, making this one of the most numerous species in its diverse family (the red-tailed hawk and black kite both may have a similar global population size, whereas the Eurasian sparrowhawk and common buzzard are possibly slightly more numerous than goshawks despite their smaller ranges).Sauer, J., Niven, D., Hines, J., Ziolkowski Jr, D., Pardieck, K. L., Fallon, J. E., & Link, W. (2017). The North American breeding bird survey, results and analysis 1966-2015. USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, MD, USA. Mortality rates for first- year goshawks is often considerably higher than older birds. In studies from Gotland, Sweden, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany and the Netherlands, 40‚Äì42% of first-years died. By the second year, mortality rates drop to 31‚Äì35%, based on ring studies from the Netherlands and Finland. Based on studies from Gotland, Finland and the southwestern United States, annual mortality for adults is 15‚Äì21%, however, feather results indicate that annual mortality for adult goshawks is up to 7% higher in Europe than in North America.Haukioja, E. & Haukioja, H. (1970). Mortality rates of Finnish and Swedish goshawks (Accipiter gentilis). Finnish Game Research no. 31:13‚Äì20. In many parts of the range, especially Europe, historic populations decreased regionally due to human persecution (especially shooting), disturbance and epidemic loss of habitat, especially during the 19th century and early 20th. Some states, like Pennsylvania, paid $5 bounties on Goshawks in the 1930s. From 1880‚Äì1930, an estimated 3,000‚Äì5,500 goshawk were being killed annually in Norway when bounties were offered. Shooting rate lowered later, causing the average number of goshawks shot to drop to 654 to for the period 1965‚Äì1970.Muthe-Kass Lund, H. (1950). Honsehauk.

Norsk Insittut for Naturforskning Temaheft 5, Trondheim, Norway. Northern goshawks continue to be persecuted in Norway, shown by the high turnover rate of breeding females in Telemark County, revealed by DNA analysis of moulted feathers. In Finland, where the species was not legally protected, 4,000‚Äì8,000 goshawks were being killed annually from 1964‚Äì1975.Moilanen, P. (1976). Kanahaukkantapot ja fasaani. Suomen Luonto, 35: 315-318. Most goshawks shot are incautious juveniles, with 58% of juvenile mortality in Germany and 59% from the Netherlands being killings by humans. Increase of pheasant releases in Vendsyssel, Denmark from 6,000 to 35,000 since 1994 has resulted in fewer goshawks as they often hunt the pheasants in winter and are shot, legally, by the region's gamekeepers.Kramer, K. (1973). Habicht und Sperber. Neue Brehm Bucherei, Wittenberg-Lutherstadt, Germany.Drachmann, J. & Nielsen, J.T. (2002). Danske duehoges populationsokologi og forvatlning. Danish Environment Ministry report 398, Copenhagen, Denmark. As recently as about 5 years before that, intentional killing by humans continued as the main cause of mortality for goshawks on Gotland, Sweden, causing 36% of deaths.Kenward, R. E., V. Marcstr√∂m and M. Karlbom. 1991. The goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) as predator and renewable resource. Proceed. Intl. Conf. Wise Use as a Conserv. Strategy no. 8:367-378. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the northern goshawk was extirpated in the 19th century because of specimen collectors and persecution by gamekeepers, but in recent years it has come back by immigration from Europe, escaped falconry birds, and deliberate releases. The goshawk is now found in considerable numbers in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, which is the largest forest in Britain. Overall there are some 200 birds in Great Britain. Juvenile goshawk from Poland In the 1950s‚Äì1960s declines were increasingly linked with pesticide pollution. However, in early 1970s pesticide levels in the United States for goshawks were low. Eggshell thinning has not been a problem for most populations, although California eggshells (weight and thickness index) pre-1947 (pre-DDT) to 1947‚Äî1964 (DDT in use) declined some 8-12%. In Illinois, migratory goshawks during the winter of 1972-1973 invasion year contained less organochlorine and PCB residues than did other raptors, however, these birds were probably from nonagricultural, northern forests.Anderson, D. W. and J. J. Hickey. 1972. Eggshell changes in certain North American birds. In Proceedings of the XVth International Ornitholological Congress., edited by H. H. Voous, 514-540. Leiden: P. J. Brill. Higher DDT levels seemed to have persisted quite recently in Europe. This was the case in Germany, especially in former East Germany where DDT was widely available until 1988, having been largely discontinued elsewhere after the 1970s. Goshawks, which had increased in The Netherlands after World War II due to less persecution, new woodlands and increased pigeon numbers, were found to have suddenly crashed from the late 1950s on. It was later revealed that this was due to DDT, the number of breeding pairs decreasing 84% from 1958 to 1963.Thissen, J., M√ºskens, G., & Opdam, P. (1982). Trends in the Dutch goshawk Accipiter gentilis population and their causes. Understanding the goshawk. International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey. Oxford, United Kingdom, 28-43. As opposed to DDT, the main contaminant found to have reduced goshawks in Scandinavia during the 20th century were methyl mercury seed dressings used to reduce fungal attack in livestock.Borg, K., Wanntorp, H. E., Erne, K., & Hanko, E. (1969). Alkyl mercury poisoning in terrestrial Swedish wildlife. Svenska J√§garef√∂rbundet. Falconer's bird in Scotland Seemingly the remaining persistent conservation threat to goshawks, given their seeming overall resilience (at the species level) to both persecution and pesticides, is deforestation. Timber harvests are known to destroy many nests and adversely regional populations.Reynolds, R. T. (1989). Accipiters. Paper read at Proccedings of the Western Raptor Management Symposium and Workshop. Harvest methods that create extensive areas of reduced forest canopy cover, dropping to cover less than 35-40%, may be especially detrimental as cases of this usually cause all goshawks to disappear from the area. However, the mortality rates due to foresting practices are unknown and it is possible that some mature goshawks may simply be able to shift to other regions when a habitat becomes unsuitable but this is presumably unsustainable in the long-term. In harvest forests of California, where overstory trees are frequently removed, goshawks have been found to successfully remain as breeding species as long as some mature stands are left intact. Despite the decline of habitat quality and the frequent disturbances, this region's goshawks breeding success rates somewhat improbably did not reduce. Similarly, a study from Italy and France shows that goshawks only left woodlots when the canopy was reduced by more than 30%, although the European goshawk populations have long been known to be adaptable to some degree of habitat fragmentation. Based on habitat usage studied in New Jersey and New York, this adaptability is not seen everywhere, as here nests were further from human habitation than expected on the basis of available habitat, an observation suggesting that disturbance regionally can reduce habitat quality.Speiser, R., & Bosakowski, T. (1987). Nest site selection by northern goshawks in northern New Jersey and southeastern New York. Condor, 387-394. Similarly, studies from the American southwest and Canada have indicated that heavily logged areas caused strong long-term regional declines for goshawks. In Arizona, it was found that even when the nests were left intact, the noisy timber harvest work often caused failure of nesting during the incubation stage, and all nesting attempts that were occurring within of active logging failed, frequently after parents abandoned the nest.Reynolds, R. T., Graham, R. T., & Reiser, M. H. (1992). Management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the southwestern United States. Other noisy activity, such as camping, have also caused nests to failure. Wildlife researchers and biologists do not seem to negatively affect goshawk nests, as they aware to keep forays to the nest brief and capture of adult goshawks for radio-tagging was found to not harm their success at raising broods. In North America, several non-governmental conservation organizations petitioned the Department of Interior, United States Fish & Wildlife Service (1991 & 1997) to list the goshawk as \\"threatened\\" or \\"endangered\\" under the authority of the Endangered Species Act. Both petitions argued for listing primarily on the basis of historic and ongoing nesting habitat loss, specifically the loss of old-growth and mature forest stands throughout the goshawk's known range. In both instances, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service concluded that listing was not warranted, but state and federal natural resource agencies responded during the petition process with standardized and long-term goshawk inventory and monitoring efforts, especially throughout U.S. Forest Service lands in the Western U.S. The United States Forest Service (US Dept of Agriculture) has listed the goshawk as a \\"sensitive species\\", while it also benefits from various protection at the state level. In North America, the goshawk is federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 by an amendment incorporating native birds of prey into the Act in 1972. The northern goshawk is also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Relationship with humans Iranian falconer with a trained goshawk =Human culture= The northern goshawk appears on the flag and coat of arms of the Azores. The archipelago of the Azores, Portugal, takes its name from the Portuguese language word for goshawk, (a√ßor), because the explorers who discovered the archipelago thought the birds of prey they saw there were goshawks; later it was found that these birds were kites or common buzzards (Buteo buteo rothschildi). The goshawk features in Stirling Council's coat of arms via the crest of the Drummond Clan. =In falconry= The name \\"goshawk\\" is a traditional name from Anglo-Saxon g≈çshafoc, literally \\"goose hawk\\". The name implies prowess against larger quarry such as wild geese, but were also flown against crane species and other large waterbirds. The name \\"goose hawk\\" is somewhat of a misnomer, however, as the traditional quarry for goshawks in ancient and contemporary falconry has been rabbits, pheasants, partridge, and medium-sized waterfowl, which are similar to much of the prey the species hunts in the wild. A notable exception is in records of traditional Japanese falconry, where goshawks were used more regularly on goose and crane species. In ancient European falconry literature, goshawks were often referred to as a yeoman's bird or the \\"cook's bird\\" because of their utility as a hunting partner catching edible prey, as opposed to the peregrine falcon, also a prized falconry bird, but more associated with noblemen and less adapted to a variety of hunting techniques and prey types found in wooded areas. The northern goshawk has remained equal to the peregrine falcon in its stature and popularity in modern falconry.Oggins, R. S. (2004). The Kings and Their Hawks: Falconry in Medieval England. Yale University Press. Goshawk hunting flights in falconry typically begin from the falconer's gloved hand, where the fleeing bird or rabbit is pursued in a horizontal chase. The goshawk's flight in pursuit of prey is characterized by an intense burst of speed often followed by a binding maneuver, where the goshawk, if the prey is a bird, inverts and seizes the prey from below. The goshawk, like other accipiters, shows a marked willingness to follow prey into thick vegetation, even pursuing prey on foot through brush. Goshawks trained for falconry not infrequently escape their handlers and, extrapolated from the present day British population which is composed mostly of escaped birds as such, have reasonably high survival rates, although many do die shortly after escape and many do not successfully breed. The effect of modern-day collection of northern goshawks for falconry purposes is unclear, unlike some falcon species which can show regional declines due to heavy falconry collections but can increase in other areas due to established escapees from falconers.Kenward, R. E. (2009). Conservation values from falconry. Recreational Hunting, Conservation and Rural Livelihoods: Science and Practice, 181.

It formerly included the Cuban black-hawk (Buteogallus gundlachii) as a subspecies. The mangrove black hawk, traditionally considered a distinct species, is now generally considered a subspecies, B. a. subtilis, of the common black-hawk. Description The adult common black-hawk is long and weighs on average. It has very broad wings, and is mainly black or dark gray. The short tail is black with a single broad white band and a white tip. The bill is black and the legs and cere are yellow. The adults resemble zone- tailed hawks, but have fewer white bars on their tail and are larger in size. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are dark brown above with spotting and streaks. Their underparts are buff to whitish with dark blotches, and the tail has a number of black and white bars. Distribution and habitat The common black-hawk is a breeding bird in the warmer parts of the Americas, from the Southwestern United States through Central America to Venezuela, Peru, Trinidad, and the Lesser Antilles. It is a mainly coastal, resident bird of mangrove swamps, estuaries and adjacent dry open woodland, though there are inland populations, including a migratory population in north-western Mexico and Arizona. Behaviour =Breeding= The bird builds a platform nest of sticks fifteen to one hundred feet above the ground in a tree, often a mangrove. Nests are often reused and tend to grow bigger. It lays one to three eggs (usually one), which are whitish with brown markings. Has hybridized naturally with Red-shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus) in Sonoma County, California, USA. This natural hybridization between different genera of hawks is rare. =Feeding= It feeds mainly on crabs, but will also take small vertebrates and eggs.

It is sometimes placed in the genus Asturina as Asturina plagiata. The species was split by the American Ornithological Society (AOU) from the gray-lined hawk. The gray hawk is found from Costa Rica north into the southwestern United States. The gray hawk is in length and weighs on average. The adult has a pale gray body, the tail is black with three white bands and the legs are orange. It is a solid, unpatterned gray on the upper parts. Immature birds have dark brown upperparts, a pale-banded brown tail, brown-spotted white underparts and a brown streaked buff head and neck. This species is quite short-winged, and has a fast agile flight for a Buteo. The call is a shrill whistled kleee-ooo. Gray hawks feed mainly on lizards and snakes, but will also take small mammals, birds and frogs. It usually sits on an open high perch from which it swoops on its prey, but will also hunt from a low glide. The nest is of sticks and built high in a tree. The usual clutch is one to three, usually two white to pale blue eggs. The young take about 6 weeks to fledging. Near Phoenix, Arizona Taxonomy The taxonomy of the gray hawk puts it within in the genus Buteo. This genus consists of hawks, which include the red-shouldered hawk, Swainson's hawk, and others. The genus Buteo is in the sub-family Accipitrinae which is also known as the \\"true hawks\\", and Accipitrinae is within the family of Accipitridae. Accipitridae consist of hawks, old world vultures, kites, harriers, and eagles. This family is within the order Falconiformes which are the diurnal (active during the day) birds of prey.The American Ornithologist Union. (2013). List of the 2,046 Bird Species (With Scientific and English Names) Known From the A.O.U. Check-List Area. The American Ornithologist Union. Retrieved November 10, 2013 The species was originally described by Hermann Schlegel in 1862 as Asturina plagiata. The AOU listed A. plagiata with the common name \\"Mexican goshawk\\" in the first four editions of the Check-List of North American Birds, from 1886‚Äì1931. By the 1957 fifth edition, it had been merged into Buteo nitidis; but by the 1998 seventh edition all of B. nitidis was separated into the resurrected genus Asturina. In 2003, Riesing et al. publisher's abstract and metadata (Elsevier) author's PDF published results of research on nucleotide sequences within the mitochondrial nd6 gene and pseudo- control-region for all species of Buteo and several related species. Among other findings, they recommended that Asturina be merged into Buteo, and concluded that A. nitidis plagiatus was sufficiently different from A. n. nitidis and A. n. costaricensis to be considered a separate species. In 2005, the AOC's Committee on Classification and Nomenclature ‚Äì North America decided Full text via BioOne. to follow the recommendation to merge the genera, but was not convinced about splitting the species. The gray hawk was originally Asturina nitida but controversy existed between ornithologists on whether or not this species was closely enough related enough to put it in the Buteo, but chromosomal mapping in 2013 has proved that the gray hawk is within the Buteoninae.de Oliveira E.H.C, Tagliarini M.M, dos Santos MS, O'Brien P.C.M., Ferguson-Smith M.A. (2013) Chromosome Painting in Three Species of orButeoninae: A Cytogenetic Signature Reinforces the Monophyly of South American Species. PLOS ONE. Researchers such as de Oliveira, Tagliarini, dos Santos, O'Brien, and Ferguson-Smith proposed in 2011 that the gray hawk should be two different species, because of a slight difference in plumage color and a difference in alarm calls documented in the northern and southern distributional gap in Costa Rica.

The tail features are in a horizontal stripped pattern in a white gray white pattern with white at the tips of the tail feathers. The tail feathers have two white bands with one being wider than the other. The sexes are similar in coloration. The adults, both male and female, have a darker gray top side with a lighter gray and white underside. The juveniles have a dark brown topside and a streaked or spotted underside and the tail feathers have numerous dark bands. The juveniles have very obvious bold facial strips and white upper tail coverts, which are the feathers at the base or start of the tail. The juveniles also have a different plumage color due to dominance and they use the dull color for camouflage. Distribution and habitat The gray hawk's range is in Northern and Central America, from southern New Mexico, southern Arizona, to central Texas, through Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, to the northern part of Costa Rica. Its habitat within this range consists of forest edges, river edges, clear cuts, savanna, and agricultural land (4). In their tropical range of the Amazon they tend to prefer a more dry second growth forest. Behaviour =Diet= The gray hawk's main diet is lizards and small mammals, but it will also eat rodents and large insects and some birds. It hunts in brushy areas either from a perch or flight just above the canopy. =Migration= The migration pattern of gray hawks depends on the location of the animals' home range. Birds that live in northern Mexico and the south-western United States will migrate, but birds living further south tend to stay in the same area permanently.Rodr√≠guez-Flores, C., Soberanes- Gonz√°lez C., and Arizmendi M.C. (2010). Buteo nitidus. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology Neotropical Birds. Retrieved November 7, 2013 A few birds in the northern range will stay in the southern part of Texas year round rather than migrating, but this is rare. The birds that migrate north to the south-western United States will migrate in the spring in order to breed. After the breeding season, the birds will begin their journey back south in mid-October to their wintering ranges. =Reproduction= The mating system of the gray hawk is monogamous. During December through May, the breeding season, these birds perform courtship displays (4). The males court the females by rising and falling flight, calls, and nest building. The male and female together will build their stick nest in tall trees, but the male only lays down the foundation while the female will shape the nest (9). The nest is about 60 centimeters across and the female will on average lay 2 to 3 pale-blue eggs per clutch. The female takes care of her eggs incubating them for 33 days; meanwhile the male will capture prey and bring it back to the female. A few breeding pairs nest along the Rio Grande in riparian woods (1). In research conducted from 1995‚Äì97 in south-west Arizona, it was found that gray hawks produced an average of 1.32 young per nest between all three years when the study was being conducted (8).Bibles B.D., & Mannan R.A.

Buteos tend to be easily recognized by their bulky bodies relative to their overall length and wingspan. The io is the only hawk that is native to Hawaii, and fossil evidence indicates that it inhabited the island of Hawaii, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai at one time. Today, it is known to breed only on the Big Island, in stands of native ≈çhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees. The species was protected as an endangered species in the United States, but was delisted in 2020https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ID=68BF4631-5056-9613-D80362B2AAEBD6C1. However, the IUCN classifies the species as Near Threatened. Description The Hawaiian hawk measures approximately 40 to 46 centimeters (16 to 18 in) in length. The female, which weighs on average, is larger than the male, which averages . Two color phases exist: a dark phase (dark brown head, breast, and underwings), and a light color phase (dark head, light breast and light underwings). Feet and legs are yellowish in adults and greenish in juveniles. During breeding season one of the pair, possibly the female, has a distinctive yellow forecap area just above the upper mandible. Threats Common threats to the io are illegal shootings, the degradation of their native forest habitat, poisoning, vehicle collisions, starvation, and predation from other animals. Lifestyle This solitary hawk remains in and defends its territories year round. They nest from March through September, and usually lay only one egg but sometimes they could lay up to three in their clutch. The female does the majority of sitting during the 38 days of incubation, while the male does the majority of the hunting. After the egg is hatched, the female only allows the male to visit when delivering food to the nest. The chick fledges at seven or eight weeks. Fifty to seventy percent of the nests successfully fledge young. The io usually hunts from a stationary position, but can also dive on prey from the air. Due to Hawaii having few native land mammals (The Hawaiian Hoary bat is Hawaii's only native terrestrial mammal), its original diet presumably consisted mainly of smaller birds such as the flightless ducks and rails that once inhabited Hawaii. Today it feeds largely on introduced animals such as rats, lizards, and game birds, as well as invertebrates such as insects. It will also feed on the Hawaiian crow, a Hawaiian bird which is extinct in the wild. They are opportunistic predators and are versatile in their feeding habits. They have a shrill and high-pitched call much like their Hawaiian name: \\"eeeh-oh.\\" They are very noisy during the breeding season. Io are strong fliers. The Hawaiian hawk was a royal symbol in Hawaiian legend, and it is sometimes called ‚Äúiolani,‚Äù or ‚Äúexalted hawk‚Äù, which was the name of Kamehameha IV and the Iolani Palace.

The red-tail is also more likely to soar steadily, with wings in a slight dihedral. Taxonomy The red-shouldered hawk is a member of the genus Buteo, a group of medium-sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings. Members of this genus are known as buzzards in Europe, but hawks in North America. Five subspecies of Buteo lineatus are recognized, which vary in range and in coloration: *B. l. lineatus (Gmelin, 1788) *B. l. alleni *B. l. elegans *B. l. extimus *B. l. texanus Distribution and habitat A pair of red-shouldered hawks, painted by John James Audubon An eastern population ranges west through southern Canada from southern New Brunswick and Ontario to the eastern edge of the U.S. Great Plains, south to Florida, the Gulf Coast, and eastern Mexico. Only northernmost populations are migratory. A western population breeds west of the Sierra Nevada from northern California to northern Baja California, and has recently expanded into Oregon and Arizona, and east of the Sierra Mountains in California. Eastern populations winter from southern Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Ohio, and southern New England south to the Gulf Coast, occasionally throughout breeding range. In winter, they are reported south to Jalisco and Veracruz, Mexico. Western populations are largely nonmigratory. Throughout its winter range, this species avoids higher elevations. Eastern birds occasionally wander west (e.g., Colorado, Kansas, West Texas, Manitoba, North Dakota) in migration; western birds have strayed east to Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, and north to Washington.Red-shouldered hawk. The Birds of North America Online. Retrieved 2014-02-25. In the east, individuals from the northern half of the species‚Äô range are migratory. In the west, most populations are local. Red-shouldered hawks are short- to moderate-distance migrants, with most individuals traveling distances between 300 and 1,500 km each way. The species follows leading lines, migrating along inland ridges and coastlines. Larger numbers of red-shouldered hawks are counted at coastal watch sites than at inland sites. Juveniles often precede adults on migration in autumn, whereas adults precede juveniles in the spring. Red-shouldered hawks typically migrate alone, although they sometimes form small flocks of three or more birds. The species usually avoids crossing large bodies of water. While migrating, red-shouldered hawks are observed in soaring, gliding, and flapping flight.Red-shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus). Hawk Mountain. Retrieved 2104-02-27. A study of red-shouldered hawk home range and habitat use in southern California found average home range of and showed fair adaptability to human-altered landscapes, which is important as riparian forest habitat has diminished by 98% from 1850 to 1977 in California's Central Valley. Red-shouldered hawks are forest raptors. In the east, they live in bottomland hardwood stands, flooded deciduous swamps, and upland mixed deciduous‚Äìconifer forests. They tend to live in stands with an open subcanopy, which makes hunting easier. They are not exclusively birds of deep forest, though; one can find red-shouldered hawks in some suburban areas where houses or other buildings are mixed into woodlands. In the west, they live in riparian and oak woodlands, and also in eucalyptus groves and some residential areas.Red-shouldered Hawk, Life History, All About Birds ‚Äì Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Allaboutbirds.org. Retrieved on 2014-02-25. Behavior =Diet= Red-shouldered hawks search for prey while perched on a treetop or soaring over woodlands. When they sight prey, they kill it by dropping directly onto it from the air. They may cache food near their nest for later consumption.Buteo lineatus red-shouldered hawk. Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved 2014-02-25. When in clearings, they sometimes fly low to surprise prey. Red-shouldered hawks, like most raptors, have very sharp vision and reasonably good hearing, with talons capable of killing animals at least equal to their own size. Small mammals are typically the most important prey, especially rodents. Voles, gophers, mice, moles and chipmunks may locally be favored based on abundance. Slightly larger mammals, such as rabbits and tree squirrels, are also occasionally preyed on. Other prey can include amphibians, reptiles (especially small snakes), birds, fish, and large insects. They will attack birds up to the size of a ruffed grouse or ring-necked pheasant. Steller's jays and blue jays, both of which being potential prey species, sometimes habitually imitate the call of the red-shouldered hawk and are known to be difficult to distinguish on voice alone.BFL: Species Account: Red- shouldered Hawk. Birds.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. During winters, red-shouldered hawks sometimes habituate to preying on birds commonly found at bird feeders. In some areas where they are common, crayfish can be important prey for this species. Unusual food items recorded for the species have included nocturnal animals such as eastern screech owls and flying squirrels and road-killed deer. =Reproduction= The breeding habitats of the red- shouldered hawk are deciduous and mixed wooded areas, often near water. They have been known to nest near residential areas and open water but this is much less common. Red-shouldered hawks select sites with greater tree species richness for nesting. Like almost all raptors, the red-shouldered hawk is monogamous and territorial. While courting or defending territories, the distinctive, screaming kee-aah call (usually repeated three to four times) of this bird is heard. Courtship displays occur on the breeding grounds, and involve soaring together in broad circles while calling, or soaring and diving toward one another. Males may also perform the \\"sky-dance\\" by soaring high in the air, and then making a series of steep dives, each followed by a wide spiral and rapid ascent. These courtship flights usually occur in late morning and early afternoon. Red-shouldered hawks' mating season is between April and July, with activity usually peaking between April and mid-June. The breeding pair builds a stick nest (also sometimes including shredded bark, leaves and green sprigs) in a major fork of a large tree. They often use the same nest year after year, refurbishing it annually with sticks in the spring. The clutch size is typically three to four eggs. The blotchy-marked eggs, often brown to lavender in color, measure on average . The incubation period can range from 28 to 33 days. Hatching is asynchronous, with the first chick hatching up to a week before the last. The hatchlings, which weigh at first, are brooded almost constantly by the female for up to 40 days. Pairs that nest earlier in the breeding season tend to lay greater numbers of eggs and have higher productivity from those eggs. The male more often captures food but will also incubate and brood occasionally. The young leave the nest at about six weeks of age, but remain dependent on the parents until they are 17 to 19 weeks old. They may continue to roost near the nest site until the following breeding season. Breeding maturity is usually attained at 1 or 2 years of age. Although they have lived as long as within a month of 20 years old, few live half that long and only around half survive their first year. Each year overall nesting success can be lower than 30 percent. Early mortality can be due to natural causes, relating to harsh weather conditions, or more often starvation. Young hawks are often parasitized by species such as Trichomonas gallinae, Protocalliphora avium, and blood parasites. Humans, unintentionally or intentionally are a threat to red-shouldered hawks, including hunting, collision with electric wires, road accidents and logging. A further common cause of mortality is natural predation. Raccoons, martens, fishers and large arboreal snakes can predate eggs, hatchlings, fledglings and occasionally incubating and brooding adults. Non-nesting adults, being a fairly large and powerful predator, have fewer natural predators, but (both during and after the breeding season as well among nestling hawks) they may be preyed on by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, barred owls, other red-shouldered hawks, northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons, and bald and golden eagles. In western New York, the main cause of nest failure was stated to be great horned owl predation.Crocoll, S. T. (1984). Breeding biology of broad- winged and red-shouldered hawks in western New York (Doctoral dissertation, State University of New York at Fredonia, 1984--Department of Biology.). Many of the same predators sometimes compete over territory and food with this species. Despite their highly similar diet and habitat preferences, it has been found that red-shouldered hawks can nest within of a barred owl without interspecies conflict.Stewart, R. E. (1949). Ecology of a nesting Red- shouldered Hawk population. The Wilson Bulletin, 26-35. In Florida, red- shouldered hawks sometimes collaborate and peaceably coexist with American crows (usually an enemy to all other birds because of their egg-hunting habits) so they cooperatively mob mutual predators, mainly great horned owls and red-tailed hawks.Kilham, L. (1990). The American crow and the common raven (No. 10). Texas A&M; University Press. Red-shouldered Hawks have hybridized with Gray Hawk (Buteo plagiatus), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Common Black Hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus). Status Prior to 1900, the red-shouldered hawk was one of the most common North American raptors. Population densities have decreased precipitously due to the clearing of mature forests (principally the wet hardwood forest they prefer) since that time. The changing of habitats has led to a general population increase of the red-tailed hawk, an occasional predator of its cousin. Additionally affecting the red-shouldered hawk was the greater availability of firearms in the early 1900s, leading to unchecked hunting of this and all other raptor species until conservation laws took effect in the latter half of the 20th century. Local forest regrowth and the ban of hunting has allowed red-shouldered hawk populations to become more stable again and the species is not currently considered conservation dependent. In Florida, the red-shouldered hawk is perhaps the most commonly seen and heard raptor species (outside of abundant black and turkey vultures).The Raptors of Southwest Florida ¬ª Naples Daily News. Naplesnews.com (206-05-16). Retrieved on 2012-12-19. However, human activity, including logging, poisoning from insecticides and industrial pollutants, continue to loom as threats to the species. Before its use was outlawed in the United States, red-shouldered hawks and other raptors suffered from exposure to DDT, a pesticide. The DDT would cause their eggs to have thin, breakable shells, reducing their ability to reproduce. Accidental encounters with power lines and automobiles also take a toll on hawks. In spite of these dangers, habitat loss remains the biggest threat to red- shouldered hawks. In art John James Audubon illustrated the red-shouldered hawk in his book Ornithological Biographies.

The property was established in about 1900 by the pioneer, James Bett Willis, who had sunk the first well to produce drinkable water in the area. Willis had a partnership with Tommy Mellor in stocking and improving the other otherwise virgin country. In 1948 the property was still owned by Willis, who also owned Clover Downs Station. J.

In the 1970s the Linke family, run by the three Linke brothers, acquired Windidda, Carnegie and Prenti Downs Stations, which they ran as a single entity. In 1992 the leaseholding was broken up into three smaller leases and Windidda was acquired by the Ngangganawili Community Incorporated. The RSPCA were called to investigate the property in 2002. In 2005 approximately 500 cattle were found dead on the property, which appeared to have been abandoned. RSPCA inspectors were called to the property to provide assistance to the remaining 2,500 cattle. Only two of the station's 13 watering points were found be in working order and the livestock were so neglected that a further 30 head of stock had to be put down. The Aboriginal corporation that held the lease to the property, Ngangganawili Community Incorporated, were thought to have left the property for law business but had left no provision for the livestock. The RSPCA described it as the worst case of neglect seen in Western Australia. Later the same year the property was effectively destocked with 1,818 cattle being mustered and sold. The remaining 300 were likely to sold to with proceeds going back to the Wandidda Aboriginal Community, who had replaced Ngangganawili Community Incorporated after it was dissolved. The Wandidda Aboriginal Corporation forfeited the pastoral lease and the property was passed under management of the Pastoral Lands Board.

As a member of the genus Buteo, it is not a true hawk and thus also referred to as a \\"buteo\\" or (outside North America) \\"buzzard\\". The white-throated hawk (B. albigula) is a close relative and was formerly included in the species B. brachyurus. Range Captive male short-tailed hawk in Monterrey, Mexico Short-tailed hawks breed in the tropical and subtropical Americas from southeastern Brazil and northern Argentina north through Central America to the mountains of the Mexico-Arizona border area, as well as in southern Florida, United States. This species is generally found below ASL and most common below . It is replaced by the white-throated hawk (B. albigula) in the Andes of southern Colombia and south to central Argentina and Chile; the short-tailed hawk is found in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, while B. albigula occurs south of these locales. As far as is known, B. brachyurus is a year-round resident except that most of the Florida population migrates in winter to the southern tip of the state, including the Keys. It is somewhat habitat adaptable but only passes areas with dense human populations when foraging. The species may be found in wooded savannah, patchy woodlands near water, cypress swamps, mangrove swamps or high pine-oak woodlands. In the tropics, it is most common in lowland foothills. Most of what is known about its natural history has been studied in the Floridian population, and might not apply to birds at the south of the species' range. In general, this species is associated with woodland, often near water. Feeding In Florida, it eats mainly smaller birds. The short-tailed hawk hunts from a soaring flight, often at the borders between wooded and open areas. A frequent maneuver is \\"kiting\\" ‚Äì coming to a stop, the bird heads into the wind, with its wings held stationary. It typically attacks prey with a nearly vertical swoop, sometimes pausing and then continuing downward in a \\"stair-step\\" manner. Typical prey ranges from a New World warbler (Parulidae) to a bobwhite (Colinus) in size. In Florida, icterids‚Äînamely the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), the common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major) and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna)‚Äîmake up the bulk of the prey. In one case, 95% of a single hawk's prey selection was found to consist of red-winged blackbirds. Hunting success is apparently relatively low. In one study, 30 hours of observation showed that only 12 of 107 hunting attempts (or around 11%) were successful. There are isolated records of short-tails preying on sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Among tropical populations, they are several records of this species regularly taking frogs (especially tree frogs), lizards, large insects such as wasps and locusts. Such prey, which serves merely as alternate foods for Florida populations, apparently provides a much larger proportion of the diet in tropical populations. In all parts of the range, they occasionally supplement their diet with smallish mammals, principally small rodents such as mice, rats, and bats. Among the heaviest prey recorded are young common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and similar small monkeys; these do not seem to form an important prey item, however, and are only snatched when the opportunity presents itself. They are primarily an aerial predator, taking most prey by swooping down to trees or the ground. Rarely, they have been recorded still hunting from a perch. Nesting The large stick nest is built in a tree, at a height ranging from . In Florida, the bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) is a popular nesting tree of the short-tailed hawk. The nest is bulky, measuring wide and deep. Its 1‚Äì3 eggs per clutch are white, usually with dark spots and blotches. The nesting season is January through June in Florida and is possibly similar in the tropics. Incubation occurs over 34 days with no known details of their fledgling period. In Florida, American crows have been known to consume eggs of this species. Status The short-tailed hawk is uncommon and local in most of its range. It is quite difficult to detect unless in flight, since it is often concealed while perched by dense canopy or with only the head showing (unlike most Buteo hawks which generally prefer prominent perches). Due to the fact that it is believed to be regularly overlooked in the field, no comprehensive population surveys have occurred for the species. However, due to its wide extent of occurrence, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Sightings of soaring short-tailed hawks are fairly frequent within their range.

This species was named after William Swainson, a British naturalist. It is colloquially known as the grasshopper hawk or locust hawk, as it is very fond of Acrididae (locusts and grasshoppers) and will voraciously eat these insects whenever they are available. Their breeding habitat is prairie and dry grasslands in western North America. They build a stick nest in a tree or shrub or on a cliff edge. This species is a long- distance migrant, wintering in Argentina; it has been recorded as a vagrant in neighboring Chile, in the island countries of the Dominican Republic, and Trinidad and Tobago, and in Norway. This species or its immediate predecessor is the ancestor of the Gal√°pagos hawk, as demonstrated by recent research. Then later diverged from the mainland birds perhaps 300,000 years ago, a very short time in evolution. Description Rufous-morph bird in Hereford, Arizona, on its way to the pampas Swainson's hawk is a raptor and a medium- sized member of the genus Buteo. It broadly overlaps in size with the red- tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), a related species found as a breeding resident almost throughout North America. Swainson's hawk is on average a little shorter in length, long, and weighs a bit less, . However, Swainson's hawk has a slightly longer wingspan at , with more slender, elongated wings, than the red-tailed hawk. Female Swainson's hawks, at an average weight of , are somewhat larger and heavier than males, at an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the tarsus is and the bill (from the gape) is . In flight, Swainson's hawk holds its wings in a slight dihedral; it tips back and forth slightly while soaring. There are two main color variations. Over 90% of individuals are light-morph; the dark morph is most common in the far west of the range: * Light-morph adults are white on the underparts with a dark, reddish \\"bib\\" on the chest and a noticeable white throat and face patch. The underwings, seen as the bird soars, have light linings (leading edge) and dark flight feathers (trailing edge), a pattern unique among North American raptors. The tail is gray-brown with about six narrow dark bands and one wider subterminal band. The upperparts are brown. Juveniles are similar but dark areas have pale mottling and light areas, especially the flanks, have dark mottling. The chest is pale with some darker marks. The subterminal band of the tail is less obvious. Birds in their first spring may have pale heads because of feather wear. * Dark-morph birds are dark brown except for a light patch under the tail. There is a rufous variant that is lighter on the underparts with reddish bars. The tails of both these forms resemble those of the light morph. Range and migration Swainson's hawk inhabits North America mainly in the spring and summer, and winters in South America. Breeding areas include south-central Alberta, central Saskatchewan, southwestern Manitoba, and west and southern Minnesota. They will breed as far north as east-central Alaska, and southwestern Yukon. Breeding continues south through the eastern parts of Washington and Oregon, locally to the central valley of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and most of Texas. The eastern part of its range includes Minnesota, northwestern Iowa, most of Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and all but eastern Texas. It periodically occurs in Iowa and rarely in northwestern Missouri, northern Illinois, and southwestern Wisconsin. migration route. 30 birds were fitted with satellite tracking devices to produce this map Small populations winter in southeastern Florida and along the Texas coast, probably having failed to find the way south around the Gulf of Mexico. Individuals reported north of these areas in winter (for example, on Christmas Bird Counts) are almost invariably misidentified buteos of other species. Swainson's hawks mostly winter on the pampas of South America in Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. The populations of Swainson's hawks breeding in California's Central Valley also winter in western Mexico and central America. The Swainson's hawk is the second longest migrant of any North American raptor, after arctic nesting Peregrine falcons. The flight from breeding ground to South American pampas in southern Brazil or Argentina can be as long as . Each migration can last at least two months. They leave the breeding grounds from August to October. Fall migration begins each clear day on which a wind blows in the general direction of travel. Birds gain altitude by soaring in circles on a rising thermal and then set their wings and close their tails as they glide, slowly losing altitude until they find another thermal and rise with it. Thus, waves and small groups are strung out across the sky. The birds gradually head southwards toward Central America where virtually the entire population funnels through the Isthmus of Panama. Concentrations over locations like Ancon Hill, Balboa, and Panama City are spectacular. In the Andes, it migrates along a narrow corridor and rarely strays off course; for example, it was only recorded in the Serran√≠a de las Quinchas of Colombia ‚Äì just or so off its usual migration route ‚Äì in 2000/2001. In Brazil, migrating birds pass through the western states of Acre and Mato Grosso, while wintering birds may stray to the southern states of Paran√°, Rio Grande do Sul and S√£o Paulo. But surprisingly, the occasional Swainson's hawk ‚Äî including birds one or two years of age ‚Äî has also been recorded in the eastern states of Maranh√£o, Par√°, Pernambuco, Piau√≠ and Tocantins, thousands of kilometers away from their usual migration route and wintering grounds and sometimes in mid-summer. This suggests that individuals occasionally become lost during migration, and/or that they may spend a whole year in the tropical regions and range about, rather than just overwintering at one site. In Uruguay, the first dedicated studies show it to be not uncommon but patchily distributed across the country in winter. Notably, it had been underreported in Flores and Paysand√∫ Departments, where it seems in fact to be a regular visitor. In recent years, the first birds were seen in early November, and some stayed until late February. Numbers increase throughout November and peak in December, when flocks of many dozen roam the open lands. But many stay only for a scant few weeks before leaving again. Spring migration broadens once the birds have passed through Mexico as they disperse through the breeding range. Migrant groups are noted in the southern U.S. states in March. The earliest Swainson's hawks arrive in southern Canada in late March, with migration peaking from mid April onwards. Ecology Soaring light-morph adult The habitat of Swainson's hawk consists of open and semi-open country ‚Äì deserts, grasslands and prairies ‚Äì in both its breeding and wintering ranges. It favors wild prairie, hayfields, and pastures over wheat fields and alfalfa fields, which may offer its prey too much cover. It requires elevated perches for hunting and a supply of small mammals such as young ground squirrels as prey for its nestlings. The breeding distribution of Swainson's hawk is tied very closely to the distribution of various small mammals for this reason. In Saskatchewan, for example, the distribution of Richardson's ground squirrel and Swainson's hawk are precisely the same. Swainson's hawk will defend its breeding territory from other buteos. Breeding densities may vary from one area to the next but averages one pair per . The average home range estimate for this hawk is . It gathers in groups for feeding and migrating. However, in each case, such gathering is not social, but motivated by good feeding or migrating conditions. Swainson's hawk, the red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis) and the ferruginous hawk (B. regalis) compete for territory, and defend territories against each other. In many parts of the plains these three species nest in the same general area and exploit much the same prey base. Although diets overlap greatly, habitats may not overlap as much. In Oregon, Swainson's hawk selects nesting trees having a different configuration than those used by red-tailed or ferruginous hawks. In southern Alberta, different nesting habitats help reduce food competition, with Swainson's hawk favoring areas with scattered trees or riparian borders, while red-tailed hawks nest in stands of tall trees, and ferruginous hawks nest on the open plains. Reduced reproductive success may result from Swainson's hawk's nesting proximity to these two other buteos. Swainson's hawk is generally tolerant of people. The bird is attracted to haying, mowing, and plowing operations. House sparrows, European starlings, and other small birds may nest in or near a Swainson's hawk's nest. In winter quarters, they are far more tolerant, though many birds will still fend for themselves. In Uruguay, the species likes largely open but broken (with rocks or woods) plains or low hills, where it can be seen to gather in larger groups. Groups of a few dozen birds are not uncommon. Flocks of over one hundred birds have been recorded several times, e.g. one that roamed the Cuchilla Marincho region south of Andresito (Flores Department) in mid-late December 2005. = Natal Dispersal = Swainson‚Äôs hawks have a high natal fidelity, and individuals generally return to areas where they fledged. On average, female natal dispersal (mean distance of 11.1 kilometers) was higher than males (mean distance of 8.3 milometers) in northern California. Longer natal dispersal distance in females is typical for many bird species, and may aid in inbreeding avoidance. Natal dispersal in the Canadian prairies was significantly higher at 66.7 kilometers, with documented movements as far as 310 kilometers. Males that fledged in territories with higher primary productivity had lower natal dispersal in northern California, suggesting they were trying to stay closer to more prey-dense habitat. =Hunting and food= Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, watching for prey activity from a perch such as a tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands. These birds patrol open areas or scan for prey from a perch; they may also catch insects in flight. They take advantage of insects turned up by farm equipment or driven out by fire. A hunting Swainson's hawk will use several strategies. It hunts insects such as dragonflies or dobsonflies while in flight, flapping little as it rides a wind current and stoops upon a fly, grabbing it with its foot and immediately transferring the prey to its bill. It uses a similar strategy to grab individual free-tailed bats from flying streams of bats. Also, when dragonfly hordes are grounded by weather, Swainson's hawk will stand near groups sheltering from the wind and pluck at individual insects. Swainson's hawk closely follows both tractors and wild fires for injured or fleeing food. It will also run down insect prey on the ground. Occasionally a hawk will stand still on a dirt bank or elevated mound waiting for prey to appear. It commonly hunts from elevated perches such as telephone poles, stooping on prey when it is sighted. Grasshopper, a favorite food of Swainson's hawk Swainson's hawks may be largely insectivorous except when nesting. Insect prey commonly taken includes grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts. Other Buteo hawks in this species range, including smaller-bodied species, do not normally prefer insects in their diet but instead focus on rodents and other small vertebrates. However, breeding birds switch mainly to capturing vertebrate prey, which pairs then bring to their nestlings. Breeding Swainson's hawks rely heavily upon small mammals such as young ground squirrels, young cottontails, pocket gophers, mice, young jackrabbits, and, at least locally, small birds and other vertebrates including reptiles and amphibians. Birds taken include large birds such as Mallards, and Sage Grouse which may have been injured initially. Other unusual bird species taken include American kestrel, and young short-eared owls. More typical in size are young lark buntings taken at their fledging time. Reptiles, which can comprise large parts of a diet, include snakes such as racers, gopher snakes and striped whipsnakes, and lizards. Amphibians may include tiger salamanders and toads. Swainson's hawk is an opportunistic feeder which responds quickly to local concentrations of food. In Argentina, flocks of immature Swainson's hawks feed on flocks of the migratory darner dragonfly Rhionaeschna bonariensis, following the hordes of insects and feeding mostly on the wing. Local outbreaks of locusts may also be exploited for food by one or more age- classes of birds. The immatures wintering in southern Florida apparently feed upon either insects, mice, or both, when turned up from field plowing. They move from one freshly ploughed field to the next. There is also some evidence that road-killed birds and animals are also consumed both on the wintering grounds and on the breeding grounds. The species commonly follows tractors and other agricultural equipment during haying or ploughing, where rodents are exposed for the hawks to capture, or insects are uncovered after crop cutting. Wildfires often attract foraging Swainson's hawks, especially grass fires in their South American wintering range. In South American grass fires, the hawks frequently wait around the edges of the fire, picking off not only insects but also vertebrates including nothuras, lizards and snakes. =Reproduction and life span= A Swainson's hawk chick When Swainson's hawks arrive at their nesting sites in March or April, they may return to their original nests as these hawks are noted to be monogamous. Research indicates that they have a high degree of mate and territorial fidelity. This is unusual in a long- distance migrant. Seven to fifteen days after the birds arrive, the males begin constructing nests on the ground, ledges or in a trees. The nest consists of twigs and grasses and can take up to two weeks to complete. New nests may be constructed, old nests refurbished, or abandoned nests of other species ‚Äî namely corvids (e.g. common raven, black-billed magpie, and American crow) ‚Äî are refurbished. The courtship displays of Swainson's hawk are not well known. One activity involves circling and diving above a potential nest site. The underwings and rump are flashed and the birds call. The display may end with one bird diving to land on the edge of the nest. Copulation occurs mainly in the morning and evening on the dead limbs of trees. The female may assume the receptive position without a prior display. During treading one of the birds calls. Swainson's hawks typically nest in isolated trees or bushes, shelterbelts, riparian groves, or around abandoned homesteads. Occasionally, a pair will nest on the ground or on a bank or ledge. Nest trees and bushes include ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, spruce, cottonwood, domestic poplar, aspen, elm, mesquite, willow, saguaro cactus, and soaptree yuccas. Nests are located from above the ground, often in the shaded canopy but near the top of the tree. Nests are flimsy structures, usually smaller than the nests of the red-tailed hawk, and often blow down after nesting season. Juvenile Swainson's hawk Clutch size ranges from one to four eggs, but averages two to three. Each egg is elliptical in shape, about long and wide. The egg is smooth with fine granulations and the ground color is white, often tinted bluish or greenish. During incubation the shell color quickly wears to dull white. Some eggs are plain; others are lightly marked with spots and blotches of light brown. The incubation period is 34 to 35 days, with the female incubating while the male brings food. Young Swainson's hawks are fed small, young mammals. Flight feathers begin to emerge on the young at 9 to 11 days. High nestling mortality often occurs when the young are 15 to 30 days old and may be a result of fratricide. The young begin to leave the nest for surrounding branches at 33 to 37 days, fledging occurs at about 38 to 46 days. The fledglings are dependent upon their parents for 4 to 5 weeks. This species has one brood a year and apparently does not lay replacement clutches. The oldest wild Swainson's hawk on record is 26 years 1 month (Swainson's Hawk 26 years 01 months 07/06/1986 California Local Unknown 07/24/2012 California Saw or photographed neck collar, color band, or other marker (not federal band) while bird was free Alive - Released/Left On Bird). Swainson's hawks die because of collisions with traffic, illegal shooting, electrocution, and even during severe prairie weather such as hailstorms. Wind storms and hail caused 30% nest failure in one study. When sharing a grove with nesting great horned owls, the hawks suffer much egg loss due to owl predation. The species also suffers from frequent, unexplained egg infertility. =Status and conservation= Injured light-morph Swainson's hawk recuperating in Boise Zoo Swainson's hawk has suffered population declines since the first half of the twentieth century and was Blue-listed in the United States from 1972 to 1982. It has since been placed on the National Audubon's List of Special Concern in 1986. It is now listed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as a Category 3C candidate. Swainson's hawk was removed from the active federal list because it was found to be more abundant than previously thought; it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. It remains listed as a threatened species by the California Department of Fish and Game as it has been since 1983. A major cause of Swainson's hawk population decline was pesticide use in its wintering grounds of Argentina. Farmers there were using pesticides (DDT and monocrotophos) to control grasshopper and locust infestations, and Swainson's hawks were ingesting these pesticides in several different ways, but mainly by gorging themselves on the insects as they lay dying. The U.S. has worked with Argentine farmers to resolve this problem. Swainson's hawk has adapted well to grazing and pastureland and seems to be holding its own over much of its breeding range, from northern Mexico to the southern parts of the prairie provinces. However, far western populations, like that of Oregon, and southern California, have drastically declined, often due to habitat loss or incompatible agricultural practices. A possible reason for declines in parts of its range may be agriculturally motivated reductions in populations of both ground squirrels and grasshoppers, major seasonal foods. Although often nesting close to human activity, some Swainson's hawks are very easily disturbed at the nest and often desert, especially early in the season. The bird is often quite tame and an easy target for shooters traveling isolated prairie roads. The species may also be affected in ways yet to be understood by some insecticides and herbicides, including those used on its wintering grounds. Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area Observing Swainson's hawk One of the best places to view the hawk is in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) in Idaho. Birds in the NCA are most frequently sighted in mid March, May, and June, in the early morning and evening when they are actively hunting. In April, Swanson's hawks engage in more sedentary breeding and egg-guarding, and are thus more difficult to spot. In July, rising canyon temperatures make prey scarce, so many birds of prey migrate away. References :This article incorporates text from the Bureau of Land Management which is in the public domain.

A portable, mortar- like launcher was used;Rottman 2013, p.117. it allowed for a three-man team to transport and fire the missile;Parsch 2003 Lobber was described as being able to reliably hit a target \\"within the length of a football field\\" and was expected to cost less than $1,000 USD per round. It was proposed that modular cargo sections be pre-packaged with supplies, with nose and tail sections attached to the needed section just before launch.Griswold 1959, p.117. The first test launch took place in December 1958 at Camp Irwin in California. Flight testing proved highly successful, and Convair proposed variants with explosive, chemical, and nuclear warheads; the United States Marine Corps also considered adopting the missile,Yenne 2006, p.48. and it was also proposed to develop a variant for anti-submarine warfare usage by the United States Navy. Larger variants were also proposed, as well as civilian usage for firefighting.Griswold 1959, p.236. However the inherent inaccuracy of the unguided, solid-fueled rocket, combined with logistical issues, meant that Lobber was not adopted for service.

The organisers, the Jat Mahasabha, stopped BJP MP Satish Gautam when he tried to speak to a TV reporter. Gautam had to leave Raja Mahendra Pratap Park, named after the Jat king. Raja Mahendra Pratap had given land to the famous Aligarh Muslim University on lease when he was a part of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan's movement that led to the formation of AMU's precursor, the Mohamedan Anglo-Oriental College, in 1875. The Raja, who was an alum of the college, later became a freedom fighter and was considered close to Marxist and nationalist leaders in India and abroad. In November 2019, The Uttar Pradesh cabinet gave its nod to setting up of a new university in Aligarh named after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh. ‚ÄúAfter becoming MP in 2014, I had demanded that Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh be given his due and AMU should give reservation to OBCs, SCs and STs. We have got the new university for the brighter future of the local youth. I will now ensure reservation to OBCs, SCs and STs at AMU,‚Äù said Gautam. In May 2018, Satish Kumar Gautam triggered unrest when he demanded the portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah be removed from Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Violent protests ensued, allegedly led by Hindu activists, over the portrait of the founder of Pakistan and former Muslim League leader. Following the protests, students from the university organized a peaceful protest to stand against the oppression. Satish sparked controversy once more in the month of May when a video surfaced of the MP abusing power in an attempt to interfere with the railway schedule. In the video, he is seen yelling at an official, demanding that the Vaishali Express enter the station before the scheduled Rajdhani Express due to the regional president of BJP arriving from the former. Personal life Satish married Meenakshi Gautam on 30 April 1993. Satish is fond of sports, particularly Kabaddi.

He is the national president of Parakh Mahasangh, and is the State President of the party's SC wing. He is an influential leader of the party and is well recognised nationwide for his activism related to issues of social justice. Early life  He was born in Begariya village, Tehsil-Mohanlalganj, District-Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh into a schedule caste (Pasi) community to Shri Kallu Prasad and Smt. Parvati Devi. His mother was a housewife and his father was a farmer. The small land holding was not sufficient for family subsistence. Kishore had very limited opportunities and means. He was average in academics but was known for his honesty and inquisitive mind. He was believed to be a brave person by his villagers. They used to say that no one could ever dare to confront him as he always stood for the truth and what was right. His parents used to worry a lot, at times, when he used to get into others‚Äô disputes, stand beside those students who were weak and speak up for those who were subjected to exploitation and discrimination. In order to drive him off from being getting into any unwanted situations his parents used to say that he loved to invite quarrels and ruckus. On being asked he used to have no answer why he used to invite problems for himself and family. It is now that he explains it that it was his sense of justice which used to drive him to take on those who used to exploit the weak and poor. He used to even stop his father whenever he felt that he was not giving due respect to his mother. On being asked for what would he risk his life for, he said that it used to be a very spontaneous reaction whenever he witnessed injustice happening. Education  After completing his intermediate studies at his native place, Kali Charan Inter college, Lucknow, Kishore took admission in under graduate course at C.R. Degree College but could not continue as he got involved in family illness, and labourers and cultivators' causes. The village where he was born was not connected to roads and electricity, so he frequently visited the administrative officers and local leaders to get the issues fixed and to get the village uplifted, which in a way still reminded one of a primitive village. Kishore throughout his school times was forced to struggle a lot. He had to travel around 20 km on foot daily to attend classes. He could buy a bicycle only in class 12th, after getting his first scholarship in 1977. Career Kishore was MLA from Malihabad constituency in 2002.

G√ºnd√ºz is interested in the use of \\"improvisation, ritual, and public action as tools for investigating political realities and social movement.\\" Early life and education G√ºnd√ºz was born in 1979 in Ankara, grew up in ƒ∞zmir, and now lives in Istanbul. From 1996 to 2002, he studied in the Electrical and Agriculture departments at the Aegean University in Izmir. In 2003 he transferred to the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Teknik √úniversitesi in Turkey, where he studied art, design, music, and dance, receiving a B.A. degree. In 2007, as a participant in an exchange program, he took a course at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in the U.S. A year later, he attended a course in ‚ÄúImPulzTanz‚Äù at the Vienna International Dance Festival. In 2008 he completed his studies with a Master of Performing Arts at Mimar Sinan University in Istanbul. Career G√ºnd√ºz has exhibited art works at the Modern Dance Society and Aegean University in Izmir; at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara; at the Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum, Galata Art Space, and the BM Contemporary Art Center in Istanbul; at the B√ºy√ºk Salon in ƒ∞zmit; and at the International Festival of Choreographic Miniatures in Belgrade. He has participated in several group projects in Istanbul and Ankara, and has been involved in a number of \\"dance performance experiences\\" and \\"theater performance experiences\\" in Istanbul, Ankara, Sarajevo, Venice, and elsewhere. He has also been a street performer for many years. =Political activities before \\"standing man\\"= Der Spiegel reported in 2013 that a couple of years earlier G√ºnd√ºz had \\"protested the headscarf ban at Turkish universities.\\" The newspaper quoted him as saying that \\"We tied headscarves on and sat in the lecture halls.\\" =Background to Taksim Square protest= Peaceful protests began to take place in Istanbul on 28 May 2013 over government plans to eliminate Gezi Park, one of the city's few green areas, and to begin development on the site. Peaceful demonstrators were attacked by police with tear gas and batons, leading to national protests by people who were more concerned about the government's authoritarian response than about Gezi Park. On 17 June, the government prohibited demonstrations in Istanbul. It was two days after police had \\"swept the square clear of protesters with teargas and water cannon.\\" The Guardian noted that after being \\"driven from the square and the park\\", protesters \\"talked about the need to find new ways of getting their message across.\\" =\\"Standing man\\"= At around 6 p.m. on 17 June, G√ºnd√ºz drove to Taksim Square, near Gezi Park, which had been sealed off owing to the widespread anti-government protests. He walked to the center of the square and stood there silently in protest against the crackdown on demonstrations in Gezi Park. He was wearing \\"a white shirt and dark pants, with his backpack in front of him.\\" He also had several bottles of water at his feet. He was facing the Atat√ºrk Cultural Center, which is decked in Turkish flags and at the top of which hangs a large portrait of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, who established Turkey as a secular state. G√ºnd√ºz planned to stand silently in the square for a long period ‚Äì several days, according to some sources; a full month, according to others. The Huffington Post reported that his \\"plan was to stay standing still there for a month, breaking every 24 hours for three hours' rest, while a friend took his place.\\" At first his act of nonviolent resistance, which he had not announced in advance and which was unaccompanied by any sign or banner explaining his action, went unnoticed. After he began to draw notice, people \\"began taking pictures and spreading the word about it on Twitter.\\" Some sources indicate that bystanders began to notice G√ºnd√ºz's protest after about 15 minutes; others suggest, in the words of the New York Daily News, that \\"G√ºnd√ºz stood for several hours unnoticed before his presence on the flashpoint square went viral on the social network Twitter.\\" According to NPR, many of the people on the square \\"didn't take him very seriously\\" at first, \\"with some even mockingly posing for photos with him\\"; at one juncture, \\"police and others tried prodding a response out of him.\\" Yet \\"he remained perfectly still and ignored them. The one occasion he did move, though, was to unbutton his pants in case they wanted to strip search him.\\" \\"For this new protest to work,\\" reported one source, \\"G√ºnd√ºz's friends positioned themselves outside the square in a bid to prevent well- wishers trying to approach him. One of them, a young woman named Asma, explained, 'We want to protect him from any provocation...He has to be alone in the middle of the square, otherwise the police will use the pretext of a gathering to clear everyone away.'\\" Over time, \\"a human chain formed an immense circle around him. Some of the youths there began arguing over whether to join him or stay well clear, as G√ºnd√ºz's friends wanted.\\" In time, however, G√ºnd√ºz was \\"joined by hundreds of others who in solidarity decided to join his protest by standing for hours on end.\\" According to one source, 300 people joined him over the course of eight hours, standing and staring at the Ataturk Cultural Center. Eventually, at 2 a.m., \\"Turkish police intervened, clearing the square and arresting several demonstrators,\\" claiming that they were blocking traffic. Some sources indicate that there were ten arrests. According to Reuters, however, \\"dozens of people who had joined G√ºnd√ºz at the silent protest were arrested.\\" Some sources maintain that \\"G√ºnd√ºz slipped away into the crowd,\\" while Der Spiegel, quoting G√ºnd√ºz himself, states that police officers detained him but \\"weren't quite sure what to do with him.\\" The police, reportedly, wondered: \\"Was it a protest, or was he crazy? Should they really go after a young man who was simply standing there?\\" The police searched his backpack, finding nothing, and then \\"made it clear that he should get lost or expect the use of force.\\" G√ºnd√ºz told Der Spiegel that he then \\"took three steps back,\\" and when \\"this didn't make an impression on them‚Ä¶I ended my campaign. I didn't want any further violence.\\"\\"Standing Man and the Impromptu Performance of Hope: An Interview with Erdem Gunduz\\" by Erin B. Mee. TDR 58:3, T223, 69‚Äì83. G√ºnd√ºz became known as \\"the standing man.\\" The hashtags \\"standingman\\" and \\"duranadam\\" (\\"standing man\\" in Turkish) went viral on Twitter. =Other \\"standing man\\" actions= As news of G√ºnd√ºz's action spread, other opponents of the Turkish government began to engage in similar protests around the country. In the words of Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and social- media commentator, the \\"standing man\\" concept \\"spread throughout Istanbul and other cities in several hours.\\" A woman in Ankara chose to stand in a spot where a protester had been killed by police. In Ankara, \\"about 25 'standingman' protesters were detained.\\" Three men stood at a spot in Istanbul, north of Taksim Square, where a Turkish-Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink, had been shot to death in 2007. Also, a group of men and women stood facing a former hotel in the city of Sivas where 37 people, mostly members of the Alevi minority, died in a 1993 fire started during an Islamist protest against the presence at a meeting there of a translator of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. In Hatay Province on the Syrian border, \\"a man stood with his hands in his pockets beside a makeshift shrine for Abdullah Comert, who was killed during clashes there between police and protesters.\\" The Business Insider reported that the day after G√ºnd√ºz‚Äôs protest, \\"more ‚Äòstanding man‚Äô protesters were back in Taksim Square\\", noting also that \\"The idea even spread abroad to New York City, showing the global appeal of Turkish protests that began as simple opposition to the demolition of a park in Istanbul.\\" After G√ºnd√ºz's protest, Interior Minister Muammer G√ºler stated \\"that there would be no police swoop against similar\\" actions. \\"If this protest does not harm public order or influence life generally, we will not intervene in such protests,\\" he said. G√ºnd√ºz's views and comments G√ºnd√ºz, according to the New York Daily News, \\"sought to play down his importance in demonstrations despite the huge number of people who followed his lead.\\" \\"I'm not the type to talk about politics,\\" G√ºnd√ºz told Der Spiegel after his demonstration. \\"I'm an artist. I prefer to talk about dance.\\" He said that it was \\"important that I protest alone, as an individual,\\" explaining that \\"When one does this in a group, it is immediately considered a terrorist organization.\\" He also stated that, being a dancer, he is \\"concerned with physicality. What am I supposed to think when a theologian says publicly that pregnant women should no longer show themselves in public because the sight of them is unsavory? When women are encouraged to have at least three, or better yet, five, children? What kind of social concept is that? What kind of understanding of freedom?\\" He told H√ºrriyet TV: \\"Maybe the media and people will learn something from this silent standing, this resistance...Maybe they will feel some empathy. I am just an ordinary citizen of this country. We want our voices to be heard.\\" G√ºnd√ºz told the BBC: \\"I am just one protester, I'm just one artist. There are many artists and many, many young people on the streets. I am nothing[,] but the idea is important, why people resist the government but the government didn't want to understand, didn't try to understand why people are on the streets [for] 19 days.\\" He also told the BBC that \\"The real violence is not showing what is going on...Four people have died, there are thousands of wounded, but the media, unfortunately, has shown us nothing.\\" According to Der Spiegel, G√ºnd√ºz \\"has no party affiliation, nor does he oppose Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government or support the opposition. But, like thousands of others, he has been drawn to demonstrations at Gezi Park, where people are protesting the authoritarian leadership of the country.\\" The Guardian, however, described G√ºnd√ºz as a \\"left-Kemalist.\\" Reactions Square in Lublin, \\"named\\" after Erdem G√ºnd√ºz as an art installation (Zbigniew Libera) As one source put it, G√ºnd√ºz's \\"quiet image seems to have struck a cord [sic] with sympathizers who are more used to seeing violent images of stone-throwing youths battling police officers and tear gas.\\" Commentators pointed out that G√ºnd√ºz's peaceful, solitary protest formed a sharp contrast with the recent violent clashes in which approximately 5,000 people had been injured and at least four had died. Many observers have compared his action to that of Tank Man, the single anti-government protester who had blocked a line of tanks in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. G√ºnd√ºz has \\"had many imitators, and some claim they chose this form of protest before G√ºnd√ºz,\\" reported Der Spiegel. \\"Many are in awe of him, but he is also hated.\\" It has been suggested that the \\"standing man\\" approach to resistance \\"could prove more difficult for the government to antagonize and meet with force.\\" \\"Erdem G√ºnd√ºz is a legend,\\" wrote Richard Seymour in The Guardian. \\"And all he had to do to earn this status was to stand completely still.\\" Seymour described his action as \\"a silent, stubborn and dignified protest against the brutality of the police response to demonstrators, which had culminated in a sinister weekend assault whose targets included medics and staff who treated the wounded. Indeed, the ministry of health went so far as to threaten to withdraw the licences of medical personnel who treated protesters injured by police.\\" Seymour noted that G√ºnd√ºz's action drew on \\"the tradition of passive resistance,\\" that such actions have \\"been the death knell of recalcitrant regimes,\\" and that \\"passive resistance is not merely symbolic; it confuses and derails the calculations of the rulers.\\" G√ºnd√ºz's protest, maintained Seymour, \\"was both an affront and a question for the authorities: beat him? Why? He's just standing there. Leave him alone? Then he wins, doesn't he?\\" The \\"moving, motionless protest,\\" Seymour opined, \\"is a symbol of great peril for the Turkish regime.\\" Honors and awards In 2005, the Turco-British Association gave him a prize for his work at the University Students' Art Exhibition. G√ºnd√ºz won the M100 Media Award, a human-rights award, in Potsdam, Germany, in 2013. The Human Rights Foundation awarded G√ºnd√ºz the 2014 V√°clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent on May 2nd. G√ºnd√ºz' fellow 2014 laureates are the members of Russian punk protest group Pussy Riot. Future Although he is aware of photographs of himself \\"with a bull's-eye on them,\\" G√ºnd√ºz \\"is not afraid,\\" saying that even if Erdogan gives in to protesters, \\"a new government leader will come in and do similar things.\\" Turkey's authoritarian system, he said, \\"must be eliminated to make room for more democracy and freedom.\\" Although he intends to continue to agitate for change, however, he \\"isn't planning a repeat performance\\" of his standing-man act, explaining: \\"One does something like that once, and that's it.\\" See also *2013‚Äì14 protests in Turkey *Media censorship and disinformation during the 2013 protests in Turkey *Tank Man *Timeline of the 2013 protests in Turkey References Category:Living people Category:1979 births Category:People from Ankara Category:Turkish male dancers Category:Turkish performance artists ","title":"Erdem G√ºnd√ºz"},{"id":"42781434","text":"Sushmita Dev (born 25 September 1972) is a politician and a member of the Indian National Congress.

Due to the lack of manpower and money to preserve the tunnel, it was closed and abandoned in 1986.

He was also a member of 16th Lok Sabha of India.He was born in Sakleshpura, Hassan. He represents Mysore constituency of Karnataka and he is the President of Yuva Morcha Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Karnataka. He won the Mysore Lok Sabha seat in 2019 with a margin of 1.39 Lakh votes by defeating the Congress candidate. Also he is the only candidate in history of Mysore lok sabha constituency to secure more than 5 lakh votes in both 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.  Career  = As journalist = Simha joined the Kannada-language newspaper Vijaya Karnataka in 1999 as a trainee. He was later elevated as the editor and functioned under senior editor Vishweshwar Bhat during the time. He wrote his column under the title Bettale Jagattu (The Naked World) espousing Hindutva and being fiercely critical of anybody opposing it. Writing an article for the Outlook in 2014, he claimed that with his book Narendra Modi: Yaaru Thuliyada Haadi (Narendra Modi: The Untrodden Road) written in 2008, Simha \\"introduc[ed] Modi to Karnataka.\\" Expressing his desire to contest from the Udupi Chikmagalur constituency as a member of the BJP in the 2014 general election, his candidature was accepted by the party, but was asked to contest from Mysore. Then a journalist with Kannada Prabha, Simha resigned in April 2014 before beginning his electoral campaign, and subsequently winning the seat. He summed up: \\"In 33 days, I had gone from columnist to parliamentarian.\\" = As politician = In June 2015, Simha was appointed as a member of the Press Council of India. As a politician and a Member of the Parliament (MP), Simha came to be known for his radical stances in the promotion of hardline Hindutva.  Controversies  Described as \\"temperamental\\", Simha's tenure as an MP was marked by several controversies. He was a vocal against government of Karnataka's birthday celebrations of Tipu Sultan starting 2015. He voiced that Sultan could be a \\"role model only for Islamists\\" and that the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was \\"encouraging Jihadists\\" in the State. In 2017, against this backdrop, and police's prohibitory orders against taking procession of Hanuman Jayanti's organizers in Hunsur, a town in his constituency, Simha was arrested after he violated the prohibitory orders. In a widely circulated video, he was seen subsequently threatening the police officials and questioning their intent of \\"restricting\\" celebration of festivals of the Hindu faith, and barging through the barricade in his car. In February 2017, Simha received criticism after he compared Gurmehar Kaur, a student of Delhi University who spoke against the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student body affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, to gangster Dawood Ibrahim. Simha courted controversy again in November that year while making statements against actor Prakash Raj after the latter questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence following \\"certain killings\\" in the country. Simha had tweeted, \\"Being sad due to son's death, having left your wife and ran behind a dancer, Mr. Raj, do you have any right to say anything to Yogi, Modi\\". He was subsequently sent a legal notice to by Raj calling for an unconditional public apology, and that failing which he would \\"press criminal charges\\" against him.

This movement started as a Facebook page, called My Stealthy Freedom, where women in Iran post photos of themselves without scarves, as a protest against the compulsory hijab laws in the country. By the end of 2016 page has surpassed 1 million Facebook likes. The initiative has received wide international and national coverage,Khiabany 2016, p. 225 and has been both praised and criticized. Chronology of My Stealthy Freedom The Facebook page called Stealthy Freedom was set up on 5 May 2014 and it is dedicated to posting images of women with their hijab (scarf) removed. Many women have submitted their pictures without hijab, taken in various locations: parks, beaches, markets, streets, and elsewhere.Khiabany 2016, p. 225 Alinejad said that the campaign began rather simply: In a few days, the page had received over 100,000 likes, in early 2015 it jumped up to 760,000 followers, and by the end of 2016 it reached over 968,000 likes.Tahmasebi-Birgani 2017, p. 186 In an interview with BBC in 2014, Alinejad insisted that women who have sent their photos are not women activists, but just ordinary women talking from their hearts. Many of the pictures were accompanied by captions, some in a poetic language, and others were mischievous or defiant. Many captions have placed the emphasis on a right to choose or freedom of choice.Khiabany 2016, p. 226 In January 2015, Alinejad also launched My Forbidden Song as part of My Stealthy Freedom campaign, and two months later she revived the Green movement slogan You are all media.Khiabany 2016, p. 227 My Stealthy Freedom has been described as an extremely active and lively space, publishing each month around 35‚Äì50 new pieces of content which are shared by hundreds of people. In mid 2014, #MyStealthyFreedom became an internationally used hashtag on Facebook and Twitter, averaging one million shares per week.Novak; Khazraee 2014, p. 1094 By the end of 2016, the page had shared over 2,000 photos of Iranian women without the hijab. The page has gained many international supporters, posts are published mostly in Persian with English and French translations.Koo 2016, p. 143 In May 2017, Alinejad launched the White Wednesdays campaign, encouraging women to remove their headscarves on Wednesdays or wear white shawls as a sign of protest. Reactions =Related and rival initiatives= Following Alinejad's initiative, queers also opened a Facebook page, My Stealthy Homosexual Freedom, posting images with the inverted aesthetics of covered faces with rainbow flags or headless images.Ganji 2015, p. 114 Iman Ganji, a doctoral student from Free University of Berlin, sees both pages as a result of general political transformation in mid-2010s, when a new middle- right government replaced the far-right one, and states that the struggle for the liberation of desire has long allied women's and queer movements together in Iran. In mid-2016, some Iranian men started Men In Hijab campaign, expressing their thoughts as well as briefly wearing the hijab themselves. This Facebook page has received over 100,000 likes and is largest among rival initiatives, but it has been criticized by foreign commentators as a \\"laddish\\" for containing juvenile jokes, cartoons and videos.Khiabany 2016, p. 228 Among other smaller rivals is the Real Freedom of Iranian Women page, launched exactly a week after the My Stealthy Freedom, with a message celebrating the veil: \\"Beautiful Hijab, My Right, My Choice, My Life\\". Former page has received less than 10,000 likes and has also been criticized for insisting that Stealthy Freedom is part of a soft war against Iran, and also for trying to generate fear.Khiabany 2016, p. 229 =Praise= Sedigheh Karimi, researcher at the University of Melbourne, in 2014 argued that virtual environment like My Stealthy Freedom provides opportunities for independent representation and for introducing new identities.Karimi 2014, pp. 228 & 230 Alison N. Novak from Temple University and Emad Khazraee from the University of Pennsylvania stressed importance of breaking boundaries of the state's internet censorship efforts: \\"The goal of My Stealthy Freedom is to mobilize public opinion regarding the issue of women's rights, hijab, and the female body.\\"Novak; Khazraee 2014, p. 1095 Gholam Khiabany, a senior lecturer in Media and Communications department at Goldsmiths, University of London, has praised Alinejad's campaign,Khiabany 2016, p. 230 as has Victoria Tahmasebi- Birgani, an assistant professor of women and gender studies at the University of Toronto.Tahmasebi-Birgani 2017, p. 193. According to Gi Yeon Koo, a cultural anthropologist from Seoul National University, \\"This online movement finds its value in that it has become a new platform for women to raise their voices in the public sphere.\\"Koo 2016, p. 154 As Iman Ganji, Koo also aligns the movement with social changes started since Hassan Rouhani assumed the presidency.Koo 2016, p. 153 In 2015 the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy gave Alinejad its women's rights award for \\"stirring the conscience of humanity to support the struggle of Iranian women for basic human rights.\\" =Criticism= There are no official statistics to show what percentage of Iranian women are against mandatory wearing of the hijab. One western researcher says, \\"It is true that there are still many women in Iranian society who choose, of their own will, to retain the image of the hijab and wear the most conservative type of hijab. Furthermore, it cannot be said that the women participating in this stealthy movement of removing their hijab are the majority.\\"Koo 2016, p. 154  Misinformation  In early June 2014, Iranian state television ran a story claiming that Masih Alinejad was in a drug-induced, hallucinatory state when she removed her clothing and was raped by three men in front of her son. Alinejad said that the story is false. Eurocentrism and orientalism Researchers state that although movement focuses primarily on gendered state violence, its message has been disturbed by challenges arising from the embedded normativity of conceptualizations of gender and sexualities in relation to Middle Eastern women in general and Iranian women in particular.Seddighi; Tafakori 2016, p. 926 See also *Girls of Enghelab Street *Kashf-e hijab *Iranian clothing *Iranian women's clothing *Topfreedom *Yasmine Mohammed References Bibliography     * External links * My Stealthy Freedom (official website) Category:2014 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Internet activism Category:Facebook Category:Sex segregation and Islam Category:Women's rights in Iran Category:Controversies in the United Kingdom ","title":"My Stealthy Freedom"},{"id":"42781722","text":"Karadi Sanganna Amarappa is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

The reserve is situated south of West Wyalong and may be accessed via the Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road. The reserve is an important refuge for native flora and fauna in a highly fragmented landscape, one in which the majority of the original vegetation has been removed. Description Road into The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve Middle dam in The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee‚Äìbroombush in the absence on Triodia (Spinefex); in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature‚Äôs category for the Reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve. The traditional landowners of the region are the Wiradjuri people, inhabiting the region for over 40,000 years prior to European settlement in the area. Little is known about the Wiradjuri people's use of the Reserve except that it was likely a place for gathering food. After European settlement but prior to its listing as a Nature Reserve the site was used as camp on the traveling stock route and as a public watering place. In 1960 it became NSW Wildlife Refuge No. 2 but was still available for use as a watering ground and camp. The area officially became The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve in 1966; prior to its change in status a rest stop was cut into a portion of the reserve along the Newell Highway and remains there today.

Due to its size and isolation the Reserve is only able to provide somewhat limited resources to support large numbers of resident animal species. Fire history for the Reserve prior to 1966 is not well documented but evidence at the site suggests it is long-unburnt and recent records show fire has not occurred there since it was announced as a Reserve in 1966.New South Wales Government: Office of Environment and Heritage: Nature Conservation. 2014. Charcoal Tank Reserve Fire Management Strategy: http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/firemanagement/TheCharcoalTankNRfms.htm  Flora  Even though the Reserve is small there are three distinct communities of vegetation. The dominant community is mallee-broombush made up of Melaleuca uncinata (broombush), Eucalyptus polybractea (blue mallee), Eucalyptus viridis (green mallee) and Eucalyptus behriana (bull mallee). Two notable native shrubs sharing the mallee-broombush community are Kunzea parvifolia (purple kunzea) and Acacia rhigiophylla (dagger-leaved wattle). The second largest group of vegetation is a eucalyptus-callitris mix; including Eucalyptus microcarpa (inland grey box), Eucalyptus sideroxylon, and Callitris endlicheri (black cypress pine). The eucalyptus and callitris community has a well- developed understory that includes native shrubs such as Cassinia laevis (cough bush), Santalum acuminatum (quandong) and Acacia hakeoides (hakea wattle). Understory and groundcover in other areas of the Reserve has been lost or badly degraded. The smallest community of vegetation is made up of Callitris endlicheri (black cypress pine), Eucalyptus Dwyeri (Dwyer's red-gum) and Acacia doratoxylon (currawang). Eucalyptus sideroxylon (mugga ironbark) The dominant community of mallee and broombush is listed as critically endangered under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act, with only two other Nature Reserves in NSW protecting similar communities.New South Wales Government: Office of Environment and Heritage: Nature Conservation. 2011. Mallee and Mallee-Broombush dominated woodland and shrubland, lacking Triodia, in the NSW South Western Slopes Bioregion - critically endangered ecological community listing. http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/malleeandmalleebroombushFD.htm Mallee and broombush have been extensively harvested in the region since European settlement.Priddel, D., Wheeler, R., Copley, P. 2007. Does the integrity or structure of mallee habitat influence the degree of fox predation on Malleefowl (Leiposa ocellata), Emu. 107: 100-101, 104-106. Callitris endlicheri (black cypress)  Fauna  Birds represent the largest number of vertebrate species occurring within the reserve with over 165 species identified; 96 species have been banded and released as part of a long-term monitoring study in the Reserve.Clayton, M. 2014. ACT Regional Organiser, Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme. Personal Communication. Some of the Reserve's breeding residents such as Climacteris picumnus victoriae (brown treecreeper) and Daphoenositta chrysopyera (varied sittella) are listed as vulnerable under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation (TSC) Act 1995. Data from the long-term bird banding project shows a decrease in the number of brown treecreepers present. There are twenty other birds that utilize the reserve that are also listed as vulnerable under the NSW TSC Act; some examples are Grantiella picta (painted honeyeater), Polytelis swainsonii (superb parrot), Anthochaera phrygia (regent honeyeater) and the Lathamus discolor (swift parrot). Under Australia's national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 the regent honeyeater and the swift parrot are listed as endangered and the superb parrot as vulnerable.Australian Government 4, Department of the Environment. 2014. EPBC Act List of Threatened Fauna: http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi- bin/sprat/public/publicthreatenedlist.pl?wanted=fauna Polytelis swainsonii (superb parrot) Sadly, species such as Leipoa ocellata (malleefowl), Pachycephala inorta (Gilbert's whistler), Drymodes superciliaris (southern scrub robin) and Falcunculus frontatus (crested shrike-tit) have become extinct from the Reserve in the past 30 years; the last crested shrike-tit banded in the reserve was in 1997.Ewin, P. 2007. 4. Malleefowl in New South Wales: Review of Past and Future Actions. Page 3. The disappearance of the malleefowl not only in the Reserve but the surrounding region is due to a number of pressures; these include predation by Vulpes vulpes (red fox) and Felis catus (cat), fragmentation and loss of habitat, isolation, competition and degradation of habitat by domestic livestock and introduced vertebrates such as Oryctolagus cuniculus (European rabbit) and Capra hircu (goat).Priddel, D., Wheeler, R. 1994. Mortality of Captive-raised Malleefowl, Leipoa ocellata, Released into a Mallee Remnant within the Wheat-belt of New South Wales, Wildlife Research. 21: 543, 551. More recently the Reserve's long-term bird monitoring study has recorded a decline in species that were previously abundant or regular visitors to the Reserve, this includes species such as the Pomatostomus temporalis (grey-crowned babbler), Hylacola cauta (shy heath wren), Stagonopleura guttata (diamond firetail), and Eopsaltria griseogularis (eastern yellow robin) Grantiella picta (painted honeyeater) Tachyglossus aculeatus (short-beaked echidna) Other fauna found in the Reserve includes mammals such as Macropus giganteus (eastern grey kangaroo), Wallabia bicolor (swamp wallaby), Tachyglossus aculeatus (short-beaked echidna) and Petaurus breviceps (sugar glider). Five amphibians are known to occur in the Reserve and nine species of reptile such as Varanus varius (lace monitor) and Pseudonaja textilis (eastern brown snake). Some invertebrates found in the Reserve are Cherax destructor (common freshwater yabby) and at least nine species of butterfly including Delias aganippe (spotted Jezebel) and Vanessa kershawi (Australian painted lady).Bond, S. 2014. Personal Communication. The reserve may also be important to the long-term survival of the locally threatened butterfly Candalides hyacinthinus simplex (western dusky-blue), this species is dependent upon Mallee for its survival and has been located in remnant mallee habitat close to West Wyalong.Braby, M. F., Edwards, T.D. 2006. The butterfly fauna of the Griffith district, a fragmented semi-arid landscape in inland New South Wales, Pacific Conservation Biology. 12: 1,7-8. Stagonopleura guttata (diamond firetail) in the hand Vertebrate pest species recorded infrequently in The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve include Felis catus (cat), Vulpes vulpes (red fox), Sturnus vulgaris (common starling), Oryctolagus cuniculus (European rabbit) Lepus europaeus (European brown hare), Mus musculus (house mouse) and Sus scrofa (pig).  Environmental threats  Due to its small size and isolation in a fragmented landscape The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve's structure and biodiversity are at risk from threatening processes such as climate change, edge effects, pest species, pollution, high intensity fire and further clearing of roadside and patch remnants in the region. Any of these threatening processes can have serious impacts on biodiversity but they are rarely encountered in isolation having a compounding effect on individual species and ecosystems as a whole. Fragmentation has isolated the Reserve from other remnant patches making it difficult for species to move through the landscape. This places species at greater risk of local extinction by preventing range expansion and therefore decreasing genetic diversity and trapping species in areas without sufficient resources.Ford, H. A., Barrett, G.W., Saunders, D.A., Recher, H.F. 2001. Why have the birds in the woodlands of Southern Australia declined? Biological Conservation. 97: 71-74, 76-79, 81-82.Driscoll, D. 2007. The conservation challenge of sustaining spatially dependent evolution, Pacific Conservation Biology. 13: 84. Once a species becomes locally extinct re-colonisation through immigration across a fragmented landscape is highly unlikely. If species are forced to move across a fragmented landscape they are at greater risk of predation or collisions with vehicles; this is especially the case for species in the Reserve which is bordered by the Newell Highway Farmland surrounding The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve Roadside vegetation in NSW is now extremely important to the survival of many species that rely on them as the only corridors to larger remnants; this includes species found in the Reserve. Small remnants such as The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve and roadside strips are under increased pressure from edge effects as they have smaller interior habitats. The Reserve's edges are linear and artificial making it more susceptible to degrading processes including severe weather events, erosion, insecticidal drift from neighbouring properties, select species dominance, grazing by neighbouring domestic livestock and invasion of pest species.Briggs, S.V., Seddon, J.A., Doyle, S.J. 2007. Structure of bird communities in woodland remnants in central New South Wales, Australia, Australian Journal of Zoology. 55: 35, 38. Predation of bird nests along artificially created edges in Mallee is higher than naturally occurring Mallee edges. Gully erosion in the west of the reserve is a long-standing problem, caused by runoff from the cleared surrounding paddocks and the artificial drainage line to dams. The Reserve becomes a sink for the cleared surrounding landscape with topsoil disturbance and potential pollutants and seeds of pest plants entering the Reserve.Munoz-Robles, C., Reid, N., Tughe, M., Briggs, S.V., Wilson, B. 2010. Soil hydrological and erosional responses in patches and inert-patches in vegetation states in semi-arid, Australia, Geoderma. 160: 524. The rest stop that has encroached into the Reserve from the Newell Highway allows easy access to the public. The area of the Reserve immediately adjoining the rest stop is regularly polluted by rubbish and is used as a toilet. Rubbish may attract introduced pest species to the Reserve, and general public access can increase the likelihood of fire with makeshift fireplaces evident. The altering of weather patterns caused by anthropogenic climate change is a serious threat to the Reserve as the impact of increased severe weather events such as drought, fire, floods and storms can exacerbate existing threatening processes.Cook, D. 2010. Climate change and threatened wetland flora and communities. Australian Plant Conservation. 19: 24-25. Changes to the timing of seasonal onset can modify food availability such as nectar and impact on the survival and abundance of species as the metabolic cost of finding food increases. The Reserve has already been impacted by long periods of drought which have seen a decline in the overall abundance of bird species in the last 30 years. A recent study using data on Lichenostomus plumus (white-plumed honeyeater) collected in The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve over the past 23 years shows their size has increased in correlation with warmer mean temperatures and a decrease in rainfall.Gardner, J. L., Amano, T., Mackey, B.G., Sutherland, W. J., Clayton, M., Peters, A. 2014. Dynamic size responses to climate change: prevailing effects of rising temperature drive long-term body size increases in a semi-arid passerine. Global Change Biology. Early View Online. The study by Gardner shows selection against smaller individuals at breeding time. Selective mortality has the potential to threaten population viability as conditions in the region become dryer and temperatures increase Lichenostomus plumus (white-plumed honeyeater) If the rate of wildfire increases with climate change slow growing flora in the Reserve, such as Callitris endlicheri (black cypress pine), may be lost. Callitris rely on seeds alone for reproduction and post fire may be outcompeted by species such as Eucalyptus that are faster growing and have more recovery options through epicormic buds and lignotubers.Cohn, J.S., Lunt, I.D., Ross, K.A., Bradstock, R.A. 2011. How do slow growing, fire sensitive conifers survive in eucalypt woodlands? Journal of Vegetation Science. 22: 433.Cohn, J.S., Lunt, I.D., Ross, K.A., Bradstock, R.A., Koen, T. 2012. Interactions between dense Callitris and Eucaluptus and Callitris canopy trees in semiarid woodlands. Australian Journal of Botany. 60: 556.  Reserve management  The Charcoal Tank rest area The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve is managed by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service (NSW NPWS) under the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. Protection of the Reserve since 1966 has prevented Mallee and Broombush from being harvested and further cleared for agriculture. Protection has also decreased threatening processes that may have otherwise increased as a result of the site being used as a camp along the travelling stock route. Problems such as overgrazing, erosion and degradation caused by hooved animals and the spread of exotic seeds through the dung of domestic herbivores are caused by such itinerant campers. In accordance with the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 the NPWS have a formal management plan in place for the Reserve that outlines actions required to ensure its conservation, with the current plan running to 2021. The management plan outlines the conservation value of the Reserve, its current state, areas of concern, threats to conservation and prioritises management and action required. Some immediate management challenges include maintaining the fence line to prevent the entry of domestic livestock, erosion control and minimising pollution and disturbance from the adjoining rest stop. On a larger scale protecting remaining roadside remnants and those on private land will ensure that connections between The Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve and larger Reserves such as Buddigower (327 ha) are maintained Data collected as part of an ongoing and long-term bird banding study that commenced in July 1986 is extremely important to guiding the conservation and management of the Reserve. The banding group visits the site up to seven times per year and provides valuable information to the NSW NPWS, The Atlas for NSW Wildlife, scientific publications and the Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic BirdsNew South Wales Government: Office of Environment and Heritage. 2014. NSW BioNet the website for the Atlas of NSW Wildlife. http://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au The NSW NPWS works closely with the local community to manage the Reserve, including the West Wyalong Aboriginal Land Council, the Bland/Temora Bush Fire Management Committee and local rural fire brigades. The NSW NPWS has a 2014 fire management strategy in place that provides clear operational guidelines, information on the most sensitive sites within the Reserve, vegetation maps, fire suppression strategies and relevant contact details. Currently the strategy requires that fire in the Reserve be immediately suppressed, any prescribed burns may only occur after a formal review of environmental factors because of the critically endangered Mallee- Broombush community. The long-unburnt conditions of the Reserve are favourable to some species such as Acanthagenys rufogularis (spiny-cheeked honeyeaters).Taylor, R.S., Watson, S.J., Bennet, A.F., Clarker, M.F. 2013. Which fire management strategies benefit biodiversity? A landscape perspective case study using birds in mallee ecosystems of south-eastern Australian, Biological Conservation. 159: 248, 252-254. By contrast, Hylacola cauta (shy heath wren) seems to prefer habitat that contains vegetation with varying ranges of post fire age; the long unburnt status of the reserve along with drought may explain why this species has declined within the Reserve. Managing conflicting habitat requirements for a diverse range of species in a small area will be an ongoing challenge See also * Protected areas of New South Wales  References   Bibliography  * Pizzey, G., Knight, F. 2012.

He was awarded the IIT Delhi's Distinguished Alumni Award in October 2015. While at IIT, Sinha met his future wife Punita, and they were married in 1986. She is also an alumna of IIT Delhi and has also been awarded the IIT Delhi's Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012. After graduating from IIT Delhi in 1985, Sinha enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, and completed a Master of Science in Energy Management & Policy in 1986. Later, Sinha also attended Harvard Business School, and obtained an MBA with Distinction in 1992. Sinha's father is Yashwant Sinha a well-known Indian politician of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the former Finance Minister and Minister of External Affairs of India. His mother, Nilima Sinha, is a children's book writer and President of the Association of Writers and Illustrators for Children. He is the brother of businessman Sumant Sinha. Jayant's wife, Punita Kumar Sinha, is an investor and fund manager, and was Jayant's classmate in IIT Delhi. She is the Founder and Managing Partner of Pacific Paradigm Advisors, an independent investment advisory and management firm. Sinha and his wife have two sons. Political career Jayant Sinha has participated in Indian politics and policy-making since the 1990s. When his father became Finance Minister under Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1998-2002), Sinha provided policy inputs on several new initiatives such as the mortgage interest tax deduction and the Saral form to file income tax returns with ease and improve tax compliance. More recently, he served on Advisory Committees for the Finance and Telecom Ministries and advised the Indian Government on spurring entrepreneurship and impact investing. Sinha was one of the Principal Authors of the McKinsey-Nasscom industry reports in 2000 and 2005. Sinha has been active in Hazaribagh, assisting his father's election campaigns since 1998. He has also worked on a variety of projects in Hazaribagh and Ramgarh districts such as fostering self-help groups, distributing solar lanterns, improving drinking water quality, and getting village roads built. During the 2014 election campaign, Sinha worked with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help frame national economic policy, including organizing and hosting an international business leaders' forum with Mr. Modi in February 2014. Sinha has been an active contributor to the BJP's efforts to develop new campaign management technologies and systems. In 2014, Sinha contested Lok Sabha elections from the Hazaribagh seat in his home state of Jharkhand. He won the elections with a huge margin of 1,59,128 votes, getting a total of 4,06,931 in his favour. After joining parliament, Sinha was a member of four parliamentary committees - Public Accounts Committee, Standing Committee on Finance and Subordinate Committee on Legislation and of the Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. In 2019, Sinha contested for the second time from Hazaribagh constituency and won the elections by a margin of 479,548 votes, shattering all previous records. 728,798 votes were recorded in his favor out of the 1,070,929 votes cast. This was the most comprehensive victory in Eastern India. Sinha led a highly technology-savvy and data-driven campaign. Ministerial career =Ministry of Finance= Sinha was sworn-in as Minister of State in the Union Council of Ministers on 9 November 2014. Subsequently, he assumed charge at the Ministry of Finance in the Indian Government, working with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. There, he helped in driving landmark initiatives such as PM Mudra Yojana, Social Security Platform, devising the Indradhanush package for public sector banks, launching the India Aspiration Fund to promote entrepreneurship, and strengthening India's capital markets. He piloted key legislations, namely the Insurance Bill, Bankruptcy Bill, Negotiable Instruments Act and Regional Rural Banks Bill in the Parliament. He also helped in preparing the Union Budgets of 2015-16 and 2016‚Äì17, which were widely hailed as two of the most significant and visionary budgets in recent years. Sinha is often credited with devising and driving innovative financing institutions, such as the National Infrastructure and Investment Fund, Long Term Irrigation Fund, India Aspiration Fund and Higher Education Financing Agency. =Ministry of Civil Aviation= After the Ministry of Finance, Sinha moved to the Ministry of Civil Aviation on 6 July 2016. His appointment came just after the government unveiled the first-ever National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP). His work in the Ministry of Civil Aviation has been widely appreciated and has led to the complete transformation of India's aviation ecosystem. India is now the world's third largest domestic aviation market and has seen 50 months of unprecedented double digit passenger growth. It is the fastest-growing large aviation market in the world. The Regional Connectivity Scheme was formulated under Sinha's guidance and is the flagship scheme of the NCAP. On 27 April 2017 PM Narendra Modi launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme from the Jubbarhatti airport in Shimla. At the launch of the scheme, Mr Sinha said the citizens would reap the benefit of development of remote areas, enhance trade and commerce and more tourism expansion. UDAN has already added more than 35 airports to the existing 70 operational airports thus dramatically expanding the Indian aviation network and bringing air travel to Tier 2 and 3 cities such as Bikaner, Adhampur, and Kanpur. UDAN operates at three levels to ensure route profitability: reducing operating costs as much as possible, providing a market discovered subsidy for half the seats and guaranteeing a three-year exclusivity on routes. The second bidding round (UDAN 2) prioritized helicopters leading to bids for more than 50 heliports in hilly areas and islands. The focus in UDAN 3 is on tourism destinations such as Kajuraho and on international routes for cities such as Guwahati. The air traveller experience has been transformed during Sinha's tenure. He worked with security and customs agencies to reduce the use of unnecessary forms, eliminate baggage stamping, and enable e-boarding. Sinha developed the innovative AirSewa grievance redressal and flight information mobile app. With this app, air passengers can register their complaints about any member of the aviation ecosystem including airlines, airports, security, immigration, or customs. Passengers get an acknowledgement of their complaint and the government monitors satisfactory closure of their complaint. He has been a strong propagator of using technology to connect to the people directly and AirSewa concept originated from his handling of passenger grievances on various social media channels. Under his leadership, a Passenger Charter has been released to strengthen and formalize passenger rights. A first of its kind safety-oriented National No-Fly list has been formulated to prevent unruly behaviour during flights bringing down such incidents sharply. Sinha led the preparation of the NABH (Next Gen Airports for BHarat) Nirmaan program which was announced in Budget FY 18-19 and aims to strengthen airport infrastructure for a billion passenger trips. This would represent a five-fold capacity increase from the approximately 200 million trips in FY 17-18. He has been instrumental in introducing a revised public-private-partnership model for airport privatization and six airports have been offered for PPP. As part of the NABH Nirmaan program, over $15 billion of airport investments are currently underway in India. To ensure that Indian airports reflect local art and culture, Sinha worked with the Airports Authority of India to constitute a Design Council comprising India's top architects and artists. The Design Council provides a Design Brief incorporating a strong ‚Äòsense of place‚Äô for the design of airport terminals. This has resulted in much-praised terminal designs in Lucknow, Agartala, Leh, Chennai, Patna, and so on. Sinha also played a crucial role in conceptualising the framework for the strategic privatization of Air India including the creation of an innovative SPV structure to manage Air India's non-core assets. Sinha has also worked with the Air India Board to formulate the MaharajahDirect strategy for Air India to become a competitive global airline. Sinha led the formulation of the DigiYatra technology standards which brings together the aviation sector to implement a digital ecosystem for seamless, all-digital travel across all Indian airports and airlines. DigiYatra is being implement in Bengaluru airport in January 2019 and several AAI airports in March 2019. This is the first national digital traveller system in the world and is being studied for implementation in other countries as well. Sinha chairs the Drone Task Force and led the efforts to introduce India's world-leading drone regulations, which are based on his DigitalSky framework. The next set of drone regulations are intended to expand drone usage to cross the Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS), payload, and automation thresholds. The DigitalSky framework went live on December 1, 2018. The goal of the Drone Task Force is to ensure that India becomes a world leader in the design, manufacture, and safe usage of drones. In October 2016 Jayant Sinha signed an MoU between the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship for training of people in the various trades associated with the civil aviation sector to meet the potential of 60 lakh jobs in the next ten years. Later on February 28, 2017, MoS for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha inaugurated India's first ever integrated heliport in Rohini, New Delhi along with the then Union Minister for Civil Aviation Ashok Gajapathi Raju.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/jayant- sinha-urges-start-ups-to-explore-scope-of-developing-drone- rickshaws/articleshow/61936955.cms On September 4, 2018 along with the Union Minister of Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu, Sinha addressed the International Aviation Summit, organised to commemorate the milestone achievement of 50 months of double-digit growth in Indian Aviation. He has led the efforts to organize the Global Aviation Summit, which is to be held on January 15-16 2019. On September 2018 Jayant Sinha announced the digital sky policy that will enable the government of India to digitise the entire sky and control the drone ecosystem. This policy under the tenure of Jayant Sinha was in two phases. In the first phase, the platform will register pilots, devices and services providers. The second phase will include automation, bi-modal control and setting up of dedicated air corridors. Jayant Sinha Minister of State for Civil Aviation added that once we digitise the sky, we will be able to give people rights to use certain slices of it for some period of time. Industry experts believed that the policy has broken new ground with digital sky platform and NPNT (no permission, no take-off). Development of Hazaribagh On 23 February 2017 MP from Hazaribagh Jayant Sinha laid the foundation stone for three medical colleges in Dumka, Palamau and Hazaribagh along with the Chief Minister of Jharkhand Mr. Raghubar Das. Professional career After his graduation from Harvard Business School, Sinha joined McKinsey & Company in Boston, and was elected Partner in 1999. At McKinsey, Sinha co‚Äêled the Global Software & IT Services Practice. Sinha returned to India in 2002 with McKinsey, before leaving to join Courage Capital, a global special- situations hedge fund, to lead their India tech and investing efforts After Courage Capital, Sinha joined Omidyar Network, founded by Pam and Pierre Omidyar. Till December 2013, he was a partner at ON and the Managing Director of Omidyar Network India Advisors. He also served on Omidyar Network's five - member global executive committee. During his time there, Omidyar's India portfolio grew to over 35 companies and organizations totaling investments worth over $100 million. He also helped in funding the Indian Impact Investing Council. Sinha has served on the boards of several companies and organizations, including Daily Hunt, d.light, iMerit and Janaagraha. He was invited to serve on the International Advisory Board of the International Finance Corporation, Washington DC In the media Sinha has been quoted widely in the global media for his views on business and economic policy, including in The Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, the New York Times, CNN, Bloomberg, and CNBC. His essays and op-eds have been published in several major publications, including the Harvard Business Review and the Financial Times. Articles written by Jayant Sinha, such as the Paradox of Fast Growth Tigers in the McKinsey Quarterly 'Strategies That Fit Emerging Markets' in the Harvard Business Review and 'It is time for India to rein in its robber barons' http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/635c59e6-19cd-11e0-b921-00144feab49a.html#axzz3rvURZk3p in the Financial Times have widely been quoted in scholarly works and are used as reference material in business schools. In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in \\"Paradise Papers\\" allegations.  Social media  In 2018, Jayant Sinha triggered controversy by allegedly garlanding 8 lynching convicts. His father, Yashwant Sinha, criticised his actions publicly in multiple platforms. Sinha got involved in this matter in April 2018 after the Fast-Track Court sentenced all 11 adult accused to life imprisonment for murder on March 21, 2018. He and local BJP leaders had provided the accused the legal assistance and eight of them were released on bail on July 4, 2018 after spending a year in jail. The Hon'ble Ranchi High Court, which is the first court of appeal, has suspended the sentence of the eight accused and released them on bail while admitting their case. High Court order, inter alia, reads: \\"...it is only apparent that the appellants were the members of the mob, and in view of lack of evidence of specific assault against them, we are inclined to release the appellants on bail\\". Sinha restated his position immediately through a series of tweets,https://twitter.com/jayantsinha/status/1015453505803472896 explaining that (a) he condemned all violence and vigilantism; (b) the rule of law is supreme; (c) the guilty should be punished, but the innocent should get justice as well; and (d) he did not, in any way, condone vigilantism, and sincerely regretted if that's the impression that he gave. Through his media interviews, Sinha has repeatedly stated that his intervention is the matter was not to condone vigilantism but to ensure justice for all.

The episode was written by Caroline Dries and Brian Young and directed by Chris Grismer. Plot The episode starts with Caroline (Candice Accola) crying over Stefan's (Paul Wesley) dead body at the Whitmore dorm, while Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Elena (Nina Dobrev) arrive. Stefan watches them from the other side while he starts to be pulled from existence, as the other side continues to crumble. He tries to hold on and Lexi (Arielle Kebbel) appears, saving him. Damon meets Bonnie (Kat Graham) and is furious when he learns that they lost the only traveler who could help them with the spell, and he tells her to find another way because his brother is on the Other Side, along with other people they all care about, such as Alaric (Matthew Davis), and her grandmother, Sheila (Jasmine Guy). Enzo (Michael Malarkey) appears with a new plan, which requires a witch. Liv (Penelope Mitchell) and Luke (Chris Brochu) try to get as far away as they can to save themselves, however Elena appears in the middle of the road forcing Luke to stop the car, while Caroline stands behind the car. They get out and Elena informs them that Stefan is dead, and the spell has stopped, however they need their help to bring him back. Liv says that it is better that one of the doppelgangers is dead so they can all live, and Elena explains that if they bring Stefan back, they will kill the travelers. Liv still does not want to help, so Caroline snaps Luke's neck, sending him to the other side. Liv, not having any other choice, agrees to help them. In the meantime, Enzo takes Bonnie to meet the traveler (Silas) who will teach them the spell, but he will only help if they will bring him back to life as too. Back in Mystic Falls, Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) helps to evacuate the town while Markos (Raffi Barsoumian) is observing. He explains that he is not afraid of Damon or Stefan coming to save the town, simply because they cannot cross the line where the spell starts. To prove his point, he uses Julian (Tyler) (Michael Trevino), to show her what will happen to any supernatural creature if they try to enter the town. They push Julian into the spell's limits and he first loses his werewolf nature, then the vampire one and returns to the last state he was as human, dead. Tyler's spirit appears to Bonnie and passes through her to the Other Side, not before she tells him that they can bring him back. Damon explains that for his plan to bring everybody's loved ones back, they will have to kill many travelers so they can pass through Bonnie and their friends can pass through her to come back, like Markos did. Liz will have to gather all the travelers at one place. Matt (Zach Roerig) and Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) will cause a gas leak, head out of the town and then somehow they will explode the place where the travelers are gathered. At the same time, Liv will start the resurrection spell. Jeremy worries about what will happen to Bonnie when everything is in motion, but Bonnie reassures him that everything will be fine. In the meantime, Stefan and Lexi go to the Grill and catch up on news. She points out to him about Caroline and how she feels about him, but Stefan insists they are friends. Liz and Markos walk into the Grill and hear them talking. Stefan realizes that Liz is trying to gather the travelers in one place and figures out that his friends are planning something. Damon tells Elena the last part of the plan where someone has to trigger the explosion and that it will be him. Elena tries to talk him out of it because it is a suicide mission, but Damon asks her to respect his choice and promises that he will be back with the others from the Other Side. Jeremy and Matt navigate the caves under the city, trying to find the gas line. Liz successfully gathered the travelers at the Grill and tries to find a way to leave before Markos figures out that something is going on. Markos suspects something, so Liz stays for a drink to convince him nothing is happening. Matt and Jeremy find the gas line, break it to cause the leak and they leave. Bonnie waits for Grams so she can tell her to come back with the others. Grams appears to tell her that she does not want to go back because she found her peace knowing that she helped Bonnie to find hers and that she is not the only one to know how to sacrifice herself for others. The two of them say goodbye and Grams leaves. At 7pm, Liv starts chanting the spell while her brother watches from the other side, encouraging her. Liz is still at the Grill with Markos, who does not let her go. Knowing that she has to leave so the plan can be completed, she pretends to smell gas and she leads Markos to the storage room to investigate. When he turns his back to her to check where the leak comes from, she hits him and messages Damon to start. Markos gets up and stops her before she leaves. Damon is right outside the city limits where the spell starts when he receives Liz's text. He gets into the car to drive to the city, when Elena joins him and tells him that she will go with him. Damon tries to talk her out of it, but Elena has made her choice and she asks him to respect it as she respected his. They take off and they manage to crash into the Grill while they are still vampires and the building explodes. Dozens of travelers approach Bonnie to pass through her to the other side, including Markos. Elena and Damon find Bonnie, who tells them to pass through her to the Other Side, find their bodies and come back as fast as they can. Elena finds her body, in addition to Alaric, who warns her to rush back to Bonnie because her brother needs her, and he will find Damon. Damon tries to help a trapped Liz at The Grill, where Alaric finds him and helps. The others (Stefan, Tyler, Enzo and Lexi) start to gather next to Bonnie ready to get out of the other side. Meanwhile, Liv keeps chanting and Luke notices that the spell is too much for her and is hurting her. He rushes to Bonnie where everyone is gathered and tells her that they have to do it now because Liv is in danger. Stefan says that not everyone is still there but Luke touches Bonnie and passes through. He runs to Liv and asks her to stop the spell but she says that she promised to help them, so she continues. Enzo does not want to wait any longer, so he also touches Bonnie to come back to life, and Tyler follows him. He sees Caroline waiting and he hugs her but he notices he feels different. He cuts himself and he realizes that he is not healing, meaning that he is no longer a hybrid. Bonnie tries to convince Lexi and Stefan to pass before it is too late but they want to wait for Damon, Elena and Alaric. Elena arrives but she does not want to go without Damon so Bonnie touches her forcing her through. Bonnie cannot hold on for long and she falls, with Stefan catching her; and he passes through. Bonnie tells Lexi to pass too, but she refuses, seeing that Bonnie gets weaker with every passing soul. She says that she prefers to wait so her best friend gets his brother back before she passes. Markos shows up and tries to pass through Bonnie but Lexi holds him back long enough for the oblivion to suck him away. Lexi realizes Bonnie is dying in the process and gave up her place for Damon so Stefan gets a chance to have his brother back, thus also lets herself find peace and left before the oblivion gets her. Damon and Alaric arrive and Alaric goes through first. Damon asks where Elena is and Bonnie assures him she is safe. At the same time, Luke cannot let his sister die and he chants a spell making her stop. Damon tries to pass through Bonnie after the spell has stopped so it no longer works, leaving him trapped in the other side. Elena tries desperately to find Liv so she can start the spell again, but Bonnie tells her that it is too late and Elena collapses. Damon is watching and Bonnie leaves them alone to say their goodbyes. Bonnie calls Jeremy to tell him that there was never a way for her to come back and to also say goodbye. Jeremy runs to find her while Alaric finds Elena crying over Damon and hugs her. They hear Jeremy screaming for Bonnie and they try to get to him. Stefan sits with Caroline and is devastated after losing both Lexi and Damon. He knows Lexi must be the reason Markos did not make it back and says that Damon is gone now that he had everything and was happy. Caroline stays with him to comfort him. The episode ends with Bonnie and Damon holding hands waiting for the oblivion to suck them.

Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating comparing the death of Stefan in the previous episode to Damon's in this one: \\"The strange thing about the difference between the two is that although Stefan‚Äôs death was obviously impermanent, emotionally at the time it felt a lot more final than Damon (and potentially Bonnie‚Äôs) deaths here. [...] the way that Stefan died ‚Äî so suddenly, so forcefully, so without one last goodbye ‚Äî felt oddly more final than the little death tour Damon gets to do here.\\" Rebecca Serle of Vulture rated the episode with 5/5 saying that the season finales of The Vampire Diaries never disappoint. \\"The season finales of this show never disappoint. They are always intense, irrevocable, and devastating. But there is also something so unifying about them. I know we throw a lot of shade at this show. It‚Äôs ridiculous sometimes, and we like to laugh. But the community The Vampire Diaries has created is extraordinary.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 4/4 saying that the fictional streaming TV Show Oh? Wow! Thing! from M.T. Anderson‚Äôs dystopian YA novel Feed sums up her reaction to the finale. \\"But it‚Äôs not just about how this episode ended. Getting there was more than half the fun. There were many excellent conversations, especially Damon‚Äôs speech to Elena that she couldn‚Äôt hear. Damon risking a half-sacrifice was impressive, but I was most touched by his willingness to stick around to help Sheriff Forbes, who has always been a friend to him.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.6/5 focusing his review on Damon's death. \\"A truly shocking and emotional hour of television, The Vampire Diaries Season 5 concluded with an absolute stunner. A heartbreaking loss. A goodbye for which viewers were not prepared.\\" Richenthal states that he is not \\"buying\\" Damon's death but he writes: \\"Killing off Damon may be exactly what The Vampire Diaries needs. It certainly has fans talking now. It will have them tuning in this fall. It's silly to get angry at a show for axing a character you liked; that person is fictional, he or she is there to serve a story and it may be in the best interests of that story for the person to die. But it is not silly to get angry at a show for playing with your emotions. For constantly faking you out when it comes to death, something TVD has been guilty over for awhile now. Death has to mean something.\\" Ashley Dominique from Geeked Out Nation gave the episode a B+ rating. \\"The season finale of The Vampire Diaries introduced conflicts that were too quickly resolved, but delivered on the emotional aspects as they dealt with the dissolution of the other side in \\"Home\\".\\" Stephanie Hall of K Site TV gave a good review to the episode saying that the season was \\"enjoyable, highly unpredictable, mind-blowing, heartfelt and heart wrenching\\". For the episode specifically, Hall stated: \\"Starting no less intense than last week‚Äôs episode ended, \\"Home\\" was a gripping hour of television, fittingly capping off the season, while still ensuring that we‚Äôd have plenty to ponder over the summer hiatus. [...] The episode itself, along with what it set up, made me more excited about the series‚Äô potential than any other episode this season has. Part of what makes this episode shine is that after being one step behind the big bads all season, \\"Home\\" turned the tables and put the protagonists on the offense.\\" Thedude35 from Bitch Stole My Remote gave a good review to the episode saying that the season ended with a bang. \\"One thing I cannot deny about The Vampire Diaires: boy do they know how to do a season finale cliffhanger.\\" He also comments on the goodbye scene between Elena and Damon praising it: \\"Well that is quite the goodbye that Damon and Elena have. I‚Äôll give her one thing ‚Äì Elena is a master at crying. And Damon is a master at the moving, ‚Äúprofess my love even though she can‚Äôt hear me‚Äù type of speeches.\\" Lindsay Sperling of We Got This Covered gave a good review to the episode stating that the show put its money where its mouth on, referring to the death of all its three main characters in the last two episodes. Sperling also comments on the triangle between them: \\"One of the main reasons that the Elena/Damon/Stefan love triangle is equally frustrating and satisfying is that these three characters can‚Äôt let go of each other. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter where the plot has taken them or who Elena is in love with at the moment, there is an underlying bond that refuses to be broken, and it was thrown in their faces on tonight‚Äôs episode of The Vampire Diaries.\\" Jen from TV Over Mind also gave a good review saying: \\"Longtime fans are no strangers to jaw- dropping season finales on The Vampire Diaries but I think you can all agree that this one is the most memorable so far. The conflicting emotions alone are enough to torture us until it returns in the fall.\\" References External links * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 5) episodes ","title":"Home (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42781882","text":"Alok Sanjar (born 4 April 1963) is a member of Indian parliament from Bharatiya Janata Party and has won the 2014 Indian general elections from the Bhopal (Lok Sabha constituency) under modi government.

A more comprehensive and confirmed list of remixers followed in December 2013. The release date of Echoes was disclosed in February 2014, followed by the track list. In April, snippets of the album were available at Metropolis. Other online music platforms provided longer snippets shortly before actual release in May. Metropolis issued Echoes as regular physical CD edition with 14 tracks and in a deluxe version. The deluxe edition contains four bonus remixes and was released as digital download and on Artoffact Records as double vinyl edition. Critical reception Echoes was well received by critics. Despite his scepticism towards remix albums, Michael Davis of Head Full of Noise praised Front Line Assembly's continuing \\"level of craftsmanship\\" heard on preceding album Echogenetic as well as on Echoes. The band managed to avoid the pitfalls of remix albums, wrote Davis, thus delivering \\"the solid Front Line Assembly quality we all know.\\" Johan Carlsson of Release Magazine called Echoes \\"a great idea too, because 'Echogenetic' saw the band move further into modern dance floor styles, and the songs lend themselves well for remixes.\\" He considered the list of remixers \\"pretty stellar\\" and said about their work, \\"It seems like all remixers have brought their A-game to 'Echoes', and all bring a fresh, interesting perspective to each song.\\" Similarly, Sean M. Palfrey of Intravenous Magazine wrote that Echoes is \\"a collection of great re-workings of the originals that don't simply resort to trying to create more dance friendly versions of what were already dance friendly songs.\\" \\"'Echoes' sounds as pure lust for the ears\\", judged Side-Line. The two new songs on the release also caught the attention of critics. \\"The brand new tracks 'Contagion' and 'Next War'\\", wrote Alex of I Die : You Die, \\"suggest a more song-oriented ends for Front Line's current style of production, a hint reinforced by the carefully arranged Hijacker mix of 'Exo' by FLA‚Äôs own Jeremy Inkel and collaborator Sasha Keevill, two of the architects of Echogenetic‚Äòs distinctive sound.\\" Release Magazine's Carlsson also noted that the new tracks follow \\"the modern, upbeat, electronic style found on 'Echogenetic'.\\" Track listing  Personnel  =Front Line Assembly= * Bill Leeb ‚Äì vocals, electronic instruments * Jeremy Inkel ‚Äì electronic instruments * Jared Slingerland ‚Äì electronic instruments =Additional musicians= * Craig Johnsen ‚Äì electronic instruments * Sasha Keevill ‚Äì electronic instruments * Ian Pickering ‚Äì backing vocals (1) =Technical personnel= * Greg Reely ‚Äì mastering, mixing (1, 7, 14) * Troy James Sobotka ‚Äì album art direction, design * Dave McKean ‚Äì Front Line Assembly logo design * Gabriele Gaba Scalici ‚Äì vocals recording (1) References Category:Front Line Assembly albums Category:2014 remix albums Category:Industrial remix albums Category:Metropolis Records remix albums ","title":"Echoes (Front Line Assembly album)"},{"id":"42781944","text":"Subhash Patel (Born 25 April 1978) is an Indian politician and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party .he served as Member of parliament, Lok Sabha from the Khargone (Lok Sabha constituency).

He was distinguished professor at Shiv Nadar University, Gautam Buddha Nagar (India) from 2016 t0 2018. From 2010 to 2015 he was Emeritus Volvo Chair Professor for Transportation Planning & Safety at IITD.

Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Safety Technology at IIT Delhi (1991‚Äì2010). He is also Director, Independent Council for Road Safety International (www.icorsi.org)  Biography  Mohan is one of the world's leading experts on traffic safety issues and human tolerance to injury. His work has significantly advanced motorcycle helmet design, pedestrian and bicyclist safety and child restraint regulations, and helped develop safer ways for various modes of transportation to safely share the roadways. He and his colleagues are responsible for bringing the world's attention to the importance of the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists internationally and popularising the term 'vulnerable road users' in reference to these road users. His group has contributed to national and international policies on traffic safety, and Indian policies on urban transportation. He along with his team helped develop policies on safer fireworks, agricultural equipment like fodder cutters and threshers, school bus designs, motor vehicle and helmet standards. While a graduate student at University of Delaware (UD) in mechanical and aerospace engineering between 1967 and 1970, he studied under JL Nowinski, Jack Vinson, Herbert Kingsbury and Barry Schneider, who, he said, each left an indelible mark on the importance of fundamental understanding of engineering principles. He credits the foundation he gained at UD in solid mechanics for influencing his career in biomedical engineering, especially his work on the mechanical properties of hard and soft tissues. Both, he underscores, require strong background in non- linear anisotropic materials and dynamic impacts. From the University of Delaware he moved to the University of Michigan to obtain a PhD in Bioengineering. While there he worked at the Highway Safety Research Institute (now University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute) with pioneers Professor Don Chaffin in ergonomics, Dr. John Melvin and Dr. Richard Stalnaker in impact biomechanics and was influenced on science and society issues by Professor John Platt. While there he worked on biomechanics of injury to the chest, lower limbs and human soft tissues. Mohan launched his career as a senior bioengineer with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Washington D.C. He came under the influence of the institute's president, Dr. William Haddon, widely considered the guru of injury control and safety science. At the institute he worked closely with Brian O‚ÄôNeill, Allan Williams and Leon Robertson, who are considered international authorities on road safety. There, he conducted and published the first real-world assessment of airbag effectiveness in frontal crashes of General Motors cars. His work there also impacted the evolution of regulations requiring children to be secured in a back seat. He moved to India in 1979 to join the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where he served as State Bank Chair for Biomechanics and Rehabilitation between 1981 and 1991; He served as the Henry Ford Chair for Traffic Safety Biomechanics (1996‚Äì2005) and then Volvo Chair for Transportation and Planning and Safety 2007‚Äì2015). Mohan is also credited with publishing some of the earliest studies on the limited role of hard shells in motorcycle helmets, mechanical properties of human soft tissues at very high strain rates, head injury criteria for children, safety of three-wheeled scooter taxis, and bringing national attention to burn injuries caused by fireworks during the Diwali festival in India and agricultural injuries due to farm machines. Mohan has also been active in the human rights movement in India. He has coauthored reports on communal violence in many cities in India, human rights violations in Kashmir, reports on the destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Bhopal gas disaster, and the burning of the railway carriage in Godhra, Gujarat.

He has exhibited artworks and published research internationally, much of the latter on the methods of 19th century watercolourist J. M. W. Turner. He is the President of Aiki Kai Australia and a member of the Senior Council of the International Aikido Federation. In the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 2016, Smibert was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) \\"for significant service to aikido through a range of roles, and to the visual arts as a painter and water colourist\\". His home, studio and gallery are in Deloraine, Tasmania. Art Smibert's art reflects three diverse streams of thought: Japanese minimalism, the early 19th century English School of Painting and Abstract Expressionism. He has been recognised as one of Australia's leading watercolourists. His 1993 collaboration with Japanese couturier Yasuhiro Chiji led to a signature range of high fashion, yuzen kimonos based on Smibert's watercolours. Some works (for example his Yosemite Valley watercolours and acrylics) are clearly inspired by the study of Turner, Caspar David Friedrich and the early 19th century philosophy known as the Sublime. For Australian landscapes Smibert sometimes uses local iron ore as pigment. Smibert's art is deeply informed by his study in aikido. His larger acrylic abstracts use the energy flow ('ki') of aikido to create a broad calligraphy reminiscent of Franz Kline and Action Painting. Smibert's career includes exhibitions in Europe, South East Asia, Japan, the Americas and Australia.www.smibert.com Examples of Smibert's Turner-influenced, minimalist and abstract painting styles, respectively, are shown below:  Aikido  Tony Smibert teaching aikido at Aiki Kai Australia's Summer School 2014 in Melbourne, Victoria Smibert commenced judo in his early teens and then aikido in 1964 at age 15. He became a student of aikido master Seiichi Sugano in 1965 and remained his student until Sugano's death in 2010. Smibert assisted Sugano to establish in Aikido in Victoria then worked closely with other senior students to establish Aiki Kai Australia and the Aikido Foundation. Smibert was Vice-President of Aiki Kai Australia from 1976 until 2010. On the passing of Sugano he was elected President. Smibert is a trustee of the Aikido Foundation, established to promote the aikido legacy of Sugano, along with senior Australian instructors Robert Botterill (7th dan) and Hanan Janiv (7th dan). Tony Smibert represented Australia at the International Aikido Federation (IAF) from 1980 to 1984. He was then elected IAF vice-chairman, a position he then held from 1984 to 2008. In 2008 he was appointed by the current Aikido Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba to membership of the Senior Council of the IAF. Smibert currently holds the rank of 7th dan Aikikai and the teaching title of shihan from Aikido World Headquarters in Japan. He regularly teaches in Australia and Continental Europe and has also taught in Japan, South East Asia, the USA, Russia and the United Kingdom. Education and publishing Smibert's publications include The Watercolour Apprentice, The Inner Art of Watercolour, The Watercolour Road, and other series for Australian Artist and International Artist magazines; and occasional articles for Craft Arts International and Australian Art Review magazines. In the early 1990s he published a series of video lessons based on seminars at Mountford Granary Art School in Tasmania followed by an illustrated manual, Painting Landscapes from Your Imagination. Smibert contributed to the Tate publication How to Paint like Turner and co-authored the Tate Watercolour Manual: Lessons from the Great Masters with Tate Senior Conservation Scientist Dr Joyce Townsend. Research Concurrent with his own painting, Smibert is a Visiting Artist Researcher at Tate Britain. His interest in the 19th century British painter J. M. W. Turner has taken him to London many times to work directly from Turner's sketchbooks and paintings. Smibert's collaboration with Dr Joyce Townsend has included using watercolour pigments from Turner's studio to recreate the methods of Turner and building an extensive collection of historic artist materials and watercolour boxes from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Smibert's research includes visiting precise locations where Turner had worked around Britain and Europe and comparing them to the artist's original drawings and colour studies towards a practical understanding of Turner's creative processes. Smibert has demonstrated Turner's techniques on BBCTV's Fake or Fortune programme and delivered master classes and workshops for curators and artists at art museums including the Tate, the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria and Art Gallery of South Australia. In 2013 he and pianist Ambre Hammond created a public performance Turner and the Sublime to bring Turner and this research to life for audiences at the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of South Australia as part of the Turner at the Tate: The Making of a Master exhibition.

The museum was founded by Dr. Henry Libby in 1912, and was the first museum in the state dedicated solely to its natural history. It is owned by the town of Wolfeboro, and is open seasonally between June and October. The museum's building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Setting The museum is located in northwestern Wolfeboro, on the north side of NH 109 overlooking the Winter Harbor inlet of Lake Winnipesaukee. It was built between 1908 and 1912 by Dr. Henry Forest Libby and constructed by local workmen from timber felled from nearby Rattlesnake Island. It is a basically rectangular building, covered by a hip roof and set on a concrete foundation. Its exterior walls are finished in stucco, and are divided into bays articulated by pilasters. At the top of most bays, just below the roofline, is a large single-pane window. One bay at the center of the main facade houses the museum entrance, sheltered by a gabled portico. The interior of the museum is a single large chamber, with plaster walls and hardwood floors. An unusual air circulation pattern facilitates natural cooling of the building, with air vents to the outside at the base of some of the bays. Collection and history The museum was the brainchild of Dr. Henry Libby, who had amassed a large collection of natural specimens, and began planning for the museum's construction in 1890. The museum building was designed by Dr. Libby in consultation with C. Howard Walker of Boston, Massachusetts, and was completed in 1912. Dr. Libby died in 1933, leaving the museum in trust to his children, or the town if they did not want to manage it. In 1956, the town formally exercised its authority to assume management of the museum. Of New Hampshire's early museums, it is the first to be exclusively dedicated to the state's natural history. The museum collection includes specimens of plants, animals, birds, and fish, as well as minerals. It is open seasonally between the beginning of June and the Columbus Day weekend in October; admission is charged.

He won the 2014 general election from Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. He also won Indian general election in 1991 from Mathura, 1996 and 1998 from Farrukhabad. He was also a member of Rajya Sabha from 2000 to 2006, before being suspended for corruption. He holds a PhD degree and runs various educational institutions and ashrams across India under the banner of Sakshi Maharaj Group for which he is also serving as its present director. He has been at the center of controversies for his Islamophobic views. He in his rally once said 2019 elections would be last elections in the country and is the last chance to elect Modi as Prime Minister simply clarifying the end of democracy in India Life and career Sachchidanand Hari Sakshi was born in Sakshi Dham, Kasganj district, Uttar Pradesh. His father was Atmanandji Maharaj Premi and mother was Madalasa Devi Lodhi. Sakshi belongs to the Lodh community which has been categorised as an Other Backward Class in Uttar Pradesh. Initially, Sakshi belonged to the BJP and had close associations with Kalyan Singh, another BJP leader belonging to the Lodh community, and another BJP leader Kalraj Mishra. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1991 from Mathura, 1996, and 1998 from Farrukhabad which has a Lodh majority. Sakshi Maharaj has been involved in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and is currently under trial as one of the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. In the 1999 general election, he campaigned for Samajwadi Party after he was denied a ticket for Farrukhabad by BJP. After 1999 election results were declared, Mulayam Singh formally admitted him to Samajwadi Party. Sakshi Maharaj said the BJP's policies were not favourable to poorer and backward sections of the society. The ticket had been denied to him on the order of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Back then, Sakshi was an accused in the murder of Brahm Dutt Dwivedi, a close associate of Vajpayee. But later the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2000, he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by Mulayam Singh Yadav. In August 2000, a college principal from Etah filed a complaint accusing Sakshi and two of his nephews, Padam Singh and Shivram Ram, of gang- raping her. The woman and her male colleague had been allegedly assaulted by Sakshi when they were driving to Agra from Etah. They had also allegedly taken away the woman's licensed firearm and jeep. The police said that the woman had been living in Sakshi Maharaj's ashram for four years. She had expressed the desire to marry a colleague but Sakshi had objected to it. Sakshi spent about a month in the Tihar jail custody awaiting trial. In 2001, he was acquitted due to lack of evidence. In January 2002, he criticised Samajwadi Party, accusing it of dictatorship, nepotism, casteism and capitalism. He said he would remain in Samajwadi Party but support BJP candidates. In December 2005, STAR TV broadcast a report stating that it had carried out a sting operation and found that some parliamentarians were misusing the MPLADS funds. Sakshi Maharaj, then a Rajya Sabha member, was among the 11 named parliamentarians. Sakshi had allegedly promised fund for a fictitious NGO. On 21 March 2006, the Rajya Sabha voted to expel Sakshi for violating the code of conduct while rejecting his apology. In 2009, an inquiry started by Etah District Magistrate Gaurav Dayal found that a college owned by Sakshi had received from the funds. The inquiry also named Sujata Verma, the principal of the college. She was later murdered. Sakshi initially absconded but on 14 October 2009 he surrendered. He was released on a bail bond of . In 2012, he returned to BJP just before the assembly polls. On the night of 15 April 2013, Sujata Verma, 47, was shot dead while returning from Sakshi's ashram in Etah. The eyewitness said that he saw Sakshi's brother pull the trigger and alleged that Sakshi was behind the murder. The police booked Sakshi and associates for murder and criminal conspiracy. The victim Sujata Verma was a local panchayat member and a close associate of Sakshi. She also served as the principal of Maharani Avanti Bai College which was owned by Sakshi. But, they had been involved in a property dispute and Verma had taken the matter to court. The victim's son said that they received threats from him in the past. After the charges were filed, Sakshi went underground. On 29 April 2013, Allahabad High Court refused to quash the FIR against him. In the 2014 general election, he contested from Unnao for BJP. Religious and other activities Sakshi Maharaj holds the title of Acharya Mahamandleshwar of Shri Nirmal Panchayati Akhada. He is also the director of Sakshi Maharaj Group which has 17 educational institutions in India and several ashrams. Personal views and controversies On 14 September 2015 in a speech in Kannauj, Sakshi Maharaj said the madrasas were creating terrorists and they encourage their students to carry out Love Jihad. On 11 December 2014, he called Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mohandas Gandhi, a \\"patriot and nationalist\\" in the Indian Parliament. The members of the Indian National Congress party criticised the statement. On 6 January 2015 while addressing a gathering in Meerut, Sakshi urged Hindu women to produce at least 4 children to protect Hinduism in India and said Muslims practice polygyny and thus have a high birth rate. In the same speech, he defended the Ghar Wapsi movement and advocated death sentence for cow slaughter and religious conversion. Police filed the FIR under Section 298 of IPC (hurting religious sentiments), among others. Following the 2015 Nepal earthquake, on 27 April, Sakshi claimed that the earthquake happened because INC leader Rahul Gandhi visited the Kedarnath temple. He claimed that Gandhi eats beef and visited the temple without purifying himself. In May 2016, Sakshi was at BJP worker Maidan Singh's house in Unnao after a police raid, where some of the family members including the girl were allegedly injured after they used force. The girl was made to unbutton her jeans in public view and in front of cameras to \\"show the MP the injuries\\". Eventually, Twitterati went berserk over the ‚Äòinappropriate‚Äô incident. However, according to some reports, the main controversy on Sakshi Maharaj was that he threatened to shoot the police who entered Singh's house. Station House Officer Jitendra Kumar filed a complaint against Sakshi, after which he was booked under sections 153 (causing provocation to cause riot), 506 (for criminal intimidation) and 505 (1) (b) (intent to cause fear or alarm to the public). The police had conducted a raid on Maidan Singh's house in connection with illicit liquor trade. Adding more fuel to the fire while talking about the Dadri murder, he said that said Hindus are ready to kill in order to protect cows from slaughter. \\"\\"We won't remain silent if somebody tries to kill our mother. We are ready to kill and get killed,\\" were his exact words. Bibliography  * * He has also been publishing the Hindi monthly Bhagwan Sandesh since 1972.

He was born in Drogheda to an old Anglo-Irish family which had settled in Ireland soon after the Norman Conquest; later he and his wife Katherine jointly acquired lands at Staunton in County Meath. He was called to the Bar and became King's Serjeant in December 1471. The appointment, unusually at that time, was stated to be for life, but in fact he apparently held it only until December 1476. In the latter year he became Controller of the Ports of Dublin and Drogheda. He was Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1478‚Äì80 and was then demoted to the post of an ordinary justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). LIke all his Irish judicial colleagues he backed the unsuccessful attempt by the pretender Lambert Simnel to seize the English throne in 1487, an attempt which was crushed decisively at the Battle of Stoke Field. He took part in a public ceremony of repentance the following year and, like all his judicial colleagues, he received a royal pardon from the victorious King Henry VII. His date of death is not recorded. References *Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 *Hart, A.R.
