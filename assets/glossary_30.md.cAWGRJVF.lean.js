Many of these shipwrecks are unable to be accessed so specific locations are not given. Some of these wreck sites have not been given official confirmation and the details are provided here. Queensland *(1842) Unidentified Mount Ernest Island An unidentified vessel floated onto a reef near Mount Ernest Island, where some of the crew members were massacred. The sole occupant remained on the vessel, which drifted free at high tide and ran aground on Mount Ernest Island. The sole occupant was massacred, and the vessel was looted. In 1929, the rudder of the vessel and other scattered wooden wreckage was still visible.Encyclopaedia of Australian Shipwrecks-Peter Stone *(1869) Unidentified Breaksea Spit, Fraser Island Workers erecting a lighthouse were notified by local Aboriginal natives of the presence of a shipwreck some four miles from Breaksea Spit. The wreck site consisted of a timber hull buried upside down in the sand, along with various sundry items including a tea chest, bars of soap, a portion of a box of candles and several bottles of gin. There wreck was never identified. *(1973) Unidentified Orchid Beach, Fraser Island A portion of an as of yet unidentified vessel was spotted just offshore of Orchid Beach, Fraser Island. The wreckage included a timber spar and a cannonade. The wreckage is buried beneath several metres of sand, but was unearthed as recently as 2002. *(1976) Unidentified Inskip Point The remains of a 19th-century wooden sailing ship were exposed during a storm in 1976 between Rainbow Beach and Inskip Point. It is believed to be the remains of the barque Saint Magnus, which drifted ashore in a storm during 1875. The wreck was recently exposed during a storm in 2002-2003. * (1989) Unidentified Cockburn Reef The site was reported to the Maritime Authority in 1989 and consists of several anchors, spars and timbers, sandstone ballast, chains and other assorted debris. *(1999) Unidentified North Ledge Reef A fisherman discovered the wreckage of an unidentified shipwreck on the eastern edge of North Ledge Reef. There are no official records of any shipwrecks in that specific location. The debris area is scattered over a wide area, and consists of iron ballast, a cannon embedded in a reef formation. It is surrounded by iron fittings, and some 50 metres away from the main wreckage, an iron water tank protrudes above the waterline. *(1999) Unidentified Jervis Reef A resident of Badu Island located what is believed to be the remains of a vessel on the southern side of Jervis Reef. It includes an anchor chain and stone ballast. This is not the remains of the French vessel Pauline et Victory, wrecked on the northern side of Jervis Reef. *(2000) Unidentified Wednesday Island The wreck site lies on the northern side of the island in a depth of seven metres of water. The only possible candidate for this wreck is the twelve ton iron ketch Gertrude, lost on the island in 1912. The wreck site consists of an anchor attached to the intact bow, which protrudes above the waterline at low tide. The hull has iron sheathing and various other structural debris. *(2004) Unidentified Goods Island The wreck of an unidentified timber vessel was located offshore of the pearling station at Goods Island. Stern posts, hoop pine wooden planking and wooden ribs as well as what appears to be a diesel engine are present at the wreck site. *(2004) Unidentified Goods Island The wreck of an unidentified commercial fisheries vessel lies beached just above the high water mark, off the southern side of the island. The vessel has a steel superstructure, and is broken in half, but in a relatively good condition. The freezer on the vessel is still present. *(2004) Unidentified Collis Beach, Prince of Wales Island The wreck of an unidentified vessel is exposed offshore of Collis Beach at low tide. Parts of the wreck are scattered down a reef slope to a depth of six metres. It appears to be an old coal hulk, with wreckage including ironwork, scattered timbers and an iron mast that protrudes above the waterline. *(2011) Unidentified Hinchinbrook Island A wooden shipwreck some thirty metres in length was located on a beach on Hinchinbrook Island after Cyclone Yasi. It could be the remains of a number of vessels wrecked in the 19th century. The remains include the hull and a windless protruding from the sand.

He left a culturally and historically important autobiography, written in 1595 when he was 75 years of age. There is a plaque marking the site of his birth at Lange Stra√üe 54 in Greifswald. Life Bartholom√§us Sastrow was born in Greifswald, the son of Nicolaus Sastrow (born 1488), a merchant, and his wife Anna Schmiterlow, who was a niece of Nikolaus Smiterlow, the mayor of Stralsund. His grandfather Hans Sastrow (murdered in 1494) had been a tenant farmer in Quilow before moving to Greifswald in 1487. Sastrow was the third of eight children; his four younger sisters and also his mother all died in an epidemic in 1549/50. He, his eldest sister Anna (1516‚Äì1594), the wife of Peter Frubose, Mayor of Greifswald, and their brother Karsten or Christian (1530‚Äì1580) were the only members of the family to have long lives. His elder brother Johannes became a lawyer, provost and poet, but died at 29 or 30 years of age. His father Nicolaus was forced to flee Greifswald in about 1523 after killing a respected citizen during an argument. He settled in Stralsund; at roughly the same time, Nikolaus Smiterlow exiled himself voluntarily from Stralsund as a political protest and settled in his niece's house in Greifswald. His Protestant faith and inclination against turmoil and upheaval were lifelong examples to Sastrow.Karl-Reinhart Trauner, Identit√§t in der fr√ºhen Neuzeit: die Autobiographie des Bartholom√§us Sastrow, Geschichte in der Epoche Karls V. 3, M√ºnster: Aschendorff, 2004 (Doctoral thesis, University of Vienna, 2002), pp. 50, 375‚Äì76 After Smiterlow's return to Stralsund in 1527, his niece, Sastrow's mother, also moved there with her children, rejoining her husband. Bartholom√§us, however, remained in Greifswald with his grandfather until 1529. In 1533 Nicolaus Sastrow became Alderman of the Guild of Tailors. The Reformation had reached Stralsund in 1525, whereas Greifswald did not convert to Protestantism until 1531; the family must therefore have become Protestant when they moved, if not before. In 1538 Sastrow entered the University of Rostock,Immatrikulation von Bartolomeus Sastrou, University of Rostock where he studied for about a year; in 1541 he resumed his studies at the newly opened University of Greifswald, where he received a humanistic education including a thorough grounding in Greek and Latin. However, he was forced to leave without completing his studies because fresh disturbances in Stralsund caused by the Mayor of L√ºbeck, J√ºrgen Wullenwever, had led to his father and Smiterlow being placed under house arrest, causing financial problems for the family. In 1542, therefore, at their father's request, Bartholom√§us and his brother Johannes rode to Speyer by way of Wittenberg, Leipzig and Frankfurt, partly to seek their fortunes and partly to speed up the court case on the now 20-year-old killing. They found the Imperial Chamber Court unstaffed. However, on the recommendation of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, Bartholom√§us obtained a position as a clerk, and in 1544, despite never having completed his studies, he was awarded a diploma as a notary of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1545, despite being a Lutheran, he was appointed to the service of the Commander of the Knights of St. John in Nieder-Weisel, Christoph von L√∂wenstein. His brother Johannes died in 1545 in the service of a cardinal in Italy, so Bartholom√§us went to Italy the following year to wind up his affairs. In Rome he was affected by the heat and also was afraid of being discovered as a Protestant by the Inquisition. He therefore soon left Italy, despite having been offered a good position. He and a companion from L√ºbeck travelled as far as Innsbruck disguised as Italians and avoiding speaking German, for fear of attack by soldiers being sent by the Pope to aid the Holy Roman Emperor against the Schmalkaldic League; they then changed back to their normal clothes for fear of attack by German Protestants who did not recognise their strange accents. On his return Sastrow worked in Wolgast for the Dukes of Pomerania, Philip I and Barnim XI, accompanied the Pomeranian representatives seeking reconciliation with Emperor Charles V, and took part in diplomatic missions to Bohemia, Saxony and the 1547/48 Diet of Augsburg (the geharnischter Reichstag). In 1548 he was appointed Pomeranian charg√© at the Imperial Chamber Court in Speyer. Only then, with the court once more staffed after years of suspension, was he able to successfully pursue his father's case. While at Speyer he also went on several journeys, including visiting the cosmographer Sebastian M√ºnster in Basel. Dissatisfied with the court bureaucracy, in the early 1550s he decided to become independent, left the service of the dukes and in 1552 was enrolled as a notary of the Imperial Chamber Court. He returned first to Greifswald and then in 1555 to Stralsund. He supported the mayor, Nikolaus Gentzkow, in developing new regulations for schools and churches as well as the town law code. In 1562 he was elected to the city council, and in 1578 he became mayor, holding that position until his death in the city in 1603.Bartholom√§i Sastrowen Herkommen, Geburt und Lauff seines gantzen Lebens, ed.

He married twice. By his sister-in-law Catharina Frubose, whom he married in 1551, he had three children, Katharina, Amnestia and Johannes (died 1593). A month after her death, in February 1598, he married her maid, Anna Haseneier. Autobiography In 1595, at the age of 75, Sastrow wrote an autobiography.Bartholom√§i Sastrowen Herkommen, Geburt und Lauff seines gantzen Lebens, ed. Mohnike, Vol. 1, p. 4. He made use of a variety of source materials: in addition to his own journaling and letters, official documents to which he had access as a notary and chronicles such as Johann Berckmann's Stralsund Chronicle and the biography of his predecessor as mayor, Franz Wessel. He modelled his use of these sources on Johannes Sleidanus' history, published in 1545‚Äì56.Trauner, pp. 149‚Äì50. He may also have incorporated sections which he had composed earlier. He had the text written by a scribe; as a result, even the primary manuscript is not by his own hand, although handwriting evidence indicates that he added notes and corrections to the completed text.Trauner, pp. 83, 87‚Äì88. He divided the work into four sections, the last of which, concerning his time in Stralsund, has not been preserved. It is unknown whether it was not completed or whether it was destroyed because of Sastrow's account of des Teuffels Battstube (\\"the Devil's bathhouse\\"), as he characterised his time there in the superscript.Trauner, pp. 91, 95. Speaking for the latter alternative is the fact that the account was not meant to be purely private, as can be seen from the almost complete absence of material about his family: thus, Sastrow says little more about his wife than that he married her, and does not even give the birth dates of his children, and he addresses it in the first instance to his sons-in-law Hinrich Godtschalk and Jakob Klerike, both city councillors.Trauner, pp. 117‚Äì19. Although it includes text from numerous Latin documents, the work is not written in Latin as is normal for contemporary humanistic writings, nor yet in Pomeranian Low German, which Johannes Bugenhagen had used in making his own translation of the Bible 50 years before, but in Early New High German Kanzleisprache, the language of depositions and records in the imperial and municipal courts. The autobiography is an important contribution to 16th- century autobiographical prose.Review of Denkw√ºrdige Geschichten von Bartholom√§us Sastrow, ed. Horst Langer , Stralsund Intern, 8 December 2011 His is the first or only record of events such as the confrontation between Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse and the Emperor that led to Philip's imprisonment. The many incorporated legal documents are important sources for the history of the Empire, especially for the Geharnischter Reichstag of 1547/48 and the Augsburg Interim of 1548. However, there are major gaps in its coverage of contemporary history, since Sastrow, unlike Sleidanus, only recounts what he personally experienced. The primary manuscript belongs to the City Archives of Stralsund and is on display in the Kulturhistorisches Museum Stralsund. Gottlieb Mohnike published a three-volume edition in 1823/24, which although insufficient by modern scientific standards remains the most complete edition. =Editions= * Bartholom√§i Sastrowen Herkommen, Geburt und Lauff seines gantzen Lebens: auch was sich in dem Denckwerdiges zugetragen, so er mehrentheils selbst gesehen und gegenw√§rtig mit angeh√∂ret hat.

It was O'Keefe's second role in a British film having starred in another crime- thriller The Fake the previous year. It seems unclear who directed The Diamond.

This house had stood witness to the diverse political and historical lives of two of the famous bygone personalities in the politics arena in the locality and in the country as well ‚Äì Don Gregorio A. Pelaez, Sr. (first Governor of Misamis Oriental) and his son, Emmanuel N. Pelaez, Sr. (elected Vice President of the Philippines in 1961 under the Diosdado Macapagal Administration). When people ask for direction, the local townsfolk refer to the house as the \\"Pelaez White House\\" because of the walls that are washed in white. History The use of this house has seen various transformations through the different meanings that correspond to the changes of time. In the early times, the house was usually associated with Gregorio A. Pelaez, Sr. who was the paramount political icon of Misamis Oriental (1926-1931 and 1938-1940) being the very first governor of the province back in the time when Misamis Oriental was officially separated from Misamis Occidental by Republic Act No. 3777 on 28 November 1939. Later on, another Pelaez entered the political arena of the Philippines ‚Äì Emmanuel N. Pelaez, Sr., son of Gregorio A. Pelaez. Emmanuel Pelaez became the first Mindanawon elected in the Vice-Presidency position in the Philippines. The late Vice President, who was born November 30, 1915, recalled that the house was built around 1920 to 1922. According to him also, the construction of the house was supervised by a Japanese maestro carpenter and the lumber was cut right there in the house‚Äôs vicinity (Pelaez, pers. com. 2002). The political contributions of the Pelaez clan in the Philippines have indisputably made significant impacts in the annal of history of Misamis Oriental as well as the Philippines. In fact, current vice-governor of Misamis Oriental is also from the influential clan of the Pelaez in the person of Jose Mari G. Pelaez. House features right The house is inspired by a Beaux Art architectural design due to its very well defined decorative articulation in its pilasters. The graceful proportion and tasteful details contribute to the quality aesthetics of the house. The second floor has the traditional sliding capi2 windows with balustraded ventanillas. Above the windows is a series of transoms with traceries. The design is basically square in plan, broken only by the central portion of the facade on the second floor which juts out over the main entry. The house has 2 floors. It also has a very spacious surroundings evidenced by the coconuts, poultry and a grotto of Mother Mary. Perhaps, the spacious area indicates how wealthy and prominent the Pelaez are. right Huge and rigid support pillars can be found at the ground floor of the house. They provide strong structural support to the second floor. Notable enough, the tiles used on the flooring gives an elegant view and one can imagine how marvelous could the view be in its early years. But as of the present, some tiles are no longer in good shape. The pillars on the second floor are said to be made of \\"Iron-Wood\\". There are 2 staircases made of a so-called \\"Balayong\\" materials that a person will encounter as he enters the second floor of the house. In totality, there are 3 staircases in the house. Aside from those mentioned, there is one staircase that can be found at the back of the house which, apparently, is in a bad condition already. After climbing up the sturdy and elegant 2 staircases, a person is welcomed with a shiny wooden floor which has a repetitive pattern of brown and dark brown. Then, as you continue your step and as you raise your head upward, one will find himself in awe of the elegant heirlooms left by the forefathers of the Pelaez kin. right Though some of the photos no longer resides in the house, there are still some photos that remained. These photos are displayed in one corner of the house. Photos of Don Gregorio Pelaez Sr. solo and with his second wife Felipa Neri Pelaez in 1907, 1936 and 1957 during their 50th anniversary can be found preserved. One photo also displays the mother of Felipa, Concepcion V. Fortich. There is also one photo of the whole Pelaez kin during a gathering of the birthday anniversary of Don Gregorio Pelaez in year 1965. Of course, there is also a photo of the late vice president, Emmanuel N. Pelaez. Other photos that are being hung on the wall include certificates of recognition from various award-giving body who recognized the great contributions of the Pelaez. right Some antique items also remained inside the house. For instance, there are these wooden chairs and tables in the dining area. There is also a metallic table and chairs along with dining-ware composed of porcelain and glass plates, cups, saucers, teapots and other containers for condiments. right One can also appreciate how devoted the Pelaez are in their catholic faith as evidenced by an antique item being displayed by religious relics. Below it is a comfortable platform where a person kneel in solemn prayer. Bronze metallic containers and plates with intricate details can also be seen being displayed in the \\"sala\\" (living room) of the house. One beautiful antique item that can also be found in the sala is this chest or also known in Filipino as \\"baul\\" that is artistically carved with a somewhat an abstract design. The wooden and metallic elements of the sala are as well as antique as the house itself. The only parts that were changed are the bench's and chair's foams and covers. Visible on top of every door and on the uppermost corner of every wall of the sala is one thing that gives the inner part of the house a grandiose feeling. This is said to be a Japanese inspired carving designs which speak and/or symbolize a meaning. The sala is also illuminated at night by a round shape white object that contains a light bulb inside. The house has a total of 8 rooms. 2 of these rooms are dedicated for house guests and a single room for the caretakers. The rest of the rooms are reserved for the members of the Pelaez clan who wish to visit and stay in the house. If you happen to observe carefully, not only the outer surfaces of the house are washed in white, but the inner walls of the house are white as well. There seems to be a minor to no degradation on the materials of the house - a proof that this house is excellently maintained.

Old photos were also transferred to Mapawa, Cugman, Cagayan de Oro where one of the houses owned by the Pelaez is built. Other sources of income for the house maintenance are also from some of the properties of the Pelaez which are the Duka Bay Resort and Alibuag Spring which is both located in the locality of Medina.

Research and career  Nelson's research is devoted to characterising the materials used to build and improve photovoltaic devices, which convert energy from the Sun into electricity. She applies a range of tools that include physical models, simulation and experiments to optimise the performance of such devices through their composite materials. Over the last twenty-five years, Nelson has worked with many types of energy converting materials, ranging from molecular materials to inorganic materials such as nanocrystalline oxides, and organic‚Äìinorganic hybrids. She uses information describing the electronic, optical and structural properties of these materials to inform the design of her devices, an approach that has garnered strong interest from industry. Since 2010, Nelson has also been studying the potential of photovoltaic technologies to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted during the generation of electricity, lessening the impact on climate change. She is the author of a popular textbook, The Physics of Solar Cells.The Physics of Solar Cells, Imperial College Press, 2003, Nelson's research has focused on the development of detailed physical descriptions of novel nanostructured or disordered (organic electronic) materials, the quantitative validation of model results against experimental data, and above all, the application of physical science to address the challenges in energy supply, in particular, in the area of photovoltaic energy conversion.

This house is one important built structure in the locality that tourists usually come to visit. In fact, notable personalities like Emilio Aguinaldo and Sergio Osme√±a had visited this house. History In the 1800s, a young merchant from San Nicolas in Cebu by the name of Ignacio Juan Vega settled in Northern Mindanao at a small town, then named Galas, today Balingasag (Vega 1999, 11). It was through Vega that the Cebuano devotion to the Sto. Nino was introduced to the townsfolk of Balingasag. Aside from this cultural practice he imparted, he also left behind a heritage house that is considered these days as one of the important landmarks that can be found in Misamis Oriental. The house also witnessed the political endeavor of its owners. The first town executive came from the Vega Clan in the person of Faustino Vega. He was known that time as presidente local, under the short-lived First Philippine Republic (1898-1903). Melquiades Vega, the son of Faustino Vega, served as the first presidente local under the American Regime (1903-1928). Though there are no existing documents that would trace back a specific period of time when this house was constructed, several attempts by heritage advocates to document this house and as well as bloggers and the local townsfolk unanimously say that this house was built in the 1800s. House features Sculpted Wooden Atlas It is noteworthy to mention that the house is designed with sculpted wooden men structures that act as support to the protruding second floor of the house. Unlike what other feature writers would say, there are only three (3) wooden men structures that exist, hence, out of the 4 corners of the house there is one corner where no wooden men structure can be seen. In other words, each corner of the house is not represented by an atlas as what other travel bloggers would state in their blogs and articles. House Interior There are also misconceptions regarding the 3 sculpted wooden structures of men. Others say that this is a paradigm of slavery while others would say that this is inspired by the atlas icon that symbolizes the man carrying the world. The true account on this, according to Dr. Antonio J. Montalvan II and with reference to the genealogy of the Vega Clan, is that the 3 sculptures represents the three (3) sons of Ignacio Juan Vega, namely Santos (married to Valentina Roa, Juana Valmores), Pedro (married to Benita Salvacion), and Gregorio. View of Vega Ancestral House The house uses \\"molave\\" tree and \\"balayong\\" as primary material in building the house. It can also be observed that the house has large beams or pillars that act as support to the overall stability of the house structure. Each pillar is placed alongside the corners, in between the corners and along the center of the house. Its walls are designed like woven abaca or also knows in visayan as \\"Uway\\" (English: rattan) that is colored in yellow. The house still uses the traditional \\"Banggera\\" (English:Sink) which is used as window shelf for kitchen wares and utensils and tub for washing at present. Stairs on Vega Ancestral House Another notable feature of the house is its uppermost portion which still uses the classical cogon for the roof. It further classifies the house under the 1st Transition of Bahay na bato aside from its emerging stone works at the bottom part of the house. Another feature of the house can also be observed in its support beams that are decorated with the chambered nautilus motif. One can somehow conclude that the owner of the house used the best quality of materials during its construction as it is evidenced by the house itself which has been withstanding the tests of time through centuries. Consequently, this heritage structure became one of the primary attractions to tourists and outsiders who come to visit the rich historical center (Poblacion) of Balingasag. Tourism The coffee table books and glossy calendars (the latest one being the 2006 Shell calendar [\\"Homes of our Heritage\\"] help in the provision of a constant stream of onlookers and curio watchers which somehow improve the local tourism statistics of the municipality. Second Floor Sala of the House According to Ms. Nanette Vega, the local tourism wishes to acquire the house through legal processes so as to maintain and preserve the house and open it as a tourism hotspot. Unwillingly, Ms. Nanette and the Vega clan decline the proposal for sentimental reasons. While they admit that they find it hard to maintain the house especially the cost incurred for the maintenance, they prefer to take care of the house than lose ownership over the local tourism authority. However, the house is still open for walk-in tourists, and those who wish to have a documentation of the house may do so by appointment basis. One highlight of this house that adds more to its fame is its association with the late Maria Clara Vega Jimenez - mother of the famous television personality Inday Badiday and Philippine Daily Inquirer editor-in-chief Letty Jimenez Magsanoc. However, it is wrong to refer to it as the \\"Jimenez House\\" because the Jimenez was just one branch of the Vega Clan. It is locally known by its correct name, \\"Vega House\\". Common misconception also regarding this house is its connection with the late and famous bygone child star Julie Vega because of her \\"Vega\\" stage surname which is in reality is Julie Pearl Apostol Postigo. This widespread rumor among those who are not familiar enough with the house is still erroneously passed up to these present times. Present Times Vega House Restaurant/Carinderia As of the present days, the first floor of the house is being utilized as a restaurant/carinderia. The store opens as early as 6:00 in the morning and closes at 7:00 in the evening. Part of the income from the store is used for the maintenance of the house.

Now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium The Master of the Legend of Saint Catherine (or the Master of the Saint Catherine Legend) is the Notname for an unknown late 15th century Early Netherlandish painter. He was named after a painting with Scenes from the Legend of Saint Catherine, now kept in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. He was active between c. 1470 and c. 1500, probably around Brussels. Identification In the 19th century, his works, like many Early Netherlandish paintings, were attributed to Jan Van Eyck or Hans Memling. At the 1902 Exposition des primitifs flamands √† Bruges, the Mass of Saint Gregory panels (now in the Metropolitan Museum) were attributed to an unknown follower of Rogier Van der Weyden, placing the artist more in the Brussels' school of artists than the earlier attributions. Multiple works were first attributed to this artist by Max Jacob Friedl√§nder. It has been speculated that the Master may be the Brussels master Pieter van der Weyden, son of Rogier van der Weyden. No works by Pieter van der Weyden are known, even though he was clearly an important painter in Brussels in the late 15th century.

The liturgical calendar of the German Reformation era had, without counting Reformation Day and days between Palm Sunday and Easter, 72 occasions for which a cantata could be presented. Composers such as Georg Philipp Telemann composed cycles of church cantatas comprising all 72 of these occasions (e.g. Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst). Such a cycle is called an \\"ideal\\" cycle, while in any given liturgical year feast days could coincide with Sundays, and the maximum amount of Sundays after Epiphany and the maximum amount of Sundays after Trinity could not all occur. In some places, of which Leipzig in Johann Sebastian Bach's time is best known, no concerted music was allowed for the three last Sundays of Advent, nor for the Sundays of Lent (apart when Annunciation fell on a Sunday in that period, or in Holy Week), so the \\"ideal\\" year cycle (German: ) for such places comprised only 64 cantatas (or 63 without the cantata for Reformation Day).G√ºnther Zedler. Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach: Eine Einf√ºhrung in die Werkgattung. Books on Demand, 2011. , p. 24‚Äì25 Other occasions for church cantatas include weddings and funeral services. In the 19th century cantatas were composed by composers such as Felix Mendelssohn. Occasions of the liturgical year As the bulk of extant cantatas were composed for occasions occurring in the liturgical calendar of the German Reformation era, including Passion cantatas for Good Friday, that calendar is followed for the presentation of cantatas in this section. Most cantatas for occasions in the liturgical year made reference to the content of the readings and/or of Lutheran hymns appropriate for the occasion. Also chorale melodies of such hymns appeared in cantata compositions, for instance for Bach most typically in the closing four-part chorale of the cantata. Thus below also readings and hymns associated with the occasion are listed, for the hymns for instance based on Vopelius' Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch.Gottfried Vopelius. \\"Kirchen-Ordnung dieser Christlichen lieder\\" (= first register), pp. 1105‚Äì1117 in Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch. Leipzig: Christoph Klinger. 1682. Data such as readings and hymns generally apply to Bach's Leipzig: differences may occur in other places, or other times, as indicated. ;Advent : Advent is celebrated on the four Sundays before Christmas. Sometimes, as in Leipzig, there was a tempus clausum (silent time: no cantatas performed) for the last three Sundays of Advent. ;Christmas to Epiphany : The Christmas season was celebrated from Christmas Day through Epiphany. Three days were observed for Christmas, with a Christmas cantata performed every day. The next feast days were New Year and Epiphany. Sundays may occur between the third day of Christmas and New Year and/or between New Year and Epiphany: thus the period had at least five occasions, or at most seven. : For the Christmas season of 1734‚Äì35 Bach composed the Christmas Oratorio in six parts, to be performed as the cantata in the service on the six feast days, three days of Christmas, New Year, the Sunday after New Year and Epiphany (there was no Sunday between the third day of Christmas and New Year in 1734). ;Sundays after Epiphany : Depending on the date of Easter, a variable number (up to six) of Sundays occurred between Epiphany and Septuagesima, the third Sunday before Ash Wednesday. The sixth Sunday after Epiphany is extremely rare: in the first half of the 18th century cantatas for this Sunday were only composed in \\"ideal\\" cantata cycles, but for instance not by composers such as Bach and Graupner who generally only composed what was to be performed under their direction. ;Pre-Lenten Season : There were three Sundays in the Pre-Lenten Season: Septuagesima, Sexagesima and Quinquagesima (the last one also known as Estomihi) ;Lent : During Lent, the six Sundays between Ash Wednesday and Easter, \\"quiet time\\" was observed in Leipzig. Only the feast of Annunciation was celebrated with a cantata, even if it fell in that time. On Good Friday, a Passion was performed, in most cases rather considered an Oratorio than a cantata. In Graupner's Darmstadt there was also a cantata on Maundy Thursday. ;Easter to Pentecost : Eastertide comprises the time up to Pentecost, starting with three days of Easter. There are five Sundays between Easter and Ascension. Ascension is followed by one Sunday before the three feast days of Pentecost. : The Sundays between Easter and Pentecost have Latin names, derived from the beginning of the prescribed readings. For example, the first Sunday after Easter is called Quasimodogeniti. Some sources name the Sunday after Easter the second Sunday in Easter, counting Easter Sunday as the first. ;Trinity and the Sundays after Trinity: Trinity is the Sunday after Pentecost. A variable number of Sundays occurs between Trinity and the first Sunday in Advent, a maximum of 27, if Easter is extremely early. ;Marian feasts : There are three Marian feast days that are usually observed in the German Reformation era: Purification on 2 February, Annunciation on 25 March and Visitation on 2 July ;Feast of John the Baptist : St. John's Day was celebrated on 24 June, with cantatas written by, among others, Bach and Telemann. ;Feast of St. Michael: St. Michael's Day was celebrated on 29 September with, for instance, cantatas by Bach and Telemann, but in Graupner's Darmstadt there was apparently no demand for such cantatas. ;Feast of St. Stephen : St. Stephen's Day falls on 26 December, the second day of Christmas, so generally not counted as a separate occasion. ;Reformation Day : Reformation Day is celebrated on 31 October and for instance Bach and Graupner wrote cantatas for the occasion. Reformation Day is however not always seen as one of the feasts of the liturgical year: for instance in Telemann's and Picander's ideal cantata cycles the feast day isn't mentioned. Telemann's ideal cycle thus consists of four Sundays of Advent; Seven occasions from Christmas to Epiphany; Nine Sundays between Epiphany and Lent; Six Sundays of Lent; 14 occasions from Easter to Trinity; 27 Sundays after Trinity; Three Marian Feasts, St. John's Day (24 June) and Michaelmas ‚Äì totalling 72 occasions for which he provided a cantata. Graupner's church cantatas don't include the sixth Sunday after Epiphany, nor cantatas for St. John's Day or Michaelmas, however there are cantatas for Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, which totals 71 occasions from GWV 1101 to 1171, with GWV 1173 indicating Reformation Day cantatas. ;Libretto cycles : Several cantata libretto cycles were published in the first half of the 18th century: :* Erdmann Neumeister: : Geistliche Cantaten (1702) :* Anonymous (Ernst Ludwig I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen?) : Sonn- und Fest-Andachten (Meiningen 1704) :* Benjamin Schmolck: : Das Saiten-Spiel des Hertzens (1720) :* Picander: : Sammlung Erbaulicher Gedanken (1724‚Äì25) : Cantaten auf die Sonn- und Fest- Tage durch das gantze Jahr (1728‚Äì29) =First Sunday of Advent (Advent I)= ;Occasion :Advent Sunday, first of the four Sundays of Advent, which are the four Sundays preceding Christmas ;Readings :, night is advanced, day will come :, the Entry into Jerusalem ;Hymns :\\"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\\" by Martin Luther (Erfurt Enchiridion, 1524) and its Latin model \\"Veni redemptor gentium\\" by Ambrose\\"Advents Lieder\\" pp. 1‚Äì23 in Neues vollst√§ndiges Eisenachisches Gesangbuch.

He won the Magic: The Gathering Online Championship in 2011. His best finishes include three Pro Tour Top 8s, at Pro Tour Journey Into Nyx, Pro Tour Eldritch Moon,, and Pro Tour Rivals of Ixalan, a runner-up finish at the 2013 World Championships, and wins at Grand Prix Nashville 2012, Grand Prix Miami 2013, Grand Prix Portland 2014, Grand Prix Oakland 2016, Grand Prix Louisville 2017, and Grand Prix Cleveland. Magic: The Gathering career  Commonly referred to as \\"The gentleman of the Magic world\\", Reid Duke started playing in 1995, at age five, with his brother Ian Duke, who is now a member of the Magic: The Gathering R&D; team at Wizards of the Coast. For a time, he was primarily a Magic: The Gathering Online player, but made the transition to in- person competitive play. He qualified for Pro Tour Amsterdam 2010 via rating, and won a Magic Online Championship Series (MOCS) event to qualify for the 2010 Magic Online World Championship, where he finished 5th, as well as the 2010 Magic: The Gathering World Championships in Chiba, Japan. Although his finishes in his first Pro Tours were unspectacular, he has not missed a Pro Tour since Amsterdam 2010. Duke first experienced success at paper Magic in 2011, when he reached the top eight of two Grand Prix events: Grand Prix Providence, where he finished fourth, and Grand Prix Montreal, where he finished fifth. He also won another MOCS event to requalify him for the Magic Online Championship, this year held in San Francisco concurrently with the 2011 World Championships. Duke ended up winning the event, defeating Florian Pils in the final. This qualified him for the inaugural Players Championship event (later renamed the Magic World Championship). At Pro Tour Dark Ascension in Honolulu, Duke finished in the money at a Pro Tour for the first time, placing 38th. From here, he would go on to finish in the money in eight consecutive Pro Tours. He also won his first Grand Prix when he defeated Todd Anderson in the final of Grand Prix Nashville. He has since 2012 been a part of the team now known as 'The Pantheon', alongside players such as Jon Finkel, Kai Budde and Gabriel Nassif. The 2012 Magic Players Championship did not go well for Duke; he finished the event with a 2‚Äì10 record, taking last place. Following this failure, Duke made it his mission to redeem himself by qualifying for next year's event and putting up a better performance, even going so far as to write down the mistakes he made in the tournament. Thanks to three Grand Prix top eight finishes, in Charleston, San Antonio and Quebec City, as well as stellar performance on the Pro Tour, he succeeded in requalifying for the World Championship when he finished 9th at Pro Tour Dragon's Maze in San Diego. He finished the 2012‚Äì13 season on 52 Pro Points, which was also sufficient for Platinum membership in the Pro Players Club. Duke started the 2013‚Äì14 season well, winning his second Grand Prix, at GP Miami. Duke went on to dominate the Swiss rounds of the 2013 World Championship, finishing in first place before the knockout rounds. Duke faced Josh Utter-Leyton in the semifinals, defeating him 3‚Äì2. He was considered a substantial favorite against his final opponent, Shahar Shenhar, and did indeed take a 2‚Äì0 lead in the best-of-five match, but Shenhar came all the way back to beat Duke 3‚Äì2 in an upset. Duke thus took second place in the event. He put up three more Grand Prix top eight finishes during the season, in Detroit, Barcelona and Philadelphia, before finally posting a top eight performance at a Pro Tour. At Pro Tour Journey into Nyx in Atlanta, Duke finished fifth, losing in the quarterfinals to Yuuki Ichikawa. At this point, he was in position to win the 2013‚Äì14 Player of the Year title, but ultimately this was won by J√©r√©my Dezani. He was also overtaken by teammate Owen Turtenwald for captainship of the United States national team at the 2014 World Magic Cup when the latter made the top eight of the final event of the season, Pro Tour Magic 2015. The 2014‚Äì15 season started really well for Duke, with him and his teammates Owen Turtenwald and William Jensen winning the very first Grand Prix of the season, Grand Prix Portland. At the 2014 World Championships, however, Duke posted a modest 14th-place finish, and his Pro Tour results throughout the season were average. He managed to reach two Grand Prix top eights, in Singapore and Montreal, towards the end of the season to retain Platinum status, but he did not qualify for the 2015 World Championships. In February 2015, Duke almost won a MOCS event for the third time, but lost in the final. In 2019, Duke was elected into the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame. =Achievements= Personal life Reid Duke is the brother of Ian Duke who is a developer at Wizards of the Coast.

A market position developed through establishing further steamship lines (like 1847 co-founder Hapag, 1874 co-founder Deutsch- Australische Dampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft, 1886 co-founder Woermann-Linie, 1890 co-founder Deutsch-Ost-Afrika-Linie). The companies traded with steamships while F. Laeisz continued the tall ship tradition which generated revenue with the nitrate trade from Chile. Until the end of the 1920s the company kept its engagement in the Chile trade with nitrate until it became possible to produce nitrate by the Haber-Bosch-System and the Chile trade came to an end. In 1897/98 the Laeiszhof was built at Trostbr√ºcke 1 in Hamburg, the head office of the company.Laeiszhof Trostbr√ºcke 1, at Hamburg-Altstadt In 1914 the first banana reefer ships, \\"Pioneer\\" and \\"Pungo\\", were ordered for the Afrikanische Frucht-Companie established in 1912 by F. Laeisz. The outbreak of World War ‚Ö† made it impossible for the company to commission these two ships for employment in its own banana trade. In 1923 with \\"Poseidon\\" F. Laeisz commissioned its first steamer for its own liner service to the SAWC and 1926 the last four-masted barque Padua was built. This ship signaled the end of the Flying P-Liner area which terminated with the end of World War II when \\"Padua\\" was given to the USSR, still trading as \\"Krusenstern\\". Since 1904 the company has owned shares in the Brazilian BRAHMA, forerunner of the brewery AMBEV.

Biography Jwaideh was born in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, into an Arabic-speaking Christian family that later moved to Baghdad. In 1942 he received a Licentiate in Law from the University of Baghdad and in 1960 a Ph.D. from Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. During this time, he also held a lecturer position in Arabic at Johns Hopkins University. After graduating he joined the faculty of Indiana University as a history professor, where he founded the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literature. He retired in 1985 and moved to San Diego where he was an adjunct professor of history at the University of California, San Diego until 1990. An annual lecture is given in his honor at Indiana University. Jwaideh and the Kurds His book ‚ÄúThe Kurdish National Movement‚Äù was selected as a Choice Outstanding Academic Title for 2006. The book was published in book form by Syracuse University Press 46 years after was published as a Ph.D. thesis; the thesis had long been known to and cited by scholars. Jwaideh understood the Kurdish socio-political system as operating at a tribal (a≈üiret) level before the twentieth century. According to Jwaideh, individual Kurdish leaders who attained political power did so within wider Muslim political structures, not within the Kurdish community. In Jwaideh's view, Kurdish identity is fundamentally tribal and more secular than religious. While acknowledging the \\"classic\\" status of Jwaideh's Kurdish National Movement, M. Hakan Yavuz asserts that Jwasdeh's characterization of Kurdish identity as being predominantly secular is fundamentally different from Kemalist secularism.

Developed between 1813 and World War I, it is one of the few surviving mill complexes in Milford, whose name is derived in part from \\"mill\\". The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The complex has been converted into residential use. Description and history The Milford Cotton and Woolen Manufacturing Company complex is located just north of the Milford Oval, on the southern bank of the Souhegan River, the historic source of its power. It consists of a single large building which developed in an evolutionary way between 1813, when its oldest part was built, and 1916, when the last major modifications were made. The mill occupies a site on the banks of the Souhegan River, which provided its power. The core of the structure is a three-story wooden building, which was the first part built. This was extended and enlarged in 1860 and 1883, and the brick end sections were added by later additions. The mill was founded about 1813, producing fabric during the War of 1812. It closed in 1833, and was reopened under new ownership in 1838. At that time, it was enlarged and possibly rebuilt entirely. Its largest period of growth came after its acquisition in 1860 by Morse, Kaley & Company, who built its largest elements. The complex was sold to the American Thread Company in 1901, and sold in 1916. During World War I it produced fabric for lining military uniforms. It is one of the city's few surviving 19th-century industrial complexes.

He played college football at Mississippi State. He was a second-round selection (43rd overall) in the 2015 NFL draft.  High school career  A native of Tunica, Mississippi, McKinney attended Rosa Fort High School, where he played linebacker and quarterback for the varsity football team and also started for the basketball team. In his junior season, McKinney threw for 530 yards with five touchdowns and rushed for 100 yards and one score, while also serving as the team's punter. On defense, he was credited with 34 tackles on the season. As a senior, McKinney accounted for 2,036 total yards of offense and 22 touchdowns (seven on the ground and fifteen passes) with 1,334 passing and 702 yards rushing. He also almost doubled his tackle total with 66. For postseason honors, the state‚Äôs high school coaches selected him to the North/South All-Star Game as a linebacker. Regarded as a three-star recruit by 247Sports.com, McKinney was ranked as the No. 49 athlete in his class. He was recruited by Memphis, Southern Miss and Mississippi State. Eventually accepting the Bulldogs' scholarship offer, McKinney became the first Rosa Fort player to sign with an SEC program since 2001.  College career  McKinney in 2014 After redshirting his initial year at Mississippi State, McKinney played in all 13 games in the 2012 season. By the fourth game, he made the starting lineup and remained there for the rest of the season. A week later at Kentucky McKinney posted 12 tackles (10 solo), 1 tackle for loss and his first two career pass breakups, earning him Co-SEC Freshman of the Week, alongside Johnny Manziel. The week after that he recorded a season-high 14 tackles at home against Tennessee, which he tied later in a loss to Texas A&M.; For the season, McKinney totalled 102 tackles, which led all SEC freshmen and tied for second among freshmen in the FBS. He earned All-SEC Freshman honors by the SEC coaches and ESPN.com, and was named a First-Team Freshman All-American by CBSSports.com, FoxSportsNext, Phil Steele and CollegeFootballNews.com. As a sophomore, McKinney led the team in tackles with 71 and sacks with 3.5. As a junior, he again led the team in tackles with 71. He was named first-team All- SEC and was an All-American. After his junior season, McKinney entered the 2015 NFL draft.  Professional career  Prior to his junior season, McKinney was projected as a first round selection in the 2015 NFL draft. On January 9, 2015, McKinney announced that he had decided to forgo his senior season and enter the 2015 NFL draft. Before the start of the pre-draft events, McKinney was ranked as the second best linebacker in the draft by NFL analyst Mike Mayock. He was one of 34 collegiate linebackers to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. McKinney completed all of the essential combine drills and finished second among all linebackers in the vertical jump, fifth in the broad jump, ninth in the short shuttle, tenth in the 40-yard dash, and tied for 11th amongst his position group in the three-cone drill. On March 4, 2015, he attended Mississippi State's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills for the team representatives and scouts from 29 NFL teams, including New York Jets' defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers and New Orleans Saints' assistant head coach Joe Vitt. As a highly sought after prospect, McKinney attended private visits and workouts with multiple NFL teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens, Miami Dolphins, Carolina Panthers, Cleveland Browns, Denver Broncos, New Orleans Saints, Chicago Bears, and Minnesota Vikings.

Built in 1869-70 and enlarged in 1891, it is the only known surviving work of architect Gridley J. F. Bryant, and is a significant local example of Italianate and Second Empire architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Milford Town Hall is located in the heart of Milford, on the east side of its central oval. The town house portion, which presents the main facade to the oval, was built in 1869, and is a two-story structure built of brick with granite trim. It was designed by Bryant & Rogers of Boston, and is stylistically similar to Gridley J. F. Bryant's other municipal and civic works of the period. The Italianate structure has a bell tower in which is a Paul Revere bell cast in 1802, which was hung in Milford's first town hall. The library annex was added to the rear of the building (along Nashua Street) in 1891, extending the south facade of the building from nine to twelve bays.Sanitary News 7 March 1891: 214. Lowell architect Frederick W. Stickney built it using a different type of brick, but stylistic elements tie it to the original structure. The Nashua Street facade originally housed commercial spaces on the ground floor, but the spaces were gradually taken over by municipal offices. The upper floor was originally built to serve as a space for the local Masonic lodge, but most of its trappings and finishes were removed after that use ended in 1939. Although the annex was designed primarily to house the town library, its basement was first used to house the fire department, and more recently housed emergency ambulance services. The library occupied the facilities until a new library was built across the street in 1951.

In a fifteen race career he won five races including the Group One Benson and Hedges Gold Cup in 1978 as well as the Heath Stakes and the Earl of Sefton Stakes. He was also placed in several top- class races including The Derby (beaten a head), Royal Lodge Stakes, Chester Vase, Irish Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Champion Stakes. His later career was compromised by illness and he was not a success at stud. Background Hawaiian Sound was a lightly made bay horse with a white sock on his right hind leg, bred by Arthur B. Hancock III's Stone Farm near Paris, Kentucky. He was sired by Hawaii, a South African Champion at two and three before being sent to the United States, where he was named the 1969 American Champion Turf Horse. His dam, Sound of Success, later produced the Goodwood Cup winner Sonus and the unraced Accordion, a leading sire of National Hunt horses. As a descendant of the broodmare Tiara, Sound of Success came from the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 2-n, which also produced the racemare Forest Flower. As a yearling, Hawaiian Sound was sent to the Keeneland September Sale, where he was sold for $32,000. He entered the ownership of Robert Sangster and was sent to Europe to be trained by Barry Hills at Lambourn. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= After finishing second on his debut, Hawaiian Sound recorded his first success in a six furlong maiden race at York Racecourse in July winning by three lengths from fifteen opponents. In September, the colt was moved up in class and distance for the Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot, and was made 11/4 favourite, largely on reports that he was superior to his stable companion Sexton Blake, who had won the Champagne Stakes. He never looked likely to win, finishing third, two and a half lengths behind the winner Shirley Heights. On his final appearance of the year, Hawaiian Sound finished eighth of the twelve runners behind Dactylographer in the William Hill Futurity after being badly hampered in the early stages. =1978: three-year-old season= Hawaiian Sound began his three-year-old season in March 1978 when he won a minor event over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse, beating Sharpen Your Eye by three lengths. In April he won the Heath Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse, beating M-Lolshan. In the Chester Vase, he started the odds-on favourite but was beaten a neck by Icelandic. The American jockey Willie Shoemaker was brought over to ride Hawaiian Sound in his net three races. At Epsom Downs Racecourse in June, the colt started a 25/1 outsider for the 199th running of the Derby Stakes. Shoemaker sent Hawaiian Sound into the lead from the start and the colt looked the likely winner in the last quarter mile but was caught in the final strides and was beaten a head by Greville Starkey on Shirley Heights. In the Irish Derby later that month he fought against Shoemaker's attempts to restrain him and after taking the lead in the straight he was beaten in a three-way photo-finish by Shirley Heights and Exdirectory. In July, Hawaiian Sound was matched against older horses for the first time when he contested the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. He finished third behind Ile de Bourbon and Acamas but was later promoted to second after the runner-up was disqualified for failing a drug test. In August, Hawaiian Sound was brought back in distance for the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he started the 2/1 favourite against a field which included Balmerino, Julio Mariner, Gunner B, More So, Cistus (Nassau Stakes) and Don (Lockinge Stakes). Hawaiian Sound took the lead soon after the start, went clear of his rivals early in the straight and won by a length and a half from Gunner B, with Jellaby in third. Hawaiian Sound bypassed the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and was aimed instead at the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in October. Starting the 7/4 favourite he appeared to reproduce his York form but was beaten into second place by the improving filly Swiss Maid. =1979: four-year-old season= Hawaiian Sound's third season was compromised by illness, as the Hills stable was affected by a viral infection. He started in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket in April for which he was the 5/4 favourite. Ridden by Steve Cauthen, he won from Spring In Deepsea, despite his saddle slipping soon after the start. He failed to reproduce his form in two subsequent outings, finishing unplaced in the Prix Ganay and running fourth in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. Assessment In 1977, the independent Timeform organisation gave Hawaiian Sound a rating of 113, seventeen pounds behind their top-rated two-year-old Try My Best, commenting that he might \\"improve a little\\" over longer distances. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best juveniles to race in Britain, he was allotted 122 pounds, nine pounds behind Try My Best. In the following year he was rated 129 by Timeform, four pounds behind their top three-year-old colt Ile de Bourbon. In the official International Classification he was also rated four pounds behind Ile de Bourbon, making him the fourth best three-year-old and the fifth-best horse of any age in Europe. Stud record Hawaiian Sound retired from racing at the end of 1979 and returned to his birthplace to become a breeding stallion at Stone Farm, starting his stud career at a fee of $15,000. He had problems with low fertility and was bought out by his insurers in 1983. He later stood at the Cedar Creek Farm in Texas. The best of his offspring was Malevic who won the Premio Presidente della Repubblica in 1986.

Built in 1904, this large brick building was the first armory building in the state, and is a distinct example of Romanesque architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The New Hampshire State Union Armory is located in downtown Manchester, on the south side of Pleasant Street roughly midway between Elm and Canal Streets. The brick building has two portions: a head house (which faces Pleasant Street), and a drill hall, located behind the head house and extending to West Central Street. It has a fortress-like main entrance, in a projecting section from its main facade that rises two stories and is framed by massive brick pilasters. The drill hall is nominally two stories in height, with a gabled roof, but its basement is fully exposed on the south side due to sloping terrain. A large granite arched entrance provides access to the basement level on that side. One unusual feature of the drill hall is that it has unique supports that can be swung into place to provided added strength to the flooring of the main hall, for use during drill exercises. The armory was built in 1904 to a design by Alfred A. Collins. It was the state's first armory building, built as part of an effort to centralize and better manage the state militia. It was the first place where all of the principal functions of the militia could be conducted, and equipment could be properly stored.

They considered themselves as the inheritors of the Dabuyid dynasty, and were known by their titles of Gilgilan and Ispahbadh. They were descended from Sukhra, a Parthian nobleman from the House of Karen, who was the de facto ruler of the Sasanian Empire from 484 to 493.  History  The dynasty was founded by Karen, who in return for aiding the Sasanian king Khosrow I (r. 531‚Äì579) against the Turks, received land to the south of Amol in Tabaristan. During the 7th century, an unnamed ruler Qarinvand dynasty was granted parts of Tabaristan by the Dabuyids who ruled in the area. In 760, the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid was defeated, his dynasty abolished and Tabaristan annexed by the Abbasids, but the Qarinvand and other minor local dynasties continued in existence. At this time, a certain Vindadhhurmuzd is mentioned as the Qarinvand ruler, while his younger brother Vindaspagan ruled as a subordinate ruler over the western Qarinvand regions, which reached as far as Dailam, a region controlled by the Dailamites, who like the Qarinvands and other rulers of Tabaristan were Zoroastrians. Vindadhhurmuzd, along with the Bavandid ruler Sharwin I, led the native resistance to Muslim rule and the efforts at Islamization and settlement begun by the Abbasid governor, Khalid ibn Barmak (768‚Äì772). Following his departure, the native princes destroyed the towns he had built in the highlands, and although in 781 they affirmed loyalty to the Caliphate, in 782 they launched a general anti-Muslim revolt that was not suppressed until 785, when Sa'id al-Harashi led 40,000 troops into the region. Relations with the caliphal governors in the lowlands improved thereafter, but the Qarinvand and Bavandid princes remained united in their opposition to Muslim penetration of the highlands, to the extent that they prohibited even the burial of Muslims there. Isolated acts of defiance like the murder of a tax collector occurred, but when the two princes were summoned before Harun al-Rashid in 805 they promised loyalty and the payment of a tax, and were forced to leave their sons behind as hostages for four years. Vindadhhurmuzd later died in 815, and was succeeded by his son Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd, who along with Sharwin's successor Shahriyar I was requested by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to aid in the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars. Shahriyar declined the request, while Qarin accepted, and became successful in his campaign against the Byzantines. Qarin was then bestowed with many honors by Al-Ma'mun. Shahriyar, jealous of Qarin's fame, began annexing some of the latter's territory. In 817, during the reign of Qarin's son Mazyar, Shahriyar, with the aid of Mazyar's uncle Vinda-Umid, expelled the latter from Tabaristan, and seized all his territories. Mazyar fled to the court of al-Ma'mun, became a Muslim and in 822/23 returned with the support of the Abbasid governor to exact revenge: Shahriyar's son and successor, Shapur, was defeated and killed, and Mazyar united the highlands under his own rule. His growing power brought him into conflict with the Muslim settlers at Amul, but he was able to take the city and receive acknowledgement of his rule over all of Tabaristan from the caliphal court. Eventually, however, he quarreled with Abdallah ibn Tahir, and in 839, he was captured by the Tahirids, who now took over control of Tabaristan. The Bavandids exploited the opportunity to regain their ancestral lands: Shapur's brother, Qarin I, assisted the Tahirids against Mazyar, and was rewarded with his brother's lands and royal title. Quhyar, a brother of Mazyar, who had betrayed the latter and chose to aid the Tahirids, who promised him the Qarinvand throne, shortly ascended the Qarivand throne, but was shortly killed by his own Dailamite soldiers because of his betrayal against his brother. Although many scholars considered the death of Quhyar as the fall of the Qarinvand dynasty, the dynasty continued to rule in parts of Tabaristan, and a certain Baduspan ibn Gurdzad is mentioned in 864 as the ruler of the Qarinvand dynasty, and is known to have supported the Alid Hasan ibn Zayd. However, his son and successor Shahriyar ibn Baduspan was hostile to Hasan ibn Zayd, but was along with the Bavandid ruler Rustam I forced to acknowledge his authority. Shahriyar's son Muhammad ibn Shahriyar is later mentioned as the later of the Qarivand dynasty in 917, and was like his father hostile to the Alids. Two centuries later, a certain Qarinvand ruler named Amir Mahdi is mentioned in 1106 as one of the vassals of the Bavandid ruler Shahriyar IV. After him, no other Qarinvand ruler is known, but they continued to rule until the 11th-century.

Hynicka was also involved in operating a chain of burlesque houses, and was a partner in an attempt to form a theatrical \\"wheel\\" in 1910. Early years Rudolph Kelker Hynicka was born on 6 July 1859 in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Hynicka was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. In the 1880s he moved to Cincinnati, the county seat of Hamilton County, Ohio, and became a reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer. He joined the Republican party, initially as a supporter of George Moerlein. He was appointed by the Moerlein faction to positions in the offices of the county auditor and county treasurer. In the 1890s Hynicka was elected police clerk. He became the Republican captain of Cincinnati's 9th ward. Political career Hynicka moved to the camp of George B. Cox, and took responsibility for maintaining Cox's voter card file. This contained records on every voter in Cincinnati, including where they worked, which church they belonged to and any scandals in which they had been involved. Hynicka became the most powerful of Cox's supporters. He headed Cincinnati's influential Republican Central Committee of ward and township captains and managed allocation of the 2,000 political patronage jobs in the city. By the start of the 1890s Hynicka, Cox and Garry Herrmann dominated Cincinnati politics. In 1897 they lost a mayoral election campaign in which the Democrat Gustav Tafel promised to clean up the city. Various scandals emerged after the Democrats took office. One involved Hynicka using his office as clerk of the police court to earn bribes of $150‚Äì$200 a week. The Republican candidate Julius Fleischmann was elected in 1900 and reelected in 1903. Hynicka was elected treasurer of Hamilton County in 1903, his only elective office. In October 1905 the Cox machine was attacked by William Howard Taft in a speech linked to President Theodore Roosevelt's drive to eliminate corruption in business and politics. In 1911 Cox announced \\"I am retiring. I hope my enemies will find other targets\\". When Cox retired Hynicka became leader of the Republican party in Hamilton county. Hynicka and Herrmann agreed to reorganize the Republican Advisory Committee without Cox at the request of Charles Phelps Taft, the president's brother. On 2 April 1912 Hynicka announced that he had withdrawn from politics to devote himself to his business interests. Cox and Herrmann had already made similar announcements. Later Hynicka was chosen to represent Ohio in the Republican National Committee, holding this position until 1924, when he was succeeded by Maurice Mashke of Cleveland. In the 1920 elections the Republicans won the White House by a landslide. In Cincinnati, however, Hynicka's candidates were less successful, indicating that his power was waning. A letter from Warren G. Harding of 4 October 1921 said \\"... I should not grieve if Hynicka should be overturned in Hamilton County, but I do not subscribe to the theory that the way to overturning is to put the Republican party out of power in the municipality of Cincinnati.\\" In 1926 Hynicka retired from his position as chairman of the Hamilton county executive and central committee of the Republican organization. Other interests In 1905 the old Vine Street Opera House in Cincinnati was renovated and reopened as the Standard Theater. It was managed as a burlesque house by Hynicka and Charles B. Arnold until 1915. In November 1906 Variety noted that a corporation controlled by John J. Ryan and Rudolph K. Hynicka, of Cincinnati, was operating a theater in St. Louis. Rudolph K. Hynicka came to own a chain of burlesque houses. In 1910 Hynicka became involved in the Columbia Burlesque Circuit, playing a leading role in that organization. On 4 December 1910 L. Lawrence Weber announced a plan to form a circuit of popular theaters, the Lawrence Weber Co-operative Booking Circuit. The investors were Weber, Sam A. Scribner, John Herbert Mack and Rudolph K. Hynicka. They planned to acquire forty theaters in cities around the United States and Canada, and to supply them with forty theater companies playing in rotation. They would put on equal numbers of melodramas, society plays, comedy dramas, farce comedies and musical comedies, charging popular prices. The partners were all associated with the \\"Eastern Wheel\\" of burlesque theaters, which had a similar business model. By 1914 Hynicka had acquired a large stake in Cox's interests in theaters in New York, and was spending growing amount of time in that city. Hynicka invested in the Cincinnati Commercial-Tribune, a newspaper, and became president of the company. The paper supported the Republican party, and expected assistance in return. Hynicka's first wife died in 1912, and he remarried. He died on 21 February 1927 in St. Petersburg, Florida. His funeral was attended by many people involved in theater.

A scion of the Tagaris family, Paul also claimed a somewhat dubious connection with the Palaiologos dynasty that ruled the Byzantine Empire at the time. He fled his marriage as a teenager and became a monk, but soon his fraudulent practices embroiled him in scandal. Fleeing Constantinople, he traveled widely, from Palestine to Persia and Georgia and eventually, via Ukraine and Hungary to Italy, Latin Greece, Cyprus and France. During his long and tumultuous career, Paul was appointed an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, pretended to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again, supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti-popes in the Western Schism, and managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394.  Early life and family  The main source on Paul's life is the document of his confession before the patriarchal synod in Constantinople, which is undated, but included among documents of the years 1394‚Äì1395. It was published in modern times by Franz Ritter von Miklosich and Joseph Muller (eds.), Acta et Diplomata Gr√¶ca medii √¶vi sacra et profana, Vol. II, Acta Patriarchatus Constantinopolitan√¶, Vienna 1860. The confession is complemented by an account of his visit to Paris in 1390, written by a monk of the Abbey of Saint-Denis and included in the anonymous Chronique du religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le r√®gne de Charles VI de 1380 √† 1422. Paul Tagaris was apparently a scion of the Tagaris family, a lineage which first appears in the early 14th century. His father is unnamed, but is described by Paul as a valiant and famous soldier, so that he is possibly identifiable either with the megas stratopedarches Manuel Tagaris, or with the latter's son, George Tagaris. Paul Tagaris claimed to be related to the ruling imperial dynasty of the Palaiologoi and adopted the surname for himself. Manuel Tagaris was indeed married to Theodora Asanina Palaiologina, daughter of Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria, and niece of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, but even if Paul was Manuel's son, Theodora was, according to the Byzantinist Donald Nicol, \\"almost certainly not the mother of Paul\\". According to Nicol, Tagaris was probably born in the 1320s, while other modern sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage at the age of 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.  Career in the East  In Palestine, Paul was able to secure his ordination as a deacon by the Patriarch of Jerusalem Lazaros, who took him under his protection (ca. 1364). Shortly after, Lazaros left for Constantinople, and his locum tenens Damianos brought charges against Paul, who was forced to abandon Jerusalem for Antioch. In Antioch, Paul once again managed to befriend an influential figure, the newly elected (1368) Patriarch Michael, who not only ordained him a priest, but eventually made him patriarchal exarch and administrator of the Patriarchate's affairs. It was not long before Paul began abusing his authority: he sacked serving bishops and put their sees up for sale, threatening to report those who complained to the Turkish authorities. Soon he claimed the title of Patriarch of Jerusalem for himself and began to ordain bishops, even in territories subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1370, he went to Iconium and then to Persia and Georgia, where, according to his own recollection, he adjudicated a dispute among three rival claimants of the throne, finding in favour of the highest bidder. No such dispute is recorded in Georgian sources at this time. At this point, again according to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon,Arsenius, Metropolitan of Tyre in 1351‚Äì1376 and rival Patriarch of Antioch in 1366‚Äì1376. . who found him and delivered an offer by the Patriarch of Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the Taurus Mountains or in the Tauric peninsula, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (). At the same time, the Patriarch of Constantinople Philotheos I Kokkinos heard about his dealings in the east, and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.  Latin Patriarch of Constantinople  Pope Urban VI (modern painting, Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, Rome) Reluctant to face the Patriarch's wrath, Paul once more decided to flee, and try his luck in Rome. As Nicol points out, such a move would be highly unusual for an Orthodox priest, but may be explained by his family's links with pro-Catholic circles in the Byzantine capital: George Tagaris, his putative brother or father, was among those who supported the Union of the Churches and had received letters of encouragement from Pope Innocent VI. To avoid passing near Constantinople, Paul was forced to make a broad detour. He took a ship, probably from Trebizond, to the Crimea, where he presented the local governor of the Golden Horde with jewels from the treasure he had amassed. In exchange, he received an escort through the Horde lands (modern Ukraine) to the Kingdom of Hungary, and thence to Rome. There he secured an audience with Pope Urban VI, claiming to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Paul presented himself to the Pope as a penitent, offered a confession, and embraced the Catholic faith. Impressed by Paul's humble demeanour, the Pope named him (in late 1379 or early 1380) to the titular post of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, which had been vacant since September 1378, when its incumbent, Giacomo da Itri, had declared his allegiance to the Avignon anti-pope Clement VII. Urban also named Paul apostolic legate for all countries \\"east of Durazzo\\". After his appointment as a \\"second Pope\\", as he called it, Paul abandoned his simple monastic habit and adopted magnificent vestments to suit his new rank, wore ostentatious jewellery, and, according to the chronicler of Saint-Denis, went about on horseback surrounded by a magnificently outfitted entourage. A likely example of Paul's splendid vestments and accoutrements at this time is a richly embroidered altar cloth, featuring a Byzantine double-headed eagle with a monogram on its breast and the legend \\"Paul, Patriarch of Constantinople and New Rome\\" in Greek, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Since Constantinople had been recovered by the Byzantines in 1261, the seat of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople had been since 1314 at Negroponte, which still remained in Latin hands. Soon after his investment, Paul stopped in Ancona on his way to Greece. He remained in the city for several weeks, f√™ted by the locals, and presented them with purported relics: on 4 March 1380 the head of James the Just, followed on 17 April by the foot of Saint Anne and a nail from the True Cross. As Nicol comments, \\"one may be tempted to question the authenticity, and still more the provenance, of his donation\\". The documents of grant, preserved in the cathedral of Ancona, are signed by Paul and a certain \\"Alexios Palaiologos the Despot\\", allegedly a son of the Byzantine emperor but in reality, according to Nicol, probably \\"another figment of Paul's fertile imagination\\". From 1380 until 1384, Paul remained at his see in Negroponte. A relative of his, George Tagaris‚Äîprobably a different person than Manuel Tagaris' son‚Äîwas called in to help with the administration of the patriarchal domains. His tenure was troubled, as the local Orthodox clergy appealed to the Venetian authorities for protection against his exactions, while the Latin Archbishop of Athens, Antonio Ballester, complained of the Patriarch's interference in his diocese. Furthermore, his lease of some of the Church lands in 1383 to a Venetian from Crete, Giacomo Grimani, proved a source of protracted legal trouble since Grimani, in the words of the French medievalist Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, \\"revealed himself as much a scoundrel as the Patriarch\\". In 1384, Paul was once again denounced as an impostor to the Pope, possibly by Ballester, who was named vicar-general of the Patriarchate in the same year, and who had held the same office during the 1378‚Äì1379 vacancy. Paul had apparently left his diocese before his denunciation, and resumed his wanderings. In 1385, he was in Cyprus, where he crowned James of Lusignan as King of Cyprus in exchange for 30,000 gold coins, and continued granting ecclesiastical appointments on the island as if he were still patriarch. Avignon anti-pope Clement VII (modern painting by Calixte Serrur) In 1388 he returned to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went to the court of Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count‚Äîa claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt‚Äîand as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon. Paul received a magnificent welcome at Avignon, where he was f√™ted by Clement VII and his cardinals. Clement, moved by his guest's tales of suffering at the hands of the Roman popes, loaded him with gifts and honours and sent him north to Paris. There, King Charles VI of France likewise prepared a triumphal welcome for his illustrious guest. Paul was an exotic and popular sight in the French capital, and was lavishly hosted and entertained. He obviously enjoyed his long sojourn there, \\"safe in a place where his past was unknown and his deception was unlikely to be discovered\\", according to Nicol. For further safety, he communicated only via an interpreter in his employ. On his visit to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, he claimed that there were several relics of the abbey's patron saint‚Äîcommonly confused with the Athenian saint Dionysius the Areopagite at the time‚Äîto be found back in Greece, and promised to help the monks bring them to France. His proposal was enthusiastically taken up, and two monks received permission and funds from the king to accompany Paul back to Greece. When the party arrived in the port in Italy from which they would sail for Greece, however, Paul bribed the captain of the ship to pretend that bad weather would delay their departure. In the same night, he and his servants set sail with their entire baggage, leaving the two monks behind. It was only in Rome, where the monks went in search of answers for Paul's behaviour, that they learned the true identity of their travelling companion. From them the chronicler of the abbey later received his information.  Return to Constantinople  According to Nicol, the achievement of the \\"accomplished sinner\\" Paul was without parallel: \\"No-one ever made such a profitable business out of changing sides, first in the schism between the Greek and Latin Churches, and then in the schism between the pope in Rome and the pope in Avignon. It is no mean feat to arrive in Rome as Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem and then to be received in Avignon as Catholic patriarch of Constantinople.\\" Now, though, having irreparably destroyed his reputation and ties with both papal courts, Paul was left with no option other than to return to Constantinople. In 1394, he was back in the Byzantine capital, where he appeared before Patriarch Antony IV, before whom he confessed his sins, abjured his conversion to Catholicism, and pleaded for mercy. As Nicol writes, \\"Only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused; for, despite rumours and tales contrived against him, he had never indulged in fornication, miracle-mongering, or the practice of magic\\". The Patriarch passed Paul's case on to the full patriarchal synod, before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice, and then once more before an assembly of the people. The records of these sessions, kept by the patriarchal scribe Perdikes, are the main source on Paul's life. The final portion of the manuscript, containing the verdict, is missing, but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon, so it is likely that he was forgiven. His subsequent life is unknown.

After retiring from racing he became a successful stallion in Australia. Background The Marquis was a bay colt foaled in 1859 and sired by Stockwell. His dam was Cinizelli, a daughter of Touchstone, who had previously produced The Oaks winner Marchioness.http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family2b.htm He was trained in Yorkshire by John Scott. He appears to have been a temperamental colt who wore blinkers and was usually accompanied to the start by his stable lad, who held onto his head until the last moment. Racing career The Marquis won the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse and the Prendergast Stakes at Newmarket as a two-year-old in 1861. In the spring of 1862 he won the 2,000 Guineas Stakes, beating Caterer by half a length. After the race he was surrounded by his Yorkshire supporters, some of whom narrowly escaped injury when he kicked out. He started favourite for The Derby and led for most of the way before being overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a neck by the outsider Caractacus. His jockey, Tom Ashmall, who had ridden the colt to victory in the Guineas, was criticised for going to the front too soon. Tom Challoner took over the ride when The Marquis started second favourite for the St. Leger Stakes on 18 September. He was not among the early leaders but moved to the front on the turn into the straight. Throughout the closing stages he was strongly challenged by the favourite Buckstone, and looked beaten at one point before rallying in the final strides to win by a head.

Their idea was named by the New York Times as one of the ideas that shaped 2008. The term was shortlisted as Word of the Year by the Oxford English Dictionary in 2016. In 2004 she was awarded a Research Councils UK academic fellowship. She was Associate Editor for the British Journal of Social Psychology between 2010 and 2012. In 2014 she undertook a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship to examine the role of identity in explaining perceptions of work-life balance. At the University of Exeter she has held the roles of Faculty Associate Dean (Research), Dean of Post-graduate Research and inaugural Director of the Exeter Doctoral College. She holds a European Research Council Consolidator Grant examining the way in which context and identity shape and constrain women‚Äôs careers.  Selected publications  Ryan MK, Branscombe NR (2012).

The museum covers the life and writings of German children's author Erich K√§stner and is based in the Villa Augustin building which had belonged to K√§stner's uncle. The museum is notable for its architecture, which was designed to be semi-mobile and fit within a single room, close to where K√§stner had grown up in Dresden's inner new town (). The museum focuses on K√§stner's early years in Dresden and Leipzig, the connections between his work and children, and his relationship to the media. The museum collection includes first editions by K√§stner, including his most famous work Emil and the Detectives, along with garments and objects belonging to K√§stner.  Museum  Established in 1999, the museum opened in early 2000 in celebration of the 101st anniversary of K√§stner's birth in the Villa Augustin at the Albertplatz in the Innere Neustadt (inner new town). The villa was formerly owned and inhabited by Erich K√§stner's maternal uncle Franz Augustin, a horse trader, and K√§stner regularly visited it as a youth. In his autobiographical novel When I was a little Boy () he refers to the Villa and many places in the vicinity. The museum has a bronze sculpture by the Hungarian artist Mathyas Varga of one such remembered scene, K√§stner as a boy perched on the wall, looking out into the bustling square and listening to the trams in Dresden.Eckhard Bahr, Dresden: mit Mei√üen, Radebeul und S√§chsischer Schweiz, Berlin: Trescher, 2010, , p. 149 In fact, Erich K√§stner's childhood memories of Villa Augustin served him as an anchor point for inspiration; the main characters of the film Anna Louise and Anton () are named after K√§stner's cousin Dora Augustin, nicknamed \\"little dots\\" (), and the adjacent Anton- Street (). The museum was funded entirely by private donations,Erich K√§stner Museum, Dresden, Citysam Dresden, retrieved 26 May 2014 organised by the / . The museum focuses on K√§stner's years in Dresden and Leipzig, the connections between his work and children, and his relationship to the media. The Albertsplatz tram stops adjacent to the museum are announced by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe (DVB) as \\"Albertplatz - Erich K√§stner Museum\\".  Architectural concept  The museum format was designed around the architectural concept that \\"less is more\\". In his 1998 design, the Irish architect Ruair√≠ O'Brien conceived of the museum as a \\"walkable treasure- chest\\" with core principles of mobility, interaction, and compactness, in other words a mobile, interactive micromuseum. Installed on the ground floor, it takes up no more than a single room, within which are thirteen mobile modules, each with drawers color-coded to signify an aspect of Erich K√§stner's life and work. With the exception of original exhibits from K√§stner's estate, visitors are encouraged to touch, read, and try out whatever they can find. In the center of the modules, the core element exhibits selected items from K√§stner's estate. The large tree in front of the museum became a shoe tree (), with pairs of shoes being thrown over the branches of tree. In 2018 the tree was cleaned of hanging shoes. Recognition In 2002, the museum was awarded the Museum Prize from the Heinz and Brigitte Schirnig Foundation () for its innovative open character and miniature scale. In 2003 the \\"micromuseum\\" design concept of the museum received an award from the German Federal Culture Foundation.

Also, to push for the implementation of additional executive laws in the Constitution: * A law organizing the presidential departments and their work * An electoral law to ensure the parliamentary system, the monitoring and the accountability. * A law organizing the work of the council of ministers, as it constitutes the executive power. * A law organizing the Prime Minister's departments and their work. * A law achieving the judiciary power's independence, while maintaining the concept of the separation of powers and subjecting the officials and the civilians to the rule of law. * A law organizing the LAF in accordance with the Constitution and the National Agreement. * A law organizing security apparatuses (army intelligence, general security, state security and their links to all the authorities). * A law organizing the state's administration (the ministries, the administrations and the ministries‚Äô structure). * An administrative d√©centralisation Policy. * A law re-organizing media outlets. 4- To create a citizen's state based on a new social contract by organizing a national convention that adds together all national components to get back to the prevailing social contract in Lebanon, in order to discuss and lay down foundations for a modern state socially, economically and culturally. This invitation shall not only include leaders of political parties that participated to the Lebanese Civil War.

In 1840 in Leicester, he formed the company Broadbents Ltd, a busy which serviced builders' merchants and roofing contractors. He was also associated with Broadbent and Hawley, stone and marble masons and gravestone cutters. Broadbent built his home, Victoria House, in 1861 in Humberstone. The large estate included a mansion house, stables, coach house, winery, orchard, conservatories and outbuildings. His first wife was the daughter of a farmer from Dodleston, Cheshire called Anne Wright and they had four children. The eldest, also Benjamin, inherited the family business. His second wife was Mary Geary and they had six children. Three years after his death, Victoria House was purchased by the Leicester Corporation to establish the Leicester Borough Asylum, which became the Towers Hospital. Selected works His work includes a marble tablet of commemoration in All Saints Church, Thurcaston. Pevsner attributes Victorian ceilings in Althorp's Billiard Room (formerly the Yellow Drawing Room or Rubens Room) and South Drawing Room to Broadbent. Broadbent erected a plaque on a gable end next to Leicaster's old Bow Bridge in 1856, which remains part of the 17th century legend of the fate of Richard III‚Äôs body. When the old Bow Bridge at Leicester was demolished to make way for a new and more serviceable structure, a very good engraving of it appeared in The Illustrated London News of February 9, 1861. It was an old bridge when King Richard III passed over it en route for Bosworth Field. The article read in part: ‚Äî > \\"For many years, there was a spot pointed out by visitors as King Richard‚Äôs > grave, and an old stone inserted in a neighbouring wall bore testimony to > the fact. In the course of events, however, it became necessary to pull down > the wall, and build over the spot; and it seemed as if the place of King > Richard‚Äôs burial would be forgotten altogether, and so it probably would > have been but for the enterprise and public spirit of a Leicester townsman, > Mr. Benjamin Broadbent, a master builder, and one well known for his many > acts of munificence. This gentleman, unwilling that the remains of a King of > England should lie without a stone to mark the place, obtained permission of > Mr. A Turner, the owner of the estate, and at his own sole cost inserted a > massive stone in the building about to be erected recording the event... The > visitor to Leicester (thanks to Mr. Broadbent), may still go to the place of > King Richard's last interment, and may read there that ‚ÄòNear this spot lie > the remains of Richard III, the last of the Plantagenets, 1485.' \\" References * Category:1813 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Architects from Leicester Category:English stonemasons Category:19th-century English architects Category:People from Humberstone & Hamilton ","title":"Benjamin Broadbent (builder)"},{"id":"42868363","text":"Down the Drain may refer to: * Down the Drain (CSI), an episode of the TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation * Down the Drain (film), a 1990 American comedy film ","title":"Down the Drain"},{"id":"42868368","text":"David Clemens (born May 5, 1992) is an American soccer player who last played for Tampa Bay Rowdies 2 in the National Premier Soccer League.

Despite the implication of the name, Halobacterium is actually a genus of archaea, not bacteria. H. noricense can be isolated from environments with high salinity such as the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Members of the Halobacterium genus are excellent model organisms for DNA replication and transcription due to the stability of their proteins and polymerases when exposed to high temperatures. To be classified in the genus Halobacterium, a microorganism must exhibit a membrane composition consisting of ether-linked phosphoglycerides and glycolipids.  Scientific classification  This organism is a member of the genus Halobacterium and its taxonomic classification is as follows: Archaea, Euryarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Halobacteria, Halobacteriales, Halobacteriaceae, Halobacterium, Halobacterium noricense. There are currently 19 known halophilic archaeal genera and 57 known species within the genus Halobacterium. = Relatives = Typical morphology of Halobacterium speciesThree reported strains Halobacterium salinarium NRC-1, Halobacterium sp. DL1, and Halobacterium salinarium R1 were compared to Halobacterium noricense strain CBA1132. The phylogenetic trees based on Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) indicated that strain CBA1132 and strain DL1 are closely related while strains NRC-1 and R1 are closely related. Multi-Locus Sequence Typing is a technique that uses genomic information to establish evolutionary relationships between bacterial taxa. Average Nucleotide Identity is a genetic method used to compare the similarity between nucleotides of two strains based on the coding regions of their genomes, which has allowed scientists to veer away from traditional methods of classifying prokaryotes based on phenotypic similarities.Zhang W., Pengcheng D., Han Z. et al. (2014) Whole-genome sequence comparison as a method for improving bacterial species definition. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol., 60, 75‚Äì78. The defining characteristic between strains CBA1132 and DL1 is that they both contain high GC content in their chromosomes, providing stability in a harsh environment.Pfeiffer, F., Schuster, S.C., Broicher, A., Falb, M., Palm, P., Rodewald, K., et al., Evolution in the laboratory: The genome of Halobacterium salinarum strain R1 compared to that of strain NRC-1, Genomics, 2008, 91(4):335-346. Other close relatives of H. noricense within the genus Halobacterium include Halobacterium denitrificans, Halobacterium halobium, and Halobacterium volcanii.  Morphology  Halobacterium noricense is known to be free living, and it typically appears as red or pink colonies due to the presence of carotenoids and bacterioruberin in their membranes. The carotenoids have the ability to absorb light between the wavelengths of 330-600 nm, as determined by light spectroscopy. Typical colony morphology is round with a diameter of 0.4 mm. Under the microscope, they can typically be measured at around 5 Œºm and appear gram-negative and rod-shaped. H. noricense does not contain the gas vesicles that are present in their close relative, Halobacterium salinarium, which often appear as floating cultures. Halobacterium noricense may occasionally appear as coccus-shaped when grown in liquid broth rather than on solid media.  Discovery  = Etymology = Halobacterium noricense is named after Noricum, Austria, which is the location of the salt deposit in which the organism was isolated. The archaeon was discovered in 2004 by a group of scientists led by Claudia Gruber. The group isolated two strains of H. noricense, along with other Halobacterium species including H. salinarium. = Sources = The first two strains (A1 and A2) of Halobacterium noricense were isolated from samples taken out of a salt deposit in Austria. The salt deposit was approximately 400 meters below the surface and is believed to have been formed during the Permian period. To obtain the samples, the researchers used a pre-existing mine to travel below the Earth's surface. They used a core drill to remove cylindrical sections of the salt deposit, which were then taken for sequencing. The deposit retained high salt levels over approximately 250 million years due to the surrounding clay and limestone. These conditions do not allow the salt to escape, which formed an ideal environment for halophilic archaea. = Media = Halobacterium noricense was isolated on ATCC 2185 medium with 250.0 grams of NaCl, 20.0 grams of MgSO4 7H2O, 2.0 grams of KCl, 3.0 grams of yeast extract, 5.0 grams of tryptone, and other compounds required for the isolate's growth. After an incubation period of approximately 2 weeks, red circular colonies appeared. This is the characteristic colony morphology of H. noricense.  Growth Conditions  Halobacterium noricense is known to be a mesophile, where optimum growth temperature is approximately 37 ¬∞C with an incubation period of 18 days. It thrives in acidic conditions at pH 5.2-7.0. NaCl concentration between 15-17% has resulted in the highest growth rates in previous studies. It has been found that Halobacterium can survive in high metal concentrations because they are extremely halophilic. This can be achieved through metal resistance, which indicates that the H. noricense strain CBA1132 might also be able to survive in these high metal ion concentrations.  Genome  H. noricense strains A1 and A2 from Gruber et al. had 97.1% similarity to genus Halobacterium through their 16S rDNA sequences. H. noricense genome, strain CBA1132, composed of four contigs containing 3,012,807 base pairs, approximately 3,084 gene coding sequences, and 2,536 genes. It has a GC content of approximately 65.95%, and 687 of the genes in the H. noricense genome have unknown functions. Metabolism and amino acid transport-related genes make up the largest group of known genes. This group contains 213 known genes. The genus Halobacterium is currently known as monophyletic because their 16S rRNA have less than 80% similarity with their closest relatives, the methanogens. = Sequencing = According to Joint Genome Institute, another complete genome analysis of Halobacterium (strain DL1) species was sequenced using 454 GS FLX, Illumina GAIIx. Halobacterium noricense (strain CBA1132) was recently isolated from solar salt and a complete genomic analysis was performed by researchers from Korea in 2016. The researchers extracted the DNA using a QuickGene DNA tissue kit, which uses a membrane with extremely fine pores to collect DNA and nucleic acids. They purified the DNA using the MG Genomic DNA purification kit. Once extracted and purified, the strategy for sequencing the genome was Whole Genome Sequencing by the method of a PacBio RS II system. Lastly, the genome was analyzed and performed by the Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) server.  Metabolism  According to Gruber et al., Halobacterium noricense cannot ferment glucose, galactose, sucrose, xylose or maltose. It is resistant to many antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Tetracycline, but can be killed by Anisomycin. This organism does not produce the enzymes gelatinase or amylase, so it cannot break down starch or gelatin. H. noricense is a chemoorganotroph and uses aerobic respiration in most environments, except when exposed to L-arginine or nitrate. In these cases, it can function as a facultative anaerobe. It is catalase positive, meaning it has the ability to break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The most abundant carbon source found in hypersaline environments is glycerol due to the contribution of the green algae, Dunaliella, to reduce its surrounding osmotic pressure. H. noricense is able to metabolize glycerol through phosphorylation to glycerol 3- phosphate and eventually, into the formation of dihydroxyacetone 5- phosphate (DHAP). NMR spectroscopy, used to locate local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei, revealed during aerobic respiration that 90% of pyruvate that is converted to acetyl Co-A by pyruvate synthase enters the Citric acid cycle while the other 10% is converted to oxaloacetate by biotin carboxylases to later be used in fatty acid degradation.  Ecology  Metagenomic analysis was performed on concentrated biomass from the last Dead Sea bloom and compared with hundreds of liters of brine (pH 6), revealing that the bloom was less diverse from brine. The Dead Sea is located on the borders of Israel and the Jordan River where its depth is around 300 m. The Dead Sea contains 1.98M Mg2+, 1.54M Na+, and 0.08M (1%) Br‚àí making the waters unique and the ecosystem harsh. Samples were collected from the Dead Sea in 1992 at Ein Gedi 310 station during bloom season. The cells were centrifuged and a reddish cell pellet was embedded in agarose plugs. DNA was extracted from the plugs and cloned into pCC1fos vector to construct two fosmid libraries, which contain DNA from bacterial F-plasmids. BAC-end sequences were performed on each library for further analysis, and the sequences were scanned for vector contamination and removed by BLASTing. The read length was 734 bp for the 1992 library. PCR 16S rRNA gene amplification was carried out and was used to construct a tree to calculate bootstrap values from a total of 714 sequence positions. Although halophiles are diverse, analysis revealed that most rRNAs had around 93% similarity to sequences in GenBank. H. noricense had a 95% similarity in the 1992 bloom. When the samples were compared to the fosmid library, some were over 88% similar to other known halophilic bacterial species. This indicates that these halophiles are specifically adapted to the extreme salinity of the Dead Sea. There are also studies in the field of astrobiology regarding the possibility of Halobacterium on Mars. Similarly to the Dead Sea, any water located on the Martian surface would be a brine with an extremely high salt concentration. Therefore, microbial life on Mars would require adaptations similar to those of Halobacterium.  Significance  Halobacterium noricense has many applications that can benefit humans and industries including drug delivery, UV protection, and the unique characteristic of bacteriorhodopsin to be able to be isolated outside of its environment. H. noricense produces a high concentration of menaquinones (fat soluble vitamin K2) that can be used as a micelle to deliver drugs to specific places in the body. According to Nimptsch K, the presence of menaquinones can also reduce the risk of malignant cancer. Fermented foods are also found to have high levels of menaquinones due to the presence of bacteria, especially in cheeses. H. noricense requires high salt concentrations and is currently being explored to enhance the process of fermentation. H. noricense is also catalase positive, meaning it can break down reactive oxygen species (ROS), like hydrogen peroxide into harmless substances such as water. Not only does it produce enzymes to protect itself against ROS, but it contains a pigment, bacterioruberin, that allows H. noricense to tolerate gamma and UV radiation. Further research into bacterioruberin can lead to bioactive compounds with anticancer characteristics. Lastly, bacteriorhodopsin (also protects cells from UV light), a light proton pump, has allowed scientists to apply it to electronics and optics. Its mechanism involves capturing light and creating a proton gradient to produce chemical energy. Some practical uses include motion detection, holographic storage, and nanotechnology.

Although her songs were mostly secular in nature (being the popular music of the time in Morocco), many of the melodies have later been modified to be fit religious Jewish liturgical songs (called piyyutim) as well. Born in Sefrou, near Fez, at the feet of the mountains of Atlas in a modest Moroccan Jewish family, she started to sing at a very early age when she performed religious songs at her synagogue. During her youth, she started to sing in coffee houses and cabarets near towns and in Casablanca. Her songs were mostly secular gharnati songs (Andalusian Arabic songs originally from Granada, Spain, and very popular among the Muslims of Andalusian background and Moroccan and Algerian Jews in the 19th century), as well as Malhun, which are long Moroccan poems. During the 1940s, she had her own orchestra and started to write her own songs. She was heavily aired on radio stations, both in Morocco and Algeria, and was extremely well known and loved by the public. Al Fassiya's Jewish identity was not considered to be problematic in Morocco during the height of her fame. In fact, the King of Morocco, Mohammed V, was so impressed by her voice that he invited her to sing at his court. Al Fassiya also worked with other artists such as Samy Elmaghribi, who wrote some of her songs. She released more than 17 albums between the years 1947-1957 . In 1962, following many fellow Mizrahi Jews who fled Arab countries due to mounting persecution following the establishment of the State of Israel, Al Fassiya immigrated to Israel. However, despite her superstar status in Morocco and North Africa, Al Fassiya's talent went unrecognized in Israel outside of the Moroccan immigrant community, as the state-run media and cultural institutions preferred to promote Western sounding music. As with many Mizrahi / Sephardi Jewish immigrants (Jews from Arab and Islamic countries), Al Fassiya faced discrimination in Israel, and she came to live in miserable and lonely conditions in Ashkelon. Despite this humiliating fate, Al Fassiya was often invited to sing at private celebrations (such as weddings) in the Moroccan community in Israel. Israeli-Moroccan poet Erez Biton, who visited her when he was employed as a social worker, was so moved by her fate that he dedicated a poem to her story; this poem has now been added to the national school curriculum in Israel, and serves as a centrepiece in discussion of the state's harsh Westernization policies in the 20th century. In her last years, Zohra Al Fassiya lived in a nursing home in Ashkelon. She died at age 89 in 1994 and was buried there.

It is Gram-negative and tryptophanase-positive, with type strain T(T) (= IAM 14863T). It is the type species of its genus. Symbiobacterium is related to the Gram-positive Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, but belongs to a lineage that is distinct from both.S. thermophilum has a bacillus shaped cell structure with no flagella.This bacterium is located throughout the environment in soils and fertilizers.  Cell Structure  Although Gram staining S. thermophilum shows a negative lab result, there are key Gram-negative membrane biosynthesis proteins that it lacks, such as LPS:glycosyltransferase and polysaccharide transporters. Instead, the cell structure of S. thermophilum includes proteins STH61, 969, 1321, 2197, 2492, and 3168 which are associated with the enveloped S-layer bacteria. The bacillus shape of S. thermophilum cells may be caused by the mreBCD (STH372-4) gene, located adjacent to the min locus. Although it has no flagella, the genome of S. thermophilum does include a flagella biosynthesis gene cluster. S. thermophilum is found to produce endospores in specific conditions. There is less research on the spore-like structure of S. thermophilum as it is the rarer form.  Genome Structure  Its genome has been sequenced, and has a size of 3.57 Mbp, with 3338 protein-coding genes. Characteristics of S. thermophilum such as the production of tryptophanase and Œ≤-tyrosinase, the cell surface structure, and a negative gram stain results indicate that the bacteria is Gram-negative. However, the sequence of 16S rRNA gene led to the complete phylogenic analysis of S. thermophilum, concluding it was in fact Gram-positive. High-G+C content (68.7%) along with its Gram stain results indicates that S. thermophilum belongs to the Actinomyces phylum, but the genome and proteins are more closely related to the Firmicutes, a Gram- positive phylum with low-G+C content. S. thermophilum further defies the knowledge that endospore forming genes are unique to the Bacillus-Clostridium group, showing genes involved in the formation of endospores. Sequencing of proteins proved biological roles in 2,082 of the 3,338 CDSs. The genome of S. thermophilum is not even partially alike other prokaryotic genomes sequenced at this point in time, as indicated by a CDS similarity matrix search.  Growth  S. thermophilum depends on other strains of Bacillus to grow, in a co-culture mechanism. This is known as microbial commensalism and often occurs in composts. S. thermophilum is one of many cultures that arise from compost derivatives. Under optimal conditions, the growth rate maximizes at 5x10^8 cells/mL.  Metabolism  S. thermophilum uses the non-oxidative branch of the pentose-phosphate glycolytic pathway for metabolism. Despite not using the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and lacking both cellulose-degrading and amylose- degrading enzymes, it has the genes and ability to metabolize glycerol, gluconate, cellobiose, N-acetylgalactosamine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. S. thermophilum contains genes for ferredoxin oxidoreductases, pyruvate, and 2-oxoacid. S. thermophilum lacks the genes for methionine and lysine biosynthesis but has the enzymes that are utilized to biosynthesize amino acids.  Respiration  The variety of respiratory enzymes possessed by S. thermophilum enables the bacterium to grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The ability to grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is indicated by the presence of both aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The presence of the Nap nitrate reductase gene cluster and Nar nitrate reductase suggest that S. thermophilum utilizes nitrate respiration.  Habitat  Due to the thermophilic nature of S. thermophilum, areas that are ideal for the survival of the bacteria would be ones that have increased temperatures and are nutrient dense. The habitats that are most suited for S. thermophilum would be in the intestinal tract of animals and also in composts. This is because both of those areas contain the essentials for the bacteria to survive.  Distribution and Diversity  S. thermophilum is a bacterium that is widely distributed throughout the environment. It can be found in many different types of soil and fertilizers that contain animal feces, as well as inside animal intestines, and in the feed that is given to the animals. To determine the distribution of S. thermophilum, tests were done to check for growth of the bacterium and whether or not the item being tested contained tryptophanase. In a study done at the Department of Applied Biological Sciences in Nihon University, Fujisawa, Japan, there was a random sample of Symbiobacterium that was cloned and it determined that out of the 31 samples taken, 16 of the cases showed that the sample had a more diverse genetic structure, where as the other 15 samples had less diverse genetics due to the results showing that the genetics were almost identical to S. thermophilum.

Mining in Taiwan was once a great industry, especially for sulfur, clay, gold and coal. Nowadays, Taiwan lacks natural resources for mining and relies on imports to meet its demand for minerals. The current mining industries in Taiwan are of small and medium size in terms of exploited minerals and the scale of mining, mainly focusing on marble and limestone for cement, stone and craft industries and sand and gravel for construction industries. Mining activities in Taiwan are regulated by the Bureau of Mines of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. History of mining Coal mining map in Keelung in 1856 Pre-colonization the indigenous people of Taiwan traded sulfur from deposits around volcanic vents to Chinese merchants visiting from the continent. Chinese mining and metallurgy followed the Hoklo, Hakka, and Han to Taiwan Island, particularly after the late Ming (16th & 17th centuries). Work was expanded under the Qing, but was limited by the occupation of the highlands by hostile native peoples. Under the consent of the Fujian officials, Yu Yonghe travelled to Taiwan following the explosion of the Fuzhou gunpowder stores in 1696 to mine sulfur. Yu's voyage began at the coast to Xiamen, crossing the Taiwan Strait and coming to a halt in Penghu before arriving in Tainan. Yu then journeyed northward to Tamsui and Beitou where he bought amorphous sulfur from local Aborigines for the making of pure sulfur. The expedition lasted ten months. This trip became the basis of one of the most important works about early Qing-era Taiwan, Small Sea Travel Diaries (Ë£®Êµ∑Á¥ÄÈÅä).http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2003/03/16/198332 As late as 1880, the only resources known to exist in economical quantities and locations were coal, sulphur, and petroleum, all in the volcanic northeastern third of the island. Mining was progressively developed by both the government and private sectors. After \\"Taiwan\\" (i.e. Tainan) and \\"Taashwi\\" (i.e. Tamsui) were opened to foreign commerce by the 1858 Treaties of Tianjin, foreign ships required those ports to maintain supplies of coal. This was provided from fields near Keelung and Tamsui, whose highly bituminous coal was fast-burning but nonetheless used by the warships of the Fuzhou Arsenal. The high demand led to rampant smuggling and theft, to the point where the Qing government temporarily banned the trade to rein in its ill effects. The Qing introduced modern coal mining to Taiwan in 1877, when they retained the British engineer Tyzack to open a shaft with modern machinery. Taiwan's heavy industry was developed by Japan both before and during the Second World War, but US bombingparticularly after the Taiwan Air Battle in October 1944 gave the Americans air supremacydevastated mining production. Although overall industry had declined only 33% from 1937 levels by the war's end, coal production had fallen from to , lower than the amount produced in the mid-1870s. Economy As of 2013, mineral products accounted for 10% of Taiwan export value. The sector also employs 2,758 workforce. Types of mining =Aluminium= Taiwan consumed about 180,000 tonnes of aluminium alloy in 2013, in which it went to the electronics sector (41%), packing (26%), construction (9%), machinery (8%) and others (16%). The CS Aluminium Corp., subsidiary of China Steel Corporation, produced 167,000 tonnes of aluminium in 2010. =Cement= Cement plant in Hualien County. Around 80% of Taiwan's cement are mined and produced in Eastern Taiwan. In 2013, the output capacity was 26 million tonnes per year. In that year, Taiwan produced 16 Mt of cement and consumed 12 Mt. Cement are exported to Ghana, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mauritius and Australia. Cement mining in Taiwan is mostly done by Taiwan Cement or Asia Cement Corporation in which its plant in Hualien County contributes to nearly 29% of Taiwan's cement production. Zuoying, Kaohsiung. Limestone mining was done in Zuoying District, Kaohsiung in an area what used to be a part of Mount Banping. In 1997, the mining activities ceased to operate. The abandoned site has now been turned into the Banping Lake Wetland Park for tourism by the Kaohsiung City Government. =Coal= Coal is distributed mainly in northern Taiwan. All of the commercial coal deposits occurred in three Miocene coal- bearing formations, which are the Upper, the Middle and the Lower Coal Measures. The Middle Coal Measures was the most important with its wide distribution, great number of coal beds and extensive potential reserves. Taiwan has coal reserves estimated to be 100-180 Mt. However, coal output had been small, amounting to 6,948 metric tonnes per month from 4 pits before it ceased production effectively in 2000. The abandoned coal mine in Pingxi District, New Taipei has now been turned into the Taiwan Coal Mine Museum, while the one in Houtong has been turned into Houtong Cat Village. =Copper= Abandoned mine facility in Jinguashi, Ruifang, New Taipei. Copper mining, as well as gold, used to take place in Jinguashi town in Ruifang District, New Taipei. In 1904, arsenic-copper sulfate mineral enargite was found at the No. 3 Mine in the area when miners dug deeper, increasing the amount of copper minerals discovered. From that moment, the focus of the mining in the area shifted from gold and silver to gold, silver and copper. After the liberation of Taiwan in 1945, the state-run Taiwan Gold and Copper Mining Bureau was established in 1946 and renamed to Taiwan Metals Mining Company in 1955. As copper production gradually increased over the years, Jinguashi mining area maintained excellent operating performance. However, after 1973, the gold and copper output began to decline. In order to increase the production, the company started large-scale open-pit mining in 1978 and shifted its focus to mineral refining and processing. To boost their mineral processing capabilities, the company took out bank loans in 1981 to build the Lile Copper Refinery in the area located at the Golden Waterfall today. Because of a collapse in the world copper price few years later, the company was unable to repay its loans and went out of business in 1987. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation assumed ownership of the land in Jinguashi and the mining in that area came to an end. =Gold= Taiwan has four gold-bearing deposits with metal content estimated at 100 tonnes. Three of the deposits are concentrated in the central mountain range, while the fourth one is at Pingfeng Mountain in the north. Jinguashi Mine is one of the biggest gold deposit, located in Ruifang District, New Taipei. The Gold Ecological Park was established within the area which houses the Gold Museum. Quartz was often found at the same rate as gold. =Oil and gas= Gongguan, Miaoli County. CPC oil refinery in Guishan District, Taoyuan City. Oil was firstly discovered in Taiwan in Gongguan Township, Miaoli County at the Chuhuangkeng oilfield. Oil has been drilled since the Qing Dynasty rule of Taiwan in 1877. It was then done by the more advanced development stage by the Japanese when they drilled around 98 oil wells. The original site of the first oil well in Taiwan has now turned into the Taiwan Oil Field Exhibition Hall. Oil exploration in Taiwan is controlled by the CPC Corporation. Deep drilling in Taiwan began in 1959 when the CPC drilled to a depth up to 4,063 meters which they brought out more than 110,000 m3 of natural gas and 10,000 liters condensate daily. Offshore drilling began in 1973 when their rig went down 3,661 meters under the ocean off the coast of Hsinchu County with no result. In January 2013, Taiwan had 2 million barrels of proven oil reserves. In 2012, Taiwan produced 22,000 barrels/day of oil. In 2007, the capacity of Taiwan oil refinery was 1,197,000 barrels/day due to its large refinery sectors. In 2012, Taiwan planned to explore oil offshore of Taiping Island in Cijin District, Kaohsiung City. Taiwan produces a small amount of natural gas. Gas exploration in Taiwan is also controlled by the CPC Corporation. It also cooperates with China National Offshore Oil Corporation in exploring natural gas in the Taiwan Strait. In 2004, natural reserved was discovered in Guantian Township, Tainan County. In July 2010, the CPC discovered natural gas reserves in Gongguan Township, Miaoli County which was estimated to have a production capacity of at least 1 billion m3. In March 2013, Taiwanese oceanic research team discovered gas hydrate deposits in water south of Pratas Islands, Kaohsiung City in the South China Sea through reflection seismology and sub-bottom profiling data. Energy usage In 2014, mining sector consumed a total of 474.4 GWh of electricity.

Definition Suppose that G is an algebraic group defined over a field K, and choose a separably closed field containing K. For a finite extension L of K in let ŒìL be the absolute Galois group of L. The first cohomology H1(L, G) = H1(ŒìL, G) is a set classifying the forms of G over L, and is a functor of L. A cohomological invariant of G of dimension d taking values in a ŒìK-module M is a natural transformation of functors (of L) from H1(L, G) to Hd(L, M). In other words a cohomological invariant associates an element of an abelian cohomology group to elements of a non-abelian cohomology set. More generally, if A is any functor from finitely generated extensions of a field to sets, then a cohomological invariant of A of dimension d taking values in a Œì-module M is a natural transformation of functors (of L) from A to Hd(L, M). The cohomological invariants of a fixed group G or functor A, dimension d and Galois module M form an abelian group denoted by Invd(G,M) or Invd(A,M). Examples *Suppose A is the functor taking a field to the isomorphism classes of dimension n etale algebras over it. The cohomological invariants with coefficients in Z/2Z is a free module over the cohomology of k with a basis of elements of degrees 0, 1, 2, ..., m where m is the integer part of n/2. *The Hasse‚àíWitt invariant of a quadratic form is essentially a dimension 2 cohomological invariant of the corresponding spin group taking values in a group of order 2. *If G is a quotient of a group by a smooth finite central subgroup C, then the boundary map of the corresponding exact sequence gives a dimension 2 cohomological invariant with values in C. If G is a special orthogonal group and the cover is the spin group then the corresponding invariant is essentially the Hasse‚àíWitt invariant. *If G is the orthogonal group of a quadratic form in characteristic not 2, then there are Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes for each positive dimension which are cohomological invariants with values in Z/2Z. (These are not the topological Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes of a real vector bundle, but are the analogues of them for vector bundles over a scheme.)

Modifications of the normal set-up can push these limits to even higher pressures and temperatures. A particular type of piston-cylinder, called Griggs apparatus, is also able to add a deviatoric stress on the sample. The principle of the instrument is to generate pressure by compressing a sample assembly, which includes a resistance furnace, inside a pressure vessel. Controlled high temperature is generated by applying a regulated voltage to the furnace and monitoring the temperature with a thermocouple. The pressure vessel is a cylinder that is closed at one end by a rigid plate with a small hole for the thermocouple to pass through. A piston is advanced into the cylinder at the other hand.Dunn T. (1993) ‚Äì The piston-cylinder apparatus. In: Luth R. W. (Ed.) Experiments at High Pressure and Applications to the Earth‚Äôs Mantle, MAC Short Course Handbook, Vol. 21, Mineralogical Association of Canada, pp. 39-94. Non endloaded piston cylinder apparatus (2016)  History  Sir Charles Parsons was the first to attack the problem of generating high pressure simultaneously with high temperature.Parsons C. A., Proc. Roy. Soc. (London), 44, 320 (1880); Trans. Roy. Soc. (London), A220, 67 (1920). Also see anon. report on Richard Threlfall's discourse at the Royal Institution, Engineering, 87, 425 (1909). His pressure apparatus consisted of piston-cylinder devices that used internal electrical resistance heating. He used a solid pressure transmitting material, which also served as thermal and electrical insulation. His cylindrical chambers ranged in diameter from 1 to 15 cm. The maximum pressure at the temperature he reported was of the order of 15000 atm (corresponding to ~1.5 GPa) at 3000 ¬∞C. Loring L. Coes, Jr., of the Norton Co., was the first person to develop a piston-cylinder device with capabilities substantially beyond those of the Parsons device. He did not personally publish a description of this equipment until 1962.Coes L. L., Jr. (1962) - Synthesis of Minerals at High Pressures. Modern Very High Pressure Techniques, Wentorf R. J., Jr., Butterworth Ed., London, p. 137. The key feature of this device is the use of a hot, molded alumina liner or cylinder. The apparatus is double ended, pressure being generated by pushing a tungsten carbide piston into each end of the alumina cylinder. Because the alumina cylinder is electrically insulating, heating is accomplished, very simply, by passing an electric current from one piston through a sample heating tube and out through the opposite piston. The apparatus was used at pressures as high as 45000 atm (corresponding to ~4.5 GPa) simultaneously with a temperature of 800 ¬∞C. Temperature was measured by means of a thermocouple located in a well. At these temperature and pressure conditions, only one run is obtained in this device, the pistons and the alumina cylinder both being expendable. Even at 30000 atm (corresponding to ~3.0 GPa) the alumina cylinder is only useful for a few runs, as is also the case for the tungsten carbide pistons. The expense of using such a device is great. Nowadays both the piston and the cylinder are constructed of cemented tungsten carbide and electrical insulation is provided in a different manner than in the device of Coes. In particular, the basis for the modern piston-cylinder apparatus is given by the design described by Boyd and England in 1960,Boyd F. R. and England J. L. (1960) - Apparatus for Phase-Equilibrium Measurements at Pressures up to 50 Kilobars and Temperatures up to 1750¬∞C. Journal of Geophysical Research, 65, 2, 741-748. which has been the first machine that allowed experiments under upper mantle conditions to be routinely carried out in a laboratory.  Theory  The piston-cylinder apparatus is based on the same simple relationship of other high-pressure devices (e.g. Multi-anvil press and Diamond Anvil Cell): P = \\\\frac{F}{A} where P is the pressure, F the applied force and A the area. It achieves high pressures using the principle of pressure amplification: converting a small load on a large piston to a relatively large load on a small piston. The uniaxial pressure is then distributed (quasi- hydrostatically) over the sample through deformation of the assembly materials.  Components  The main components of the piston-cylinder apparatus are the pressure generating system, the pressure vessel, and the assembly parts within the vessel. There are two types of piston-cylinder apparatus: non end-loaded and end-loaded, which involve, respectively, one or two hydraulic rams. In the end-loaded type the second hydraulic ram is used to vertically load and strengthen the pressure vessel. The non end-loaded type is smaller, more compact and cheaper, and is operable only to approximately 4 GPa. Pressure is applied to the sample by pressing a piston into the sample volume of the pressure vessel. The sample assembly consists of a solid pressure medium, a resistance heater and a small central volume for the sample. Three common configurations are used: \\\\tfrac{1}{2}‚Äù, \\\\tfrac{3}{4}‚Äù and 1‚Äù, which are the diameters of the piston and thus the sample assembly. According to the pressure amplification concept, the choice of the piston depends on the pressure you need to achieve. During the experiment, water circulates around the pressure vessel, the bridge and the upper plates to cool the system. = Sample assemblies = The purposes of the sample assembly are to transmit hydrostatic pressure to the sample from the compressing piston, to provide controlled heating of the sample and to provide, via the capsule, a suitable volatile and oxygen fugacity environment for the experiment. Therefore, it includes a component for each of these purposes. The outer cylinder is a pressure transmitting, electrically insulating cylinder made from NaCl, talc, BaCO3, KBr, CaF2, or even borosilicate glass. The next components are, in order, an electrically insulating borosilicate glass cylinder and a graphite cylinder, which acts as the ‚Äúfurnace‚Äù. To locate the sample exactly in the centre of the furnace and to grip the thermocouple, a support rod usually made of crushable ceramics is used. The final component is a conductive steel base plug, located at the top of the sample assembly. The final part of the assembly is the thermocouple itself, whose wires are insulated from one another and from the material of the assembly by a tube made of mullite. = Capsules = The sample capsule must contain the sample and prevent reaction between the sample and the other materials of the sample assembly and not, itself, react with the sample. It must also be weak so as not to interfere with pressure transmission during the run. For this purpose the materials most used are: Au, Pt, AgPd alloys, Ni and graphite. Sample volumes are typically 200 mm3, which translates to ~500 mg of starting material, but with larger assemblies the volume can be up to 750 mm3.  Pressure control  The nominal pressure in an experiment can be calculated from the amplification of the oil pressure through the reduction in area over which it is applied, but every component has a characteristic yield stress, consequently the nominal pressure is different from the effective one. Thus, it must be adjusted taking into account the friction: Peffective = Pnominal \\\\+ Pcorrection In order to determine the effective pressure, calibration experiments can be done using either static or dynamic methods, and usually make use of known phase transitions or reactions, melting curves or measured water solubility in melts. Since frictional effects also depend on whether the press is in compression or in decompression, it is good practice to perform the experiments in the same way as the calibration runs.  Temperature control  Temperature can be measured using a thermocouple within an accuracy of ¬± 1 ¬∞C. The accuracy of the temperature is influenced by both random and systematic errors, and is smaller at higher temperature and pressure conditions. Such errors can arise from temperature gradients, differential pressures in the assembly, contamination during the experiment and the effect of pressure on thermocouple electromotive force. These errors can be cushioned choosing the appropriate thermocouple type for the experimental conditions. Temperature gradients, on the other hand, can be minimised using a tapered furnace.  Applications  The main advantages of the piston-cylinder press are the relatively large volume of the assembly, fast heating and quenching rates, and the stability of the equipment over long run durations. These aspects, together with the ease and safety of procedure make this device suitable for geochemical studies and in-situ measurements of the physical properties of materials. Some applications, especially in Geosciences, are: synthesis of high-pressure and temperature materials, hot pressing and investigation of partial melting of rocks.

The floor plan is that of \\"dog trot\\" design, being that doors and windows were positioned directly across from each other on all sides of the house. This allowed for natural air flow to cool house in the hot Arkansas summers. Transoms were placed above each interior door, as found in larger buildings of the time, to allow hot air to rise and be moved through rooms and up to second floor, where the hot air would be sucked out in a natural ventilation process. Ornate hand carved wood art, extensive floor, door and window moldings, as well as impressive plaster work was incorporated into the design.

He was also appointed as a Surrey commissioner for loyal and indigent officers in 1662 and to the commission on recusants in 1675. His cousin John Evelyn described him in 1685 as \\"an honest gentleman, much in favour with his Majesty\\", and marks of the royal favour were apparent: Edward was knighted at Worcester Park, Surrey, on 13 September 1676, created a baronet on 13 February 1683 and made a deputy lieutenant of the county in the same year. In 1685, Evelyn stood for Parliament for Surrey with Sir Adam Browne as a Court or Tory candidate, against the Whig incumbents, his cousin George Evelyn and Arthur Onslow.

An afternoon storm forced many of the Whig electors to take shelter in the surrounding countryside, due to the lack of accommodations in the village, expecting the election to be held the next morning. When they were gone, the Sheriff suddenly called for a poll and returned Sir Edward and Sir Adam. During this year, Evelyn was also named an alderman of Kingston-on- Thames, which had surrendered its old charter and was granted a new one in August. Sir Edward served on four minor committees during the Loyal Parliament. He probably fell out with James II over religious policy, as he was removed from the Kingston corporation, the commission of the peace, and his deputy lieutenancy in the spring of 1688. In October 1688, on the eve of the Glorious Revolution, he was restored to his deputy lieutenancy, but quickly accepted the new regime. Under William and Mary, he was reappointed to the commission of the peace in November 1688 and the commission for assessment in the same year, and was further honoured with an appointment as a gentleman of the privy chamber. Though restored to most of his offices, he did not stand for Parliament again. Death Evelyn died suddenly on 3 May 1692 and was buried at Long Ditton. He left his lands and manors to his wife for life, to be divided after her death among his surviving daughters: the manors of Long Ditton to Penelope, Talworth to Mary, and Claygate to Sophia.

Service under Meng Zhixiang  It is not known when Zhang Gongduo was born, but it is known that he was from Taiyuan. He was said to have studied literature and history in his youth. At some point, he became a follower of the Later Tang general Meng Zhixiang, then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and when Meng built up his military strength (in anticipation of a potential confrontation with the Later Tang imperial government) by recruiting and establishing a number of army corps, Zhang was put in command of the Yisheng (Áæ©Âãù) and the Dingyuan (ÂÆöÈÅ†) corps.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 51. As of 932, Meng was in conflict with his erstwhile ally Dong Zhang the military governor of neighboring Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), after the two, who had jointly rebelled against the imperial government earlier, should enter into some rapprochement with the imperial government ‚Äî given that An Chonghui, the powerful chief of staff (Shumishi) to then- reigning emperor Li Siyuan, who had previously been advocates of the imperial campaign against the two of them, had been executed by Li. Meng wanted to at least formally resubmit to the imperial government, but Dong refused, as his son Dong Guangye (Ëë£ÂÖâÊ•≠) and Dong Guangye's family, had been executed by the imperial government. Dong, indeed, decided to launch a campaign against Xichuan to conquer it. The two armies, commanded by their respective military governors, encountered each other at Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). Zhang's Yisheng and Dingyuan corps were stationed as rearguards in the Xichuan formation. Dong, who was a fierce warrior, was initially winning the battle, killing Meng's subordinates Mao Chongwei (ÊØõÈáçÂ®Å) and Li Tang (ÊùéÁë≠). Meng, in fear, pointed at the rearguards ‚Äî apparently intending to signal retreat. Believing that he was ordered to engage, Zhang led the Yisheng and the Dingyuan corps into battle with a loud shout, crushing the Dongchuan troops, killing several thousands, and capturing Dong's officers Yuan Gui (ÂÖÉÁìå) and Dong Guangyan (Ëë£ÂÖâÊºî, apparently also a son of Dong Zhang's). The Dongchuan troops collapsed, causing Dong to panic and flee back to Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (Ê¢ìÂ∑û), where he was subsequently killed in a mutiny, with the mutineers then surrendering to Meng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. For Zhang's accomplishments, he was given the command of the more prestigious Pengsheng (ÊçßËÅñ) and Konghe (ÊéßÈ∂¥) corps.  Service under Meng Chang  In 934 (by which time Li Siyuan's son Li Conghou was Later Tang's emperor), Meng Zhixiang declared himself the emperor of a new state of Later Shu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. He became deathly ill not soon after, however, and he, after entrusting his young son Meng Renzan (soon renamed Meng Chang) to Zhang Gongduo and a few other high-level officials and generals ‚Äî the chancellor Zhao Jiliang and the generals Li Renhan, Zhao Tingyin, Wang Chuhui, and Hou Hongshi (‰æØÂºòÂØ¶) ‚Äî died. Meng Chang succeeded him as emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Meng Chang conferred on Zhang the honorary title of acting Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â). In the aftermaths of Meng Chang's succession, Li Renhan became very arrogant and insisted on being put in command of the imperial guards. Meng Chang initially agreed. However, Zhang, as well as Meng Chang's close associates Han Jixun (ÈüìÁπºÂã≥), Han Baozhen (Èüì‰øùË≤û), and An Siqian (ÂÆâÊÄùÈÅ∑), all secretly accused Li of plotting treason. Meng Chang thereafter had Han Jixun consult Zhao Jiliang and Zhao Tingyin and, apparently after receiving their blessing, arrested and killed Li. Not long after, he received the title of military governor of Baoning Circuit (‰øùÂØß, headquartered in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), as well the chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). (Whether his chancellor designation was fully functional or honorary at this point is unclear, as Tang had a tradition of bestowing chancellor designations on military governors as honorary titles, although it must have subsequently become functional, even if not at this point, based on subsequent events.) It was said that he governed with integrity and sternness, and the people benefitted from his governance. In 941, as part of Meng Chang's reforms to end the practice of having high-level officials and generals hold office at the imperial government at the capital Chengdu but continuing to serve also as military governors ‚Äì as the end result was that they were not attentive to their circuits, and their staff members would effectively rule the circuit and mismanage them ‚Äì several high-level officials/generals who were doing so, including Zhang, were given some additional honors but stripped of their military governorships.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. (For reasons unclear, in 944, Meng reversed his reform and again had high-level officials/generals assume military governorships, although it was not stated whether Zhang received the military governorship of Baoning, or any other circuit, at that time.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Zhang died in 945.

Early life and education Born on June 26, 1969, to secular Ashkenazi Jewish parents in Los Angeles, California, Zuckerman grew up in Pacific Palisades and studied at Santa Monica College. He transferred to the University of Oregon in Eugene, and there earned a Bachelor of Arts (1992), Master of Arts (1995), and Doctor of Philosophy (1998), all in sociology. Career Zuckerman is a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, California. He is also an affiliated adjunct professor at Claremont Graduate University. He was a guest professor at Aarhus University in Denmark in 2006 and 2010. He serves as the special series editor of the Secular Studies book series published by NYU Press. He is on the board of directors of Brighter Brains, which builds and supports orphanages, schools, and clinics in Uganda. His research interests are secularity, atheism, apostasy, and Scandinavian culture. =Published work= Phil Zuckerman's analysis finds differing levels of atheists and agnostics in countries around the worldAtheism: Contemporary Rates and Patterns, in: Michael Martin (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Atheism. Cambridge University Press 2007 Phil Zuckerman is the author of six books, including The Nonreligious, co-authored with Luke Galen and Frank Pasquale; Living the Secular Life; Faith No More; Society without God; Invitation to the Sociology of Religion; and Strife in the Sanctuary. His works have been translated into six languages, including Persian, Korean and Turkish. Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book Society without God notes that Denmark and Sweden, \\"probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world\\", enjoy \\"among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world\\". Zuckerman's work is based on his studies conducted during a 14-month period in Scandinavia in 2005‚Äì2006. Zuckerman identifies that Scandinavians have \\"relatively high rates of petty crime and burglary\\", but \\"their overall rates of violent crime‚Äîsuch as murder, aggravated assault, and rape‚Äîare among the lowest on earth\\".(Zuckerman 2008, pp. 5‚Äì6) In 2009, New York Times columnist Peter Steinfels commented that Society Without God provides evidence that an irreligious society can flourish. Society Without God won a ‚ÄúBook of the Year Silver Award‚Äù by Foreword Magazine in 2008 and was featured in The New York Times in an article by Peter Steinfel. Zuckerman's Living the Secular Life: New Answers to Old Questions was released in 2014 and reviewed in The New York Times by Susan Jacoby. Living the Secular Life was designated a \\"Best Book of 2014\\" by Publishers Weekly and was featured in a commentary by New York Times columnist David Brooks. The American Humanist Association has featured Zuckerman as a speaker on rising irreligion in the United States. Zuckerman is on the editorial board of Secularism and Nonreligion and is a convener of the Non- religion and Secularity Research Network conference. =Public commentary= Zuckerman has said that 20 percent of the United States are irreligious and 30 percent of citizens under 30 are. Zuckerman has commented that religion is often conflated with patriotism in the United States. He has stated that while \\"he applauds the passion and purpose\\" of American Atheists, they are a minority, as the majority of atheists in America \\"are not angry, do not hate religion and do not need a forum to vent\\". Zuckerman has found that murder rates in Scandinavian countries lowered after abolishing the death penalty, and has opposed the use in the United States. Zuckerman has found that the religiously unaffiliated tend to be more inclined to progressive politics, and the decline in Protestant Christianity in America is a blow to conservative causes. Zuckerman has commented on the rise of secular Judaism. Zuckerman commented that growing atheist movements in the United States were a response to the impact of the Christian right. =Secular studies program= In 2011 he founded and currently chairs the first secular studies program. When the secular studies program was announced, the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture at Trinity College noted it was the first program to offer a degree in secular studies. The program lets students major in secular studies, including in a core course \\"Sociology of Secularity\\". The first student to graduate from Pitzer College with a degree in secular studies was the first student in the United States with such a major.

Martin et al. (2014) named the clade after finding goniopholidids and pholidosaurids to group together in their phylogenetic analysis of crocodyliform evolutionary relationships. In their analysis, Pholidosauridae was monophyletic and Goniopholididae was paraphyletic, being an assemblage of successively more basal taxa within Coelognathosuchia. Coelognathosuchia itself was positioned near the base of the larger clade Neosuchia as the sister group to a clade containing the Early Cretaceous neosuchian Bernissartia and Eusuchia, the group that includes all modern crocodilians and their closest extinct relatives. Martin et al. named Coelognathosuchia from the Greek (, \\"concave\\"), (, \\"jaw\\") and (, \\"crocodile\\"), after a small depression on the surface of the skull between the maxilla and jugal bones in both goniopholidids and pholidosaurs. Other diagnostic features of Coelognathosuchia include orbits (eye sockets) that are narrower than the frontal bone that separates them and smaller than the supratemporal fenestrae (two holes at the back of the skull roof) behind them, a notch between the premaxilla and maxilla at the tip of the snout, and the reduction or absence of the antorbital fenestrae (a pair of holes in the snout in front of each orbit). A close relationship between Goniopholididae and Pholidosauridae conflicts with the hypothesis that pholidosaurids are instead more closely related to the family Dyrosauridae. This alternate phylogeny was found in many analyses, including Jouve et al. (2006), Pol and Gasparini (2009), and de Andrade et al. (2011), who named the clade Tethysuchia. In both studies, Goniopholididae was found to be a more distantly related clade within Neosuchia. In their description of Pholidosaurus specimens from southwestern France, Martin and colleagues reiterated their opinion that Dyrosauridae is not as closely related to Pholidosauridae as stated by previous authors by pointing to numerous shared characters between the Cherves-de-Cognac pholidosaurid remains and Goniopholididae.

In 1979, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Berman an MBE for Services to Community Education and Community Arts, examples of which include City Farms, Instant Business Enterprise System, the Inter-Action Creative Game Method, Fun Art Bus I & II, the Community Media Van, FabLab on Wheels, the Father and Mother Xmas Union and Inter-Action; the umbrella organization for a range of innovative, creativity-based projects and community training systems. Later Berman saved the World War I ship, HMS President (1918) which became the charity's centre for fifteen years. He became founding chair (2014) of Rhodes Scholars in Britain and a trustee. In 2015 he was invited by MIT's Bits and Atoms to establish Fab Foundation UK. A Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar in 1962, Berman is Inter-Action's founder (1968) and CEO. Currently, in addition to the activities above, Berman runs international workshops and training courses in the Inter-Action Creative Game Method and Inter-Action Instant Business Enterprise System.  Early life and education  Berman was born in Lewiston, Maine, on 8 March 1941 to Jack and Ida (n√©e Webber) Berman. He attended Lewiston High School but despite becoming a regional and national debating champion, did not graduate. Instead he accepted the offer of a place at Harvard University at the age of 15, to study Government & Middle Eastern Languages and Literature. He was a resident at Winthrop House and graduated in the Class of 1961. He then won a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Exeter College, Oxford University in 1962.[1] Berman was unable to finish his doctorate at Oxford in 1965, due to an unprovoked attack whilst researching in Istanbul, Turkey, which left him with a cranial blood clot, a badly damaged back and given a year to live. Unable to continue his research, Berman moved to London.  Inter-Action and community action/development  Berman established Inter-Action in London in 1968 to explore new forms of creative and participatory programmes for the Inner City, and find new ways to motivate learning. The work is targeted at disadvantaged families and young people (especially young girls and young women in science and technology), children with learning disabilities and people returning to education or seeking training. It has been described as \\"the most exciting community education agency in Europe\\". Essentially, Inter-Action is involved in problem-solving work of a community development nature. It takes specific challenges and tries to develop practical projects and techniques which can be widely disseminated and used by others throughout the UK and Europe. The work with disadvantaged groups of young people (and adults) and especially girls/young women has been a major theme throughout the decades of the work of Inter-Action and now Fab Foundation UK. Inter-Action Trust (later Inter-Action Social Enterprise Trust) has been the umbrella for Berman's activities, including a series of theatres, at least six theatre companies, community festivals and seasons of plays, making print and radio media accessible to local communities, establishing the first City Farm, the National Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens (see below), the first community architecture service in Europe and numerous other projects. Inter-Action commissioned the first community arts resource centre in Europe which was purpose-built on a derelict Council site in Talacre Road, West Kentish Town, London, designed by Cedric Price. Inter-Action has influenced the work of numerous other community arts initiatives as well as direct offshoots in Milton Keynes and Leeds. The Father & Mother Xmas Union (FXU) was set up in 1969 to stage large-scale social and activist events such as protests against the National Front and Selfridges (for using red-leg labour). City Farms: In 1971, Berman negotiated with British Rail to take over numerous tracts (10,000 acres) of land throughout the UK which were unusable for development under modern planning legislation because of their proximity to the railway lines. He established the first City Farm in Britain in Kentish Town, north London, in 1971 (which became a model for City Farms across the country) and then the National Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens which currently includes approx. 1,200 City Farms and Community Gardens throughout the UK. Fun Art Bus: In 1972, to bring theatre and arts into the community, Inter-Action converted a Routemaster bus to create a small theatre on its upper deck, along with a cinema showing short films and slide shows downstairs. The bus was brought back during the 2012 Olympic Games in which Berman was a torchbearer. HMS President: In 1988 the ship was saved by the charity Inter-Action Social Enterprise Trust, run by Berman, who invented the term ‚Äúsocial enterprise‚Äù in the UK in 1970, to describe organisations such as the National Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens, which has more than 1,200 sites. In President social enterprises included: a base for start- up companies for young people; audio-visual studios; a publishing company; an NGO Advisory Service, and an 'event deck' to earn funding for the charity. This period saved her from scrap, and preserved her for future generations. She had become a London landmark, marked on street maps, so was permitted to retain her warship title and name \\"HMS President\\" with the added suffix \\"(1918)\\" to distinguish her from the new shore establishment of the same name. Her sister ship, Chrysanthemum was hired to Steven Spielberg for the boat chase sequences shot in 1988 in Tilbury Docks for the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. She was then laid up in the River Medway, where the brackish water rusted her hull so badly that she was scrapped in 1995. Numerous other activities including the establishment of WAC ‚Äì the Weekend Arts College (now simply Wac Arts), the first Community Media Van, a community print shop including the publishing arm, Inter-Action In-Print, a film company, Infilms, a new centre on HMS President (1918), a free school and a plethora of media and computer projects from the 1980s onward; then two more theatre companies: the Old Age Theatre Society (OATS) working in old people's homes and the British American Repertory Company (BARC), the first joint company approved by both Equity Unions and both countries for non-star actors and stage staff. Additionally, he has been Chairman of the successful Save Piccadilly Campaign in the 1970s (to stop the high-rise office development surrounding the Circus) and the action against JP Morgan to open their blocking of a walkway/cycling path of the Thames Walkway on the Isle of Dogs. He continues to spend part of each year in India, advising on social enterprise projects, mainly with women, and environmental projects, especially water developments. He has worked in Hong Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Russia, South Africa and India as a director/trainer as well as advising on developing new social enterprises. In Russia he worked as an adviser to three state ministers and in the UK as a non-party-political Special Advisor on inner city matters to Cabinet ministers, Michael Heseltine and Tom King. All of these he did whilst remaining in the Inter-Action Co-operative.  Theatre career  During the 1960s, Berman became a prominent figure in British Alternative Theatre. In 1967, he became the playwright-in-residence at the Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill. ;The Ambiance Lunch-hour Theatre Club and the Almost-Free Theatre: In 1971 Berman set up the Almost Free Theatre on Rupert Street, Soho in the West End. The audiences paid what they could afford (at least one penny) to see a range of productions based on a range of social and political themes. The Almost Free also staged numerous individual new plays by Mike Stott, Henry Livings, Michael Stevens, Wolf Mankowitz, Edward Bond and many others. Sir Tom Stoppard developed several of his key one act plays for Berman's theatres including After Magritte, Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth and the highly successful Dirty Linen and New-Found-Land. ;Dirty Linen and New-found-land: A pair of two 1976 Tom Stoppard plays that are always performed together, produced and directed by Berman. New-Found-Land interrupts the two parts of Dirty Linen. It is a comedy about the British citizenship process, based on the real-life naturalization of Berman. It was first performed as an Ambiance Lunch-Hour Theatre Club presentation at Interaction's Almost Free Theatre in 1976. Then, opening in June 1976, it played for more than four years at the Arts. ;Black Theatre Season: Berman programmed Britain's first season of plays on black issues: Black and White Power Plays at the Ambiance in 1970. The season introduced the work of African-American playwrights like Ed Bullins and LeRoi Jones, alongside work from white playwrights on Black issues such as Israel Horovitz. ;Gay Theatre Season: The 1975 season of gay plays was the first to be staged in Britain. The season led to the formation of gay theatre companies, principally Gay Sweatshop, Britain's first gay and lesbian theatre company, founded by Gerald Chapman. ;Dogg's Troupe: Dogg's Troupe staged street theatre and community events in hospitals, old people's homes and other community venues. Berman played the roles of Professor R.L. Dogg and Otto Premiere Check. ;TOC (The Other Company): The Other Company was set up by Berman and the innovative Israeli director Naftali Yavin in 1968.

The catheter was developed to make rectal access more practical and provide a way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum so that health practitioners can leverage the established benefits of rectal administration. Patients often need medication when the oral route is compromised, and the Macy Catheter provides an alternative for those medications that can be prescribed per rectum. The Macy Catheter is of particular relevance during the end of life, when it can help patients to remain comfortable in their home. Fancher L. \\"Hospice nurse invention to help alleviate discomfort of taking medication.\\" Contra Costa Times. July 16, 2014. Key features and functions The Macy Catheter is a disposable device approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), consisting of a dual-porl-lumen ballooned tube that is inserted by a clinician into the rectum just past the rectal sphincter. Once inserted into the rectum, a soft balloon is inflated with water via a balloon inflation valve to hold the device in place. This small, flexible \\"semi- retention\\" balloon exerts very little pressure on the rectal wall, and is designed for safety and comfort, while also allowing the catheter to be easily expelled when the patient needs to defecate. The catheter utilizes a small flexible silicone shaft, allowing the device to be placed safely and remain comfortably in the rectum for repeated administration of medications or liquids. Once in place, the medication delivery port of the Macy Catheter rests on the patient's leg or abdomen, where it is easily accessible for repeated administration of liquid medications in solution or suspension form. The device stays in place until the patient has a bowel movement and expels the retention balloon, or until manually removed after first deflating the balloon. The Macy Catheter medication port has a specialized valve to prevent leakage and is designed to be non-clogging and compatible only with the connectors on oral/enteral syringes (not luer syringes) for safety. The device is FDA-approved to remain in the rectum for up to 28 days. The catheter has a small lumen, allowing for small flush volumes to get medication to the rectum. Small volumes of medications (under 15ml) improve comfort by not stimulating the defecation response of the rectum, and can increase the overall absorption of a given dose by decreasing pooling of medication and migration of medication into more proximal areas of the rectum where absorption can be less effective.De Boer AG, Moolenaar F, de Leede LG, Breimer DD. (1982) \\"Rectal drug administration: clinical pharmacokinetic considerations.\\" Clin Pharmacokinetics. 7(4):285-311Moolenaar F, Koning B, Huizinga T. (1979) \\"Biopharmaceutics of rectal administration of drugs in man. Absorption rate and bioavailability of phenobarbital and its sodium salt from rectal dosage forms.\\" International Journal of Pharmacaceutics, 4:99-109 Indications for use The Macy Catheter is intended to provide rectal access to administer liquids and medications. The Macy Catheter can be used in the following clinical situations: # Medication administration when the oral route fails \\"A Quality Improvement Study: Use of a Rectal Medication Administration Device Intervention to manage end-stage symptoms in hospice patients when the oral route fails.\\" Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association 2012 Poster Presentation. # Administration of fluids and electrolytesGirisgin AS, Acar F, Cander B, Gul M, Kocak S, Bodur S.

Common clinical use scenarios The Macy Catheter provides an immediate way to administer medication or liquids for patients in the home setting when the oral route of medication administration is compromised. Unlike intravenous lines, which usually need to be placed in an inpatient environment and require special formulation of sterile medications,Plumer AL. 2007. Plumer's Principles and Practices of Intravenous Therapy. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. 753 pp. the Macy Catheter can be placed by a clinician, such as a hospice nurse or home health nurse in the home. Many oral forms of medications can be crushed and suspended in water to be given via the Macy Catheter. The Macy Catheter is useful for patients who cannot swallow, including those near the end of life (an estimated 1.65 million people are in hospice care in the US each year\\"National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization's Facts and Figures: Hospice Care in America, 2013 Edition\\" ). Because the Macy Catheter enables a rapid, safe, and lower cost alternative to administration of medications, A Quality Improvement Study: Use of a Rectal Medication Administration Device Intervention to manage end-stage symptoms in hospice patients when the oral route fails. Poster Presentations. 6th Annual Hospice Palliative Nurses Association Clinical Practice Forum, Pittsburgh, PA, September 15-15, 2012. it may also be applicable to care of patients in long-term care or palliative care, or as an alternative to intravenous or subcutaneous medication delivery in some instances. The Macy Catheter is clinically indicated for the following scenarios: 1\\\\. Symptom management at the end of life,Matzo M, Sherman DW, eds. 2014.

Bowel obstruction * For medication management, hydration, and symptom control when the oral route is not viable due to total obstruction 3\\\\. Discharge from acute care to the home setting * Allows for easy, discreet, and safe medication administration and short-term hydration in the home setting * For transitioning from intravenous or subcutaneous route to the rectal route when discharged from acute settings to the home setting History The Macy Catheter was invented by Brad Macy, RN, BSN, a 22-year veteran hospice nurse. Inspired by a patient who was terminally agitated and not responding to a solid form of a rectally delivered medication, Macy administered the same medication in a liquid suspension with a small tube inserted into the patient's rectum. The patient's agitation rapidly diminished, and the patient was sleeping within 30 minutes.\\"A hospice invention that stemmed from necessity\\" McKnight's Long Term Care News (March 5, 2014) After practicing repeated successful interventions involving the application of medication in highly concentrated form to the distal one-third of the rectum, Macy realized the potential implications for hospice and palliative patients worldwide. With this motivation, he proceeded to develop the Macy Catheter, a device designed and developed for commercial use.\\"The Macy Catheter Invention\\" The commercial product is protected by two issued U.S. patents and received 510(k) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration in early 2014.\\"Hospi Corporation receives clearance for catheter\\" McKnight's Long Term Care News (February 18, 2014) \\"January 2014 510(k) Clearances\\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Rectal drug delivery Rectal drug delivery is an effective route of medication delivery for many medications used at the end of life.Davis MP, Walsh D, LeGrand SB, Naughton M.

Sigmund, or to be more accurate, his wife, discovers that he lives up to his name on his wedding night, which is unfortunate because he stands to inherit a large fortune if he remains married and reaches the age of 30 without separation or divorce. In an effort to ensure his future he contacts his uncle Hymie, a famous physiologist. Hymie has Sigmund sign a contract guaranteeing him a big cut of the inheritance, and produces a serum which stops Sigmund's snoring. It also renders him unable to sleep.

In the field of proteomics, accurately predicting a protein‚Äôs subcellular localization, or where a specific protein is located inside a cell, is an important step in the large scale study of proteins. This computational prediction problem is known as Protein subcellular localization prediction. Over the last decade, more than a dozen web servers and computer programs have been developed to attempt to solve this problem. Proteome Analyst is an example of one of the better performing subcellular prediction tools. Proteome Analyst makes predictions for both prokaryotic eukaryotic proteins using a text mining approach. Proteome Analyst was originally developed by the Proteome Analyst Research Group at the University of Alberta, and was initially released on March 2004. It was recently updated on January 2014. Input/Output and Method Users can submit requests to the Proteome Analyst web server by selecting the organism type and then uploading a text file containing the protein sequence in a FASTA format. Proteome Analyst then uses BLAST to look for similar proteins in the Uniprot database with annotation on subcellular localization information. Proteome Analyst then uses a machine-learned classifier to analyze the annotation text fields of the most similar proteins identified in Uniprot search to make the final subcellular localization predictions. Users can view and download Proteome Analyst‚Äôs results or ask Proteome Analyst to explain its predictions. Technology Proteome Analyst consists of >30,000 lines of Java code and can be deployed on computer cluster to accelerate its speed and performance using multiple CPUs. The initial release of Proteome Analyst used Na√Øve Bayes classifier to perform its predictions. The current version of Proteome Analyst uses Support Vector Machine classifiers. Currently Proteome Analyst supports subcellular predictions for five organism types (Eurkayotes including animal, plant, fungi, and prokaryotes including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria).

Its brands include George Karelias and Sons, Karelia Slims, Om√©, Karelia Family, Karelia Royal, Rex, American Legend and Leader. The Company produces an average of 15 billion cigarettes per year and employs approximately 500 people worldwide. Karelia has a primary listing on the Athens Stock Exchange (KARE)  History  = 1888 to 1991 = The company's roots date back to 1888, when the first generation of the Karelia family established itself as a small tobacco business in Kalamata, Greece. Its activities were largely regional in the first few decades of its operations, until the political and economic outlook in the country became more stable allowing Karelia to expand the markets for its brands on a nationwide level. From the 1950s until today, numerous Karelia brands have gained popularity resulting in a wide circulation and substantial market share in all of Greece. The corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities have been traditionally located in Kalamata, and since 1971 have been situated in the current premises that were built, totaling an area of 80,000 square meters. The sales and marketing offices are located in the Karelia Building in Athens. The company entered the Athens Stock Exchange in 1976, and was publicly traded under the name Karelia Brothers. That same year, Karelia became the Greek licensed manufacturer for RJ Reynolds (currently Japan Tobacco International), by producing and distributing the brand Winston, and subsequently in 1981, with the Camel brand. Since the early 1990s the group has been transformed from a predominantly Greek company into an international group. In 1991 the company adopted its current name, the Karelia Tobacco Company Inc. In 1994 Karelia established an office in Sofia, Bulgaria.

He is known for his photographs, described as evoking the artistic values and composition of Chinese landscape paintings. A New York Times reviewer called him \\"one of the great visual artists of his time\\" because of his \\"carefully crafted images that celebrate the beauty of the human condition and the majesty of nature.\\" Biography Tchan was born on June 21, 1916 in Chao'an, Chaozhou (Teochew) in eastern Guangdong Province. Tchan graduated from the Guangdong Provincial Second Normal School in 1934, but learned to appreciate painting, music, and poetry from his father. As he explained to a reporter late in his life, \\"I never received formal art training, but my father liked paintings and calligraphy. I loved paintings but could not paint, photography allowed me to create pictures.\\"Alexandra A. Seno, \\"A Cultural History Framed in A Chinese Artist's Lens,\\" New York Times (November 25, 2005) In 1944, Tchan moved to Vietnam in order to run a trading business but spent more and more time with photography. One of his most important influences was Lang Jingshan (1892-1995), whose photography was rooted in Chinese painting. Tchan followed Lang‚Äôs example in montage works which printed several negatives into one image in order to evoke a Chinese painting. For instance, in the early 1950s, Tchan produced photographs which used the ‚Äúone corner‚Äù pictorial style of the Song dynasty painter Ma Yuan (1189-1224). Although still pursuing photography as an amateur, after returning to Hong Kong in 1955, Tchan traveled to many countries on photographic expeditions, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. In these photographs Tchan declared that his new ambition was to portray \\"the real object in collaboration with the skill of pictorial depiction,\\" that is, to show the lives of ordinary people in vivid and aesthetically rigorous images. In 1959 and 1962 he returned to China, and photographed the classic landscapes of Guilin and Huangshan. In a 1962 essay, \\"Chinese Pictorial Painting and Landscape Photography\\" Tchang argued that restricting himself to black-and-white was similar to the three-dimensional textures and forms of Chinese paintings and that his use of space simplified the structures and enhanced the viewer's sense of solidity and emptiness. Although the period of political turmoil during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and early 1970s was not productive for him, by the 1980s Tchan had developed an interest in ethnic photography and worked to encourage photo tourism to China's minority areas. In this period he frequently added brushstrokes to his photos, often taking inspiration from Western style paintings as well. In Hong Kong he founded the Chinese Photographic Association of Hong Kong. Tchan died on 11 September 2018 in Hong Kong, aged 102.

A chelate conjugate of DMTHF with Technetium-99m (DMTHF-Tc), developed by the Philip Low lab at Purdue University, can be used for selective imaging of cancerous tissues where FR-Œ± is overexpressed. DMTHF-Tc is a type of folate targeting, an imaging and drug delivery method where the folate receptor (FR), being upregulated on malignant and inflamed cell types, is targeted. It can be used to reduce drug toxicity, as well as to visualize or quantify the amount of disease in cancerous and inflamed tissue. In normal tissues, the FR shows limited distribution. However, in cancer cells, FR-Œ± shows upregulation, while FR-Œ≤ expression is increased in inflamed tissues on activated macrophages. Because the receptor has these two isoforms that are only 76% homologous, the isoforms can be selectively bound in different types of diseased tissue for folate targeting. Synthesis DMTHF is derived from Technetium (99mTc) etarfolatide (EC20), another 99mTc-based folate-linked chelator produced by Endocyte for folate- targeted imaging. 99mTc-EC20 is used to image sites of inflammation via FR-Œ≤. With the addition of two methyl groups, the dimethylated derivative shows selectivity for the Œ±-isoform over the Œ≤-isoform of the FR. Affinity By incubating increasing concentrations of 99mTc-DMTHF with KB human cancer cells, the affinity of 99mTc-DMTHF for FR-Œ± was determined to be comparable to EC20. Through dye conjugates and fluorescent antibodies specific for macrophages, it was determined that DMTHF-DyLight 680 showed little affinity for FR-Œ≤ on CD11b+ macrophages. This dye conjugate, DMTHF-DyLight 680, showed affinity for FR-Œ± on KB cells, confirming the researchers' previous results. Specificity On mice with KB (FR-Œ±-positive) and A549 (FR-Œ±-negative) implanted shoulder tumors, 99mTc-DMTHF was taken up by the KB tumor but not the A549 tumor, demonstrated by radioisotope imaging and biodistribution analysis. In an atherosclerosis model where macrophages accumulate, 99mTc- EC20, but not 99mTc-DMTHF, was taken up in the aorta-cardiac region. This result was expected because macrophages overexpress FR-Œ≤, and DMTHF has higher affinity for FR-Œ±. In a collagen-induced arthritis model where the mice had systemic and joint inflammation, 99mTc-EC20 accumulated in the organs and limbs, which was not seen with 99mTc-DMTHF. In mice with muscle injury via cardiotoxin, the same result with a lack of uptake of 99mTc-DMTHF was observed as expected. Lastly, animals that had ulcerative colitis as well as M109 neck tumors were tested. The tumor displayed similar uptake of 99mTc-EC20 and 99mTc-DMTHF, while only 99mTc-EC20 was observed in the inflamed colon. This result was supported by DMTHF-dye conjugates. Therefore, DMTHF can be used in vivo to distinguish cancer from sites of inflammation. Targeting =Imaging= Currently, reliable imaging methods do not exist for isolating cancerous tissue from other diseased tissue, particularly in distinguishing cancer from inflammation. For example, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and similar radiolabelled biomolecules can be used to target cancer but also accumulate at sites of infection and inflammation. All of the folate receptor- targeted imaging agents reported in the literature prior to DMTHF could not distinguish between inflammation and cancer. To isolate cancer from inflammation, Low et al. (2012) developed DMTHF-Tc that shows specificity for FR-Œ±. By chelating DMTHF to 99mTc, the same properties that make EC20 a good imaging agent for the FR allow 99mTc-DMTHF to target FR-Œ± reliably. =Therapy= Although no studies to date have explored using a DMTHF-drug conjugate for targeted therapy of cancer, it could be a valuable tool for targeting FR-Œ± expressing malignant tissues. Like an imaging agent, a therapeutic molecule consists of the targeting ligand, DMTHF, with a linker system. Instead of an imaging agent, the molecule would then include a drug payload, such as a chemotherapeutic.

The hospital's chief executive officer is Kevin Abel, and it is affiliated with Kalispell Regional Healthcare. It is a member of the Planetree Alliance. History North Valley Hospital's history traces back to Whitefish, Montana‚Äôs first hospital, which opened in 1905. The hospital was owned by Great Northern Railway and Dr. Hugh E. Houston, a Great Northern Railway physician, served as the hospital‚Äôs first doctor. Its first patients were mostly people injured in railroad accidents. Mr. Peter Gutensohn and Mrs. J.A. Sampson acquired Northern Valley from the railroad in 1912. They operated the hospital until the hospital building was converted into an apartment building in 1923. The town was without a hospital from 1923 until 1936. The building was converted back into a hospital by Mrs. J.A. Earhart. Dr. Edith Boyd purchased the hospital in 1941 and operated it until 1947. In 1946, the hospital moved locations and was named after Dr. John B. Simons. The hospital was later named North Valley Hospital Auxiliary. Dr. Simons sold his interest in the hospital to a civic board in 1961. North Valley Hospital Auxiliary was renamed Whitefish Memorial Hospital. A third hospital was planned and broke ground in 1969. That hospital, named North Valley Hospital, opened in July 1974. It was expanded with a 50 bed Extended Care Center in a 1975 renovation, which cost $1.325 million and was funded entirely with bond sales. The hospital was again expanded in 1988. Quorum Health Resources became the hospital's manager in 1990. North Valley Hospital became a member of the Planetree Alliance network of hospitals in 1992. In May 2016, North Valley Hospital became affiliated with the Kalispell Regional Healthcare system. =Expansion= In 2000, hospital administrators decided to relocate North Valley Hospital. The hospital‚Äôs new $30 million facility, located on the south end of Whitefish, opened in March 2007. North Valley Hospital built a new facility for North Country Medical Clinic in Eureka, Montana in 2008. That same year, the hospital began operating The Base Lodge Clinic at Whitefish Mountain Resort annually from December until April. The hospital purchased The Professional Center in Columbia Falls, Montana in August 2010. The center originally opened in 1978 and was renamed North Valley Professional Center following the acquisition. In 2015, the clinic, which offers family medicine and obstetrics, geriatric and pediatric care, reopened at a new 8,700-square-foot location on Talbott Road.New health clinic opens Nov. 2 in C.

North Valley Hospital acquired Glacier Maternity later that year. North Valley Embrace Health, a structured outpatient mental health clinic, was opened in 2011. In April 2013, the North Valley Hospital began a $1.7 million expansion, which added a fourth operating room to its main facility. The new operating room included the infrastructure to operate the da Vinci Surgical System. The expansion was completed in October of that year. North Valley Geriatric Specialty Services opened in January 2014. The hospital also operates North Valley Physical Therapy, a physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic in Columbia Falls, Montana. In September 2014, North Valley Behavioral Health, a division of North Valley Hospital, opened its clinic in Whitefish, Montana, led by J. Douglas Muir, MD, to treat mental health patients. In October 2015, North Valley Hospital announced a collaborative affiliation with Kalispell Regional Healthcare as a result of a joint task force that was launched in July 2013 to explore opportunities for collaboration between the Kalispell and Whitefish hospitals.Hospitals join forces: Kalispell, Whitefish boards approve collaboration.

He is owned by Khalid Abdullah and was trained by Sir Henry Cecil until Cecil's death in 2013, when Lady Cecil, Sir Henry's widow, became his trainer. Background Noble Mission is a bay horse with a white blaze and white socks on his front legs bred by Juddmonte Farms. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Since retiring to stud, Galileo has become one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland multiple times. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle and Ruler of the World. Noble Mission's dam is Kind, a daughter of Danehill, who was trained by Roger Charlton and won two Listed races. Kind is now a broodmare for Juddmonte Farms and her most famous foal is Frankel, Noble Mission's full-brother, who won ten Group 1 races and retired unbeaten. She has also foaled Lingfield Derby Trial winner Bullet Train and Joyeuse, who has won two listed races. Racing career =2011: Two-year-old season= Noble Mission made his racecourse debut on 25 October 2011, in a one-mile maiden race at Great Yarmouth. In what was his only race as a two-year-old, he was ridden by Tom Queally and finished in second place, five lengths behind winner Swedish Sailor. =2012: Three-year-old season= In April 2012, he contested a one-mile maiden at Newbury, where he started favourite and won easily. On 5 May he stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Newmarket Stakes, where he again started favourite. After the start, Tom Queally positioned him in fourth place of the five runners, and then closed up with two furlongs left to run, before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by a neck from Mariner's Cross. After the Newmarket Stakes he Noble Mission was quoted as a 20/1 shot for the 2012 Derby. He returned to Newmarket two weeks later for the Fairway Stakes, when he was ridden for the first time by Eddie Ahern. In a tight finish, he finished second, a neck behind Thought Worthy and three quarters of a length ahead of third-placed Rugged Cross. Noble Mission never ran in the Derby, but instead went to Royal Ascot for the King Edward VII Stakes, where he faced Thought Worthy again, along with Derby-third Astrology, Thomas Chippendale and Initiator. Noble Mission, who was once again ridden by regular jockey Tom Queally, was involved in another close finish. After being impeded earlier in the finishing straight, he took the lead with one furlong still to run, but could not hold off stablemate Thomas Chippendale, who won the race by half a length, with Noble Mission coming second. At Glorious Goodwood, Noble Mission ran in the Gordon Stakes and started as the 11/4 second-favourite. In the early stages he was held up near the rear of the field by Tom Queally, before starting to close on the leaders with two furlongs remaining. He took the lead one furlong out and raced level with Encke (who won the St. Leger later in the year) right to the finishing line, with Noble Mission winning by a nose. The pre-race favourite, Michelangelo, finished in third place lengths behind Noble Mission and Encke. Tom Queally, who was Noble Mission's regular jockey until the end of 2013 On 22 August, Noble Mission finished fourth behind winner Thought Worthy in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York. Noble Mission's final race of the season came at Newbury on 27 October in the St. Simon Stakes. He was settled in the middle of the pack by Queally before challenging leader Hazel Lavery in the final furlong, but he could not get to the front and Hazel Lavery won by half a length, with Noble Mission finishing in second. =2013: Four-year-old season= In his first race as a four-year-old, Noble Mission faced eight rivals in the John Porter Stakes, on 20 April 2013. The race was won by the four-year-old colt Universal, who beat Quiz Mistress by a head, with Noble Mission a head behind the runner-up in third place. On 4 May he finished last of four runners behind winner Universal in the Jockey Club Stakes. On his following start, Noble Mission dropped in class for the Listed Tapster Stakes, which is run over one-and-a-half miles at Goodwood. Ridden for the first time by Ian Mongan, he took the lead with over one furlong still to run and pulled clear to win by four lengths from Genzy. At Royal Ascot, Noble Mission contested the Hardwicke Stakes, where at the price of 12/1, he was one of the outsiders. He finished the race in fourth place, about lengths behind winner Thomas Chippendale. On his next start, Noble Mission stepped down in distance for the 10-furlong Rose of Lancaster Stakes at Haydock Park, where the odds-on favourite was the three-year-old Telescope. After being slowly away, he was held up at the rear of the field by jockey Tom Queally. He closed in on the leaders two furlongs out, but could not quite catch them, finishing in third place, just over a length behind winner David Livingston. Noble Mission then raced outside the United Kingdom for the first time, when he took part in the Prix Dollar at Longchamp. Amongst the favourites in the betting were Cirrus des Aigles, Planteur and Maputo. Noble Mission was ridden for the first time by James Doyle, who had become the retained rider for Khalid Abdullah since the horses previous run in the Rose of Lancaster. He was slowly away at the start again, and although he reduced the gap to the leaders in the finishing straight, he never contested the lead. The race was won by Cirrus des Aigles, who beat Mandour by one-and-three-quarter lengths, with Petit Chevalier third and Noble Mission fourth. =2014: Five-year-old season= As in 2013, Noble Mission's 2014 seasonal debut came in the John Porter Stakes on 12 April, where he finished in second place, a neck behind winner Cubanita. Thirteen days later he ran in the Gordon Richards Stakes. In this race, instead of being held up, he was sent into the lead in the early stages by James Doyle. He was never caught and in the final furlong he pulled clear to win by nine lengths from Telescope, with Contributor a further nine lengths back in third place. Telescope re-opposed Noble Mission in his next race, the Huxley Stakes, with Ektihaam also amongst the opposition. Noble Mission and Ektihaam contested the lead, before the latter took the lead outright, and then faded. This left Noble Mission in front, and he pulled out a few lengths lead two furlongs out. Telescope stayed on and finished second, but could not catch Noble Mission who won the race by lengths. Noble Mission was then supplemented for the Group 1 Tattersalls Gold Cup, which is run at The Curragh, at the cost of ‚Ç¨21,000. The ground conditions were described as soft and three horses were pulled out of the race before the start, including Dewhurst winner Parish Hall. The betting was dominated by Noble Mission and two-time Group 1 winner Magician, who started as the even-money joint-favourites. The three other runners were Hall Of Mirrors, Einsteins Folly and Euphrasia. Noble Mission led the field from the start and pulled clear with two furlongs left to run, Magician and Euphrasia (who finished second and third respectively) reduced his lead in the final furlong but could not get on terms with him and Noble Mission won by lengths. This was both Noble Mission's and trainer Lady Cecil's first Group 1 win. Noble Mission traveled to France for Grand Prix de Saint- Cloud on 29 June. Flintshire was the favourite, with Noble Mission next in the betting. Doyle sent Noble Mission out into the lead from the start, and had pulled out a three-length lead as the field entered the finishing straight. He was still in the lead by three lengths with about 100 metres left to run, but then tired and faded quickly. Spiritjim just overtook Noble Mission at the finishing line, winning by a head. Siljan's Saga finished in third place, about a neck behind the winner. Noble Mission was later awarded the victory after Spritjim tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol. About one month later, Noble Mission contested the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen. After being drawn wide he started well, but had to race wide around the first bend. In the back straight he moved up to be just behind leader Nausica Time, until taking the lead about 500 metres from the finish. He ran on well, but was overtaken by Lucky Lion 70 metres out. Lucky Lion won the race, beating Noble Mission by half a length, with third-placed Calyxa three lengths behind Noble Mission. On 18 October, Noble Mission started the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Champion Stakes, the race in which Frankel had concluded his unbeaten career in 2012. His eight rivals included Cirrus des Aigles (the 7/4 favourite), Ruler of the World, the six-year-old Al Kazeem, and the lightly raced but highly regarded Irish colt Free Eagle. Racing on heavy ground, Noble Mission was sent into the lead by Doyle from the start and set the pace from Al Kazeem, with Ruler of the World and Cirrus des Aigles close behind. As the field entered the straight many of the fancied runners were struggling and the race evolved into a protracted struggle between Noble Mission and Al Kazeem. The older horse gained a slight advantage inside the final furlong, but Noble Mission rallied in the final strides to win by a neck after a \\"thrilling duel\\",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/29673682 with Free Eagle finishing one and a quarter lengths back in third. An emotional Lady Cecil said \\"It's just a fairytale. It means so much to us. When he died I kept the licence to feel closer to him\\". Doyle commented \\"I knew it was Al Kazeem as soon as I saw his head alongside and I know what a good horse he is, but this fella is unbelievable. He just relaxes in front now, and I was able to save a bit for the finish\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing/champion- stakes-2014-noble-missions-victory-a-salute-to-the-memory-of-sir-henry- cecil-9804374.html On 2 November it was announced that Noble Mission would retire from racing and begin his career as a breeding stallion at Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Kentucky. Assessment During his three-year-old season he achieved a rating of 115 in the Gordon Stakes, officially ranking him as the joint-236th best horse in the world. In November Noble Mission was named Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards. Stud record In his first season at stud, Noble Mission sired the Grade I Travers Stakes winner Code of Honor. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Noble Mission is inbred 3 √ó 4 to the stallion Northern Dancer, meaning that Northern Dancer appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

(16 November 1894 ‚Äì 27 July 1972) was an Austrian-Japanese politician, philosopher and Count of Coudenhove-Kalergi. A pioneer of European integration, he served as the founding president of the Paneuropean Union for 49 years. His parents were Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi, an Austro-Hungarian diplomat, and Mitsuko Aoyama, the daughter of an oil merchant, antiques-dealer and major landowner in Tokyo., chpt. (1) His childhood name in Japan was Aoyama Eijiro. He became a Czechoslovak citizen in 1919 and then took French nationality from 1939 until his death. His first book, Pan-Europa, was published in 1923 and contained a membership form for the Pan-Europa movement, which held its first Congress in 1926 in Vienna. In 1927, Aristide Briand was elected honorary president of the Pan-Europa movement. Public figures who attended Pan-Europa congresses included Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann and Sigmund Freud. Coudenhove-Kalergi was the first recipient of the Charlemagne Prize in 1950. The 1972‚Äì1973 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour. Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" as the music for the European Anthem. He also proposed a Europe Day, a European postage stamp, and many artifacts for the movement (e.g. badges and pennants)., p. 99  Family roots  Europa-Platz ‚Äì Coudenhove-Kalergi in Klosterneuburg, Austria Coudenhove-Kalergi was the second son of Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi (1859‚Äì1906), an Austro-Hungarian count and diplomat of mixed European and Japanese origin. His mother was Mitsuko Aoyama (1874‚Äì1941). His father, who spoke sixteen languages and embraced travel as the only means of prolonging life, yet died in his forties, had prematurely abandoned a career in the Austrian diplomatic service that took him to Athens, Constantinople, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, to devote himself to study and writing. Coudenhove- Kalergi's parents met when his mother helped the Austro-Hungarian diplomat after he fell off a horse while riding in Japan. In commenting on their union, Whittaker Chambers described the future originator of Pan-Europe as \\"practically a Pan-European organization himself.\\" He elaborated: \\"The Coudenhoves were a wealthy Flemish family that fled to Austria during the French Revolution. The Kalergis were a wealthy Greek family from Crete. The line has been further crossed with Poles, Norwegians, Balts, French and Germans, but since the families were selective as well as cosmopolitan, the hybridization has been consistently successful.\\" The Kalergis family roots trace to Byzantine royalty via Venetian aristocracy, connecting with the Phokas imperial dynasty. In 1300, Coudenhove-Kalergi's ancestor Alexios Phokas-Kalergis signed the treaty that made Crete a dominion of Venice. During his childhood, Coudenhove-Kalergi's mother had read aloud to him Momotar≈ç and other Japanese fairy tales.  Youth and education  The Ronsperg castle, his childhood home. Damaged during the Second World War, the repairs were overseen by a German from Japan Masumi Schmidt-Muraki. Coudenhove-Kalergi spent his adolescence on Bohemian family estates in Ronsperg, known today as Pobƒõ≈æovice. His father personally taught his two sons Russian and Hungarian and toughened them both physically and morally. He took them on long walks in all weather, made them sleep on straw mattresses and take cold showers, and taught them to shoot and fence so well that no one would ever dare challenge them. He also took them to Mass every Sunday. On every Good Friday, as the liturgy came to the exhortation \\"oremus et pro perfidis Judaeis\\" (\\"Let us also pray for the faithless Jews\\"), the old count allegedly rose and walked out of the church in a protest against this supposed expression of antisemitism. Coudenhove-Kalergi studied at the Augustiner-Gymnasium in Brixen before attending the Theresianische Akademie in Vienna from 1908 until 1913. He obtained his doctorate in philosophy with a thesis on Die Objectivit√§t als Grundprinzip der Moral (Objectivity as the Fundamental Principle of Morals) in 1917 from the University of Vienna. During his student years, Coudenhove-Kalergi married the famous Jewish Viennese actress Ida Roland in April 1915. His marriage to a divorc√©e thirteen years his senior, and a commoner, caused a temporary split with his family. His mother Mitsuko did not accept Ida, considering her a \\"beggar living on the riverbank,\\", chpt. (3): \\"\\" a traditional Japanese point of view against actors and performers. His mother, as head of the family, banned him from the family temporarily, but retracted when Coudenhove-Kalergi became renowned for his pan-European concept.  Personal philosophy  Aristocratic in his origins and elitist in his ideas, Coudenhove-Kalergi identified and collaborated with such politicians as Engelbert Dollfuss, Kurt Schuschnigg, Otto von Habsburg, Winston Churchill, and Charles de Gaulle. His ideal political constituent was a gentleman who must respect and protect ladies, a person adhering to honesty, fair play, courtesy, and rational discourse. He strove to replace the nationalist German ideal of racial community with the goal of an ethnically heterogeneous European nation based on a commonality of culture, a nation whose geniuses were the \\"great Europeans\\" such as abb√© de Saint-Pierre, Kant, Napoleon, Giuseppe Mazzini, Victor Hugo, and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Pan-European political activist  Ida Roland-Coudenhove-Kalergi and Thomas Mann in the second Pan-European Congress in Sing-Akademie zu Berlin on 17 May 1930 Coudenhove-Kalergi is recognized as the founder of the first popular movement for a united Europe. His intellectual influences ranged from Immanuel Kant, Rudolf Kjell√©n and Oswald Spengler to Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. In politics, he was an enthusiastic supporter of \\"fourteen points\\" made by Woodrow Wilson on 8 January 1918 and pacifist initiatives of Kurt Hiller. In December 1921, he joined the Masonic lodge \\"Humanitas\\" in Vienna. In 1922, he co-founded the Pan-European Union (PEU) with Archduke Otto von Habsburg, as \\"the only way of guarding against an eventual world hegemony by Russia.\\" In 1923, he published a manifesto entitled Pan-Europa, each copy containing a membership form which invited the reader to become a member of the Pan-Europa movement. He favored social democracy as an improvement on \\"the feudal aristocracy of the sword\\" but his ambition was to create a conservative society that superseded democracy with \\"the social aristocracy of the spirit.\\" European freemason lodges supported his movement, including the lodge Humanitas., chpt. V ‚Äì 3 Pan-Europa was translated into the languages of European countries (excluding Italian, which edition was not published at that time) and a multitude of other languages, except for Russian., p. 107 According to his autobiography, at the beginning of 1924 his friend Baron Louis de Rothschild introduced him to Max Warburg who offered to finance his movement for the next three years by giving him 60,000 gold marks. Warburg remained sincerely interested in the movement for the remainder of his life and served as an intermediate for Coudenhove-Kalergi with influential Americans such as banker Paul Warburg and financier Bernard Baruch. In April 1924, Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the journal Paneuropa (1924‚Äì1938) of which he was editor and principal author. The next year he started publishing his main work, the Kampf um Paneuropa (The fight for Paneuropa, 1925‚Äì1928, three volumes). In 1926, the first Congress of the Pan-European Union was held in Vienna and the 2,000 delegates elected Coudenhove-Kalergi as president of the Central Council, a position he held until his death in 1972. His original vision was for a world divided into only five states: a United States of Europe that would link continental countries with French and Italian possessions in Africa; a Pan-American Union encompassing North and South Americas; the British Commonwealth circling the globe; the USSR spanning Eurasia; and a Pan-Asian Union whereby Japan and China would control most of the Pacific. To him, the only hope for a Europe devastated by war was to federate along lines that the Hungarian-born Romanian Aurel Popovici and others had proposed for the dissolved multinational Empire of Austria-Hungary. According to Coudenhove-Kalergi, Pan-Europe would encompass and extend a more flexible and more competitive Austria-Hungary, with English serving as the world language, spoken by everyone in addition to their native tongue. He believed that individualism and socialism would learn to cooperate instead of compete, and urged that capitalism and communism cross-fertilise each other just as the Protestant Reformation had spurred the Catholic Church to regenerate itself.; Coudenhove-Kalergi attempted to enlist prominent European politicians in his pan-European cause. He offered the presidency of the Austrian branch of the Pan-European Union to Ignaz Seipel, who accepted the offer unhesitatingly and rewarded his beneficiary with an office in the old Imperial palace in Vienna. Coudenhove-Kalergi had less success with Tom√°≈° Masaryk, who referred him to his uncooperative Prime Minister Edvard Bene≈°. However, the idea of pan-Europe elicited support from politicians as diverse as the Italian anti-Fascist politician Carlo Sforza and the German President of the Reichsbank under Hitler, Hjalmar Schacht. Although Coudenhove-Kalergi found himself unable to sway Benito Mussolini, his ideas influenced Aristide Briand through his inspired speech in favour of a European Union in the League of Nations on 8 September 1929, as well as his famous 1930 \\"Memorandum on the Organisation of a Regime of European Federal Union.\\" Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" as the Anthem of Europe in 1929, which he later proposed in 1955 as Anthem for the European Union. In 1930, he proposed a Europe Day in May and in 1932 he proposed to celebrate every 17 May, the anniversary of Aristide Briand's \\"Memorandum\\" being published in 1930., p. 176: \\"\\" However, his Pan-Europeanism earned vivid loathing from Adolf Hitler, who excoriated its pacifism and mechanical economism and belittled its founder as \\"a bastard.\\"; ; Coudenhove-Kalergi once again approached Mussolini on 10 May 1933 in a futile attempt to form a union of Latin nations against the Third Reich. , p. 114 Hitler's view of Coudenhove-Kalergi was that the \\"rootless, cosmopolitan, and elitist half- breed\\" was going to repeat the historical mistakes of Coudenhove ancestors who had served the House of Habsburg., p. 691 In 1928, Hitler wrote about his political opponent in his Zweites Buch, describing him as \\"\\"., p. 425 Hitler did not share the ideas of his Austrian compatriot. He argued in his 1928 Secret Book that they are unfit for the future defense of Europe against America. As America fills its North American lebensraum, \\"the natural activist urge that is peculiar to young nations will turn outward.\\" But then \\"a pacifist-democratic Pan-European hodgepodge state\\" would not be able to oppose the United States, as it is \\"according to the conception of that commonplace bastard, Coudenhove-Kalergi...\\"Hitler's Secret Book, 1928, (tr. Attanasio, Salvator, New York: Grove Press, 1962), p 107. Nazi criticism and propaganda against Coudenhove-Kalergi, and his European worldview, would decades later form the basis of the racist Kalergi plan conspiracy theory. Nazis considered the Pan-European Union to be under the control of Freemasonry., p. 394 In 1938, a Nazi propaganda book was released in German.The book had English edition as Freemasonry: Its World View, Organization and Policies. (English full text: http://der-stuermer.org/freemasonryen.htm) It revealed Coudenhove- Kalergi's membership of Freemasonry, the organization suppressed by Nazis.: \\"\\" On the other hand, his name was not to be found in Masonic directories 10,000 Famous Freemasons published in 1957‚Äì1960 by the United States' freemasons.‚Äì1960 He had already left the Viennese Masonic Lodge in 1926 to avoid the criticism that had occurred at that time against the relationship between the Pan-European movement and Freemasonry. He wrote about his Masonic membership in Ein Leben f√ºr Europa (A Life for Europe) published in 1966.; , p. 57 In fact, its Nazi propaganda book also described his action in 1924‚Äì1925 only. However, this propaganda also stated that \\"The Grand Lodge of Wien went enthusiastically to work for the Pan European Union in a call to all Masonic chief authorities. Even the Masonic newspaper The Beacon enthused about the thoughts of the higher degree Freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi, and stated in March 1925: \\"Freemasonry, especially Austrian Freemasonry, may be eminently satisfied to have Coudenhove-Kalergi among its members. Austrian Freemasonry can rightly report that Brother Coudenhove-Kalergi fights for his Pan European beliefs: political honesty, social insight, the struggle against lies, striving for the recognition and cooperation of all those of good will. In this higher sense, Brother Coudenhove-Kalergi's program is a Masonic work of the highest order, and to be able to work on it together is a lofty task for all brother Masons.\\"\\"Web.archive.org Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo in the cinematic trailer of Casablanca After the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich in 1938, Coudenhove-Kalergi fled to Czechoslovakia, and thence to France. As France fell to Germany in 1940, he escaped to the United States by way of Switzerland and Portugal. When he passed a few days after the successful escape to the United States, he listened to the radio announcing the possibility that he had died. (Roy Publishers) During World War II, he continued his call for the unification of Europe along the Paris-London axis. His wartime politics and adventures served as the real life basis for fictional Resistance hero Victor Laszlo, the Paul Henreid character in Casablanca. He published his work Crusade for Paneurope in 1944. His appeal for the unification of Europe enjoyed some support from Winston Churchill, Allen Dulles, and \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan. After the announcement of the Atlantic Charter on 14 August 1941, he composed a memorandum entitled \\"Austria's Independence in the light of the Atlantic Charter\\" and sent it to Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In his position statement, Coudenhove-Kalergi took up the goals of the charter and recommended himself as head of government in exile. Both Churchill and Roosevelt distanced themselves from this document. From 1942 until his return to France in 1945, he taught at the New York University, which appointed him professor of history in 1944. At the same university Professor Ludwig von Mises studied currency problems for Coudenhove-Kalergi's movement. (Hutchinson) On 22 July 1943, Nazis deprived him of his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Vienna, with the racist argument, that as a \\"Jew\\" he was not considered dignified an academic degree of a German university (\\"eines akademischen Grades einer deutschen Hochschule unw√ºrdig\\") ‚Äì even though he was not Jewish nor was his family Jewish. His doctorate degree was only regranted on 15 May 1955 ‚Äì a very long time after the end of Nazism. The end of the World War II inaugurated a revival of pan-European hopes. In the winter of 1945, Harry S. Truman read an article in the December issue of Collier's magazine that Coudenhove-Kalergi posted about the integration of Europe. His article impressed Truman, and it was adopted to the United States' official policy., chpt. (3) Winston Churchill's celebrated speech of 19 September 1946 to the Academic Youth in Zurich commended \\"the exertions of the Pan-European Union which owes so much to Count Coudenhove-Kalergi and which commanded the services of the famous French patriot and statesman Aristide Briand.\\", p. 664; In November 1946 and the spring of 1947, Coudenhove-Kalergi circulated an enquiry addressed to members of European parliaments. This enquiry resulted in the founding of the European Parliamentary Union (EPU), a nominally private organization that held its preliminary conference on 4‚Äì5 July at Gstaad, Switzerland, and followed it with its first full conference from 8 to 12 September. Speaking at the first EPU conference, Coudenhove-Kalergi argued that the constitution of a wide market with a stable currency was the vehicle for Europe to reconstruct its potential and take the place it deserves within the concert of Nations. On less guarded occasions he was heard to advocate a revival of Charlemagne's empire., p. 537 In 1950 he received the first annual Karlspreis (Charlemagne Award), given by the German city of Aachen to people who contributed to the European idea and European peace. In Japan, a politician Ichir≈ç Hatoyama was influenced by Coudenhove-Kalergi's fraternity in his book The Totalitarian State Against Man. It was translated into Japanese by Hatoyama and published in 1952. Coudenhove-Kalergi was appointed the honorary chairman of the fraternal youth association that Hatoyama, with the influence of his book, had established in 1953. In 1955, he proposed the Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" as the music for the European Anthem, (digital document by CVCE) a suggestion that the Council of Europe took up 16 years later. In the 1960s, Coudenhove-Kalergi urged Austria to pursue \\"an active policy of peace\\", as a \\"fight against the Cold War and its continuation, the atomic war\\". He advocated Austrian involvement in world politics in order to keep the peace, as \\"active neutrality\\". He continued his advocacy of European unification in memoranda circulated to the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. He recommended negotiations between the European Community and the European Free Trade Association towards forming a \\"European customs union\\" that would be free of political and military connections, but would eventually adopt a monetary union.  Views on race and religion  In his 1925 book Practical Idealism, Coudenhove-Kalergi envisioned an all- encompassing race of the future made up of \\"Eurasian-Negroid[s],\\" replacing \\"the diversity of peoples\\" and \\"[t]oday's races and classes\\" with a \\"diversity of individuals.\\"Praktischer Idealismus, Wien/Leipzig 1925, pages 20, 23, 50 In an interview in the first Pan-European Congress in 1926, he expressed the support of Jews by the Pan-European movement and the benefits to Jews with the elimination of racial hatred and economic rivalry brought by the United States of Europe. In 1932, Coudenhove-Kalergi composed, and had his publishing house reissue, a preface for a new edition of his father Heinrich von Coudenhove- Kalergi's condemnation of antisemitism in his later life. In 1933, he responded to the ascendance of Nazism by collaborating with Heinrich Mann, Arthur Holitscher, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Max Brod in writing and publishing the pamphlet Gegen die Phrase vom j√ºdischen Sch√§dling (Against the Phrase 'Jewish Parasite').  Journeys to Japan  = First return to Japan = The Pan-European idea influenced a young Japanese diplomat ‚Äì in the future, the president of Kajima Corporation ‚Äì Morinosuke Kajima during his residence in Berlin in 1922. Coudenhove-Kalergi formed a friendship with Kajima and then asked him to translate the book Pan-Europa into Japanese. He proposed Pan-Asia to Kajima and promised to give Dutch East Indies as their friendship after the realization of the task to establish Pan-Asia. Kajima published Pan-Europa in Japanese in 1927. In 1930 Kajima retired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to become MP. His ambition to become an MP was due to Coudenhove-Kalergi's influence., chpt. (3) In 1970‚Äì1971 he published the complete works of Coudenhove-Kalergi from Kajima Institute Publishing that was established by Morinosuke Kajima. He respected Coudenhove-Kalergi over a lifetime, dreaming of the realization of Pan-Asia. In Japan, the Pan-European idea also influenced a journalist Yoshinori Maeda, the president of NHK. He became a pioneer of Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union with the image of Pan-Europa that he read in his student days., chpt. (2) In 1953 Ichir≈ç Hatoyama established Yuai Youth Association (later Yuai Association), the fraternal association as the successor of fraternity that Coudenhove-Kalergi mentioned in The Totalitarian State Against Man. The Japanese word has several meanings but especially the word used by Hatoyama means fraternity and in German br√ºderlichkeit., p. 137 It can also be considered equivalent to \\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\\" (Brotherhood), the motto of the French Republic. An educator Kaoru Hatoyama became the second president of the association after her husband Ichir≈ç, the first president, died in 1959. In 1967 Coudenhove- Kalergi was awarded the Kajima Peace Award, and was invited to Japan by Morinosuke Kajima as the president of Kajima Institute of International Peace, Yoshinori Maeda as the president of NHK, and Kaoru Hatoyama as the president of Yuai Youth Association. Together with his second wife Alexandra in a wheelchair, Coudenhove-Kalergi stayed in Japan from 26 October to 8 November. He was also accompanied by his young brother Gerolf's daughter Barbara., chpt. (5) Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi was also awarded First Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan. He was granted an audience with the Emperor Hirohito, Empress K≈çjun, their son Crown Prince Akihito to whom he had presented his book in 1953 in Switzerland, and Crown Princess Michiko. This time, he had returned to Japan for the first time since his childhood 71 years earlier. He gave several lectures and met various leaders. Coudenhove-Kalergi spent 2 weeks in Japan as a guest of Japanese TV, radio, newspaper, magazines and other media. While in Japan, Coudenhove-Kalergi specifically asked for a meeting with the president of Soka Gakkai, Dr. Daisaku Ikeda, as Coudenhove- Kalergi had been interested in Ikeda's work for many years. After their first meeting in October 1967, Coudenhove-Kalergi described Ikeda as \\"very energetic, life-loving, honorable, friendly and intelligent.\\", chpt. (1) = Soka Gakkai invitation = Coudenhove-Kalergi visited Japan again at the invitation of the Soka Gakkai in October 1970., chpt. (2) During his stay, he and Daisaku Ikeda conducted a formal dialogue over the course of several days, a total of more than 12 hours of which was recorded for posterity. He also visited the campus of Soka University in Tokyo, which was under construction at that time. Two decades later, in 1990, Ikeda proposed that Coudenhove- Kalergi's favorite song, Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy,\\" be regularly performed at major Soka Gakkai meetings. It was reported in Japan that this was one cause of the split between the Soka Gakkai and Soka Gakkai International (SGI) from Nichiren Shoshu in 1991, as the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood objected to the song's \\"Christian origins.\\"  Death  Coudenhove-Park at Hietzing, Vienna According to a masonic report, Coudenhove-Kalergi died of a stroke. His secretary, however, indicated that Coudenhove-Kalergi possibly committed suicide. In the memoir his secretary wrote, she said his death had been kept secret so as not to disappoint those who considered him to be the great visionary of European integration. Coudenhove-Kalergi was the head of the Pan- European Union until his death. The presidency was succeeded by Otto von Habsburg. Coudenhove-Kalergi is buried at Gruben near Gstaad. His grave, covered with wild grapes, is located in a Japanese rock garden in the Swiss Alps. The grave is unpretentious and upon it is the French epitaph \\"\\" (Pioneer of the United States of Europe), with none of the other great titles that many supporters believe he had earned. Coudenhove-Kalergi was married three times: to Ida Roland (1881‚Äì1951), to Alexandra Gr√§fin von Tiele-Winkler (1896‚Äì1968), and to Melanie Benatzky-Hoffmann (1909‚Äì1983). His known children were Ida's daughter Erika and Alexandra's son Alexander, both of whom were his step- children.

Biography =Early life= Charles Nordhoff was born in London, England, on February 1, 1887, to American parents. His father was Walter Nordhoff, a wealthy businessman and author of The Journey of the Flame penned under the name \\"Antonio de Fierro Blanco\\". His mother, Sarah Cope Whitall, was of Pennsylvania Quaker stock. Nordhoff's parents returned to the United States with him in 1889, living first in Pennsylvania, then Rhode Island, and finally settling in California by 1898.US Census, 1900, for Los Angeles County, California Charles Bernard Nordhoff's grandfather was Charles Nordhoff, a journalist and author of non-fiction books. Nordhoff himself showed an early interest in writing. His first published work was an article in an ornithological journal, written in 1902 when he was just fifteen. After attending The Thacher School in Ojai, California, he entered Stanford University at seventeen, but transferred after one year to Harvard. After graduation in 1909, Nordhoff worked for his father's businesses, first spending two years in Mexico managing a sugar plantation, then four years as an executive of a tile and brick company in Redlands, California. He quit in 1916, signed up with the Ambulance Corps, and traveled to France. There he joined other American expatriates as a pilot in the Lafayette Flying Corps. He finished World War I as a lieutenant in the US Army Air Service. =Writing career= After leaving the service, Nordhoff remained in Paris, France, where he worked as a journalist and wrote his first book, The Fledgling. In 1919, he and another former Lafayette Squadron pilot, James Norman Hall, who was also an author and journalist, were asked to write a history of that unit. Neither man had known the other during the war.The New York Times, \\"Charles Nordhoff, Author, Dies at 60\\", April 12, 1947, pg. 17 Their first literary collaboration, The Lafayette Flying Corps, was published in 1920. The two authors then returned to the United States, sharing a rented house on Martha's Vineyard, until given a commission by Harper's Magazine to write travel articles set in the South Pacific. They went to Tahiti in the Society Islands for research and inspiration, and ended up staying, Nordhoff for twenty years, Hall for life. Their second book, Faery Lands of the South Seas, was serialized in Harper's in 1920‚Äì21, then published in book form. Nordhoff married a Tahitian woman, Christianne Vahine Tua Tearae Smidt, with whom he would have four daughters and two sons. He wrote novels on his own for ten years, of which The Derelict (1928) was considered his finest solo effort. Nordhoff and Hall continued to jointly write travel and adventure articles for The Atlantic during the 1920s and early 1930s.The New York Times, \\"A Vivid Tale of Maritime Adventure\\", Oct 16, 1932, pg BR7 They also co-authored another memoir of World War I, Falcons of France (1929). It was Hall who suggested they work on The Bounty Trilogy: Mutiny on the Bounty (1932), Men Against the Sea (1934) and Pitcairn's Island (1934). Nordhoff, who would write in the mornings and spend the afternoons fishing, once explained how he and James Hall worked together. They initially drew up charts of all the characters, then would dole out the chapters to each other. For their joint works they each made an effort to write in the other's style so as to achieve a reasonably smooth narrative. After The Bounty Trilogy, Nordhoff and Hall's most successful book was The Hurricane (1936). They continued their partnership writing novels until 1945. Nordhoff produced one more solo book, In Yankee Windjammers (1940), a retelling of the ships, sailors, and way of life about which his grandfather had written. =Later life= Nordhoff divorced his first wife in 1936, left Tahiti a few years later, and returned to California, where in 1941 he married Laura Grainger Whiley. During World War II, he had the honor of having a Liberty ship, SS Charles Nordhoff, built in Portland, Oregon in 1943, named after him. Charles Bernard Nordhoff died alone at his home in Montecito, California, on April 10, 1947. His body was found the next morning by Tod Ford, who had called on him to work on their book. Newspapers at the time reported the death as an \\"apparent heart attack\\". Later sources indicate he had been drinking heavily, was depressed, and may have committed suicide.California Death Index, 1940-1997 He is buried in the Redlands, California, Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.NNDB Selected works * The Fledgling, 1919 * The Lafayette Flying Corps, with James Norman Hall, 1920 * Faery Lands of the South Pacific, with James Norman Hall, 1921 * Picar√≤, 1924 * The Pearl Lagoon, 1924 * The Derelict, 1928 * Falcons of France, with James Norman Hall, 1929 * The Bounty Trilogy, with James Norman Hall  Mutiny on the Bounty, 1932  Men Against the Sea, 1933  Pitcairn's Island, 1934 * The Hurricane, with James Norman Hall, 1936 * The Dark River, with James Norman Hall, 1938 * No More Gas, with James Norman Hall, 1940 * In Yankee Windjammers, 1940 * Botany Bay, with James Norman Hall, 1941 * Men Without Country, with James Norman Hall, 1942 * High Barbaree, with James Norman Hall, 1945 Film treatments The Nordhoff‚ÄìHall books were the source for both the 1935 and the 1962 MGM films, Mutiny on the Bounty.

He also played non-league football in the Lincolnshire area. Playing career Keeble began his football career with his hometown club, Holbeach United. While doing his National Service in the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, he played for Football League club Grimsby Town's reserve team as an amateur, and turned professional as soon as he left the Army in 1959. He made his League debut against York City in the following September, and went on to establish himself in the starting eleven. He was ever-present as Grimsby were promoted as Third Division runners-up in 1961‚Äì62, and scored once that season ‚Äì the only goal of his Grimsby career ‚Äì in a 3‚Äì2 win at home to Northampton Town in March 1962. According to Keeble, interviewed in 2011, he \\"was about out and hit the ball towards goal. Ron Rafferty went up with the 'keeper and they both missed the ball and it went flying into the net.\\" Earlier that same season, Keeble was the victim of a bizarre occurrence when playing away to Watford, whose Vicarage Road ground had been constructed on the site of an old gravel pit and was prone to subsidence. A hole opened up on the pitch under his feet, expanding to wide and twice as deep, and the referee suspended play for 14 minutes while the hole was filled in. He played much less frequently at the higher level, making only 49 appearances, which took his total to 172 (181 in all senior competitions), and was released at the end of the 1954‚Äì65 season. He moved on to Fourth Division club Darlington, went straight into the starting eleven and was ever-present as they were promoted to the second tier in his first season. He played 154 times for Darlington in the League, and scored twice. One of those two goals, against Walsall, was scored from even further out than his Grimsby goal: he \\"hit the ball forward, the goalkeeper came out to claim it and slipped on his backside and it trickled into the goal.\\" He made 154 league appearances in four seasons with Darlington, and went on to play non-league football for clubs including Boston United, Brigg Town and Barton Town. Style of play Keeble began his career as a centre half, but soon switched to full back. Although right-footed, he was used most often at left back. He described himself as \\"[not] one of those players who go in for big tackles\\", preferring to manoeuvre his opponent positionally, and went through his whole professional career without being booked. Personal life Keeble was born in Holbeach, Lincolnshire. He married wife Diane in 1963. After his football career finished, he worked in a supervisory role for transportation companies in the Grimsby area. Keeble died at home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, after a short illness, at the age of 77.

In March 2002, he successfully defended his doctoral dissertation entitled \\"The Phenomenon of Donated People in 11th‚Äì12th century Przemyslite Territories\\" and was awarded a PhD in the field of economic and social history. Petr√°ƒçek was greatly influenced by his doctoral supervisor Prof. Jaroslav ƒåechura, and by Czech social historians Prof. Eduard Maur and Prof. Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†taif. From 1999 to 2002 he studied at the Catholic Theological Faculty of Charles University in Prague. In 2000, he joined a seminary. From 2002 to 2005 he continued theological studies at the Theological Faculty of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, where in 2005 he passed the final examination and received the title Licentia in Sacra Theologia (insigni cum laude). His supervisor was Prof. OP Guy Bedouelle, and Prof. Mariano Delgado also had a considerable influence on him.

He spend summer semester as visiting fellow at Yale University in 2015.  Work  The first topic that Petr√°ƒçek chose to investigate in his scholarly work was the social and economic history of the early Middle Ages in the Czech lands, focusing on the lower strata of society in particular. This work resulted in the 2003 publication of the monograph The Phenomenon of Donated People in the Czech Lands in the 11th ‚Äì 12th Centuries: On the Knowledge of Economic and Social History of the Czech Lands at the Time of Dukes. A second, revised and expanded version of the book was published in 2012 by the prestigious publishing house Argo under the title Serfs and Freemen, Dukes and Manorial Estates: the Phenomenon of Donated People in Premyslid Bohemia in the 10th‚Äì12th Centuries. (Nevoln√≠ci a svobodn√≠, kn√≠≈æe a velkostatek. Fenom√©n darovan√Ωch lid√≠ p≈ôemyslovsk√Ωch zem√≠ 10.‚Äì12. stolet√≠). Petr√°ƒçek has also published numerous other studies and articles concerning social, economic and religious history. In 2017 he published his book Power and Exploitation in the Czech Lands in the 10th - 12th Centuries. A Central European Perspective as Volume 40 of Brill¬¥s Series ‚ÄûEast Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450‚Äú. While studying theology, Petr√°ƒçek began to concern himself with issues in the history of Catholic exegesis during the modernist crisis. One of the key figures in Fribourg was the Old Testament Exegesis Professor Vincent Zapletal (1867‚Äì1938) of the Dominican Order, who worked at the Theological Faculty of the University from 1893 to 1928. Zapletal was among the most significant figures in progressive Catholic exegesis, along with the French biblical scholar Marie Joseph Lagrange OP and German Jesuit Franz von Hummelauer. Zapletal sought a scientific interpretation of the Bible and employed a historical-critical method, and became a victim of the anti-modernist crisis in the Catholic Church between 1904 and 1914. Petr√°ƒçek completed a critical biography entitled Bible Science in the Period of the (Anti-)Modernist Crisis: The Life and Work of Vincent Zapletal OP (1897‚Äì1938). It was published in 2006 in the Czech Republic (V√Ωklad Bible v c√≠rkvi v dobƒõ (anti-)modernistick√© krize. ≈Ωivot a d√≠lo Vincenta Zapletala OP (1897‚Äì1938)). There was also an abridged French version, Le Pere Vincent Zapletal O.P. (1867‚Äì1938). Portrait d'un exegete catholique. Studia friburgensia ‚Äì Series historica 6, Fribourg 2007, which dealt with the life of Zapletal before the appearance of the anti-modernist crisis and its aftermath. Petr√°ƒçek has also published numerous studies and articles appearing in the academic journals such as Revue Biblique or Memoire Dominicaine and most of them in the Czech journal Salve. The culmination of his research work is The Bible and Modern Criticism: Progressive Czech and World Exegesis in the Vortex of the (Anti-)Modernist Crisis, which was published by the Vy≈°ehrad publishing house in 2011 (ƒåesk√° a svƒõtov√° progresivn√≠ exegeze ve v√≠ru (anti-)modernistick√© krize). Other scholarly interests of Petr√°ƒçek include historical anthropology and issues related to cross-cultural communication, adaptation, and the diversity and dynamics of society and culture in European history, particularly in the area of church, social and religious history. Petr√°ƒçek has examined the question of the causes and roots of the dynamic secularization of the Czech lands and in 2013 published Secularization and Catholicism in the Czech lands: Specific Aspects of the Czech Route from National Church to the Most Atheist Country in the World. (Sekularizace a katolicismus v ƒçesk√Ωch zem√≠ch. Specifick√© rysy ƒçesk√© cesty od lidov√© c√≠rkve k nejateistiƒçtƒõj≈°√≠ zemi svƒõta). In investigating the underlying causes of secularization trends, Petr√°ƒçek has looked into the overall adaptive ability of Christianity, publishing articles and studies concerning this issue as well as a monograph in 2013 entitled Adaptation, Resistance, Resignation: The Church, Society and Changes in Modern History (Adaptace, resistance, rezignace. C√≠rkev, spoleƒçnost a zmƒõna v novovƒõk√Ωch dƒõjin√°ch). In the Polish publishing house El Press he published three monographs in English. In his first English book In the Maelstrom of Secularization, Collaboration and Persecution. Roman Catholicism in Modern Czech Society and the State, author explores the various processes which culminated in Roman Catholicism drastically falling in both position and status in the modern Czech culture, society, and state, thus rendering a privileged and self-confident national church a problematic, humiliated, barely tolerated and, for much of the 20th century, brutally persecuted community. https://www.academia.edu/10471766/In_the_Maelstrom_of_Secularization_Collaboration_and_Persecution._Roman_Catholicism_in_Modern_Czech_Society_and_the_State In the second English book Church, Society and Change. Christianity impaired by conflicting elites, he presents four model situations to proof, that the way in which the Christian elites of the different confessions coped with the primary problem of a divided Christendom is interpreted as a moment of rupture in the history of the Western church, which undermined its adaptive and innovative capacities and so set European society on the path to modern secularisation.https://www.academia.edu/9525118/Church_Society_and_Change._Christianity_impaired_by_conflicting_elites In the third with the title Man, Values and the Dynamics of Medieval Society. Anthropological Concepts of the Middle Ages in a Transcultural Perspective, the author analyses how Medieval culture and civilization in Europe was able to come to terms with cultural, social and religious plurality and diversity without posing a threat to solidarity, openness, dynamism and the actual functioning of society using selected phenomena such as Inquisition, Canon Law, Cult of Relics etc.https://www.academia.edu/10877726/Man_Values_and_the_Dynamics_of_Medieval_Society._Anthropological_Concepts_of_the_Middle_Ages_in_a_Transcultural_Perspective In 2016 Petraƒçek continued his research in the field modern social and church history with the book The Council, Tradition, Reform. The Legacy of the Second Vatican Council.https://www.academia.edu/28736161/C%C3%8DRKEV_TRADICE_REFORMA._Odkaz_Druh%C3%A9ho_vatik%C3%A1nsk%C3%A9ho_koncilu_Vy%C5%A1ehrad_Praha_2016_240_s._in_Czech_with_english_Summary_The_Church_Tradition_Reform._The_Legacy_of_the_Second_Vatican_Council_ This highly appreciated monograph is primarily focused on the question of continuity and discontinuity in the area of the modern history of the Catholic Church in relation to the most significant events of Church history of the 20th century, that is the Second Vatican Council. In 2017 he published small book with the title The West and its Faith: 9.5 Theses on the Impact of Luther‚Äòs Reformation. The 500th anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation gave him, in particular within the context of the contemporary development of the position and role of the church in western society, an opportunity for more general thoughts concerning the influence of the events of the sixteenth century on the history of Christianity, the church and society.https://www.academia.edu/35628859/Z%C3%81PAD_A_JEHO_V%C3%8DRA._9_5_teze_k_dopad%C5%AFm_Lutherovy_reformace._Praha_Vy%C5%A1ehrad_2017._ISBN_978-80-7429-911-7_The_West_and_its_Faith_9.5_Theses_on_the_Impact_of_Luther_s_Reformation_ Recently he published also some studies in Modern czech social and church history, such as The First and Second Life of Father Josef Toufar (1902‚Äì1950) and Shifts in Interpretations of Modern Czech History.

It was founded in the early 1960s by the Shomrei Emunim Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom Chaim Roth. Name The neighborhood is named after the eponymous book by Aharon Roth, founder of the Shomer Emunim Hasidic dynasty. This work contains essays on the subjects of \\"faith, reward and punishment, redemption, and a passionate yearning for God\\". The main street in the neighborhood is also called Shomrei Emunim Street. Location Kiryat Shomrei Emunim is bordered by Mea Shearim to the south, Beit Yisrael to the west and north, and Shivtei Yisrael Street to the east. History Kiryat Shomrei Emunim was established in the early 1960s by Rabbi Avrohom Chaim Roth, the Shomrei Emunim Rebbe, son and successor of the founder of the Shomer Emunim dynasty, Aharon Roth. The Rebbe selected a site between the long-established neighborhoods of Mea Shearim and Beit Yisrael. He procured a gift of 50,000 liras from the Bank of Israel toward construction costs. In addition to residential buildings, the Rebbe opened a Talmud Torah and yeshiva. Over time, the neighborhood grew to include 12 buildings, a synagogue, yeshiva gedola, yeshiva ketana, kollel, and mikveh. In 1975 a Bais Yaakov girls high school moved to Kiryat Shomrei Emunim. In 1976 the Rebbe relocated to Bnei Brak, but returned to the neighborhood each year to celebrate the holidays of Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Shavuot with his Hasidim in Jerusalem. Attempted terror attack On January 11, 2001, a resident spotted a large bag deposited in a garbage can on Shomrei Emunim Street. She called over her brother, a 36-year-old father of five who studies in a neighborhood yeshiva. He opened the bag and saw a bomb connected to a cell phone with wires. He detached the wires from the cell phone and then called police. While police were examining the bomb, which consisted of two mortar shells, the cell phone rang, but the connection had been severed. (subscription) This was the second of four attempted bombings in the vicinity of Mea Shearim and Beit Yisrael over a two-month period. Expansion In 2013 developers broke ground on an additional 150 apartment units in Kiryat Shomrei Emunim, a project that will double the population base. The project includes a ornamental garden and a public playground. The new units are expected to attract high demand due to the neighborhood's proximity to neighboring Hasidic communities, the Jerusalem city center, and the Western Wall.

The purchase included an annuity for Reviczky's life, and it formed the basis of Spencer's collection. Of this collection the Count printed and distributed a descriptive catalogue under the title of Bibliotheca Graca et Latina, complectens auctores fere, omnes Grscite et Latii veteris, quorum opera, vel fragmenta xtatem tulerunt, exceptia tantum asceticis et theologicis Patrum nuncupatorum scriptis; cum delectu editionum tam primariarum, principum, et rarissimarura, quam etiam optimarum, splendidissimarum, atque nitidissimtrum, quas usui meo paravi, Periergus Deltophilus, Berolini, 1784 in eight volumes.

History  Peoria Charter Coach Company's first bus in 1941 Peoria Charter Coach Company was founded in 1941 by Walter Winkler, who traded in the family car and received a loan from his sister to buy a bus to shuttle Caterpillar workers between Spring Bay and a new factory in Peoria, when gas was rationed during World War II. In 1979, Winkler stepped down and his sons Roger and Stanley took over the business. In 1990, Roger bought Stanley's share of the business when the latter retired. In 1999, Roger's son William and his wife Cindy took over the business, buying it from Roger. In 2010, Peoria Charter opened a new terminal in Urbana. In 2013, the company moved its pick up location in Joliet from the Joliet Mall parking lot to the Union Station parking lot, in order to meet customers' demand for overnight parking. The company introduced online ticketing in 2010. On July 15, 2020, Peoria Charter Coach announced that it had laid off all but eight of its 140 employees in response to declining revenues.

The project was established following the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes. The main objective of the CSI was \\"to increase the respect for and protection of human rights by the police and to build confidence between law enforcement agencies and communities including through the promotion of multi-ethnic policing.\\" The CSI was approved in November 2010 by all OSCE participating states. The project was officially ended on 11 December 2015.  History  The Community Security Initiative was developed at the request of the government of Kyrgyzstan and approved by a decision of the OSCE Permanent Council on 18 November 2010. The main goal of the project was to support Kyrgyzstan's police in dealing with the security situation following the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes and to assist in the police reform process. Markus Mueller of Switzerland (2010-2013), Todor Staykov of Bulgaria (2013-2014), Robin Seaword of the UK (2014), and Patrick McNulty of the US (2015) served as head of the CSI. In the fall of 2014, the government of Kyrgyzstan decided to close the CSI project. However, it was extended for another year. The CSI was officially closed on 11 December 2015.  Activities  As part of the project, the OSCE sent unarmed police advisers to several districts across Kyrgyzstan and donated 18 mobile police receptions‚Äîminivans with basic equipment needed for a mobile police reception‚Äîto re-establish and increase police presence in remote areas. In 2011‚Äì2015, over 80,000 people approached the mobile police receptions. A mobile police reception in Leilek District The CSI project also organized over 150 trainings for police officers to improve their professionalism. In addition, the CSI closely monitored and supported the activities of local crime prevention centers and neighborhood inspectors to increase their efficiency in addressing security issues and everyday concerns of citizens. The CSI also promoted youth empowerment and education by providing opportunities for young people to learn about school bullying and racketeering, as well as ethnic tolerance, career building, and prevention of bad habits. The project worked in collaboration with the OSCE's Police Reform Programme and High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM). The project also collaborated with a large number of national authorities in Kyrgyzstan, including the Ombudsman, Prosecutor General, the State Penitentiary Service, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Health.

Most of them were musical comedies. Early successes included Moonlight (1924) and Mercenary Mary (1925). Later productions received mixed reception. His longest-running production was the comedy Separate Rooms, which ran from March 1940 to September 1941. Early years Sheet music for Oh You Wonderful Girls (1917) William Barr Friedlander was born in 1884. He would become a librettist, composer, producer, director, author and manager. An early example of his work is the 1905 The Man with the Jingle, a song for which Friedlander wrote the lyrics to music by Charles E. Mullen. He wrote the lyrics to My lovin' Henry (1905), music by Terry Sherman. Friedlander married the Russian-born Nan Halperin, a vaudeville performer, and composed all the songs she used in her act. During the 1910s and 1920s he produced a number of tabloid shows for vaudeville. The Suffragettes was a very successful tab show featuring Nan Halperin. In 1916 W.B. Friedlander Inc. produced Salamander Sallies by Will M. Hough (1882‚Äì1962) and Friedlander, The Night Clerk headed by Frank Ellis, The Four Husbands with Howard Burkholder and George W. Jenks, among others. The shows were booked through vaudeville houses. The company said it planned to produce a new revue called the Friedlander Show with seven complete stage settings and 34 people. First Broadway shows Friedlander wrote the music and lyrics for Frivolities of 1920, a musical review that opened at the 44th Street Theatre on 8 January 1920, produced by G.M. Anderson. The show got poor reviews for its lack of wit and music, but stayed open for seven weeks. Friedlander's musical Pitter Patter was staged at the Longacre Theatre in 1920. The cast included James Cagney, the future film star. Pitter Patter opened at the Longacre on 28 September 1920 and ran for fourteen weeks. In 1921 Freidlander and L. Lawrence Weber were in partnership to present dramatic, musical and vaudeville attractions at the Longacre on Broadway. In 1924 the Longacre staged the small musical Moonlight, with a score by Con Conrad and Friedlander. Moonlight opened at the Longacre on 30 January 1924. The critics called it tuneful fun. The show ran for 174 performances and then toured successfully. The next year Conrad and Friedlander's musical comedy Mercenary Mary was presented at the Longacre. It was based on the 1923 farce What's Your Wife Doing?. Although the music was weak the cast was strong, and included Allen Kearns. It opened at the Longacre on 13 April 1925 and ran for more than four months. Marion Wightman's The Dagger opened at the Longacre on 9 September 1925, directed by Friedlander. It was panned by the critics. Friedlander produced and directed the play The Shelf, which opened at the Morisco on 27 September 1926 and ran for 32 performances. The cast, headed by Frances Starr, was excellent. The play was not. Friedlander produced the musical comedy Piggy, which opened at the Royale Theatre on 11 January 1927. The script was weak, but the popular comedian Sam Bernard played the starring role and carried the show for 79 performances. Bernard died soon after the show closed. Later productions Friedlander produced and directed the musical comedy Jonica, which opened at the Craig Theatre on 7 April 1930. The authors were Dorothy Heyward and Moss Hart with music by Joseph Meyer and lyrics by William Moll. The show, called \\"odd, unlikely\\", was a flop. Moss Hart claimed he had little to do with the show. It is possible that Friedlander rewrote it without taking credit. The script appears to have been lost. Friedlander produced Under Glass, starring Ross Alexander. It opened at the Ambassador Theatre on Broadway on 30 October 1933 and ran for just eight performances. Hiram Sherman's farce Too Much Party, directed by William Friedlander, opened at the Theatre Masque on 5 March 1934 and closed after eight performances. The comedy Separate Rooms opened at the Maxine Elliott Theatre on 23 March 1940, moved to the Mansfield Theatre on 15 April 1940, and then on 10 June 1940 moved to the Plymouth Theatre, where it finally closed on 6 September 1941 after 613 performances. The play was written by Alan Dinehart and Joseph Carole. Friedlander directed and staged it. Stars included Alan Dinehart, Glenda Farrell and Lyle Talbot. Friedlander's revival of the 1907 musical comedy The Time, The Place and The Girl opened at the Mansfield Theater on 21 October 1942. Eugene Burr's review in Billboard was scathing, calling it \\"the monstrosity at the Mansfield\\". He said \\"Mr. Friedlander has directed all this in the manner of a below-average Burlesque skit. Principals are forlornly stranded in couples near the apron, and called upon to throw the frightful lines back and forth at each other in the manner of discomforted victims trying to pass the buck.\\" Good Morning, Corporal opened at the Playhouse Theater on 8 August 1944, staged and presented by Friedlander. Writing in Billboard, Joseph Koehler said \\"This can't run‚Äîin fact it won't even crawl.\\" The show closed after ten days. It was the last of Friedlander's productions to appear on Broadway. W.B. Friedlander died in January 1968, aged 83.

History The local common was used as a military camp in 1742, with thousands of troops camped there during the summer months. It was an ideal base, as it was less than a day's march to Tilbury, where the troops would leave for foreign service. In the 1778 encampment, King George III came to inspect the troops, and Dr Samuel Johnson stayed for five days. Warley Barracks was made permanent in 1804, with space for 2,000 cavalry. of land were bought and used for two troops of horse artillery ‚Äì 222 horses, with 306 soldiers of varying ranks and ten officers ‚Äì a hospital, and half a battalion of the Rifle Brigade. In 1842 the East India Company's barracks at Chatham became inadequate, and they purchased the land to move their troops in. Accommodation was created for 785 recruits and 20 sergeants with new buildings for the officers. Married family housing was also provided, and a chapel. In 1856 further building work was carried out, and a total of 1,120 men were housed there every year. After training they were deployed to India. The area and men were absorbed into the British Army after the Indian Mutiny in 1857, and in 1861 the barracks was bought by the War Office. The barracks became the depot of the Brigade of Guards in the 1860s. In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot and the 56th (West Essex) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 44th and 56th regiments amalgamated to form the Essex Regiment with its depot in the barracks in 1881. The regiment saw active service in the Second Boer War and both World Wars. Following the amalgamation of the regiment with the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment to form the 3rd East Anglian Regiment in 1958 the site was sold to the Ford Motor Company. The Essex Regiment Chapel is located in Eagle Way. The chapel was built in 1857 and is a Grade II listed building. It was originally built for the East India Company, but with the establishment of the Essex Regiment Depot at Warley, the chapel became the regiment's \\"home\\" church. The chapel's interior contains displays of regimental history, memorials, heraldry and regimental colours. The chapel is open by appointment, and on regimental heritage days. The chapel is nearby to the Warley (Brentwood) Army Reserve drill hall, which is the headquarters of 124 (Essex) Transport Squadron, part of 151 Regiment RLC. The site of the old regimental depot and barracks is now the headquarters of the Ford Motor Company. Most of the barracks have been demolished and only the chapel, the officers' mess (now Marillac Nursing Home) and one of the regimental gyms (Keys Hall) remain.

History Sultan Ahmed III (reigned 1703‚Äì1730) commissioned the sebil, a public fountain to provide drinking water for travellers and running water for praying people's ritual washing needs. Completed in 1728‚Äì1729, within an era with great importance attached to the construction of many fountains, it was dedicated to the sultan's mother Emetullah Rabia G√ºlnu≈ü Sultan (1642‚Äì1715), who was buried in √úsk√ºdar. The fountain was initially situated directly on the quay at the waterfront of Bosphorus to serve travellers crossing the Strait. During the redesigning of the area in 1932‚Äì1933, the fountain was dismantled and relocated to the center of the nearby square next to the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque. It underwent two major restorations. In the first one, during its relocation, the broken parts of the fountain were repaired or replaced. The second restoration took place in 1955, when the structure had to be elevated about to match the square's ground level. The fountain stands today on a two- step high platform in ƒ∞skele Square at the intersection of Pa≈üalimanƒ± Street and Hakimiyetimilliye Street. Architecture Details of a corner facade: A faucet over a sink flanked by two Solomonic columns topped with Corinthian order capital under a muqarnas. Cornice and eaves with ornaments carved at top. The fountain was built as a stand-alone structure in the type of a \\"square fountain\\" () looking like a monument. It has the form of an octagonal prism with wide four facades and four narrow corner facades. The octagon plan of the fountain at the base turns into a quasi-square form at the top. The square-pyramid formed hip roof has wide eaves on all sides. The fountain is built by solid white marble with a wooden roof covered by lead sheet. Designed by the court architect Kayserili Mehmed Aƒüa in the rococo architectural style of Ottoman Tulip Period (1703‚Äì1757), it is adorned with ornamentation. Its design shows similarities with the Fountain of Ahmed III (1729) and the Tophane Fountain (1732). ƒ∞t features a faucet inside a lancet arch in the middle of each facade over a watering trough to enable for bucket filling, livestock drinking or taking ritual body washing for prayer. The higher- attached faucets over a sink in the four corner facades were designed to spend drinking water for people. In the wall of the main facade, which looks at Bosphorus, there are two semicircular niches on both sides resembling a mosque's mihrab. A number of relief flower motifs as tulips, roses and chrysanthemums in vase adorn the structure. Each of the eight corners of the fountain features a Solomonic column topped with a Corinthian order capital. At the top of the corner facades in between the columns, muqarnas, three- dimensional decorations of Islamic architecture, are placed, which transform the octagon plan of the fountain into a square right under the roof. The wooden roof's eaves features carved ornaments over a cornice encircling the entire structure. On each of the four wide facades, the fountain features an inscription in Arabic script, which was in use in the Ottoman Empire. The inscriptions on three facades are excerpts from verses of three poets, namely the famous Diwan poet Ned√Æm (1681?‚Äì1730), ≈ûakir and Kƒ±rƒ±mlƒ± Mustafa Rahmi (died 1750), while the inscription on the main facade contains verses inspired by both Sultan Ahmed III and his son-in-law, Grand Vizier Nev≈üehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha (1666‚Äì1730). The inscription is written in Jeli Thuluth style of Islamic calligraphy by Sultan Ahmet III himself, who was also a poet and calligrapher. It was signed as \\"Ahmed ibn-i Mehmed Han\\" (Ahmed, the son of Khan Mehmed). The construction date of the fountain can be calculated from the inscriptions by the Abjad system, which assigns numerical values to Arabic letters for purposes of numerology. The calculated value of AH 1141 in Islamic calendar, which was in use in the Ottoman Empire, corresponds to AD 1728‚Äì1729.

Belonging to a class of molecules known as furanosteroids, it has a characteristic highly strained electrophilic furan ring fused between C-4 and C-6 of the steroid framework. Members of this family, including wortmannin, are known to be potent, irreversible covalent inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks).  Biosynthesis  The complete biosynthesis of viridin is not known. Through [2-14C]mevalonic acid labeling studies, it has been shown that viridin is biosynthesized from a triterpenoid pathway, which starts from squalene, rather than a diterpenoid pathway. Incorporation of lanosterol into viridin has been described. Although the mechanisms and order of the remaining steps from lanosterol to viridin are not certain, these include the formation of the furan ring, the loss of C-13 and C-14 methyl groups, aromatization of the C-ring, removal of the side chain, and oxidation of the A-ring. Some of these steps may be analogous to pathways of other steroids. Loss of a hydrogen atom from C-15 during removal of the C-14 methyl group suggests a pathway similar to that of other steroid biosyntheses. Analogous to the cholesterol pathway, the C-14 methyl group is lost as formic acid by action of sterol 14-demethylase. Though the C-13 methyl group isn't removed in the pathway of aldosterone, it is possible that viridin undergoes analogous oxidation at C-18 followed by loss of formic acid or decarboxylation to remove the C-13 methyl. Removal of the side chain has been shown to follow a mammalian pathway. It likely follows the pathway of androstenedione and oxidatively removes the side chain as acetic acid, resulting in a ketone on the D-ring. The ‚Äúextra‚Äù carbon in the furan ring at C-4 comes from the 3‚Äô-position of mevalonic acid and represents the C-4Œ≤-methyl group of lanosterol. Oxidation and decarboxylation of the C-4Œ±-methyl group is consistent with the normal mammalian steroid pathway; however, instead of repeating these steps to remove the other methyl group, the second oxidized methyl group is likely intercepted to form the furan ring by an unknown mechanism. Studies show that aromatization of the C-ring proceeds without skeletal rearrangement. In the biosynthesis of viridiol by Gliocladium deliquescens, the 3Œ≤-OH reduced form of viridin, the incorporation of squalene, lanosterol, dehydroxydemethoxyviridin, and demethoxyviridin was reported. This suggests that the vicinal oxygenations at C-1 and C-2 are independent steps involving hydroxylation. center Removal of C-14 methyl Oxidative removal of side chain Removal of C-4 methyl  References  Category:Steroids Category:Furans Category:Triketones ","title":"Viridin"},{"id":"42870411","text":"Peter Gilchrist McArthur (March 10, 1866 - October 28, 1924) was a farmer and writer in Ontario.

He was one of the earliest members of the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden and, along with the group's founder, bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris, Murray is the only member who has appeared on all of the band's releases. Growing up in various areas of London, Murray became a member of a skinhead gang before he took an interest in rock music at 15 and formed his own band, Stone Free, with childhood friend Adrian Smith. After leaving school at 15, he regularly answered advertisements which appeared in Melody Maker before auditioning for Iron Maiden in 1976. A short while later, Murray was sacked following an argument with the group's lead vocalist, Dennis Wilcock, and spent six months in Smith's band, Urchin. In the spring of 1978, following Wilcock's departure, Murray was asked to rejoin Iron Maiden, in which he has remained to this day. Biography As a child, Murray's family lived in poverty and were constantly moving to different areas of London, which meant that he was often bullied and involved in fights. By the time his family settled in Clapton in 1970, Murray joined a skinhead gang and \\"had a violent couple of years of being out on the street.\\" He developed an interest in rock music when he was 15 after hearing \\"Voodoo Chile\\" by Jimi Hendrix on the radio, about which he recalls, \\"everything changed, just like that. Getting into rock music wasn't like a gradual process for me; it was completely sort of extreme, totally black and white. I heard 'Voodoo Chile' on the radio and I thought, 'Bloody hell! What is THAT? How do you do THAT?' And I started hanging around the rock music section of the record stores and buying albums, thinking about getting into the big time, wondering what that would be like.\\" After \\"hanging 'round record stores\\" and acquiring several Hendrix and blues albums, Murray decided to take up the guitar. At 16, he formed his first band, a trio called Stone Free, which also included Adrian Smith on vocals, who would also become a member of Iron Maiden in 1980. From there, Murray would answer ads in Melody Maker and regularly audition for different bands at the weekend, leading to short stints in Electric Gas, \\"this sort of soft-rock, American-type band\\", and The Secret, \\"this sort of mad punk band\\", with whom he would record a single \\"The Young Ones\\" under the alias \\"Reggie Mental\\", and a demo, \\"Caf√© De Dance\\", in 1977. Murray (left) performing with Adrian Smith in 1982 He auditioned for Iron Maiden in late 1976, eager to get back into \\"a more sort of heavy rock-type vibe\\". At the time the band already had two guitarists, Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance, who disapproved of Murray being permitted to audition, seeing it as a slight on their ability. The group's founder and bassist Steve Harris did not hesitate to choose Murray over Sullivan and Rance, later stating: \\"When the others made it plain that it was either them or Dave Murray, there was no choice. There was no way I was gonna let Dave go. Not only was he a nice bloke, he was just the best guitarist I'd ever worked with. He still is.\\" Unfortunately, after only a few months in the band, Murray was sacked following an argument with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock after a show at the Bridgehouse pub in Canning Town which led him to team up with Adrian Smith again in his band, Urchin. During his short tenure with this group, Murray recorded one single, entitled \\"She's a Roller\\", after which he was asked to rejoin Iron Maiden following Dennis Wilcock's departure. Murray managed to hold down a 9 to 5 job working as a storekeeper for the London Borough of Hackney, which he has stated was \\"so I could sleep off the night before\\", but was able to resign once the band signed with EMI in 1979. Murray's solo guitar style throughout his career has been mainly based on the legato technique, such as on \\"The Trooper\\", which he claims \\"evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\\" He has also written songs for the band, though he is less prolific than other band members, usually forgoing lyric writing and instead concentrating on the musical elements of songwriting. He mainly co-writes songs with another member of Iron Maiden, \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" (from 1980's Iron Maiden) being to date the only composition for which he is credited as sole writer. Murray and Harris are the only members of Iron Maiden to have appeared on every one of the band's releases. Along with Adrian Smith, he appears at no. 9 on Gibson's list of the \\"Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time\\". Murray played with the jazz ensemble on Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain's instructional video Rhythms of the Beast. Equipment Murray used and endorsed Marshall amplifiers almost exclusively, other than on the Somewhere in Time (1986) and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988) albums and their respective tours, when he instead used Gallien-Krueger amps, and Victory Amps during the recordings of The Book Of Souls, but again Marshalls on tour (JVM410h). He has used Fender Stratocaster guitars almost exclusively. His black 1957/63 (the body is from a '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, previously owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used approximately between 1978 and 1990. It was used as a template by Fender to manufacture an Artist Signature model in 2009. The original now resides at his mother's home. \\"I bought it in 1976,\\" he said. \\"I saw it advertised in Melody Maker‚Ä¶ I got the serial number to check it was [Kossoff's] guitar. It cost quite a bit of money but I didn't care. I just sold everything I had so I could get it, and I used it from then on. It just felt like I was holding a piece of magic because he had used this guitar.\\"\\"All right then\\" (no credited author); Classic Rock #216, November 2015, p21 In addition to Fender guitars, Murray has occasionally performed with various Dean, Gibson, Ibanez, ESP and Jackson electric models. During the Dance of Death World Tour 2003-4, Murray used a Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar for live performances of the song \\"Journeyman\\". =Guitars= As of 2015, his main guitar is a 2-tone sunburst Fender Californian Series Stratocaster with two Seymour Duncan Hot Rails pick- ups (bridge and neck positions), one Seymour Duncan JB Jr. pick-up (middle position) and a chrome Floyd Rose tremolo system. In 2015, Seymour Duncan announced the release of the official Dave Murray Loaded Pickguard set with demonstrator Danny Young performing the official video on the Seymour Duncan YouTube channel. On stage, Murray has also performed with a cream USA Floyd Rose Classic Stratocaster (with a 22-fret maple neck and same electronics and hardware as the sunburst model), a custom Stratocaster based on his aforementioned Paul Kossoff Fender, and a Gibson Flying V. In 2010, he began using a Gibson Les Paul Traditional model, featuring Seymour Duncan '59 and JB pickups in the neck and bridge positions respectively, which his guitar technician, Colin Price, states was originally brought in for Adrian Smith to try, but was then bought by Murray for practising on tour. In addition to this Les Paul, he primarily used a 2002 Les Paul Classic with a Seymour Duncan '59 and JB neck and bridge pickups for the recording of The Book of Souls (2015), as well as a sunburst Gibson Les Paul Axccess with the same pickup configuration and a Floyd Rose tremolo. In 2015, Fender announced a second Artist Signature model, based on his California Series Stratocaster. It retains all the specifications of his original guitar, has a compound radius fretboard and is made entirely in their Ensenada plant in Mexico. =Guitar specifications= * Ernie Ball Strings ‚Äì custom gauge .009, .011, .014, .024, .032, .042 * Seymour Duncan Hot Rails single coil sized humbucking pick-ups with dual blade coils * \\"Original\\" Floyd Rose Locking Tremolo Systems * His Artist Signature model features a soft \\"V\\"-shaped maple neck with satin back and sports a humbucker/single-coil/humbucker (HSH) configuration ‚Äì DiMarzio Super Distortion DP100 (bridge), American Vintage '57/'62 (middle), DiMarzio PAF DP-103 (neck) ‚Äì with 3-way switching and American Vintage hardware.

It was built by Royalist forces in order to prevent Parliamentarian forces landing at Pembroke Castle, and to protect Royalist forces landing from Ireland. The site was chosen on the west side of the eastern inlet surrounding the site of the later town, known locally as a Pill. Construction was according to a plan by Richard Steel, an engineer from the King's headquarters in Oxford.James Frederick Rees The Story of Milford, University Of Wales Press, 1954 ASIN B000MYZBCQ It was built on raised headland at the junction of the Pill and the waterway, and at a cost of ¬£400. Known locally as the Gunkle, it may have been the site of an Iron Age fort. It was the only fort built during the Civil War in Pembrokeshire.Phillips, Benjamin A Pembrokeshire's Forts & Military Airfields 1535 - 2010, Logaston Press, 2013 Although there is no definite description of the fort, similar structures consisted of four earthen bastions surrounded by a ditch. The walls were of palisade, and the canons sat on the bastions. Accommodation and catering facilities were contained in tented constructions in the middle of the enclosure. The bell tower at Steyton church was used as an observation post and musket tower. Site of the fort, to the left of the picture, overlooking the Haven estuary On 23 February 1644 a Parliamentary force of three ships arrived in the Haven, and Colonel Rowland Laugharne assumed command of all forces at Pembroke. Two Royalist ships took shelter in the Pill. Parliamentary forces moved canons into position on the eastern side of the Pill in addition to those on ships in the Haven, and a bombardment of the fort began. Land forces arrive from the north of the fort via Steynton, and a truce was called and the fort surrendered. It was manned by Parliamentarian forces for the remainder of the conflict, and dismantled prior to the outbreak of the Second Civil War in 1648. The earth embankments were noticeable until at least the 1930s, but in 1990 the area was bulldozed and is now built over.

Early life and education Thompson was born in New York, New York, but received his public school education in Bennettsville, South Carolina. Thompson attended North Carolina Central University, where he earned the Bachelor of Science and the Master of Science degrees in biology. In 1977, he would go on to earn his Doctor of Education Administration from Duke University, with minor degrees in political science, economics, and educational law. Career After graduation from North Carolina Central University, Thompson worked in a number of capacities at several institutions. From 1956 to 1960, he worked as a senior research assistant at the Medical School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; from 1960-1961 he was an assistant professor of biology at North Carolina A&T; State University; from 1961-1965 he was assistant professor and acting chairman of the Biology Department at Tuskegee University; and from 1965-1983 he served as a professor of biology, chairman of the Division of Natural Science, vice president for academic affairs, provost, and finally as acting president of Shaw University. During his tenure at Shaw University, Thompson befriended former Governor of North Carolina, and President of Duke University, Terry Sanford. It was Sanford who encouraged Thompson to enroll in a doctoral program at Duke University, which had been developed to train potential college presidents. As a part of a class assignment, Thompson interviewed former University of North Carolina President William Friday. Friday was so impressed with Thompson that he offered him a part-time job in the department. In 1975, Thompson was appointed Vice President for Student Services and Special Programs of the University of North Carolina, and began the process of resolving the university's desegregation dispute with the federal government. On November 1, 1980, Thompson was appointed as interim Chancellor of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, where he served for one year. In 1985, partially upon the recommendation of Dr. Friday, Thompson was selected as the 8th chancellor of Winston-Salem State University. The Thompson administration focused on the improvements of academics through the recruitment of quality faculty, improvement of admission requirements for students, enhancement of the general studies program, and working to meet and surpass accreditation standards. In addition, the school of nursing was revitalized, the university increased its focus on undergraduate research; and collaborations were established within the private sector, government, and fellow universities. In 1995, Thompson concluded ten years of service to the university upon his resignation to continue work within the University of North Carolina System. Legacy The Cleon F. Thompson center, on the campus of Winston-Salem State is named in his Honor. Completed in 1996, the Thompson Center houses the university's post office, bookstore, Financial Aid Department, Registrars Office, Office of Admissions, Division of Student Affairs, and Kennedy Dining Hall.

Born as Renato Manganella, he wrote under the pen name of D'Ambra becoming a celebrated journalist, novelist, and film critic. A noted film enthusiast, D'Ambra became involved in the cinema in 1911 when he anonymously wrote screenplays. From 1916 he formally entered the film industry, setting up his own production company and directing more than twenty films. His silent comedies drew comparisons to the films of his German contemporary Ernst Lubitsch. In 1922 D'Ambra's company was absorbed into the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana and he retired from regular filmmaking although he occasionally produced further screenplays.

Main characters  ; Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage):The main character born on March 18, 1956, Kevin grew up in the turbulent late 1960s and early 1970s. Right after he graduated from high school in 1974, he went off to college, got married and has a son born in 1981. The voice of the present-day adult Kevin (the show's voice-over narrator) is supplied by Daniel Stern. ; John \\"Jack\\" Arnold (Dan Lauria):Character born on November 5, 1927, died in 1975. Kevin's father is a gruff, laconic man and a Korean War veteran; he grew up during the Great Depression, served in the US Marine Corps right after he graduated from college, and is seen in photographs wearing the uniform of a First Lieutenant. He works as a product distribution manager at NORCOM, a large military defense company. Later, he starts his own business, building and selling handcrafted furniture. The series' last episode reveals that he dies in 1975 near the end of Kevin's freshman year of college‚Äîthat is, two years after the time of the show's finale. Jack Arnold represents the viewpoint of the conservative \\"Greatest Generation\\" that grew up during the Depression and came of age during World War II; this generation was confused and angered by the rapid changes taking place in the 1960s. ; Norma Arnold (n√©e Gustafson) (Alley Mills): Kevin's housewife mother. Unlike her husband, Norma is friendly, upbeat, and optimistic. She met Jack as a college freshman. When he graduated, she moved across the country with him and did not finish college. She eventually gets her degree late in the series and begins work at a software startup called Micro Electronics. She worked her way up in the future as board chairman at the end of the series. Although she came of age at the same time as her husband, she is less conservative than him and increasingly yearns to break out of her homemaker role, reflecting the rise of feminism in the 1960s‚Äîas was illustrated in one episode where she takes a pottery class, much to the dismay of Jack. ; Karen Arnold (Olivia d'Abo): Kevin's older, rebellious, hippie sister. Her free-spirited lifestyle clashes with her overbearing father's conservatism, and she depends upon her mother as a mediator. When Karen moves in with her boyfriend Michael (David Schwimmer) during her freshman year of college, she has a falling-out with her father. The pair marry one year later and move to Alaska, where Michael has secured a good job working on the Alaska Pipeline. Karen ultimately accepts some of her parents' viewpoints and has a baby, while her husband learns to support his wife and child. ; Wayne Arnold (Jason Hervey): Kevin's older brother. Wayne enjoys physically tormenting Kevin and Paul, calling Kevin \\"butthead\\" or \\"scrote\\". He takes over the family furniture business when his father dies. Wayne is usually portrayed as a loser in romantic relationships. For a time he dated a girl named Dolores, which was more casual than serious. In later seasons, Wayne matures. In the final season, he begins a serious relationship with a divorcee named Bonnie but is left heartbroken when she reconciles with her ex-husband. In the series finale, it is revealed that he takes over the family furniture business after Jack dies in 1975. ; Paul Joshua Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano): Character born March 14, 1956, Paul is Kevin's long time best friend, a bright and excellent student, and an allergy sufferer. He is also Jewish and in one episode celebrates his Bar Mitzvah. Although Kevin and Paul are best friends in the series's early seasons, their relationship becomes somewhat strained later. Kevin begins to spend more time with Chuck and Jeff, causing tension with Paul. Paul also attends a private prep school for one season, leaving Kevin alone to start public high school. In another episode Kevin tattles on Paul after Paul loses his virginity. In the final episode it is revealed that Paul eventually attends Harvard and studied law and become a lawyer. ; Gwendolyn \\"Winnie\\" Cooper (Danica McKellar): Born in September or October, Winnie is Kevin's main love interest and neighbor for the first three seasons (she and her family move across town at the end of Season 3). Their first kiss, and her older brother's death in Vietnam, play an important part in the pilot. In another episode, Winnie's parents separate in grief over the death of their son. In the epilogue of the final episode, it is revealed that Winnie travels overseas to study art history in Paris. Kevin and Winnie write to each other every week for these eight years until she returns; in the concluding moments of the finale, Kevin says that when Winnie returned to the States, Kevin met her accompanied by his wife and first child‚Äîdespite the hope among Wonder Years fans that Kevin and Winnie would themselves marry, as they seemed destined to do so throughout the series's run. \\"Like I said,\\" says Kevin at the end, \\"things never turn out exactly the way you plan them.\\" As suggested in an episode entitled \\"The Accident\\" and in the final episode of the series, every important event in Kevin's life has somehow involved Winnie. Recurring and other notable characters  ; \\"Grandpa\\" Albert Arnold (David Huddleston): Kevin's paternal grandfather, a loving but stubborn old man who constantly annoys his son, Jack. Though their relationship is strained, Kevin's father and grandfather have a strong bond that has a lasting effect on Kevin as he grows older. Grandpa gifted Kevin with a dog, which Kevin named Buster, and sold Kevin his very first car‚Äîfor one dollar. He also appeared in one episode being less jovial, when he announces the death of a family member named Rose and escorts the entire family to her funeral. Grandpa is also a widower, as Kevin's paternal grandmother was only seen in flashback scenes of family films. ; Buster: Kevin's dog, a loving and loyal brown and white beagle. Buster was a gift given to Kevin by his grandfather Albert, much to Jack's disapproval. Eventually the family all fall in love with the dog, especially when it is feared that he is lost after running away in the park. Though physically appearing in only four episodes throughout the entire series, Kevin reminisces that Buster would always be there happily waiting for him throughout the most important events in his young life, including his graduations from high school and college. ; Randy Mitchell (Michael Tricario): Kevin's friend, described as loyal and brave, though noticeably lacking Paul's intelligence. (He gets a 730 combined score on his SAT.) Though he appeared throughout the entire series, he usually had only minor parts in episodes. Randy and Paul are the only characters to remain on throughout the series as Kevin's friends in both junior high and high school. ; Doug Porter (Brandon Crane): Kevin's junior high school classmate and friend. He also becomes part of Kevin's entourage. In one episode, he briefly replaces Paul as Kevin's best friend after the two have a falling-out. Doug is very agreeable and loves to eat junk food. In later episodes Doug befriends both Kevin and Paul where they engage in activities such as touch football or sneaking to a sleepover attended by older teenage girls. ; Chuck Coleman (Andy Berman): One of Kevin's high school friends, who often appears with a \\"nervous tic\\". Chuck dates Alice Pedermeir and, on one episode, confides that he may have gotten her pregnant. However, much to his relief, the pregnancy test turns out negative. On another episode, Chuck punches Kevin in the face after he catches Kevin in a compromising position with Alice, who was helping Kevin to get a good deal on a used car. But they patch things up. ; Alice Pedermeir (Lindsay Sloane): One of Kevin and Winnie's high school friends, and Chuck's girlfriend. In the episode \\"Alice in Autoland\\", after breaking up with Chuck, she tells Kevin that she has had a crush on him forever, but then she comes back with her boyfriend. Everybody says she has an annoying voice. ; Cindy (Heather McComb): Kevin's high school classmate whom he had been dating. When Kevin lies to Cindy to break a date and go cruising with his friends and she finds out, she is left heartbroken. ; Brett (Jon Frear): Kevin's classmate. He was featured a few times during the series. 1992‚Äì1993. ; Coach Ed Cutlip (Robert Picardo): Kevin's gym teacher, who excels in bullying his students and always wears a red cap to hide his bald head, which has a steel plate in it. He enjoys drawing diagrams on the board that nobody can decipher, and Kevin describes him as having an inferiority complex. However, he is shown to be somewhat of a more sensitive person than usually indicated when he plays a department store Santa in a Christmas-related episode, where Kevin is the only student to know of Coach Cutlip's part-time job. Coach Cutlip is also aware of his mean personality towards the students, and admits to Kevin, \\"kids like me when I am Santa\\". During the 1988‚Äì1991 seasons, Picardo was simultaneously seen on the ABC Vietnam series China Beach in the role of Dr. Dick Richard, and is among a small group of television actors to achieve notoriety on two television series at the same time. Also, both shows, while airing in the late 80's/early 90's, were set in the late 60's. ; Jeff Billings (Giovanni Ribisi): Plays Kevin's good friend in the later part of the series. His parents are divorced and he lives with his mother, which is the reason that he moves in late. He has a girlfriend from his old town but breaks it off with her midway through the final season. ; Ricky Halsenbach (Scott Nemes): Kevin's classmate and friend. He also becomes a member of Kevin's entourage. He was Kevin's first friend to get a driver's license. He fell in love with a new student named Haley but broke it off with her after Kevin and Jeff made fun of the size of her nose. ; Carla Healey (Krista Murphy): Kevin's junior high school classmate and one- time girlfriend of Paul. ; Margaret Farquhar (Lindsay Fisher): Kevin's square dance partner in 7th grade. ; Lisa Berlini (Kathy Wagner): Kevin's junior high school classmate whom he develops a strong crush on. After Kevin works up the courage to call Lisa on the phone to break the ice, a steady relationship between the two seems promising‚Äîuntil Lisa unceremoniously breaks a date with Kevin to the Fall Dance to go to the same dance with another guy. ; Mr. Cantwell (Ben Stein): Kevin's junior high school science teacher. He often shows filmstrips to the class while speaking in a monotone voice with steady emotion (similar to his performance as the monotonous economics teacher in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which made him famous). ; Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Slater (Crystal McKellar): Kevin's junior high school classmate and one-time girlfriend. He dates her purely to make Winnie jealous and she punches him when she finds out he still likes Winnie. Because of that, she holds a grudge against Kevin and becomes a recurring, physically violent aggressive nuisance throughout Kevin's junior high school years. ; Mr. Diperna (Raye Birk): The Vice-Principal of Robert F. Kennedy Junior High and Kevin's nemesis. In the pilot episode, Kevin gets in trouble and is disciplined by Mr. Diperna. Mostly in the series, he usually gives Kevin and the students a hard time. He later fires Kevin's mom shortly after she is hired by the school as a receptionist. A more sympathetic portrayal of Mr. Diperna was shown in \\"Goodbye\\", where he privately confers with Kevin that Mr. Collins died and that he will replace him as Kevin's math teacher until they find a suitable hire. ; Teri (Holly Sampson): An older, attractive girl whom Kevin meets and has a brief fling with while on vacation in the episode \\"Summer Song\\" from Season 3, which is cut short when Teri and her family are called back home prematurely. ; Debbie Pfeiffer (Torrey Ann Cook): Paul Pfeiffer's little sister who has a crush on Kevin. Kevin takes Debbie to a dance in one episode and is given some money by her father. ; Craig Hobson (Sean Baca): Kevin's junior high school classmate. He often teases Kevin and Paul over their emotional hang-ups resulting from girlfriend problems, only to accidentally start a relationship himself by falling for Becky Slater when she hits him with her bicycle (her intended victim was Kevin). Craig's relationship with Becky stops her from harassing Kevin and allows the couples to happily co-exist. However, Hobson ends the relationship with Becky when his family enrolls him in a military academy for his ninth grade year, reviving her hatred of men and blaming Kevin. ; Miss White/Mrs. Heimer (Wendel Meldrum): Kevin's junior high English teacher. Kevin harbors a crush on her and sometimes imagines that she feels the same way. She gets married after the second season and becomes Mrs. Heimer, but Kevin continues calling her Miss White, which she always corrects. In one episode, a pregnant Mrs. Heimer needs Kevin to drive her to the hospital on the day of his junior high graduation as she's going into labor and can't find her husband. ; Michael (David Schwimmer): Karen's live-in boyfriend, and eventually, her husband. Kevin looks up to him as a role model and friend. Though a hippie like Karen, he's less opinionated, more level-headed and seemingly more mature than Karen. He and Karen move into the same place together before marriage, which upsets Jack greatly. Michael eventually wins Jack's approval and respect when he takes a job in Alaska, proving himself to be a hard worker who puts family first. ; Wart (Scott Menville): Wayne's best friend. Wart early in the series is much like Wayne: immature and dimwitted. He later joins the Army and is shipped to Vietnam. He returns much more mature and serious. He receives accolades and respect from people like Wayne, Kevin and Jack, but also receives threats and verbal abuse from other people. Wart is hinted at suffering from PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) after his time in Vietnam, in particular Kevin notices him shirtless and crying by himself during a football game. ; Bonnie Douglas (Paula Marshall): A 23-year- old divorcee with a six-month-old son whom Wayne meets at NORCOM and starts a relationship with. However, she eventually realizes she still has feelings for her ex-husband and breaks up with Wayne to reconcile their marriage. ; Madeline Adams (Julie Condra): Kevin's junior high classmate whom he develops a crush on after Winnie attends another school after moving. Romantic tension develops between the two, and after Kevin and Winnie break up, he starts dating Madeline. It's short lived, however, as Kevin still has feelings for Winnie and dumps Madeline after she badmouths her. (4 episodes) ; Cara (Lisa Paige Robinson): Kevin's girlfriend during his summer vacation at the lake. Unlike other girls he has dated, Cara is a bit rebellious (smokes cigarettes, etc.). She and Kevin keep in touch by writing letters to each other after he leaves. On a spur-of-the-moment decision, Kevin ditches a workday to visit Cara the following summer, but is disappointed when he finds out she has another boyfriend. ; Mr. Arthur Collins (Steven Gilborn): Kevin's math teacher in junior high. Despite his difficulty, and some misunderstandings between them, Kevin grows to have a respect for him and more than once regards him as a hero-figure. He dies of a heart condition in 1970. ; Kirk McCray (Michael Landes): A popular 8th grader whom Winnie starts dating in 1968. She ultimately breaks up with him early the next year. ; Brad Gaines (Mark-Paul Gosselaar): A student at Kevin's junior high school who inadvertently throws a monkey wrench into Kevin and Lisa Berlini's would-be relationship when he asks Lisa to a school dance and she accepts‚Äîafter she accepts the same date with Kevin. ; Mrs. Carples (Maxine Stuart): Kevin's Piano teacher, Kevin thinks he isn't good enough at the piano, because his rival Ronald Hirschmuller is much better than him, she gives him great life advice. ; Young Kevin Arnold (Jeremy Yablan): Appears in flashbacks to Kevin Arnold when he was a young boy. ; Mr. Nestor (Charles Tyner): Kevin's hard-of-hearing elderly shop teacher. ; Tommy Kisling (Jay Lambert): Kevin's junior high school classmate and friend who finds a copy of Becky Slater's election speech and tempts Kevin to use it. ; Brian Cooper (Bentley Mitchum): Winnie Cooper's older brother. He was seen in the opening scene working on an El Camino car when Wayne and Kevin are fighting, ordering Wayne to cut it out, to which Wayne agrees as (in the words of Kevin) Brian \\"defined cool\\" for all the kids on the block, being the eldest of the neighborhood kids at 19. He was then conscripted into the US Army. When Kevin and Wayne get disciplined by Mr. DiPerna for fighting at school, Mr. & Mrs. Arnold are called in. However Jack and Norma's attention turns to a more serious matter, as they are told Brian was killed in Vietnam, and go to comfort Mr. & Mrs. Cooper. Kevin is later seen with his family and the Coopers attending Brian's funeral, which Kevin recalls was the first funeral he attended which was \\"not for an old person\\". Brian's ghost then appears to Kevin at the wake, saying that he is fine with Kevin's growing relationship with Winnie; only for Kevin to give Winnie some space so she can help get over his loss.

Owing to the speed of the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, fighting reached French soil early in the war. Though their advance was stopped at the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, the Germans gained control of a portion of French territory which remained under German occupation behind the stabilized Western Front for much of the rest of the war. The occupied zone represented about 3.7 percent of French landmass and included some of the most industrialized parts of the country. 64 percent of France's pig-iron production, 24 percent of its steel manufacturing and 40 percent of the total coal mining capacity was located in the zone, dealing a major setback to French industry. A number of important towns and cities were situated within it too, notably Lille, Douai, Cambrai, Valenciennes, Maubeuge and Avesnes. Partly because of its proximity to the front, occupied north-east France was ruled by the military, rather than by a civilian occupation administration. Economic exploitation of the occupied zone increased throughout the war. Forced labor became increasingly common as the war dragged on. Much of the 1928 novel Schlump by Hans Herbert Grimm is set in German-occupied France where the protagonist works in the occupation administration.

It won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s). Lyrics and music \\"Down to You\\" uses a verse- bridge structure. It is in the keys of D major and E major. It begins with Mitchell playing a solo piano introduction. The theme of the song is the need to either change your life or take responsibility for it, since \\"it all comes down to you.\\" Music professor Lloyd Whitesell describes it as \\"a wry meditation on the transience of love and moral certainty.\\" The song takes place in the aftermath of a one-night stand. The verses provide philosophical ruminations about the situation, while the bridge provides more specifics. The opening lines of the first verse, \\"Everything comes and goes/marked by lovers and styles of clothes,\\" set the tone for the song. Sean Nelson describes the lyrics as being \\"terse but true, general but suggestive, clever but light, and they rhyme,\\" and also claims that with only those two lines Mitchell could have \\"had a pretty good song on her hands.\\" At the beginning of the song Mitchell seems to be addressing herself, or else a more generalized someone. The bridge begins with the lines: :You go down to the pick up station :Craving warmth and beauty :You settle for less than fascination :A few drinks later you're not so choosy These lines may also be addressed to herself, or may be addressed to the absent lover. The lyrics are ambiguous in this respect, and are also ambiguous as to whether the bridge is addressed to a real or fictional person, and even as to the gender of the person the lyrics are addressed to. By the end of the penultimate verse, a random encounter with a stranger in the light of day leads the singer to realize that \\"love is gone,\\" and the tryst of the prior night wasn't really love. This realization is underscored by David Crosby and Susan Webb joining Mitchell to sing the line. This recognition then leads to an extended orchestral interlude. While the orchestral instruments alternately take up the musical theme, Mitchell plays the piano using different types of chords, including major key, minor key, diminished and augmented chords. Music journalist Mark Bego describes Mitchell's playing as being like a jazz solo. According to author Larry David Smith, the final verse ends with \\"an acceptance of life's uneven qualities, and the resignation of acceptance.\\" Reception At the 1975 Grammy Awards, Mitchell and Tom Scott won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for \\"Down to You\\". Music journalist Mark Bego describes it as a \\"sheer masterpiece.\\" Pitchfork Media critic Jessica Hopper describes the arrangement as being \\"stunning in its complexity.\\" References External links * Category:Joni Mitchell songs Category:1974 songs Category:Songs written by Joni Mitchell Category:Song recordings produced by Joni Mitchell Category:Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) ","title":"Down to You (song)"},{"id":"42871133","text":"Kristian Blystad (born 18 March 1946) is a Norwegian sculptor.

Featuring material written by Wilson, it was his most successful album‚Äîhis highest charting album, his only Gold record and his only Grammy Award. Wilson introduces here for the first time on a comedy album his character Geraldine Jones, who delivers a retort to form the title of the album. Geraldine The character Geraldine was first introduced by name on Labor Day, September 1, 1969, in a television special put together by Wilson, his manager Kay, and NBC executives. The show was called The Flip Wilson Special, and its success led to Wilson's variety show called The Flip Wilson Show, first broadcast September 22, 1970. Wilson first performed the specific routine of Geraldine defending her new dress on The Ed Sullivan Show on January 11, 1970. In the routine, Wilson takes on the persona of a preacher's wife. The wife (Geraldine) explains to her angry husband why she has an expensive new dress, telling him that \\"the devil made me buy this dress.\\" She describes how the devil followed her on the street, flattered her with praise, showed her the dress in a shop window, pressed her into the shop, and then forced her to sign the preacher's name to a check. The preacher is doubtful; he says that she is too quick to blame the devil, for instance the time she rammed the car into the side of the church. She counters by saying that, at the time of the car accident, she was trying to wrest control of the steering wheel away from the devil, and she was also trying to kick the devil, which prevented her from using the brake pedal. Reception The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress entered the Billboard charts at No. 200 on February 28, 1970. It rose to No. 24 on the Billboard R&B; album charts in the U.S., and reached No. 17 on the Billboard 200. The album was certified Gold on July 22, 1970. It won the 1970 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards held in March 1971. The record was distributed independently until December 1971, when Atlantic Records signed a distribution deal with Little David. Production Veteran producer Monte Kay, president of Little David, joined with general manager Jack Lewis to produce the album. Sid Maurer was hired as art director. Audio engineer Gene Radice edited the recording, and Shelly Katz took photographs for the cover art. Licensing for public performance of the album was through BMI.

Early life Serdatzky was born on 15 September 1877 as Yente Raybman in Aleksotas (Aleksat), near Kovno (Kaunas), Lithuania (then in Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire), the daughter of a used furniture dealer who was also a scholar. She received a secular as well as a basic Jewish education, and learned German, Russian, and Hebrew. The family home was a gathering place for Yiddish writers around Kovno, including Avrom Reyzen, and in this way she became acquainted with contemporary Yiddish literature.Zucker, Sheva. \\"Yente Serdatzky: Lonely Lady of Yiddish Literature.\\" Yiddish 8.2 (1992): 69-79; here: 69.\\"Yente Serdatzky (1877-1962)\\" [author biography]. Found Treasures: Stories by Yiddish Women Writers. Ed. Frieda Forman, Ethel Raicus, Sarah Siblerstein Swartz, and Margie Wolfe. Toronto, Ontario: Second Story Press, 1994. 365-366.  Career  Serdatzky worked in a spice shop and ran a grocery store as a young woman. In 1905, the year of the Russian Revolution, she left her family and moved to Warsaw, to pursue her writing. There she joined the literary circle around I. L. Peretz. She had her literary debut with the story \\"Mirl,\\" published in the Yiddish daily newspaper Der Veg (The Way), of which Peretz was the literary editor. Peretz supported her work, and published further writings by Serdatsky. In 1906, reunited with her family, Serdatzky emigrated to the United States. After living initially in Chicago, she settled in New York City, where she ran a soup kitchen on the city's Lower East Side. She published short stories, sketches, and one-act plays in Yiddish periodicals including Fraye arbeter shtime (Free Voice of Labor), Fraye gezelshaft (Free Society), Tsukunft (Future), Dos naye Land (The New Land), and Fraynd (Friend). She also published stories regularly in the Forverts (The Forward), and became a contributing editor there. In 1922, following a disagreement over payment with Forverts editor Abraham Cahan, Serdatzky was dismissed from the staff, though her demands for payment (and the magazine's refusal) dragged into the mid-1930s. She dropped out of the literary scene for years, and supported herself in part by renting rooms. Much later in her life, from 1949 to 1955, she published over 30 stories in Isaac Liebman's Nyu-yorker vokhnblat (New York weekly paper).Zucker (1992), p. 70. Serdatzky's only book publication was Geklibene shriftn (Collected writings), published in New York by the Hebrew Publishing Company, in 1913.  Critical reception  Abraham Cahan described Serdatzky in 1914 as a successful writer of \\"tales of real life.\\"\\"New Writers of the Ghetto.\\" The Bookman 39 (March‚ÄìAugust 1914). 637. The characters in her fiction are often women like herself, immigrants and intellectuals, inspired by left-wing political ideals, while facing disappointment in their everyday lives and relationships.Bilik, Dorothy. \\"Yente Serdatsky, 1877-1962,\\" undated. Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia [online version]. Jewish Women's Archive. Retrieved July 27, 2014. Her stories at times convey a sense of \\"pervasive loneliness.\\" She was called \\"The Queen of Union Square\\" by essayist Sh. Tennenbaum in 1969. Interest in her work revived in the 1990s, and her work remains a topic of interest among feminist scholars of Yiddish literature, and scholars of American immigrant literature and culture.  Personal life  Serdatsky married and had three children. At least three of her sisters also lived in the United States by 1952: Mary Press in Chicago, Yetta Chesney in Los Angeles, and Mollie Hirsch. She died in 1962, aged 85 years.

The broadcasts were sponsored by the Electricity Council, as part of wider efforts to educate the public about electricity. In a fashion typical for such broadcasts of the period, the films were made to be frightening for young children ‚Äì depicting graphic electrocution scenes well before the 9pm watershed for programs unsuitable for children. Television transmission was typically most frequent during school holidays and at times of day dedicated to children's programming. The three individual films were in fact part of a longer 10-minute film shown in schools to highlight the dangers of electricity. The film was hosted by two animated characters, a Wise Owl voiced by actor Brian Wilde, famous for his roles in Last of the Summer Wine and Porridge, who indoctrinates a younger bird, a robin, voiced by Bernard Cribbins, in electrical dangers and then shows the three films as demonstration of the hazards described. The inclusion of these animated characters provided a reassuring presence to younger children who would have been potentially traumatized by the events depicted in the films. Within this longer film, all three separate films differ slightly from their individual TV broadcasts with very minor changes to the music. However, the first film 'Frisbee' is notable also for about 5 seconds of additional footage not broadcast on TV, showing more of the character 'Jimmy' forcing entry through the sub-station fence, and also an additional graphic shot of his legs on fire after his electrocution. The longer 10-minute film also features a fourth incident not released as a separate stand-alone TV PIF. This focuses on the consequences of vandalism to electrical infrastructure and opens with a teenage boy, encouraged by friends, throwing a chain up to a 132,000 volt pylon, causing an explosive short circuit which in turn triggers an area blackout. This knocks out power to local traffic lights, which results in a young girl being knocked off her bike and killed. It subsequently transpires that the dead girl is in fact the younger sister of the teenage vandal who caused the power cut. Within both the 10-minute film and as a stand-alone PIF, the film 'Frisbee' is not narrated. However, in both formats, the other two films are narrated by Brian Wilde and also commence and end with a white on black caption with the words 'Play Safe' placed between two prongs between which a violent arc of electricity then occurs. The 'Play Safe' campaign was superseded in 1989 by a new film called 'Powerful Stuff' which was also presented in both a longer version for schools and separate stand-alone PIFs for television broadcast. The tone of this later campaign, whilst broadly aimed at all ages, placed the emphasis on older children and teenagers. Television Broadcasts Play Safe was regularly broadcast during advertising breaks on ITV and Channel 4 well into the 1980s. The three broadcasts were: # Frisbee: The campaign was infamous for this PIF. A young boy named Jimmy accidentally throws a Frisbee into an electricity sub- station, where it becomes wedged into an insulator. Although reluctant to do so, his sister Amy persuades him to retrieve it. He breaks through the perimeter security, climbing up onto a high voltage transformer to retrieve the Frisbee. As he reaches out to the Frisbee, he is electrocuted and killed by a 66,000 volt current arcing from the insulator string, much to his sister's horror. The film cuts to a radio broadcast stating that he was killed instantly by a 66,000 volt shock and that children must stay away from sub- stations. # Kites and Planes: A young boy flies a kite near a transmission tower (pylon), not realizing that the kite control cord is a conductor. The boy receives a shock when the kite makes contact with a conductor on the 132,000 volt pylon. As a stand-alone TV broadcast, it is assumed the incident is fatal. However, within the 10-minute film, it is stated afterwards by the 'Wise Owl' character that the victim was 'badly burned but didn't die'. # Camping and Fishing: The film highlighted the dangers of using fishing rods and camping poles near overhead power lines. After depicting a few near- misses, it concludes with a boy receiving an electric shock from a wooden- pole-supported 11,000 volt wire when the mast of his boat strikes the conductor. Again, from the stand-alone TV broadcast, the incident is assumed fatal, but again the longer film clarifies otherwise, referring to the victim having been 'knocked unconscious but alright after a few days'.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Victoriaville, Quebec. After the war she was converted to a in 1959. In 1966 she was converted to a diving tender and renamed Granby, serving as such until 1973 when she was decommissioned for the final time. Victoriaville was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 2 December 1943 by George T. Davie Shipbuilding Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 23 June 1944. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 November 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin- screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in Bermuda, Victoriaville was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-9 in February 1945. She spent the rest of the war in Europe as a trans- Atlantic convoy escort. She returned to Canada in May 1945 and on 12 May escorted the surrendered into Bay Bulls. Later in May 1945, Victoriaville traveled to Saint John to undergo a tropicalization refit for possible service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration and water- cooling capabilities and changing the camouflage. The refit was halted on 20 August 1945 and on 17 November that year, she was paid off at Sydney and laid up at Shelburne. =Postwar service= After the war Victoriaville was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. However, with the increasing Soviet submarine threat, the Royal Canadian Navy sought to augment its anti-submarine forces. She was reacquired and converted into a Prestonian-class frigate. This meant a flush- decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She emerged from the refit and was recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 25 September 1959 with the new pennant number 320. Victoriaville was assigned to the Seventh Canadian Escort Squadron. Victoriaville served in an anti-submarine warfare role until 21 December 1966 when she was renamed Granby and was reclassified as a diving tender, taking over the name and role of the retiring , but kept her pennant number. She operated in this capacity until 31 December 1973 when she was paid off. She was sold for scrap in 1974. References =Notes= =Sources= * *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

After graduating from the German School of Thessaloniki, he left Greece in 1942 in order to study engineering at Vienna Polytechnic Institute. However, his interests soon turned to music, and he began studying composition at the Vienna Academy of Music, graduating with distinction in 1951.Œúaria-Dimitra Baveli, \\"Logothetis, Anestis\\", Hellenic Music Centre. Retrieved 26 May 2014 He was granted Austrian citizenship in 1952, and married that year.Biography at Anestis Logothetis site. Retrieved 26 May 2014 Logothetis then worked as a private music tutor. He received several scholarships to study composition in Rome, and took part in international seminars on modern music in Darmstadt, where he became influenced by modern composers such as John Cage, Earle Brown, and Bruno Maderna. Initially he wrote a number of works using conventional musical notation and different combinations of instruments and orchestrations. Around 1957 he started developing electronic music in Gottfried Michael Koenig's studio in Cologne, producing his composition Fantasmata in 1960. By the late 1950s he also developed his own system of graphic notation incorporating visual symbols, relying on their interpretation and improvisation by performers. It is said that \\"Logothetis employs this system to different ways of imprinting the contemporary sound on the score in order to express the sense of space in musical notation and redefine the roles of the composer, the performer and the audience, during the composition and performance of a piece.\\" He produced works for orchestral ensembles as well as electronic and multimedia music, and a series of radio operas. He composed his first computer-based work, Wellenformen, in 1981 in Stockholm. Concerts of his work have taken place throughout Europe, the USA and Asia. Logothetis died of cancer in Vienna in 1994.

Lamb and mutton are terms for the meat of domestic sheep (species Ovis aries) at different ages. A sheep in its first year is called a lamb, and its meat is also called lamb. The meat of a juvenile sheep older than one year is hogget; outside North America this is also a term for the living animal.OED \\"Hogget\\"; The term 'hogget' was only added to the U.S. National Agricultural Library's thesaurus in 2009 The meat of an adult sheep is mutton, a term only used for the meat, not the living animal. Meat from sheep features prominently in several cuisines of the Mediterranean. Lamb and mutton are very popular in Central Asia and in India, where other red meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. It is also very popular in Australia. Barbecued mutton is also a specialty in some areas of the United States (chiefly Owensboro, Kentucky) and Canada. Lamb dishes Aloo gosht is a meat curry in North Indian cuisine. It consists of potatoes (\\"aloo\\") cooked with meat (\\"gosht\\"), usually lamb or mutton, in a stew-like shorba gravy.

His notable achievements at the Consulate include the varied initiatives of outreach to the Indian diaspora as well as the mainstream American society.

Another similar lecture series focussing on the Indian states and named 'India-State by State' was also received well. He also helped establish a film and Literature Club in order to introduce Indian movies and literature to the American population. During his tenure as the Consul General, he has also appeared on Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, in a hilarious episode based on India's elections. In response to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, announced by Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, Mulay initiated a Swachh Consulate campaign in New York. This holistic cleansing campaign has set a model of Swachh Consulate campaign for other Indian missions abroad. Mulay also launched the Consulate at Your Doorstep outreach program with the aim of deepening understanding of US decision-makers on India-US relations and addressing the concerns of the community on passports, visas and other matters.

It was established in 1972 and located in York until moving to Bradford in 2007. Impressions Gallery also runs a photography bookshop, publishes its own books and sells prints. It is one of the oldest venues for contemporary photography in Europe. Operations Impressions Gallery is a charity, a not-for-profit organisation, funded by Arts Council England and Bradford Metropolitan District Council. The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows. The gallery space incorporates a bookshop. The organisation publishes its own books and catalogues, often to accompany its exhibitions, either by itself or in association with others such as Dewi Lewis Publishing and Photoworks. It has published work by Melanie Friend, Paul Floyd Blake, Joy Gregory, Anna Fox, Trish Morrissey, Tessa Bunney, Gavin Parry, Andy Lock, Stefan Ruiz and Laurie Long. History The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. Parr and Meadows showed work at Impressions throughout the 1970s, with solo shows of Parr's Home Sweet Home in 1974 and Beauty Spots in 1976 and Meadows' Free Photographic Omnibus in 1974 and Clayton Ward in 1978.Val Williams, Daniel Meadows: Edited Photographs from the 70s and 80s (Brighton: Photoworks, 2011), 21. Some of the other photographers whose work the gallery has shown are: In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to Centenary Square, Bradford. The gallery's archive, dating back to 1972, was given to the National Media Museum, Bradford, in 2013. It is called the 'Impressions Gallery Archive', a part of the National Photography Collection. It was believed then to be the first time a publicly funded photography gallery has had its archive cared for and made accessible by a national institution.

Biography Born in Pennsylvania, she earned degrees from Carnegie-Mellon University (BFA, 1982) and Northwestern University (MFA, 1986). The first phase of her exhibition career spanned the early 1980s through 2004 and focused largely on paintings using encaustic as the primary medium, and exploring color theory, geometrical proportion, and texture. These works have been presented internationally in a wide range of exhibition venues, including the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Art Cologne, Art Chicago International Expo, Galerie Waszkowiak (Berlin), Roy Boyd Gallery (Chicago), and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Budapest). Following grants from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in the Arts at Northwestern University (1998) and the Arts Council of Great Britain (2000), her artmaking began to increasingly employ time-based media (digital animation and video). This body of work has dominated her output since that time, taking the form of installations, video, photography, and performance. These works have also been presented at international venues, including the National Art Museum of China (‚ÄúTransLife‚Äù, Beijing, CN), the STRP Art and Technology Festival (Eindhoven, NL), Sony Center-Potsdamer Platz (DAM/Digital Art Museum, Berlin), the Taipei Digital Art Festival (Taipei, TW), and the Mondriaanhuis (Museum for Constructive and Concrete Art, Amersfoort, NL). An abiding concern in her oeuvre has been the perceptual process: ‚ÄúMy own interest in visual perception and its relationship to society is always fundamental to the work I create. To varying degrees both my digital and encaustic works address situations where cognition conditions conceptualization, and where a priori concepts influence the accuracy of one‚Äôs cognition. I am interested in the social and philosophical implications that exist when one realizes that ‚Äòseeing is not believing‚Äô. Ultimately, I intend the social impact of my work to be felt through its induction of destabilizing or stabilizing our perceptual complacence, since it is within the boundaries of our perceptual framework that we interpret and act within the world.‚Äù The ethical scope of Novak‚Äôs concerns has expanded in several recent projects ‚Äî pr!ck (2006‚Äì2008), scale (2010), Bird (2012‚Äì14) ‚Äî to address ethological topics via interactive installations. A significant portion of her work since 1998 has been collaborative, with those collaborators including musicians (Frances-Marie Uitti, Jay Alan Yim), computer scientists (Ian Horswill), neuromechanical engineers (Malcolm MacIver), as well as other new media artists. In 2010, she was invited by the College Art Association to serve on the Task Force on the Use of Human and Animal Subjects in Art; subsequently this organization published a report which includes recommendations for future art projects to consider as ethical guidelines. An interview with Novak published in the journal Antennae also discusses these concerns. From 1995-1998, she was a contributing editor to Flash Art Magazine. From 1984-87, and again in 1990, she served as a juror for the Chicago International Film Festival in the Documentary Films category. Parallel to her activities as an exhibiting artist, she has held a number of teaching positions. Currently a faculty member at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (Department of Film, Video, New Media, and Animation), her prior commitment to pedagogical issues was evidenced in her serving as Associate Director of the Animate Arts Program (2004‚Äì2010) at Northwestern University, an interdisciplinary undergraduate program she co-developed with Ian Horswill of that institution‚Äôs engineering school, along with other colleagues from the disciplines of film, animation, and sound design.

This would help elucidate the relative positions of the hydrogen-bond acceptors and substituted aromatic system to find the compound with the lowest Ki value in a series of benzamide opioids dating back to the 1970s. The original work found a mixture of agonists and antagonists. U-77891 acts as an agonist of the Œº-opioid, Œ¥-opioid and Œ∫-opioid receptors with Ki values of 2, 105 and 2300 nM, respectively. The compound has ED50 values of 0.02 mg/kg and 0.21 mg/kg in mouse phenylquinone writhing and tail-flick assays. One reason for the high potency is the LogP of 4.57, allowing it to accumulate in fatty tissue such as the brain.

The band has headlined tours of the UK and Europe, performed in Dubai, festivals such as Bearded Theory, Alchemy, Deerstock, Farmer Phil's Festival, Splendour and Beautiful Days, and toured in support of New Model Army, The Levellers and The Wonder Stuff. In 2015 the band played in the Field of Avalon at Glastonbury Festival, attracting the third largest crowd to the stage over the course of the weekend. History The band released a number of EPs before a first album on Weird Sounds in 2013, described by Louder Than War as \\"startlingly good, and so it should be, it‚Äôs been many years in the making\\". The album has been reviewed positively in both folk and metal sources. On 11 February 2015, Ferocious Dog announced that they would be releasing a second album, From Without, this was funded by fans pre-ordering the album in advance. It was produced by Matt Terry and mastered by Al Scott. It was released in October 2015 after single releases of \\"Ruby Bridges\\" in June 2015 and \\"Slow Motion Suicide\\" in August 2015. Touring the new material started at The Bodega in Nottingham on 7 March 2015, the first live appearance with the new line-up including Leslie Carter on guitar and Scott Walters on drums - it sold out in 22 minutes. This kicked off a busy year of touring and festivals, culminating in a sell-out home town gig at Rock City in Nottingham. Ferocious Dog are the first independent act to sell-out the venue in its 35-year history. The band encouraged those attending to bring items for a local food bank to the gig, completely swamping the room Rock City had put aside to store them in the process. The gig was filmed and recorded, and released as a CD and DVD. 2016 ended with a UK and European tour supporting The Levellers, including shows in the Netherland and Germany. Further shows in the Netherlands were played in February 2017.  Fans  Fans of Ferocious Dog are affectionately referred to as 'Hell Hounds' - taking their name from the Ferocious Dog song. They have a growing renown for lively mosh pits and increasingly elaborate stacking routines during the band's performances. Many of them have been tattooed with the Ferocious Dog fighting dogs logo by lead singer Ken Bonsall, a former coal miner who now operates as a tattoo artist.  Lee Bonsall  Pivotal to the ethos and drive of Ferocious Dog is the sad fate of Ken's son Lee. Lee served in Afghanistan from the age of 18, and upon rejoining civilian life took his own life in 2012 at the age of just 24, unable to overcome the post traumatic stress disorder he was suffering from stemming from one of his friends being killed by a sniper. Lee is commemorated in the songs \\"The Glass, Lee's Tune\\" and \\"A Verse for Lee\\" on their first album. This gave rise to The Lee Bonsall Memorial Fund which is a constant focus for fundraising and awareness building by the band. Lee's story was featured in the BBC documentary Broken by Battle. Lee Bonsall gave the band their name as a child.

It is based on the M113 armored personnel carrier, and was built by FMC Corp. at its San Jose, California, and Charleston, WV facilities.Hearings on military posture and H.R. 13456, p. 7795. Design Its light weight allows the use of a relatively small engine to power the vehicle, a 6V53 Detroit 2-stroke six cylinder diesel, with an Allison TX-100-1 3-speed automatic transmission, and allows the vehicle to carry a large payload cross-country and to be transported by fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. The driveline consists of a front sprocket, 5 roadwheels and a rear tensioner. Suspension is by torsion bar. Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light track. In off-road driving, the driver must be careful to keep the track tension constant. Even with a failed torsion bar the M548 is still roadworthy. The power of the motor drives the transfer gearcase, generator and the cooling of the differential/steering gear. The transfer gearcase can be used as a separating clutch when towing the vehicle and serves to reduce the motor's speed. The power transmission between the drive follows the torque converter with an automatic lock-up clutch. Variants =United States= ; M548A1 It has the same improvements as M113A2.

Also, the armor and weapons mechanic school's recruits, as well as at the tank mortar unit 16/5, used the M548. The usual load is ten pallets of eight 155 mm projectiles including charges and detonators. The handling is done with an electric hoist.

The town is the administrative centre of the municipality and the largest urban area in the whole Hardanger district. The town is located at the southern end of the S√∏rfjorden, in a narrow valley between towering mountains and the lake Sandvinvatnet to the south. The large Folgefonna glacier lies just west of Odda, high up in the mountains. The village of Odda was declared a \\"town\\" in 2004. The town has a population (2019) of 4,876 and a population density of . The town also includes the Eitrheim area, just northwest of the town centre. Odda Church is located in the town centre. Norwegian National Road 13 is the main road going through the town. History Odda has been populated for centuries, but in the 19th century, Odda became a significant tourist destination, and it was the centre of Odda Municipality. Visits ranged from English pioneers around 1830 to German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II, who visited Odda every year between 1891 and 1914. This led to the construction of several hotels in the town. Some of the main tourist attractions around Odda include the Buarbreen glacier, the nearby Folgefonna glacier, and the Hardangervidda plateau. The present Odda is a modern town which grew up around smelters built at the head of the S√∏rfjorden branch of the main Hardangerfjorden in the mid- twentieth century, drawing migrants from different parts of Norway. The carbide production and the subsequent production of cyanamide was started in 1908 after the hydroelectric power plant was built in nearby Tyssedal. The power plant provided the necessary electricity for the arc furnaces. The plant was the largest in the world and remained operational until 2003 when the plant was closed and sold to Philipp Brothers Chemicals Inc. The Norwegian government tried to get the site recognized together with other industrial plants as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2010, an international report stated: What makes Odda smelteverk so important and central to the application of Norway‚Äôs hydro power sites and pioneer chemical industry as a World Heritage Site is the fact that here in an internationally unique way the physical remains of an early chemical production process are still present.Riksantikvaren, Taming the Waterfalls , , Retrieved 2014-02-05. In 2020, Odda Municipality (of which the town of Odda was part) was merged into the newly enlarged Ullensvang Municipality.  Notable people  Dialect The town of Odda grew up around this smelter in the early-twentieth century, drawing migrants from different parts of Norway. As a result, there developed a new dialect, a mixture of that spoken in the home regions of the migrants--a phenomenon termed by linguists \\"a Koin√© language\\". Odda and the neighboring village of Tyssedal provided valuable insights to linguists studying this phenomenon. The researcher Paul Kerswill conducted an intensive study of the Norwegian spoken in the two communities, relating them to very different geographical origins: The workers in Odda came predominantly (86%) from western Norway. In Tyssedal only about one third came from western Norway; one third came from eastern Norway; and the rest from other parts of the country. The dialects that evolved in these two communities were radically different from each other, though spoken at a short geographical distance from each other.

Rafferty was born on 26 September 1926 and grew up on a farm in Ballinakill, Co. Galway, Ireland. He learned music mainly from his father, Tom \\"Barrel\\" Rafferty who played the flute and uilleann pipes. Rafferty emigrated to the United States in 1949 and settled in northern New Jersey. He became known in the Irish traditional music scene in greater New York City and appeared at an extensive array of concerts and festivals all over US including the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife in 1976, and toured with the Green Fields of America. Rafferty was influential in helping Ireland's traditional music organization Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann (CCE) establish itself in North America through the Martin Mulvihill Branch; since then, a branch has been named after him, the Michael Rafferty Branch in New Jersey. Rafferty made three recordings with his daughter, multi- instrumentalist Mary Rafferty Clancy, a solo recording, and a recording with fiddler Willie Kelly. He taught extensively, both privately and at The Catskills Irish Week, the Augusta Heritage Center, and the New Jersey State Council on the Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program. In 2003, Rafferty was named Irish Echo's Traditional music of the Year. In 2010, he was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts. With Paddy Carty, Jack Coen, and a few others, Rafferty was known as one of the best exponents of the East Galway style of flute playing, a rolling, lyrical style that is somewhat slower and less ornamented than other Irish traditional flute styles.

USFC Grampus was a fisheries research ship in commission in the fleet of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, usually called the United States Fish Commission, from 1886 to 1903 and then as USFS Grampus in the fleet of its successor, the United States Bureau of Fisheries, until 1917. She was a schooner of revolutionary design in terms of speed and safety and influenced the construction of later commercial fishing schooners.NOAA History: Report On The Construction And Equipment Of The Schooner Grampus Grampus‚Ä≤s home ports were Woods Hole and Gloucester, Massachusetts. During her 31-year career, Grampus made significant contributions to the understanding of the mackerel fishery off the United States East Coast , Canada, and the British colony of Newfoundland. She also investigated the tilefish population, conducted fishery investigations in the Gulf of Mexico, and contributed to fish culture work in New England to propagate the mackerel, cod, and lobster. Design = Fish Commission requirements = Fishery scientists of the late 19th century believed that successful spawning was the most significant factor in the productivity of fisheries, and the Fish Commission had placed the fisheries research ship USFC Fish Hawk in service in 1880 to serve as a floating fish hatchery that could move up and down the coast in accordance with the timing of American shad runs.NOAA History: R/V Fish Hawk 1880-1926 Grampus was constructed to fill a need the Fish Commission perceived for a ship with a well in which marine fishes could be kept alive and transported from the fishing grounds to fish hatcheries on the coast of the United States, where fisheries researchers could collect their eggs for use in the hatcheries and further ensure productive fisheries. Grampus also was to bring back fish for biological study of the fish themselves. Grampus also needed to be seaworthy and fast, so as to be able to collect fish from European waters and bring back to the United States fish such as sole, turbot, plaice, and brill - which were important to the European commercial fishing industry but did not occur naturally in the waters off North America - so that they could be introduced into waters off the United States. Grampus also was to demonstrate the method of beam trawling used by European fishermen in the North Sea but not in the United States at the time to catch groundfish, and to spur the use of beam trawling by American commercial fishermen in the hope of increasing the monetary value of the American catch and to provide additional employment for men aboard American fishing vessels. The Fish Commission believed that groundfish species native to the waters off North America could be profitably fished even though they differed from the species found in European waters, and Grampus was to use beam trawling to test this idea. The Fish Commission wanted to develop a comprehensive understanding of the migration of food fishes in the spring and autumn as they travelled to and from their summer feeding grounds, and chose to construct Grampus as a sailing ship because it wanted her to be able to remain at sea for weeks or months at a time to follow the migration continuously and investigate it completely without having to come into port for coal, as a steamer would. Grampus also had to be seaworthy enough to remain on duty and not lose contact with the migrating fish during bad weather. Finally, Grampus had to be designed and equipped to capture fish that did not swim near the surface in order to investigate fisheries completely, and she also needed to be able to capture and investigate minute life such as plankton, which supported the food fish population. Grampus needed a windlass in order to work her gear, and the Fish Commission opted for a steam windlass. United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Zera Luther Tanner, an influential inventor and oceanographer of the era, commanding officer of the Fish Commissions fisheries research ship USFC Albatross, and previously the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, received the task of determining what type of steam apparatus Grampus should carry. He chose a steam windlass with engines of 35 horsepower (26.1 kW). Operating the windlass required the installation of a boiler, steam pump, iron water tanks, and associated piping. = Speed and safety = An illustration of USFC Grampus from Report of the Commissioner for 1886, published in 1889.In addition to meeting the Fish Commissions research and fish culture requirements, Grampuss design also reflected ideas for improvement in the design of the then-conventional New England commercial fishing schooners so as to improve both speed and safety. In the mid-1880s, these schooners tended to be wide, shallow, and sharp so as to allow the greatest possible speed by reducing drag through the water and allowing the ship to carry a considerable amount of sail. In order to keep the hulls shallow, the schooners were \\"very wide aft, with a heavy, clumsy stern and fat counters, the run being hollowed out excessively so as to produce in the after section a series of very abrupt horizontal curves.\\" The two masts came to nearly the same height above the waterline, and the schooners carried a large jib extending from the bowsprit end to the foremast. This traditional schooner design had a number of drawbacks. The shallow hull did not, in fact, contribute significantly to speed, and the wide stern design actually hindered fast sailing. The ships shallowness of hull gave them a high center of gravity that made them prone to capsizing and sinking in heavy seas, often with significant or total loss of life among their crews. The foremast rising to the same height as the mainmast often meant either that the jib when raised to the top of the foremast caused an inefficient, asymmetrical sail pattern, or that the upper parts of the foremast were left unused; having a foremast that was taller than necessary added extra expense to the cost of the ships construction and also meant that she had an unnecessary amount of weight aloft, making her less stable and more prone to dangerous rolling and capsizing. The large jib also created problems, moving the sails center of effort too far forward when the schooner shortened sail and the mainsail was reefed, making the ship harder to handle. Moreover, handling the large jib required crew members to work on the bowsprit in bad weather, a dangerous practice that resulted in men being swept overboard and drowned. To address these issues, Grampus, although similar in design to the traditional New England schooner, also differed in significant ways. She had a hull Commissioner's Report 1901, p. 324. deeper than traditional schooners of similar length, giving her greater stability, and her beam was less than that of a traditional schooner. She had a straight stem, rather than a raking one, and her stern was narrower and more raked, with her after portion approximating a V-shape, all changes which increased her hull length at the waterline. Her foremast was considerably shorter than her mainmast, and her rigging was designed so that she could carry a double-headed rig forward that allowed her to use a smaller jib that could be furled upon the approach of heavy weather and a fore staysail running from the foremast to near her stem. The result was a ship able to achieve higher sailing speeds, able to make more efficient use of her sails, with no need for crew members to work on her bowsprit during bad weather, and less likely to capsize in heavy seas. Ideas for the changes in schooner design to make these improvements had been discussed as early as 1882, but Grampuss design was the first to put them into practice. A model of Grampus went on display in 1885 at the American Fish Bureau in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and attracted much attention. Her design influenced that of many future commercial fishing schooners. The U.S. Fish Commission‚Ä≤s Report of the Commissioner for the Year Ending June 30, 1901 said that \\"her superiority in safety, speed, and other desirable qualities has been fully established\\" and \\"[a]fter twelve years' service [i.e., through at least 1898] the Grampus is unexcelled in speed by fishing vessels or pilot boats Referring to shipbuilding in New England, the report added, \\"Nearly all of the fishing vessels recently built are deeper than formerly, and embody other features that characterize the Grampus. The spirit of improvement has received such an impetus that the best skill of the most eminent naval architects has of late been devoted to designing fishing vessels.\\" =Other characteristics= Grampus was of wooden construction, built largely of white oak with some white pine deck planking.Commissioner's Report 1887, pp. 444‚Äì445.

The Fish Commission commissioned Grampus on 5 June 1886 under the command of Captain J. W. Collins. She departed Noank that day for Woods Hole, Massachusetts,Commissioner‚Ä≤s Report 1886, p. xlviiCommissioner's Report 1886, p. 701. which was to be her home port. After a stopover at Woods Hole from 6 to 8 June 1886, she departed for Gloucester, Massachusetts, where she arrived on 9 June 1886 and took aboard her boats and fishing gear ‚Äì all of which had been manufactured at Gloucester ‚Äì and made alterations to her sails. That work completed, she sailed on 14 June 1886 to Boston, Massachusetts, where she took aboard her marine chronometer and \\"other instruments and apparatus.\\" She spent 16-22 June 1886 at Gloucester, then sailed to Woods Hole, arriving there on 23 June 1886 to begin preparations for her first scientific cruise. That cruise began on 21 August 1886, when Grampus departed Woods Hole to determine the status of the tilefish off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 702. Discovered in 1879,Commissioner's Report 1897, p. cxxi. first collected scientifically at sea by the Fish Commission steamer in 1880, and abundant enough in 1880 and 1881 to suggest the development of a new fishery, the tilefish had experienced a massive die-off in 1882, with many millions of dead fish found between Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Cape May, New Jersey.Commissioner's Report 1893, p. 34. After a week on the fishing grounds without finding a single tilefishCommissioner's Report 1886, p. 703. ‚Äì prompting Collins to propose that the species was at least locally extinct ‚Äì Grampus set course for Woods Hole, arriving there on 24 August 1886. The voyage doubled as a shakedown cruise, and it demonstrated that the steam windlass and its engines and boiler were too heavy for Grampus, adding so much weight forward as to make her difficult to manage in a seaway, and the windlass and its associated machinery were removed and placed ashore at Woods Hole.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 696.The Fish Commission steamer took the steam windlass aboard at Woods Hole on 13 September 1886 and transported it to Providence, Rhode Island, where the American Ship Windlass Company installed it aboard Fish Hawk between 14 and 26 September 1886. (See Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 696.) She therefore arrived at Gloucester on 2 September 1886 to have installed a new wooden windlass that had been manufactured for her there.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 704. With her new windlass installed, she departed Gloucester on 22 September for a cruise to La Have Bank and Roseway Bank in the North Atlantic Ocean south of Nova Scotia, Canada, and Seal Island Ground in the Gulf of Maine to collect live cod and halibut for return to Woods Hole for study and propagation, i.e., fish culture work.Commissioner's Report, 1886, p. 705. During the cruise, Grampus received a \\"perfect specimen\\" of the squid Sthenoteuthis megaptera ‚Äì only the second perfect specimen of the species ever collected and the first in United States, preceded only by one collected in Canada ‚Äì from the Gloucester-based schooner Mabel Leighton on 26 September 1886.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 706. However, she had little success in her primary objective, finding that cod and halibut caught in deep water died soon after being placed in her well, apparently because of the rapid change in pressure and temperature as they were hauled to the surface.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 709. Her attempts to catch halibut in shallow water met with no success.Commissioner's Report 1886, pp. 711‚Äì712. She returned to Woods Hole on 12 October 1886Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 712. and offloaded fish she had collected as well as seabirds her personnel had shot for study.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 708. Grampus made a single-day voyage to visit the mackerel-fishing fleet in the western part of Vineyard Sound off Gay Head, Massachusetts, then was engaged until March 1887 in voyages to collect spawning cod and investigate the fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, Massachusetts Bay, and Vineyard Sound, finding some success in bringing cod back alive in her well to Woods Hole, although over 95 percent of fish still died in the well.Commissioner's Report 1886, p. 716‚Äì717. On 3 April 1887, she departed Woods Hole to conduct a cruise along the United States East Coast from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.Commissioner's Report 1887, p. liv.Commissioner's Report 1887, p. 494. The reasons for the behavior of mackerel during their annual spring appearance off the coasts of the United States and Canada were poorly understood when Grampus entered service,Commissioner's Report 1895, p. 80. and the cruise began a lengthy involvement for her in examining mackerel behavior as she studied schools of mackerel as they moved toward the coast early in the fishing season and how factors such as temperature and food sources influenced their subsequent movements.Commissioner's Report 1887, p. liv. She completed this work for the season on 31 May 1887, then returned to Woods Hole on 4 June 1887.Commissioner's Report 1887, p. 495. On 3 July 1887 she sailed north to investigate reports of mackerel in the North Atlantic Ocean northeast of Newfoundland and collect birds, bird eggs, and remains of the great auk, which had become extinct in the mid-19th century. She proceeded along the coast of Nova Scotia as far as Canso, into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, north to the Magdalen Islands, to St. John's, Newfoundland, and then along the eastern coast of Newfoundland, finding no sign of mackerel but collecting many specimens of flora and fauna as well as a significant number of great auk bones.Commissioner's Report 1887, p. lv. She returned to Woods Hole on 1 September 1887.Commissioner's Report 1887, p. 509. She spent the winter of 1887‚Äì1888 making cruises off Massachusetts to collect brood cod.Commissioner's Report 1887, pp. 551‚Äì555. An illustration of the operation of depth sounding equipment aboard USFC Grampus in the Nantucket Shoals area off Massachusetts, published in 1893 in Report of the Commissioner for 1889 to 1891.From April through July 1888, Grampus returned to the mackerel fishing grounds between Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras, collecting living eggs and embryos for fish- culture work and experimenting successfully with returning living mackerel to port in her well. In May 1888, she also studied menhaden reproduction in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Late in the 1888 fishing season, she investigated the mackerel fishery between Nantucket and Virginia,Commissioner's Report 1888, p. lxxxiv. and she collected brood cod during October and the first half of November 1888.Commissioner's Report 1888, p. xxiv. This effort came to an end on 15 November 1888, when she ran aground during a gale on Bass RipCommissioner's Report 1888, pp. cxx-cxxi. (), a shoal in the North Atlantic east of Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts.MA Home Town Locator: Bass Rip in Nantucket County MA With the weather giving signs of deteriorating further, her crew abandoned ship. Unmanned, she floated free and was adrift for several days before she was recovered and taken to Woods Hole. She underwent repairs at Gloucester. Grampus departed Woods Hole on 14 January 1889, arrived at Key West, Florida, on 27 January 1889, and began operations in the Gulf of Mexico to study the red snapper fishery on the continental shelf off the west coast of Florida in waters deep, continuing these operations until 27 March 1889 and battling a great deal of stormy weather to conduct her investigation.Commissioner's Report 1888, pp. xiii, lvi-lvii. From late July through early September 1889 she conducted research in waters south of Massachusetts and Rhode Island and between the eastern end of Nantucket Island and Block Island, taking water temperature readings to a depth of as much as and making meteorological observations at stations along a series of parallel lines extending as far as from the coast.Commissioner's Report 1889‚Äì1891, pp. 6‚Äì7.Commissioner's Report 1889‚Äì1891, pp. 125‚Äì126. Her work began a multiyear effort to record temperatures in vertical water columns and associated weather above those columns to discern the interaction between the Gulf Stream and colder waters and the possible effect of that interaction on the behavior of various food fishes, especially the mackerel. In September 1889 she began collecting cod eggs off Massachusetts for the Bureau of Fisheries station at Gloucester, continuing that work until the following spring.Commissioner's Report 1889‚Äì1891, p. 22. 1890s A undated view at sea of the stern of Grampus. Her commanding officer, identified as Captain Adams, steers at right. Grampus completed her cod collection duties off Massachusetts for the season in May 1890. From 3 July to 25 August 1890, she resumed the work of recording water temperatures and weather off southern New England she had begun in the summer of 1889, this time joined in the effort by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey survey steamer and observers stationed aboard the Nantucket South Shoals Lightship. Grampus again collected brood cod over the winter of 1890‚Äì1891.Commissioner's Report 1889‚Äì1891, p. 23. From 5 May to 18 June 1891, she again investigated the mackerel fishery off the U.S. East Coast between Massachusetts and Delaware, continuing the inquiry into how weather and water temperature influenced the seasonal movements of mackerel.Commissioner's Report 1889‚Äì1891, p. 129. Following that, she operated off southern New England for the third consecutive summer, from 30 June to 1 September 1891, to continue the study of vertical water columns and weather begun in 1889, this time operating only with the support of personnel embarked on the lightship.Commissioner's Report 1892, p. cvii.Commissioner's Report 1893, p. 33. On 5 September 1891, Grampus was on a voyage from Hyannis, Massachusetts, to Woods Hole with U.S. Commissioner of Fisheries Marshall McDonald and his wife and daughter, Assistant U.S. Fish Commissioner J. W. Collins (her former captain), and two female guests aboard when she ran aground on L'Hommidieu Shoal in Vineyard Sound during a southeasterly storm. McDonald, Collins, McDonalds family members, and the other two women made it safely to Falmouth, Massachusetts, in a dory, and Grampus later was refloated and returned to service.Fisheries Historical Timeline: Historical Highlights 1890s In late June 1892, Grampus began an assignment in the lower Chesapeake Bay and the waters of the North Atlantic outside its mouth to ascertain the abundance of fishes in the region; she completed this work on 20 July 1892.Commissioner's Report 1893, p. 48. Before the end of July, with Commissioner McDonald aboard, she began an investigation under his personal direction of the waters off southern New England to see if the tilefish had returned to those waters; the water-column studies of 1889 through 1891 in which she had participated demonstrated a return of warmer water to the depths the tilefish inhabited, and during several voyages in waters between Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and Cape Henlopen, Delaware, she collected eight tilefish during the remainder of the summer, the first found there since the tremendous tilefish die-off of 1882.Commissioner's Report 1893, pp. 32‚Äì35. This finding supported a hypothesis that an influx of cold water had killed the tilefish in 1882 and that the species would reestablish itself as warmer water spread back into the area. She spent the autumn of 1892 and winter of 1892‚Äì1893 in New England waters on fish egg collection duties and in largely unsuccessful attempts to capture live cod.Commissioner's Report 1893, pp. 86, 88. In the spring of 1893, the Fish Commission tasked Grampus to evaluate the success of a five-year ban the United States Congress had passed in 1886 on the taking of mackerel prior to 1 June of each year ‚Äì a prohibition which had expired after the 1892 season ‚Äì by following the commercial fishing fleet throughout the entire 1893 spring mackerel season to see what effect the five- year ban had had on the mackerel population off the U.S. East Coast.Commissioner's Report 1893, p. 46. During her cruise, she was to obtain specimens of mackerel, record physical conditions continually, and use towed nets to gather organisms that mackerel feed on.Commissioner's Report 1893, p. 47. Departing Woods Hole on 10 April 1893, she arrived at Lewes, Delaware, on 21 April after a stormy passage and met the mackerel fleet there. The mackerel catch and weather both were poor, and by mid-May 1893 the fleet had moved north, following the mackerel in their annual migration. After calling at Woods Hole for supplies, Grampus departed on 23 May 1893 to follow the fleet to the waters off Nova Scotia. There the mackerel catch improved significantly after 1 June 1893, and Grampus returned to Woods Hole in late June 1893 with a good collection of specimens and complete set of observations. She again searched for tilefish in July and August 1893 with Commissioner McDonald aboard.Commissioner's Report 1894, p. 95. Grampus again shadowed the mackerel fleet in the spring of 1894, departing Gloucester on 7 April. She was bound from Gloucester to Woods Hole before proceeding to Lewes when a serious nor'easter struck, raising significant concerns for her safety.Anonymous, \\"Anxiety Felt For the Grampus,\\" The New York Times, April 13, 1894. She survived, however, and operated from Lewes from 20 April to 10 May, hampered as she had been a year earlier by heavy weather.Commissioner's Report 1894, p. 47. She followed the fleet north to fishing grounds off the coast of New York, and then across Georges Bank to Cape Sable Island and Nova Scotia.Commissioner's Report 1894, p. 93. She then continued to follow schools of mackerel into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence as far north as Cape North on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. Completing this work she departed for Gloucester on 13 June, arriving there on 25 June. During the last half of July and first half of August 1894, she cruised the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to examine the mackerel fishery there. After egg collection duty in the autumn of 1894 and winter of 1894‚Äì1895, she spent another spring in 1895 following mackerel schools, beginning her cruise on 12 April, operating from Lewes until 10 May, then following the mackerel to waters off New York, across Georges Bank and Browns Bank to Nova Scotia, to Cape North, and then briefly in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before returning to Gloucester, where she arrived on 30 June 1895. From 8 August to late September 1895, she conducted the first investigation of mackerel abundance and behavior and associated environmental factors in the waters off northern New England, operating between the Bay of Fundy and Block Island.Commissioner's Report 1896, pp. 103‚Äì104. Grampus resumed the collection of information on the mackerel in the spring of 1896, leaving Gloucester on 11 April, arriving at Lewes on 16 April, leaving Lewes on 8 May, and working her way north along the coast of New Jersey and east along the coast of Long Island and Block Island before arriving at Woods Hole on 14 May. In May and early June 1896 Grampus collected mackerel eggs in the Vineyard Sound area and off Chatham, Massachusetts,Commissioner's Report 1896, pp. 30, 105., and in the latter part of June she was stationed at Small Point, Maine, to collect mackerel eggs in support of the Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk at Casco Bay.Commissioner's Report 1896, pp. 11, 35. The lobster fishery had been in decline for a number of years,Commissioner's Report 1897, p. vi. so in July Grampus moved to Rockland, Maine, to support Fish Hawk, which had moved to Boothbay Harbor, in collecting lobster eggs, concluding this work on 3 August 1896 and returning to Gloucester.Commissioner's Report 1896, p. 37. During the autumn of 1896 and over the winter of 1896‚Äì1897 she collected cod eggs.Commissioner's Report 1897, p. xxxv. From May to June 1897, she collected lobsters along the coast of Maine from Portland to Rockland and transported them to the Fish Commission station at Gloucester with no difficulty; after the lobsters had been stripped of their eggs at Gloucester, she then released them along with lobster fry along the coast of Maine during her return voyage.Commissioner's Report 1897, pp. xviii, xxxiii. She collected brood cod off Massachuetts in October and November 1897 and lobsters along the entire coast of Maine between April and July 1898,Commissioner's Report 1898, pp. x, l, lii, liii. and released lobster fry along the coast of Maine.Commissioner's Report 1899, p. lv. In \\"one of the most noteworthy investigations of the [Fish] Commission\\" and \\"one of the leading features of the fishing industry\\" during fiscal year 1899 (which ran from 1 July 1898 to 30 June 1899), she conducted a systematic study of tilefish populations on the edge of the continental shelf off southern New England and Long Island during three cruises between August and October 1898 and found tilefish in abundance, bringing back the hope the Fish Commission last held in 1880‚Äì1881 that a commercial tilefish fishery would develop.Commissioner's Report 1899, pp. xxiii, cxxx. In October and November 1898 she collected brood cod along the coast of Massachusetts for the Fish Commission station at Woods Hole.Commissioner's Report 1899, pp. xii, xxxvi. During the summer of 1899 she made three cruises to the Gulf Stream to study the state of the tilefish fishery.Commissioner's Report 1900, pp. 18, 122. She collected brood cod off Massachusetts for the Woods Hole station in October and November 1899.Commissioner's Report 1900, p. 44. 1900s Between April and the beginning of July 1900, Grampus collected egg-bearing lobsters along the coast of Maine between Portland and Eastport with the assistance of a steam smack.Commissioner's Report 1900, pp. 28, 32, 46. During the summer of 1900 she made a successful cruise to study the tilefish fishery.Commissioner's Report 1901, p. 128. In October 1900 she collected brood cod for the Woods Hole station, fishing as in years past in the vicinity of the Nantucket Shoals; she had caught 4,000 to 6,000 cod every autumn since 1897.Commissioner's Report 1901, pp. 2, 23, 199. In the spring of 1901, although delayed by stormy weather that persisted throughout April and early May, she collected egg-bearing lobsters for the Fish Commission‚Ä≤s Gloucester station during operations along the coast of Maine from Portland to Rockland, again assisted by a steam smack, and released lobster fry along the coast of Maine during her return trip from Gloucester.Commissioner's Report 1900, pp. 35‚Äì36. After a chase of several days and nights off the coast of Maine, she captured two harbor seal pups which went on display in a large pool as part of the Fish Commission‚Ä≤s exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York, but they both died during the exposition‚Ä≤s final week.Commissioner's Report 1901, p. 297. On 28 July 1901, Grampus embarked a small party from the Fish Commission‚Ä≤s Woods Hole station and left Woods Hole bound for fishing grounds south and east of Nomans Land to collect tilefish.Commissioner's Report 1902, p. 124. Reaching the fishing grounds that night, she began trawling on the morning of 29 July in the vicinity of at a depth of and two hours later brought 62 tilefish weighing a combined to the surface. She returned with them to Woods Hole on 30 July, and the Fish Commission shipped her catch to dealers in Boston, Gloucester, and New York City who had agreed to cooperate with the Commission in its goal of establishing a commercial tilefish fishery. She collected brood cod off Massachusetts for the Woods Hole station from 2 October to 3 November 1901.Commissioner's Report 1902, p. 38. From 18 April to 18 July 1902, Grampus collected egg-bearing lobsters along the coast of Maine between Wood Island and Eastport for the Gloucester station, assisted as in previous years by a steam smack,Commissioner's Report 1902, p. 36. and during the remainder of the summer assisted in the work of the Woods Hole station.Commissioner's Report 1903, p. 22. One of her most significant achievements that summer was in response to a request by fish dealers and curers for more tilefish with which to spur the development of a commercial tilefish fishery; departing Woods Hole on 30 July 1902, she proceeded to fishing grounds southeast by south of Nomans Land and on 31 July in five trawl sets at at a depth of caught 474 tilefish ranging in size from and totaling .Commissioner's Report 1903, pp. 84‚Äì85. It was the largest catch of tilefish ever made at the time,Commissioner's Report 1903, p. 85. and after she landed them at Woods Hole and they were shipped to fish dealers, the dealers found success in selling them. In the autumn of 1902 she collected brood cod at Nantucket Shoals for the Gloucester station. In the spring of 1903 she collected egg-bearing lobsters off Maine. =U.S. Bureau of Fisheries= 1900s An undated photograph of Grampus off Gloucester, Massachusetts. By an Act of Congress of 14 February 1903, the U.S. Fish Commission became part of the newly created United States Department of Commerce and Labor and was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries, with both the transfer and the name change effective on 1 July 1903. As USFS Grampus, Grampus became part of the Bureau of Fisheries fleet. In the summer of 1904, Grampus collected egg-bearing lobsters in Maine, and in October and November 1904 she collected brood cod off Massachusetts. Laid up over the winter of 1904‚Äì1905, she reentered service on 1 April 1905 for another stint collecting egg-bearing lobsters.Commissioner's Report 1905, p. 37. By mid-1905, the Bureau of Fisheries was reporting to the United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor that after 19 years of active service, Grampus would soon be in need of major repairs and reconstruction to keep her seaworthy, and that the Bureau viewed it as highly desirable that auxiliary motor power be installed aboard her to supplement her sails. In the summer of 1905, her usual duties of lobster collection were interrupted when she was tasked to transport Bureau of Fisheries representatives to Newfoundland to examine herring fisheries in its waters at the request of New England fishing interests and determine the effect on American herring-fishing vessels of fishing regulations recently passed by the colony's government.Commissioner's Report 1906, pp. 20‚Äì24. Grampus took the opportunity to make observations related to mackerel in the region and to study local fishing and fish preservation practices in Newfoundland during the voyage.Commissioner's Report 1906, p. 24. The Bureau representatives found nothing irregular and that Newfoundland was enforcing fishing regulations in accordance with the Treaty of 1818, but in mid-1906 the Bureau again reported to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor that the voyage demonstrated both the need for repairs to and reconstruction of Grampus and the installation of motor power aboard her if she was to remain an effective part of the Bureau‚Ä≤s fleet.Commissioner's Report 1906, p. 20. Grampus completed her annual lobster collection duties off Maine in late September 1906, then was dismantled at Gloucester in anticipation of undergoing the major repairs and reconstruction advocated by the Bureau.Commissioner's Report 1907, p. 18. After the U.S. Congress appropriated US$7,500 for her repairs,Commissioner's Report 1907, p. 20. she was sent to Boothbay Harbor, Maine, for reconstruction in June 1907. After the completion of her repairs and reconstruction, Grampus ‚Äì now referred to as an \\"auxiliary schooner\\" by the Bureau of Fisheries ‚Äì began a cruise of several weeks in July 1908 to study animal life in the Gulf Stream off southern New England, collecting creatures from both deep and shallow water and taking soundings and temperature readings.Commissioner's Report 1909, p. 16. In the spring of 1909 at the request of the Board of Trade and Master Mariners' Association of Gloucester, the Bureau agreed to investigate mackerel schools believed to congregate in waters remote to those visited annually by the seining fleet,Commissioner's Report 1909, p. 24. testing a belief among some fishermen that the replacement of older hook-and-line fishing methods by seining and gillneting over the previous 20 years had dispersed mackerel schools and led to a decline in the productivity of the mackerel fishery.Commissioner's Report 1910, pp. 28‚Äì29. On 7 April 1909, Grampus departed from Gloucester to conduct the study.Commissioner's Report 1910, p. 29. She joined the seining fleet at Lewes, Delaware on 2 May 1909 and began her mackerel study, making her first experiments that day at . Her cruise made experimental use of gillnets and lines to catch mackerel and tow nets to detect minute crustaceans mackerel feed on. Focusing initially on the southern fishing grounds from Cape Henry, Virginia, north to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where mackerel runs first began each spring, and hampered by stormy weather, she remained behind after the fishing fleet moved north to see if she could detect any mackerel remaining behind, as might be the case if newer fishing methods were dispersing them. No mackerel remained behind, however, and Grampus moved north to follow the fish, working her way across Georges Bank and Browns Bank and making port calls in Nova Scotia at Sandy Point from 5 to 8 August 1909, at Halifax, from which she departed on 12 August, and North Sydney, from which she sailed on 15 August. For the rest of August and during September she worked in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and along the south coast of Newfoundland; she then departed the region on 10 October 1909Commissioner's Report 1910, p. 34. bound for Gloucester, where she arrived on 16 October 1909. Her cruise failed to discover where the southern population of mackerel went after it disappeared from the fishing grounds off Long Island each year or where the northern population went after its annual departure from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, but Grampus did discover that weather and the presence of schools of predatory bonito had a much larger impact on the abundance of mackerel on the fishing grounds than previously suspected.Commissioner's Report 1910, p. 30. 1910s A photo which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration assesses as probably showing a dependents cruise aboard USFS Grampus ca. 1915\\\\. Inactive over the winter of 1909‚Äì1910, Grampus began her annual lobster collection duties in April 1910. She conducted her routine fish-culture work during fiscal year 1911 (1 July 1910-30 June 1911)Commissioner's Report 1911, p. 63. and fiscal year 1912 (1 July 1911‚Äì30 June 1912).Commissioner's Report 1912, p. 66. In July and August 1912, she explored the oceanography of the Gulf of Maine to determine the physical and biological conditions governing the distribution of fish food and young fishes.Commissioner's Report 1913, p. 30. In the summer of 1913 she studied the oceanography of waters from the Gulf of Maine to the Virginia Capes, discovering previously unknown scallop beds.Commissioner's Report 1914, p. 61. In late 1913 and early 1914, she provided living quarters for personnel collecting pollock spawn.Commissioner's Report 1914, p. 55. In the summer of 1914, she conducted oceanographic work from the Gulf of Maine to Nantucket, then was laid up over the winter of 1914‚Äì1915.Commissioner's Report 1915, p. 76. She resumed her oceanographic work in the Gulf of Maine on 4 May 1915, continuing it until 27 October 1915.Commissioner's Report 1916, p. 112. She was laid up for the winter of 1915‚Äì1916. From 18 July 1916 to 24 April 1917, Grampus conducted her final scientific work for the Bureau of fisheries, with oceanographic and other investigations off the U.S. East Coast and fishery investigations in the Gulf of Mexico.Commissioner's Report 1917, p. 102. Early in the winter of 1916‚Äì1917, she investigated banks near Cape Fear, North Carolina, whose productivity were unknown to fishermen; she was hampered by storms and was able to study only two of the potential fishing grounds, but found one to be a good site to fish for sea bass or blackfish and the other productive for drifting fishing vessels.Commissioner's Report 1917, p. 80. Later in the winter she moved on to the Gulf of Mexico, where she overcame interruptions by fog and storms to study the shrimp fishery there. In her otter trawl, she found shrimp in abundance off Mobile Bay on the coast of Alabama, on the southeast side of Ship Island on the coast of Mississippi, and southeast of Barataria Pass on the coast of Louisiana. Wrapping up her Gulf of Mexico work, she reached Washington, D.C., in April 1917, then proceeded to Gloucester. Disposal After Grampus returned to Gloucester in 1917, major defects were found in her hull that would require considerable expense to repair. Deeming her of obsolete design, no longer suited to its needs, and not worth repairing, the Bureau of Fisheries condemned and sold her in 1918.Commissioner's Report 1918, p. 93.NOAA Photo Library No caption. Perhaps a dependents cruise on the Bureau of Fisheries schooner GRAMPUS. The GRAMPUS was condemned and sold in 1918.

It saw its first combat experience recapturing Mariupol from pro-Russian separatists forces in June 2014. Initially formed as a volunteer militia on 5 May 2014 during the 2014 Ukrainian crisis, on 12 November 2014, Azov was incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine. All regiment members were contract soldiers serving in the National Guard of Ukraine. In 2014, the regiment gained notoriety after allegations emerged of torture and war crimes, as well as neo-Nazi sympathies and usage of associated symbols by the regiment itself, as seen in their logo featuring the Wolfsangel, one of the original symbols used by the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich.

History  The Azov Battalion has its roots in a group of Ultras of FC Metalist Kharkiv named \\"Sect 82\\" (1982 is the year of the founding of the group). \\"We are trying to come to power through elections, but we have all sorts of possibilities\\" - as \\"Azov\\" becomes party, Hromadske.TV (13 October 2016) \\"Sect 82\\" was (at least until September 2013) allied with FC Spartak Moscow Ultras. Late February 2014, during the 2014 Ukrainian crisis when a separatist movement was active in Kharkiv, \\"Sect 82\\" occupied the Kharkiv Oblast regional administration building in Kharkiv and served as a local \\"self-defense\\"-force. Soon, on the basis of \\"Sect 82\\" there was formed a volunteer militia called \\"Eastern Corps\\". A soldier of the Azov Battalion with a heavy machine gun. On 13 April 2014 Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov issued a decree authorizing creating new paramilitary forces from civilians up to 12,000. –î–ª—è —É—Ä–µ–≥—É–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –Æ–≥–æ-–í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–µ –ú–í–î —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–µ—Ç —Å–ø–µ—Ü–ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫–∞ , Arena.in.ua, 15 April 2014. The Azov Battalion (using \\"Eastern Corps\\" as its backbone) was formed on 5 May 2014 in Berdiansk by a white nationalist. Many members of Patriot of Ukraine joined the battalion. Among the early patrons of the battalion were a member of the Verkhovna Rada Oleh Lyashko, and an ultra-nationalist Dmytro Korchynsky and businessman Serhiy Taruta and Avakov. The battalion then received training near Kyiv by instructors with experience in the Georgian Armed Forces. The battalion started in Mariupol where it was involved in combat, and was briefly relocated to Berdiansk.Azov Battalion announced signing of new warriors, TSN News, May 20, 2014. On 10 June, the battalion dismissed deputy commander Yaroslav Honchar and distanced themselves from him after Honchar made criticizing statements about looting and debauchery in Azov battalion. Igor Mosiychuk became deputy commander. In June 2014, Anton Herashchenko (an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs) said that it was planned that the Azov battalion would have a strength of 400 people, and the salary for volunteers would be 4,300 hryvnia ($360) This gives an exchange rate of $0.08409 per hryvnia (11.892 hryvnia = $1) for 25 June 2014. per month. (Contract soldiers were paid 1,505 hryvnia per month.) On 11 August, Azov battalion, backed by Ukrainian paratroopers, captured Marinka from pro- Russian rebels and entered the suburbs of Donetsk clashing with Donetsk People's Republic fighters. In early September 2014, the Azov battalion was engaged in the Second Battle of Mariupol. Regarding the ceasefire agreed on 5 September, Biletskiy stated \\"If it was a tactical move there is nothing wrong with it ... if it's an attempt to reach an agreement concerning Ukrainian soil with separatists then obviously it's a betrayal.\\" In September 2014, the Azov battalion was expanded from a battalion to a regiment and enrolled into the National Guard of Ukraine.. This gives an exchange rate of 19.0000 hryvnia = $1. At about this time it started receiving increased supplies of heavy arms. The Azov battalion received funding from the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and other sources (believed to be Ukrainian oligarchs). So whilst its volunteers were officially paid 6,000 hryvnia ($316) per month, they really received around 10,000 hryvnia ($526) per month. The national socialist \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" websites were shut down or put under restricted access. On 14 October, Azov Battalion servicemen took part in a march to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Kyiv organised by the Right Sector. In the 26 October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Biletsky, the battalion's commander, won a constituency seat (as an independent candidate) in Kyiv's Obolon Raion (Biletsky hails from Kharkiv) in the Ukrainian parliament. In his constituency Biletsky won with 33.75% of the votes; runner up Vadym Stoylar followed with 17.17%. In parliament Biletsky did not join any faction. profile, on the official website of the Ukrainian parliament Member of the battalion Oleh Petrenko is also an MP for Petro Poroshenko Bloc after winning a constituency seat in Cherkasy in the same election. Full list of newly elected People's Deputies, Televiziyna Sluzhba Novyn (12 November 2014) In his constituency Petrenko won with 41.15% of the votes; runner up Valentyna Zhukovska followed with 23.65%. On 31 October 2014, deputy commander of the Azov Battalion Vadym Troyan was appointed head of Kyiv Oblast (province) police (this police force has no jurisdiction over the city of Kyiv). On 11 November 2014 the Azov Battalion was officially incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine. As of late March 2015, despite a second ceasefire agreement (Minsk II), the Azov Battalion continued to prepare for war, with the group's leader seeing the ceasefire as \\"appeasement\\". In March 2015 Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in their Operation Fearless Guardian training mission. US training however was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as US House of Representatives passed an amendment blocking any aid (including arms and training) to the battalion due to its Neo-Nazi background. After the vote Congressman John Conyers thanked the House saying \\"I am grateful that the House of Representatives unanimously passed my amendments last night to ensure that our military does not train members of the repulsive neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, along with my measures to keep the dangerous and easily trafficked MANPADs out of these unstable regions.\\" However, the amendment has since been removed as of November 2016. In August 2015, the Ukrainian government pulled all volunteer battalions, including the Azov Regiment, off the front lines around Mariupol, replacing them with regular military units.Nolan Peterson. \\"Putin's War: Regular and Volunteer Ukrainian Troops Vie in Mariupol\\", Newsweek, 29 August 2015. The Azov Regiment was moved to a base in Urzuf, in the former seaside villa of deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the southwest of Mariupol. Beginning in 2015, Azov has organised summer camps where children and teenagers receive combat training mixed with lectures on Ukrainian nationalism. On 27 April 2016, 300 troops and light-armored vehicles from the regiment were assigned to Odessa to safeguard public order after Mikheil Saakashvili wrote in social media about a rash of pro-Russian \\"titushki\\" attacks on civilians. Azov published a media release on its website on 20 November 2017 noting that, on 16 November, it had met with a foreign delegation of officers from the United States Armed Forces and Canadian Armed Forces. In October 2019, members of the US House of Representatives from the Democratic Party requested that the Azov Battalion and two other far-right groups be classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department, citing recent acts of right-wing violence such as the Christchurch mosque shootings earlier that year. The request spurred protests by Azov's supporters in Ukraine.  Leadership and organisation  Andriy Biletsky leads units of the battalion on a patrol near Mariupol in July 2014. The regiment's first commander was Andriy Biletsky. Biletsky stayed out of the public spotlight working on expanding Azov to battalion size. In summer 2014, he took the command of the unit. In August 2014, he was awarded a military decoration, \\"Order For Courage\\", by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, and promoted to lieutenant colonel of in the Interior Ministry's police forces. Because Biletsky was elected into the Ukrainian parliament in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election he left the battalion in October 2016 (Ukrainian elected officials can not be in the military (nor police)). A 16 July 2014 report placed the Azov Battalion's strength at 300. An earlier report stated that on June 23 almost 600 volunteers, including women, took oaths to join the \\"Donbass\\" and \\"Azov\\" battalions.Will Stewart and Sara Malm. Ukraine's women sign up to fight as top politician claims number of children killed is 'ten times higher than official toll', UK Newsday, 23 June 2014. The unit included 900 volunteers . The battalion was originally nicknamed the \\"Men in Black\\" or \\"Black Corps\\" (ukr.: \\"Chorny Korpus\\"), a counter to Russia's Little Green Men due to their use of all-black fatigues and masks when raiding pro-Russian checkpoints. The group was funded from its origin by Ihor Kolomoyskyi, Cypriot-Ukrainian billionaire business oligarch. = Current status = The Ukrainian military decided to turn all volunteer battalions into regular military units for internal policy reasons. The Ukrainian government has opted to deploy only volunteer units to the Donbass front. In January 2015 \\"Azov\\" Battalion was officially upgraded to Regiment and its structures took a definite shape. A mobilization center and a training facility was established in Kyiv, in former industrial complex \\"ATEK\\" for selection and examination; and the personnel, composed by volunteers from all over Ukraine, has to pass through a screening and vetting process, quite similar to army's mobilization procedures. Recruits are then assigned to the combat units of the Regiments, or to support and supply units, where they undertake intensive combat drills training. Reconnaissance and EOD units are considered the √©lite of \\"Azov\\" and are manned by most experienced personnel (typically, former Ukrainian Army special forces or similar). Since 2015 the Battalion has been upgraded to Regimental status and \\"Azov\\" is now officially called \\"Special Operations Regiment\\", with combat duties focused on reconnaissance, counter-reconnaissance, EOD disposal, interdiction and special weapons operations. The regiment, the only territorial defense unit of its size in the NGU, is organized into: * Regimental HQ * 1st Commando Battalion * 2nd Commando Battalion (under formation stage) * 5th Tank Battalion * Field Artillery Battery * Reconnaissance Company * Security Company * Engineer Company * Maintenance Company * Logistic Company * Signal Platoon * CBRN- defense Platoon * 4th (Training) Battalion  Regimental Depot Kyiv  Regimental Depot Mariupol  Regimental Depot Berdiansk = Foreign membership = According to The Daily Telegraph, the Azov Battalion's extremist politics and professional English social media pages have attracted foreign fighters, including people from Brazil, Ireland, Italy, United Kingdom, France, the United States, Greece, Scandinavia, Spain, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Russia.Swedish neo-Nazis join fight in Ukraine, The Local Sweden, 30 July 2014. About 50 Russian nationals are members of the Azov regiment. Around 20 Croatians joined the Azov Battalion in January 2015, ranging in age from 20 to 45. After Croatia's foreign minister Vesna Pusiƒá confirmed that there are Croatian volunteers in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry called Croatia to withdraw its citizens from armed conflict.

According to Minsk Ceasefire Agreements, foreign fighters are not allowed to serve in Ukraine's military: since \\"Azov\\" Regiment was granted full military status, its foreign volunteers were compelled either to take Ukrainian citizenship, or to leave the Regiment. Despite the Minsk Ceasefire Agreements, the regiment still has foreign fighters, including an ex-British army serviceman Chris Garrett, a Brazilian nationalist named \\"Frank Horrigan\\" and a 33-year-old former soldier in the Greek army and French Foreign Legion known by the nom-de-guerre of \\"The Greek\\".  Human rights violations and war crimes  Reports published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have connected the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture. An OHCHR report from March 2016 stated that the organisation had \\"collected detailed information about the conduct of hostilities by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne (31km east of Mariupol), from the summer of 2014 to date. Mass looting of civilian homes was documented, as well as targeting of civilian areas between September 2014 and February 2015\\". Another OHCHR report documented an instance of rape and torture, writing: \\"A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence by 8 to 10 members of the 'Azov' and 'Donbas' (another Ukrainian battalion) battalions in August‚ÄìSeptember 2014. The victim's health subsequently deteriorated and he was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.\\" A report from January 2015 stated that a Donetsk Republic supporter was detained and tortured with electricity and waterboarding, which resulted in his confessing spying for pro-Russian militants.  Ideology  = Neo-Nazism = Emblem featuring a Wolfsangel and Black Sun, two neo-Nazi associated symbols The Azov Battalion has been described as a far-right militia with connections to neo-Nazism, with members wearing neo-Nazi and SS symbols and regalia and expressing Neo-Nazi views. The group's insignia features the Wolfsangel and the Black Sun, two neo-Nazi symbols.Azov soldiers have been observed wearing Nazi-associated symbols on their uniforms. In 2014, the German ZDF television network showed images of Azov fighters wearing helmets with swastika symbols and \\"the SS runes of Hitler's infamous black-uniformed elite corps\\". A Polish war correspondent gained access in 2015 to one of Azov's bases located in the former holiday resort Majak; Azov fighters demonstrated to him Nazi tattoos as well as emblems on their uniforms.Ch≈Çopcy z ‚ÄûAzowa‚Äù broniƒÖ Mariupola. Ukrainy, Europy i‚Ä¶ bia≈Çej rasy, Intera (8 July 2015) Shaun Walker writes in The Guardian that \\"Many of [Azov's] members have links with neo-Nazi groups, and even those who laughed off the idea that they are neo-Nazis did not give the most convincing denials\\", citing swastika tattoos among the fighters and one who claimed to be a \\"national socialist\\". According to The Daily Beast, some of the group's members are \\"neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and avowed anti-Semites\\", and \\"numerous swastika tattoos of different members and their tendency to go into battle with swastikas or SS insignias drawn on their helmets make it very difficult for other members of the group to plausibly deny any neo-Nazi affiliations\\". Michael Colborne of Foreign Policy has called it \\"a dangerous neo-Nazi-friendly extremist movement\\" with \\"global ambitions\\", citing similarities between the group's ideology and symbolism and that of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooter, along with efforts by the group to recruit American right-wing extremists. The group has dismissed accusations of promoting fascist symbolism, stating that any association with Nazi symbolism is a result of Russian propaganda. A spokesman for the unit has said \\"only 10‚Äì20%\\" of its recruits are neo-Nazis, with one commander attributing neo-Nazi ideology to misguided youth. Members of the unit have stated that the inverted Wolfsangel, rather than connected to Nazism, represents the Ukrainian words for \\"united nation\\" or \\"national idea\\". British political scientist Richard Sakwa writes that Azov's founding member Andryi Biletsky, leader of the neo-Nazi Social-National Assembly (SNA) made statements about a \\"historic mission\\" to lead the \\"white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival ... a crusade against the Semite-led Untermenschen\\", an ideology he traces to the national integralism of 1920s and '30s. Political scientist Ivan Katchanovski has compared the group's ideology to that of Patriot of Ukraine, saying, \\"The SNA/PU [Patriot of Ukraine] advocates a neo-Nazi ideology along with ultranationalism and racism. The same applies to [...] members of the Azov battalion and many football ultras and others who serve in this formation.\\" In June 2015, the Canadian defence minister declared that Canadian forces would not provide training or support to Azov Battalion. In 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives also passed a provision blocking any training of Azov members by American forces, citing its neo-Nazi connections. The House had previously passed amendments banning support of Azov between 2014 and 2017, but due to pressure from The Pentagon, the amendments were quietly lifted. This was protested by the Simon Wiesenthal Center which stated that lifting the ban highlighted the danger of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine. Despite accusations that the group is anti-Semitic, some members of the Jewish community in Ukraine support and serve in the Azov Battalion. One of its most prominent members is Nathan Khazin, leader of the \\"Jewish hundreds\\" during the 2013 Euromaidan protests in Kyiv.  Civil Corps Azov  The Azov Battalion also has a non-military wing and non-governmental organization called \\"Civil Corps Azov\\" created \\"for political and social struggle\\". \\"Azov\\" become party, gazeta.ua (28 May 2016) In 2016 members of Civil Corps Azov founded a social center \\"Cossack House\\" in Kyiv.  National Corps (political party)  In September 2016, the founder of the Azov Battalion, Andriy Biletsky, said that the Civil Corps Azov would be transformed into a political party. In early October 2016, Biletsky stated that the new party would use neither names nor symbols of the Azov Battalion. Ukrainian battalion \\"Azov\\" created his own political party, RBC Information Systems (12 October 2016) On 14 October 2016, this political party called National Corps held its first congress.Volunteer battalion Azov members and former members create National Corps political party, Interfax-Ukraine (14 October 2016) \\"Azov\\" creates a political party, Ukrayinska Pravda (12 October 2016) There delegates elected Biletsky to head the party for the next four years. National Corps is based on the (political party) \\"Patriot Party\\" (which was named \\"Civic Movement Honest Business\\" before 2015, \\"Azov\\" created a party who wants to restore the nuclear potential and legalization of firearms, Ukrayinska Pravda (14 October 2016)) \\"Patriot Party\\" was already registered by the Ministry of Justice. The party advocates expanding the powers of the President of Ukraine by granting him authority to be the Supreme Commander-in- Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as well as the head of government. National Corps favors restoring Ukraine's nuclear power status and nationalizing enterprises which were government owned when Ukraine became independent in 1991. The party wants Ukraine to break all ties with Russia (diplomatic, trade and culture ties). It is against Ukraine joining the European Union and against Ukraine joining NATO. It wants to create the \\"Intermarium Union\\" with Baltic and Black Sea nations (to include Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, etcetera). The party advocates expanding the right to bear arms and initiate public discussion about restoring capital punishment in Ukraine for treason and the embezzlement of government funds by officials in excessive amounts. National Militia In 2017 a group called the National Militia, closely linked to the Azov movement, was formed. Its stated aim is to assist law enforcement agencies, which is allowed under Ukrainian law, and it has conducted street patrols.

An enclosed weatherproof shelter with on-demand heaters is installed at UBC Okanagan Exchange Bus shelters are planned to be installed in West Kelowna. All completed RapidBus stops on Highway 97 are raised to match with the height of the bus floors, allowing faster boarding and wheelchair users to enter or exit bus without using ramp. Stops are designed to minimize the gap between bus and curb. Only Nova Buses are compatible with this set-up since double deckers and New Flyers are low-floor and will not be used for liability and practicality purposes. FRP plank is attached to the curve, allowing buses to contact the curb without damaging or scratching the vehicle. Tactile pavings are installed at all raised stops on Highway 97. Digital screens with real- time schedule information are installed at all stops as well. Most 97 Okanagan Nova Buses are equipped with a public announcement system featuring the same familiar voice announcing the Route upon entering the bus, and next stop, final stop announcements inside the bus. Inside the bus there is also an electronic sign that displays the Route when the doors open, then the next stop when the door closes, and will alternate between the next stop, and stop requested once someone requests a stop. History 97 Express was originally created to connect Orchard Park Shopping Centre, Rutland and the current UBC Okanagan Exchange via Enterprise Way and Highway 33. In September 2010, the first phase of Kelowna RapidBus service was announced connecting UBC Okanagan Exchange and the Downtown Queensway Exchange in Kelowna via Highway 97, replacing the old 97 Express serving Rutland via Highway 33. The Southbound McCurdy stop did not have a shelter or curb until late 2011. RapidBus expanded its service to West Kelowna on September 2, 2012, although the Westside stop was the only dedicated RapidBus stop. The route diverted from Highway 97 at several intersections to serve local stops. Infrastructure upgrades started in 2013 to further expand RapidBus service.

Tambjamines are composed of two pyrrole rings with an enamine moiety at C-5 and a methoxy group at C-4, and the majority have short alkyl chains substituted for the enamine nitrogen. This group of alkaloids have been isolated from marine invertebrates and bacteria (both marine and terrestrial).  Marine sources and ecological roles  The large nudibranch Roboastra tigris is a known predator of Tambje eliora and Tambje abdere, two species of smaller nudibranchs. The chemical extracts of all three nudibranch species contain tambjamines, which were traced to Sessibugula translucens, a food source of the two prey species. It is hypothesized that tambjamines are a chemical defense mechanism of the bryozoan against feeding by the spotted kelpfish Gibbonsia elegans.  Biosynthesis  MBC Biosynthesis YP1 Biosynthesis The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for tambjamine production was identified in 2007 using functional genomic analysis of a Pseudoalteromonas tunicata strain. The Tam cluster consists of 19 proteins, 12 of which were found to be highly similar to proteins in the Red and Pig pathways based on sequence data. The proposed biosynthesis of tambjamine YP1 involves the incorporation of proline, malonyl Co-A, and serine in the synthesis of MBC. AfaA is hypothesized to activate long-chain fatty acids while the predicted dehydrogenase, TamT, introduces a double bond into a fatty acyl side chain. It is presumed that TamH then carries out the reduction of the CoA-ester to form an aldehyde intermediate, followed by transamination. Condensation of the dodec-3-en-1-amine product of this reaction and MBC by TamQ, results in the tambjamine YP1.

He was born in Hamburg, Germany, and began studying violin when he was five years old. The family moved to the United States, where he attended the Rivington School in New York, but they returned to Europe when it became evident that Theodore was a musical prodigy. He was a concert violinist by the time he was 10. The family returned to the U.S. in 1870, and Theodore took positions as a violinist in several groups including Simpson's Theatre in Philadelphia, Wallack's Theatre, and several others. His best known composition was \\"Hearts and Flowers\\", which he composed in half an hour in 1893, and which continued to sell more than 100,000 copies annually until the end of his life. He was so prolific that his publisher, Carl Fischer, insisted that he use multiple pseudonyms; Fischer was concerned that nobody would believe how much Tobani was composing. Another popular work was \\"Our Little Nestling\\", written in 1883 for Mrs. Lester Wallack, for which he was paid $35. He also composed \\"Around the Christmas Tree\\", subtitled \\"A Yule-Tide Potpourri\\", which was later arranged for band by Louis-Philippe Laurendeau ed.

The crypt of the church has 12th- century mosaics depicting the zodiac signs on a marine background. The presbytery has a contemporary mosaic showing battle scenes and a depiction of Christ. In the 1500s, the church became property of the Hieronymite order, who reconstructed the church. In the 18th century, the church interior was decorated in a Rococo style, hiding much of the original Romanesque details. In 1721, the present facade was built.

The modern re-emergence of an Orthodox Western Rite begins in 1864 with the work of Overbeck, a former Catholic priest. Overbeck had left the priesthood, converted to Lutheranism and married though it is uncertain whether he ever functioned as a Lutheran pastor. He immigrated to England in 1863 to become professor of German at the Royal Military Academy, where he also undertook studies of the Church of England and Orthodoxy. Convinced that both the Papacy and Anglicanism were on the verge of collapse, Overbeck was received into the Orthodox Church at the Russian Embassy in London by Fr. Eugene Poppoff in 1865 as a layman because he had married after his ordination. As a part of his conversion to the Orthodox Church, Overbeck had requested permission from the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to begin a Western Orthodox Church in England. Initially, Metropolitan Philaret was hesitant about Overbeck's request but did not rule out the idea entirely. Overbeck outlined his rationale for a Western Orthodox Church in his bookCatholic Orthodoxy and Anglo-Catholicism, a largely-polemical work describing why the established Western churches should be rejected. In 1867, Overbeck also began to publish The Orthodox Catholic Review, a journal for the advancement of Western Orthodoxy. Overbeck had also begun to convince others of the feasibility of a Western Orthodox Church and was ultimately able to submit a petition of 122 signatures (mostly Tractarians) to the Holy Synod in 1869 to ask for the creation of a Western Rite. A synodical commission was established to investigate the question, and Overbeck was invited to state his case before the commission in St. Petersburg in 1870. Overbeck's idea received the approval of the commission, and he was instructed to present a revised Western Liturgy for evaluation by the commission, which he did in December of that year, and it was subsequently approved.Sobranio mnenii i otzyvov Filareta, mitropolita moskovskago i kolomenskago, po uchebnym i tserkovno- gosudarstvennym voprosam, ed. Archbishop Savva, Tome V, Part II (Moscow, 1888), 711-713. While Overbeck was making his overtures to the Russian Church, another anonymous individual was making a similar plea to High Church elements within the Anglican Church. The next several years were spent with further developing the Western liturgies for administration of the other sacraments as well as the praying of the Divine Office. Overbeck also attempted to reach out to Old Catholics since they had just recently gone into schism from the Roman Catholic Church over Vatican I's definition of papal infallibility. Overbeck also continued to criticise Roman Catholics and Anglicans as well as those Western converts to Orthodoxy who used the Byzantine Rite. By 1876, Overbeck began to make appeals to other Orthodox Churches for their recognition of his scheme. He received audiences with the Patriarch of Constantinople Joachim III and received recognition from the Patriarch of the theoretical right of Western Christians to have a Western Orthodox Church. However, Overbeck's efforts did not result in the establishment of a Western Orthodoxy. He attributed that failing to the hesitance of the Greeks in London (and the Church of Greece generally) to grant approval because of the \\"newness and importance\\" of the question and because the Greeks may have feared taking the wrong step and compromising themselves. The Orthodox Catholic Review published its final issue in 1885, and Overbeck died in 1905 without seeing the implementation of the Western Orthodox Church. Georges Florovsky summed up Overbeck's experience in this way: \\"it was not just a fantastic dream. The question raised by Overbeck was pertinent, even if his own answer to it was confusedly conceived. And probably the vision of Overbeck was greater than his personal interpretation.\\"Georges Florovsky, \\"Orthodox Ecumenism in the Nineteenth Century,\\" St. Vladimir‚Äôs Seminary Quarterly, 4, No. 3-4, 1956, 32.

It is based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches initiated and directed by James Bevel\\"James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement\\" by Randy Kryn, a paper in David Garrow's 1989 book We Shall Overcome, Volume II, Carlson Publishing Company.Randy Kryn, \\"Movement Revision Research Summary Regarding James Bevel\\", published by Middlebury College, October 2005. and led by Martin Luther King Jr., Hosea Williams, and John Lewis. The film stars actors David Oyelowo as King, Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Tim Roth as George Wallace, Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, and Common as Bevel. Selma premiered at the American Film Institute Festival on November 11, 2014, began a limited US release on December 25, and expanded into wide theatrical release on January 9, 2015, two months before the 50th anniversary of the march. The film was re- released on March 20, 2015 in honor of the 50th anniversary of the historical march. Selma received critical acclaim, with particular praise given to DuVernay's direction and Oyelowo's performance, though it was met with some criticism for its historical inaccuracies, largely centered on the perceived vilification of Johnson and the omission of several prominent Jewish civil rights leaders. The film was nominated for Best Picture and won Best Original Song at the 87th Academy Awards. It also received four Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama, Best Director and Best Actor, and won for Best Original Song. Plot In 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) accepts his Nobel Peace Prize. Four black girls walking down stairs in the Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church are killed by a bomb set by the Ku Klux Klan. Annie Lee Cooper attempts to register to vote in Selma, Alabama but is prevented by the white registrar. King meets with Lyndon B. Johnson and asks for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered, but the president responds that, although he understands Dr. King's concerns, he has more important projects. King travels to Selma with Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, James Orange, and Diane Nash. James Bevel greets them, and other SCLC activists appear. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover tells Johnson that King is a problem, and suggests they disrupt his marriage. Coretta Scott King has concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma. King calls singer Mahalia Jackson to inspire him with a song. King, other SCLC leaders, and black Selma residents march to the registration office to register. After a confrontation in front of the courthouse, a shoving match occurs as the police go into the crowd. Cooper fights back, knocking Sheriff Jim Clark to the ground, leading to the arrest of Cooper, King, and others. Alabama Governor George Wallace speaks out against the movement. Coretta meets with Malcolm X, who says he will drive whites to ally with King by advocating a more extreme position. Wallace and Al Lingo decide to use force at an upcoming night march in Marion, Alabama, using state troopers to assault the marchers. A group of protesters runs into a restaurant to hide, but troopers rush in, beat and shoot Jimmie Lee Jackson. King and Bevel meet with Cager Lee, Jackson's grandfather, at the morgue. King speaks to ask people to continue to fight for their rights. King receives harassing phone calls with a recording of sexual activity implied to be him and another woman leading to an argument with Coretta; she knows it is a fabrication but the strain of constant death threats has taken its toll on her. King is criticized by members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC.) As the Selma to Montgomery march is about to begin, King talks to Young about canceling it, but Young convinces King to persevere. The marchers, including John Lewis of SNCC, Hosea Williams of SCLC, and Selma activist Amelia Boynton, cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. The troopers order the marchers to turn back, and when the marchers hold their ground, the troopers attack with clubs, horses, tear gas, and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television as the wounded are treated at Brown Chapel, the movement's headquarter church. Movement attorney Fred Gray asks federal Judge Frank Minis Johnson to let the march go forward. President Johnson demands that King and Wallace cease their activities, and sends John Doar to convince King to postpone the next march. White Americans, including Viola Liuzzo and James Reeb, arrive to join the second march. Marchers cross the bridge again and see the state troopers lined up, but the troopers turn aside to let them pass. King, after praying, turns around and leads the group away, and again comes under sharp criticism from SNCC activists. That evening, Reeb is beaten to death by a white mob on a street in Selma. Judge Johnson allows the march. President Johnson speaks before a Joint Session of Congress to ask for quick passage of a bill to eliminate restrictions on voting, praising the courage of the activists. The march on the highway to Montgomery takes place, and, when the marchers reach Montgomery, King delivers a speech on the steps of the State Capitol.

Roger Mitchell as Frederick D. Reese Production =Development= Director Ava DuVernay On June 18, 2008, Variety reported that screenwriter Paul Webb had written an original story about Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson for Celador's Christian Colson, which would be co-produced with Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment. In 2009, Lee Daniels was reportedly in early talks to direct the film, with financing by Path√©. Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner of Plan B joined as co- producers along with participation of Cloud Eight Films. In 2010, reports indicated that The Weinstein Company would join Pathe and Plan B to finance the $22 million film, but by the next month Daniels had signed on with Sony to re-write and direct The Butler. In an interview in August 2010, Daniels said that financing was there for the Selma project, but he had to choose between The Butler and Selma, and chose The Butler. In July 2013, it was said that Ava DuVernay had signed on to direct the film for Path√© UK and Plan B, and that she was revising the script with the original screenwriter, Paul Webb. DuVernay estimated that she re-wrote 90 percent of Webb's original script. Those revisions included rewriting King's speeches, because, in 2009, King's estate licensed them to DreamWorks and Warner Bros. for an untitled project to be produced by Steven Spielberg. Subsequent negotiations between those companies and Selma's producers did not lead to an agreement. DuVernay drafted alternative speeches that evoke the historic ones without violating the copyright. She recalled spending hours listening to King's words while hiking the canyons of Los Angeles. While she did not think she would \\"get anywhere close to just the beauty and that nuance of his speech patterns\\", she did identify some of King's basic structure, such as a tendency to speak in triplets (saying one thing in three different ways). In early 2014, Oprah Winfrey came on board as a producer along with Pitt, and by February 25 Paramount Pictures was in final negotiations for the US and Canadian distribution rights. DuVernay did not receive screenwriting credit due to a stipulation within Webb's original contract, which gave Webb the sole credit. On April 4, 2014, it was announced that Bradford Young would be the director of photography of the film. =Casting= In 2010, Daniels (who was the attached director at the time) confirmed that the lead role of King would be played by British actor David Oyelowo. King was one of four main roles played by British actors (the others roles being those of King's wife, President Johnson, and Alabama Governor Wallace). Actors who had confirmed in 2010 but who did not appear in the 2014 production include Robert De Niro, Hugh Jackman, Cedric the Entertainer, Lenny Kravitz, and Liam Neeson. On March 26, 2014, British actor Tom Wilkinson was added to the cast to play US President Lyndon B. Johnson. On April 7, it was announced that British actress Carmen Ejogo would play Dr. King's wife, Coretta Scott King. On April 15, actor and rapper Lakeith Stanfield had reportedly joined the cast to play civil rights protester Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was shot and killed on a nighttime march and whose death led James Bevel to initiate the Selma to Montgomery marches.Kryn in Middlebury On April 22, Lorraine Toussaint joined the cast to portray Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was very active in the Selma movement before SCLC arrived and was the first African-American woman in Alabama to run for Congress. On April 25, it was announced that R&B; singer Ledisi had been added to the cast to play Mahalia Jackson, a singer and friend of King. On May 7, Andre Holland joined the cast to play politician and civil rights activist Andrew Young. On May 8, Tessa Thompson was cast to play the role of Diane Nash, a civil rights activist and founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. On May 9, Deadline confirmed the role of rapper and actor Common as James Bevel, the Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. On May 16, Trai Byers was added to the cast to play James Forman, a civil rights leader active in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. And on June 20, Deadline cited the role of Colman Domingo as SCLC activist Ralph Abernathy. On May 28, Stephan James was confirmed portraying the role of SNCC activist John Lewis in the film. On May 29, Wendell Pierce joined the film to play civil rights leader Hosea Williams. On May 30, Cuba Gooding Jr. was set to play civil rights attorney and activist Fred Gray. On June 3, British actor Tim Roth signed on to play Alabama governor George Wallace. On June 4, Niecy Nash joined the cast to play Richie Jean Jackson, wife of Dr. Sullivan Jackson played by Kent Faulcon, while John Lavelle joined to play Roy Reed, a reporter covering the march for The New York Times. On June 10, it was announced that the film's producer, Oprah Winfrey, would also portray Annie Lee Cooper, a 54-year-old woman who tried to register to vote and was denied by Sheriff Clark‚Äîwhom she then punched in the jaw and knocked down. Jeremy Strong joined the cast to play James Reeb, a white Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston and murdered civil rights activist. On June 12, it was reported that Giovanni Ribisi joined the cast to play Lee C. White, an adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on strategies regarding the Civil Rights Movement. Alessandro Nivola also joined to play John Doar, a civil rights activist and attorney general for civil rights for the Department of Justice in the 1960s. Dylan Baker was added to the cast to play FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover , who carried out extensive investigations of King and his associates, on July 17. =Filming= Historic photo of Alabama State troopers attacking civil rights demonstrators during the first attempt to march from Selma to Montgomery Principal photography began May 20, 2014, around Atlanta, Georgia. Filming took place around Marietta Square and Rockdale County Courthouse in Conyers. The Conyers scene involved a portrayal of federal judge Frank Minis Johnson, who ruled that the third and final march could go forward. In Newton County, Georgia, filming took place at Flat Road, Airport Road, Gregory Road, Conyers, Brown, Ivy and Emory Streets, exteriors on Lee Street, outside shots of the old Newton County Courthouse, also shots of the Covington Square, and an interior night shoot at the Townhouse Caf√© on Washington St. In Alabama, scenes were shot in Selma, centering on the Bloody Sunday march to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and at Montgomery, Alabama, where, in 1965, King led civil rights demonstrators down Dexter Avenue toward the Alabama State Capitol at the conclusion of the third march from Selma. =Music= Jason Moran composed the music for the film, marking his debut in the field. Common (who plays James Bevel) and John Legend released the accompanying track \\"Glory\\" in December 2014, ahead of the film's theatrical release. A protest anthem, \\"Glory\\" refers to the 2014 Ferguson protests and earned both the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Release Selma premiered in Grauman's Egyptian Theatre at AFI Fest on November 11, 2014, in Los Angeles for which it received a standing ovation. The film opened in limited release in the United States on December 25, 2014, including Los Angeles, New York City, and Atlanta, before its wide opening on January 9, 2015. The film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2015. It was released by Path√© February 6, 2015 in the United Kingdom. Paramount Pictures gave the film a limited re-release in the US on March 20, 2015 to honor the march's 50th anniversary. Selma was released on Blu-ray and DVD on May 5, 2015. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 99% based on 308 reviews, with an average rating of 8.52/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Fueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, Selma draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Martin Luther King, Jr. ‚Äì but doesn't ignore how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a rare grade of \\"A+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times praised the film as \\"an important history lesson that never feels like a lecture. Once school is back in session, every junior high school class in America should take a field trip to see this movie.\\" Joe Morgenstern, writing for The Wall Street Journal, wrote: \\"At its best, Ava DuVernay's biographical film honors Dr. King's legacy by dramatizing the racist brutality that spurred him and his colleagues to action.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the acting, directing, writing, and cinematography, and wrote: \\"Even if you think you know what's coming, Selma hums with suspense and surprise. Packed with incident and overflowing with fascinating characters, it is a triumph of efficient, emphatic cinematic storytelling.\\" Rene Rodriguez, writing in the Miami Herald, commented that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"DuVernay's look at Martin Luther King's 1965 voting-rights march against racial injustice stings with relevance to the here and now. Oyelowo's stirring, soulful performance as King deserves superlatives.\\" David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, wrote: \\"This is cinema, more rhetorical, spectacular, and stirring than cable-TV drama.\\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film four out of five stars, and wrote: \\"With Selma, director Ava DuVernay has created a stirring, often thrilling, uncannily timely drama that works on several levels at once ... she presents [Martin Luther King, Jr.] as a dynamic figure of human-scale contradictions, flaws and supremely shrewd political skills.\\" Praise was not unanimous. Writing about why Selma was not nominated for more Academy Awards, Adolph Reed Jr., political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, opined that \\"now it's the black (haute) bourgeoisie that suffers injustice on behalf of the black masses.\\" =Accolades= The film won and was nominated for several awards in 2014‚Äì15.

The film was criticized by some for its omission of various individuals and groups historically associated with the Selma marches, while others challenged how particular historical figures in the script were represented. Most controversy in the media centered on the film's portrayal of President Johnson, and his relationship with King. To people such as LBJ Presidential Library director Mark Updegrove and Joseph A. Califano Jr., Johnson was seen as a champion of civil rights legislation and a proactive partner of King, and they accused the film of falsely depicting Johnson as a reluctant, obstructionist political actor who had the FBI monitor and harass King. Having served as Johnson's top domestic policy assistant (including on issues of civil rights) and as U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Califano questioned whether the writer and director felt \\"free to fill the screen with falsehoods, immune from any responsibility to the dead, just because they thought it made for a better story\\". Historian David E. Kaiser complains that the film's depiction of Johnson as obstructing Dr. King's civil rights efforts‚Äîwhen, in fact, he helped get important legislation passed‚Äîadvances a false narrative that American whites are \\"hopelessly infected by racism and that black people could and should depend only on themselves\\". Andrew Young‚ÄîSCLC activist and official, and later U.S. congressman, ambassador to the United Nations, and mayor of Atlanta‚Äîtold The Washington Post that the depiction of the relationship between Johnson and King \\"was the only thing I would question in the movie. Everything else, they got 100 percent right\\". According to Young, the two were always mutually respectful, and King respected Johnson's political problems. On television, Young pointed out that it was US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy who had signed the order that allowed the FBI to monitor King and other SCLC members and that it happened before Johnson took office. Some Jews who marched with King at Selma wrote that the film omits any mention of the Jews who contributed significantly to the civil rights movement, ‚Äúairbrushing‚Äù Jews out of the film, particularly Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who appeared in news photos at the front of the march with King. Director DuVernay and US Representative John Lewis, who is portrayed in the film marching with King during the civil rights movement, responded separately that the film Selma is a work of art about the people of Selma, not a documentary. DuVernay said in an interview that she did not see herself as \\"a custodian of anyone's legacy\\".

A member of a prominent Surrey family, his career in Parliament was cut short after a few months by his premature death from smallpox. John was the eldest son of George Evelyn, of Godstone, and of his second wife Margaret Webb. He succeeded his father in the Godstone estate in 1699. On 5 May 1701, he obtained a marriage license with Ann Glynne, the daughter of John Glynne and granddaughter of the judge John Glynne, but the marriage does not appear ever to have been carried out. At the 1702 election he was returned unopposed at Bletchingley, where his father and grandfather had previously sat. On his journey to take his seat, he visited his second cousin once removed, the diarist John Evelyn, at Wotton, Surrey; the latter referred to him as \\"a young and very hopeful gentleman\\". Soon after the opening of Parliament, Evelyn contracted smallpox, and died on 13 November. His entailed estates passed to his brother George. John is believed to have been a Whig, but his short tenure in Parliament precludes a positive identification.

The undulating landscape has emerged as a result of comprehensive extraction of gravel followed by environmental restoration since the late 1970s. The area is owned by a company, I/S Hedeland, which is owned by the municipalities of H√∏je-Taastrup, Greve and Roskilde. The landscape consists of both woods and open land and has a varied flora and bird life. Many of the former gravel pits have been converted into lakes and ponds. Hedeland is also home to a wide selection of recreational facilities, including a golf course, a kart circuit, a vintage railway, equestrian centre, amphitheatre and fishing ponds. Name The name has been created from the words hede, meaning heath. The flat and fertile moraine landscape between Roskilde, K√∏ge and Copenhagen was from the Middle Ages known as Hedeboegnen or simply Heden (\\"The Heath\\"). Facilities =Equestrian centre= Hedehusg√•rden Equestrian Centre is located at Brandh√∏jg√•rdsvej 2 in the northeastern corner of Hedeland. Hedehusg√•rden is an old farmhouse which in 1892 was purchased by an engineer who wanted to extract gravel from its land. The equestrian club traces its roots back to 1946 but took over Hedehusg√•rden in 1976. =Vintage railway= Hedeland Vintage Railway is a 5.2 km narrow gauge railway operated by the Danish Industrial Railway Society. Built by members of the society, construction began in 1975 and the first short stretch was opened in 1977. It currently offers a 10 km return trip but plans exist to extend the railway all the way to Tune which will increase its length to 7 km. Service is both steam and diesel locomotives. Most of the tracks and rolling stock come from defunct industrial rail lines that were used for transporting sugar beets on the island of Lolland. =Brandh√∏j Miniature Railway= Brandh√∏j Miniature Railway covers 18,000 m¬≤ and has a total length of more than 1,200 metres. Construction began in 1984. =Motor sports= Roskilde Racing Center is located next to Roskilde Airport at Tune. Hedeland Motor Club (Hedelands Motorklub), a club with more than 500 members, opened a kart circuit there in 2001. It has a length of 1250 metres. There is also a cross circuit. The vineyard =Vineyard= In 1984, 1,000 grape vines were planted on a southwest-facing slope on the north side of an artificial lake. The number has later been increased to 3,000, of which half are Marechal Foch and half are L√©on Millot. The amphitheatre =Amphitheatre= The amphitheatre was constructed between 1994 and 1996 and seats 3,500. A self-owning, Hedeland Theater, now Opera Hedeland, was founded on 1 July 2002. It produces an annual opera. Previous performances are Tosca' (2005), Nabucco (2006), Carmen (2007), Turandot The Magic Flute (2009), Norma (2010), La Traviata (2011), Don Giovani (2012), Madame Butterfly (2013), Il trovatore (2014). =Golf course= Hedeland is also home to an 18-hole golf course. It is operated by Hedeland Golf Club. = Temple of Tokamak = The Temple of Tokamak, designed by Annie Locke Scherer, is a structure originally built by participants of the participatory art event The Borderland in 2019. The inspiration for its design was a Tokamak reactor, a torus-shaped device that generates a powerful magnetic field to create fusion. This is meant to be a symbol of the unifying forces of humanity that bring us together. This project was fully funded by Borderland art grants.

T. Loo (; 1February 1880August15, 1957), was a controversial art dealer of Chinese origin who maintained galleries in Paris and New York and supplied important pieces for collectors and American museums by illegally exporting a large amount of significant state cultural relics from China. He has been called \\"the preeminent dealer of Chinese art and artifacts for the first half of the twentieth century,\\" but also criticized for his illegal active role in removing antiques and archaeological treasures from China for sale to western collectors. Early life Lu Family c. 1900. C.T. Loo is in the rear, second from right He was born Lu Huanwen in Lujiadu Âç¢ÂÆ∂Ê∏° (Lu Family Ford) a village in Huzhou, Zhejiang, China, some west of Shanghai. His family had lived in this single-surname village since the 10th century. Orphaned at age ten, he raised by his uncle, but he decided as a teenager to try his luck in Nanxun, a center of the silk trade. He did well working under Zhang Baoshan, a successful merchant, whose son, Zhang Renjie, was appointed to the Chinese Embassy in France. Loo accompanied Zhang to Paris in 1902 at the age of 22. Few Chinese were living in France at that time, but Zhang Renjie invited Loo to work as doorman at his teahouse and then in his family Chinese goods import business, the gallery Ton-ying, in the Place de la Madeleine. Zhang used his connections in China to obtain antiques and works of art for the company. On his return to China, Zhang became an early financial backer of Chiang Kai-shek. pp. 146, 190, 451‚Äì452. Career and influence as an art dealer When Loo arrived in Paris, he wore the traditional Chinese gown and sported a queue, but soon became a Parisian dandy. He thrived in Zhang's store but felt constrained. Profits were not reinvested but instead used for the anti-Manchu revolutionary activities of his boss, who subsidized a circle of Chinese philosophical anarchists. In 1908, Loo, now dressed in elegant Parisian fashion and calling himself Cheng-Tsai Loo (Lu Qin Zhai), opened his own store on Rue Taitbout under the name \\"Laiyuan and Company\\" with branches soon to open in Beijing and Shanghai. Loo realized that Westerners preferred later works such as Qing dynasty three-color porcelains, which could supply in good quantities because of the political ties he formed. A friend remarked on Loo's sources in China: \\"being in touch with important people... he was able to know of precious works of art which had been hidden from the storms of many revolutions.\\" Loo's timing was good. The reports of the French archaeological mission on the Central Asian caves at Dunhuang made the taste for Chinese things fashionable, and Loo supplied high quality works to fit the new tastes. He developed scholarly understanding and expanded public taste in Asian art, particularly sculpture and early jades, by becoming friends with such eminent Sinologists as Edouard Chavannes, Victor Segalen, and especially Paul Pelliot, director of the Dunhuang expedition, whom he commissioned to write catalogs (as he did later with Berthold Laufer in the United States). The outbreak of war of 1914, however, meant that he could no longer travel to and from China through Siberia but was forced to return by way of the United States. He discovered a growing market for Chinese art in New York and decided to establish a new branch there in 1915. The move from war-torn Europe to the New World was prescient, since the United States became the dominant importer of Chinese antiquities from 1916‚Äì1931. thumbleft200pxTitle Page Loo's First New York Exhibition Catalogue Once established in galleries on Fifth Avenue, Loo's charm and connections in China proved effective and profitable. Loo, observes one recent scholar, lived in one of the most vigorous growth periods for the Asian art market. Wealthy collectors were learning about Asian art, as were well-endowed museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, and the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. In Europe, interest in collecting art from the Orient was such that the major dealers, such as Loo, the Duveen brothers, and the Japanese dealer Yamanaka & Co., could hold exhibitions almost every year, sometimes both in New York and in Paris or London.Vimalin Rujivacharakul, \\"China and china: An Introduction to Materiality and a History of Collecting\\", in p. 15Shirley M. Mueller, C.T. Loo and Charles Lang Freer: Neuropsychological Insights, Ceramics in America, 2015:52-60. Loo worked hard to establish personal relations with American museum directors and collectors. Between 1915 and 1917, he offered gifts to at least six museums. In July 1917, for instance, Loo wrote a postcard from Beijing to George Byron, director of the University of Pennsylvania museum, \\"Will write you if I have seen some fine things suitable for your honorable museum.\\"Ann Blair Brownlee, David B. Brownlee, Penn in the World Expedition 50.1 p. 39 Works which he sold to museums and collectors at this time are on display at the Freer Gallery, the Fogg Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, among others, including the Yixian luohans, Emperor Taizong's horses, and a Sui dynasty altarpiece from the collection of the imperial collector Duanfang. After the end of the war in 1919, Loo found himself competing with dealers such as Duveen for the attention of collectors. A revealing transaction took place in 1921. Loo offered what he thought to be a Tang dynasty bronze head of Guanyin to John D. Rockefeller, III for $40,000. Rockefeller, perhaps concerned that dealers would want to take advantage of his wealth, declined, offering $25,000. After further bargaining led nowhere, Loo sold the piece to University of Pennsylvania Museum for $40,000. Loo continued his attempts to develop a relation with the Rockefellers, however, hosting them in his Paris \\"pagoda,\\" though they bought little of consequence from him. The decade long boom in Chinese art came to a close with the Crash of 1929, and by 1931, the volume of China's antique trade with the United States had fallen to about half what it had been in 1926. The years up to 1941 saw a change in the nature of Loo's market as tastes changed. In the West, the study of Asia and Asian art became more professional as museums acquired curators to deepen and widen their collections and universities developed graduate programs. In China, the beleaguered Chinese government viewed traveling exhibitions which visited the West as a way to promote China's image, and Chinese art became an occasion for national pride. Loo's business reached its peak in the second half of the 1930s as he adapted to a more sophisticated market. Loo expanding his international art network to England, France, Germany, and America. Between 1933 and 1941 Loo launched at least one important exhibition or publication project every year. He continued to make major sales to his earlier museum clients, especially of bronzes and sculpture. Loo was instrumental in building the collections of the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City, whose organizer, Laurence Sickman, became a good friend. A series of catalogs and scholarly indexes displayed Loo's knowledge and experience. Among his most successful exhibitions was Three Thousand Years of Chinese Jade, held in 1939 in New York as a fund raiser for China's wartime refugees. The war in China, however, made it nearly impossible to find or export artwork, especially the sculptures Loo so admired. Another problem for Loo was that many of his early clients either died or lost interest. One new client whose interest grew was Eli Lilly, an Indiana pharmaceutical executive who assembled the basic works for the Asian collection of what became the Indianapolis Museum of Art.Shirley M. Mueller, C.T. Loo as Dealer and Eli Lilly as a Collector: A Tug of War, Traces (The Indiana Historical Journal, Summer 2013): 18‚Äì25 In 1947 Loo offered Lilly a group of Song dynasty ceramics for $54,350 which he had listed in his 1941 catalog for roughly half that price. Lilly, perhaps reasoning that Loo should have lowered, not raised, the price for works which had not sold, offered $40,000. After an exchange of correspondence which did not bring the sides together, Loo shipped the pieces to the museum and went himself to Indianapolis, bringing with him five further pieces.Shirley M. Mueller, C.T. Loo and Eli Lilly: Emotions at Work, Fine Art Connoisseur (July/August 2011): 49‚Äì50. When Lilly agreed to pay the original asking price, Loo compromised by including the extra pieces. All are now in the museum.Shirley M. Mueller, \\"Eli Lilly Collects: Emotion at Work\\" Vastari [n.d.]Shirley M. Mueller, C.T. Loo as Dealer and Eli Lilly as Client: Inside a Collector's Head, Aziatische Kunst, Volume 42 #4, December 2012: 3-1.Shirley M. Mueller, C. T. Loo and Eli Lilly: Neuropsychological Insights After 1949, the new Communist government gained control of China and cut Loo off from his sources. Some of Loo's associates were arrested, and Loo's nephew, who had been his agent there, escaped to Hong Kong. In 1950, Loo was forced to liquidate much of his stock, leaving the business to his long-time colleague and successor, Frank Caro. Controversies over Loo's export of Chinese art Sculpted relief of Emperor Emperor Taizong of Tang's Horse Sold to the University of Pennsylvania Museum by C.T. Loo 1918 The fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 weakened government supervision of antiquities and coincided with a growth of Western interest in them. Loo created a chain of middlemen who were on the lookout for items they thought he might buy, not only from now impoverished families, but also from imperial tombs, monuments, and monasteries. Loo sometimes suggested that the objects he had acquired belonged to nobody. He reported that an early Zhou bronze was \\"accidentally discovered\\" by a friend of Loo's who was digging a well for a new house. His name has been \\"notoriously\\" associated with two relief panels depicting the favorite horses of Taizong, the founder of the Tang dynasty, among the most important Chinese sculpture pieces outside of China. Loo sold these two panels \`\`to the University of Pennsylvania Museum in the late 1910s and the early 1920s for $125,000. Loo later wrote that two tombs discovered in 1924 contained archaic jades, and that he was \\"able to secure\\" the whole collection. Jades discovered in tombs at Jincun, Henan, in 1928‚Äì29 were \\"superb\\" and \\"thanks to an expert buyer that we had stationed in the village, we were able to secure nearly everything that came from these tombs, and most of them are now in the Winthrop collection at the Fogg Museum.\\" Others are in the Freer Gallery.\\"A Mystery of History A Jade and Gold Assemblage from Jincun\\" Freer-Sackler. Loo also arranged for a group of Buddhist sculptures to be removed from Xiangtangshan Caves in Hebei, North China. When they could not find a buyer in China, Loo shipped them to Paris, where they again did not find buyers. When these efforts had failed, he finally shipped them to the United States, where the Philadelphia Museum and Charles Freer bought significant works for prices which now seem quite low.Tom Swope, \\"Chinese Buddhist sculpture and Fakes,\\" quoting from Stanley Abe, \\"From Stone to Sculpture: The Alchemy of the Modern,\\" in Treasures Rediscovered: Chinese Stone Sculpture from the Sackler Collections at Columbia University (Chinese regulations and Western museum practices now promote protection of such cultural treasures) \\"Promoting the protection of Chinese cultural heritage \\" Freer-Sackler These transactions continue to offend some Chinese. Xu Jian, professor of history at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, says, \\"Loo directly and strongly stimulated China's tomb-robbing activities.\\" G√©raldine Lenain, author of a biographical study of Loo, says emotions in China are \\"still very cruel, still very intense\\", and he's \\"considered a criminal, the biggest criminal of all.\\" Daisy Wang (Wang Yiyou), author of a doctoral dissertation on Loo's career as a dealer, told an interviewer that Loo served as \\"an exotic Chinese servant for his rich and powerful Euro-American clientele ... based on America's capitalist and imperialist logic that Chinese antiquities were to be consumed by the rich and the powerful in modern America,\\" not in China. Loo recognized the feeling against him. His introduction to the catalog for his liquidation sale in 1950 noted: \\"No matter which object I exported from my country, they were all bought openly on the market, in competition with others.\\" He continued: \\"I am happy today that these objets d'art that I exported are securely and carefully preserved for posterity, because I think that if they had remained in China, many of these beautiful objects would have been destroyed.\\" He suggested that the Chinese should blame some \\"foreigners.\\" He pointed out that the person who was responsible for the removal of the famous relief panels of the Taizong emperor's chargers was \\"a foreign dealer.\\" Personal life Not long after he opened his Paris gallery, Loo was struck by the beauty of Olga Hortense Libmond (1876‚Äì1960), a woman four years his elder who ran a milliner's shop a few doors away. They fell in love, and indeed saw each other constantly until his death in 1957, and she guided his life and career. But since she wanted to maintain her relationships with an older man who had financed her business, she instead offered her 15-year-old daughter, Marie-Rose (1895‚Äì1971), to Loo in marriage. Marie-Rose remained married to Loo until his death in 1957. They had four daughters, among them Janine Loo Pierre-Emmanuel. Loo died in Nyon, Switzerland, 15 August 1957.Abilene Reporter-News 18 August 1957 Page 4Qin zhai Lu (1880‚Äì1957) Biblioth√®que nationale de France.

The red brick building had jade-green roof tiles and Chinese gargoyles, 16th- and 17th-century lacquered wood paneling, an art deco glass ceiling depicting Chinese characters, an 18th- and 19th- century sculpted wood galleria of Indian origin, and a lacquer and wood elevator. The building fell into disrepair after Loo's death, but was purchased by a private French investor in 2010 and renovated as a venue for art and events. Loo's library is available to scholars.

He is the father-in-law of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, the former leader of the cartel and once considered Mexico's most-wanted man. Coronel Barreras was arrested by Mexican security forces in Agua Prieta, Sonora on 30 April 2013. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison on April 28, 2017 for drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms. Early life and career In√©s Coronel Barreras was born on 21 January 1968 in Canelas, Durango, Mexico. He was also known by his alias \\"El Uno\\" (The One) and \\"El Suegro\\" (The Father-in- Law). His wife is Blanca Estela Aispuro Aispuro, and his daughter Emma Coronel Aispuro is married to Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and once Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. Coronel Barreras was also related to Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Coronel Villarreal, a former Sinaloa Cartel chief who was killed in a firefight with Mexican security forces in 2010. Coronel Barreras was officially a cattle rancher at the rural community of La Angostura, Canelas, Durango. However, people from the local area stated that he reportedly cultivated marijuana and opium poppies. On 9 January 2013, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Coronel Barreras under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement with the Sinaloa Cartel's illicit activities and coordinating drug trafficking operations for Guzm√°n. The designation also sanctioned Damaso L√≥pez N√∫√±ez (alias \\"El Licenciado\\"), another Sinaloa Cartel chief who worked directly with Guzm√°n. Under the Kingpin Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) virtually froze all the assets Coronel Barreras had in the U.S. and prohibited U.S. citizens from doing any kind of business with him. His area of operations was in Durango and Sonora, particularly in the municipalities of Agua Prieta, San Luis R√≠o Colorado, and Cananea, where he coordinated marijuana plantations and drug trafficking shipments through the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. Arrest On 30 April 2013, the Mexican Federal Police arrested Coronel Barreras, his son In√©s Omar Coronel Aispuro, and three other people at a warehouse in Agua Prieta, Sonora without a single shot fired. The authorities seized four automatic rifles, a handgun, and at least 550 pounds (250 kilograms) of cannabis at the scene. At the time of his arrest, the authorities alleged that Coronel Barreras coordinated drug trafficking shipments for the Sinaloa Cartel from Mexico through the Arizona border crossing, and that he played an important role in the overall operations of Guzm√°n. That afternoon, he was flown from Sonora to the Mexico City International Airport in a Boeing 727 owned by the Federal Police. He was then transferred to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, for his legal declaration. Coronel Barreras was later imprisoned at a federal penitentiary in Tamaulipas state, but was re-transferred to one in Sinaloa on December 2013. =Prison break rumors= On 26 May 2014, local media outlets reported that Coronel Barreras had escaped from the penitentiary in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa with several other inmates. The Mexican government disputed this story through Twitter, stating that the story was false and that he was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Hermosillo, Sonora. The government confirmed, however, that three inmates escaped from the prison in Culiac√°n: Ram√≥n Ruiz Ojeda, Adri√°n Campos Hern√°ndez, and Adelmo Niebla Gonz√°lez (alias \\"El Se√±or\\"), a top drug trafficker for the Sinaloa Cartel and former business partner of Guzm√°n. =Conviction= On April 28, 2017, a federal judge in Sonora found Coronel Barreras guilty of marijuana trafficking and for being in possession of military-exclusive firearms. He was convicted to 10 years, 5 months, and 9 days in prison, and was ordered to forfeit $MXN15,930. The sentence also extended to his son, who was convicted of marijuana trafficking and given 10 years and 3 months, and ordered to forfeit $MXN15,542.

Core Technologies Groundhog Technologies launched its Mobility Intelligence platform based on Chaos Theory and multi-dimensional modeling. The application of Chaos Theory gave rise to the company‚Äôs mathematical models of subscribers' mobility and usage behavior, which can be used for different applications such as by mobile operators to optimize networks according to the user demands. Human moving pattern in phase space According to Chaos Theory, some seemly random or chaotic signals may be converted to analyze in phase space which can reveal the patterns behind it. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior shows patterns around an attractor in the phase space. Based on the attractor in the phase space, data can be utilized from different space, time, and individuals for modeling and indoor geolocation. It is also found that the dimensional structure and characteristics of phase space can naturally neutralize the bias of positioning (based on techniques such as triangulation or trilateration) caused by reasons such as multipath. That is, although each input is biased in some way, the observation from different dimensions and angles are biased in different ways. Combining multi-dimensional input in the phase space, based on the Law of Large Numbers it can average out the bias with different samples through dimensions, time, and individuals.
