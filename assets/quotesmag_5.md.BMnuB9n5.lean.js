Based on the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889) by Mark Twain, the film is about a mechanic in 1912 who bumps his head and finds himself in Arthurian Britain in AD 528, where he is befriended by a knight and gains power by judicious use of technology. When he falls in love with the King's niece, her fianc√© Sir Lancelot takes exception, and when he meddles in the politics of the kingdom, trouble ensues. Filmed from October to December 1947, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was released on April 22, 1949 and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was a popular success and became one of the highlight films of 1949. Plot Hank Martin (Bing Crosby), an American mechanic, is knocked out and wakes up in the land of King Arthur. Here he finds romance with the very lovely, fair and beautiful Alisande la Carteloise (Rhonda Fleming) and friendship with Sir Sagramore (William Bendix). Unfortunately, the heroic Hank also incurs the hatred of both Merlin (Murvyn Vye) and Morgan le Fay (Virginia Field). While Hank persuades King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), an aged, semi-perpetual, cold-in-the-nose invalid, to tour his kingdom in disguise to see the true, wretched condition of his subjects, Merlin and Morgan plot to usurp his throne. When Hank tries to stop them, he is returned to his own time. Heartsick over losing the woman he loves, he goes on a tour of a British castle. Its owner, Lord Pendragon (Hardwicke again), sends him to see his niece, who has the striking resemblances and looks just like Alisande. Production notes The film soundtrack was composed by Jimmy Van Heusen with lyrics by Johnny Burke. The orchestral score was written by longtime Paramount staff composer Victor Young, who also conducted the orchestra for many of Crosby's Decca Records recordings. * \\"If You Stub Your Toe on the Moon\\" by Bing Crosby * \\"When Is Sometime\\" by Rhonda Fleming * \\"Once and for Always\\" by Bing Crosby and Rhonda Fleming * \\"Busy Doing Nothing\\" by Bing Crosby, William Bendix and Cedric Hardwicke * \\"Once and for Always\\" (reprise) by Bing Crosby and Rhonda Fleming * \\"Twixt Myself and Me\\" by Murvyn Vye (this was cut from the film after its world premiere at Radio City Music Hall, New York). A highlight of the film is the scene in which Hank Martin teaches the court musicians how to \\"jazz up\\" the medieval music they are playing. Perhaps the best-known song from the score is \\"Busy Doing Nothing\\", which Hank, Sir Sagramore and the King sing when they are strolling through the woods pretending to be peasants. The cast made separate recordings of the songs used in the film for Decca Records in December 1947 and these were issued as a 78rpm album set. Crosby's songs were also included in the Bing's Hollywood series. Cast * Bing Crosby as Hank Martin/Sir Boss * Rhonda Fleming as Alisande la Carteloise * Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Lord Pendragon/King Arthur * William Bendix as Sir Sagramore * Murvyn Vye as Merlin * Virginia Field as Morgan le Fay * Joseph Vitale as Sir Logris * Henry Wilcoxon as Sir Lancelot * Richard Webb as Sir Galahad * Alan Napier as High Executioner * David Stollery as Billy (uncredited) Reception The film opened on April 7, 1949 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and, together with the Music Hall's annual Easter pageant and stageshow, generated the Music Hall's biggest four-day Easter gross at the time, grossing $146,000 in its first week. The following week, with children out of school and the theatre opening at 7:45 a.m. to enable six showings a day, it grossed a Music Hall record $170,000 and became the number one film in the United States. Contemporary reviews praised Crosby's performance but had mixed assessments about other aspects of the film. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times was positive, writing: \\"The solid, reliable humors of Mark Twain‚Äôs A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which have already done yeoman service in two films and a Broadway musical show, have been given another going over‚Äîwith eminently satisfactory results‚Äîin Paramount‚Äôs new film of the same title, which came to the Music Hall yesterday. And for this we can thank Bing Crosby, primarily and above all, because it is Bing in the role of the Yankee who gives this film its particular charm ... But it is still Bing‚Äôs delightful personality, his mild surprises and sweet serenities, and his casual way of handling dialogue that makes this burlesque a success. No one in current operation could qualify, we are sure, to play the Connecticut Yankee the way the old Groaner does. Harrison's Reports also liked the film, calling it \\"A very good romantic comedy\\" with \\"numerous situations that will provoke hearty laughter.\\" Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"All in all, I would put this picture well up among Paramount's Crosby features as an effort to accomplish something different ... It is a pleasantly fabulous excursion in the dream classification, and the cutback to the medieval past is effectively enough introduced in this adaptation of the Mark Twain story.\\" Variety was not quite so enthusiastic: \\"Picture wears the easy casualness that's a Crosby trademark, goes about its entertaining at a leisurely pace, and generally comes off satisfactorily. It's not high comedy and there‚Äôs little swashbuckling.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote that the idea was \\"so promising that it's a shame the picture collapses,\\" explaining, \\"The early half of the picture accepts Bing's particular brand of easy charm ... But social welfare work among the downtrodden peasantry (there's even a scene that reminds you of 'Monsieur Vincent') hardly fits into my idea of cheerful musical comedy.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote that Crosby was \\"effortlessly amiable,\\" but that the film lacked the wit of the 1931 Will Rogers version and that the songs were inferior to those of the Rodgers and Hart stage musical. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Fantasy Films list.

It runs through many of Albuquerque's oldest neighborhoods, including Downtown, Old Town, Nob Hill, and the University of New Mexico area. Central Avenue was part of U.S. Route 66 from 1937 until the highway's decommissioning in 1985 and also forms one axis of Albuquerque's house numbering system. It was also signed as Business Loop 40 until the early 1990s when ownership of Central Avenue was transferred from the New Mexico State Highway Department to the City of Albuquerque. Route East Central Central follows a primarily east-west alignment from Paseo del Volc√°n (Atrisco Vista Boulevard) on the western outskirts of the city to Four Hills Road just east of Tramway Boulevard (NM 556) near the mouth of Tijeras Canyon. Both ends terminate at Interstate 40, which replaced Route 66 as the primary east-west route through Albuquerque. Along the way Central passes through the historic Old Town, Downtown, EDo, Huning Highlands, Silver Hill, University, Nob Hill, and Highland neighborhoods. The street crosses the Rio Grande just southwest of Old Town, passing through the old neighborhood of Atrisco. Central then passes through the heart of Albuquerque's west side before climbing Nine Mile Hill on the city's western limits. History =Early history= The route that is now Central Avenue has existed in some form since prehistoric times, linking Tijeras Canyon and points east with a good ford of the Rio Grande near present-day Old Town. Originally a Native American trading route, the trail later connected Albuquerque with the outlying settlement of Carnuel. It was upgraded to a wagon road by the U.S. Army in 1858. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway reached Albuquerque in 1880, but for logistical reasons the tracks were routed some two miles east of the existing town. This led to the establishment of a separate \\"New Town\\" around the railroad depot, which was built on the preexisting Carnuel road. When the original downtown street grid was laid out that same year, this road between Old Town and New Town became Railroad Avenue. A mule-drawn streetcar line was soon established. =Rise to prominence= By the turn of the century, Railroad Avenue had been clearly established as Albuquerque's main commercial corridor, and in 1907 the City Council decided to rename the street to better reflect this fact. As reported in the Albuquerque Journal, \\"The name of 'Central Avenue' it is believed, will at once convey the idea that it is the city's main business street and the center of town.\\" A new electric streetcar line was installed in 1904. Meanwhile, the city grew eastward along Central, driven in part by the establishment of the University of New Mexico on the East Mesa in 1889. The early 20th century saw an influx of tuberculosis patients seeking the healthful effects of Albuquerque's dry climate, and a number of sanatoria were established on a stretch of East Central that came to be known as \\"TB Avenue.\\" One of these survived to the present day as Presbyterian Hospital. Tewa Lodge, a Route 66 era motel on East Central With the increasing popularity of the automobile in the 1920s, Central became a hub for car dealerships, service stations, and related enterprise. This role increased dramatically in 1937 when, with New Deal funding secured by governor Clyde Tingley, Route 66 through Albuquerque was realigned from Fourth Street to a more direct east- west route along Central. The road was extended west across the Rio Grande and paved along its entire length, while the grade crossing downtown was eliminated with a new underpass. Dozens of new motels, diners, and filling stations sprang up along East and West Central to cater to the steady stream of travelers passing through the city. By 1955, there were 98 motels along Central Avenue. =Decline and renewal= Downtown Central Avenue in 2009 Central entered an economic decline in the 1960s as Albuquerque became increasingly decentralized. Interstate 40 provided travelers with a faster and more convenient east-west route through Albuquerque, while the new Winrock and Coronado shopping centers drew customers away from the older retail districts on Central. The large downtown Alvarado and Franciscan hotels were demolished in the early 1970s and Albuquerque High School moved to a new location in 1973, leaving its old campus at Central and Broadway boarded up. The street's fortunes began to turn around in the early 1980s with the successful renovation of the KiMo Theater, a treasured landmark which had been threatened with demolition. Over the next two decades, downtown Central Avenue was gradually transformed into an arts and entertainment district with a variety of bars, restaurants, galleries, and live music venues, as well as new residential space. Nob Hill has also rebounded, with an eclectic mix of mostly locally owned businesses. Landmarks The KiMo Theater Central has a large number of surviving Route 66-era commercial buildings as well as earlier buildings downtown and in Old Town. =West Central= Unlike most of downtown Albuquerque, the streetscape of Central Avenue has remained mostly intact since the early 20th century. Notable buildings include the Pueblo Deco-style KiMo Theater, the Sunshine Building, and the First National Bank Building, which was Albuquerque's first skyscraper. Robinson Park, a rare remnant of the railroad era, is located on a triangular block between Eighth and Tenth Streets. La Glorieta, a Spanish hacienda dating back to the seventeenth century, is believed to be the oldest building on Central. It is now a part of Manzano Day School. Franciscan Hotel =East Central= Two major landmarks on East Central are the University of New Mexico main campus and Expo New Mexico, the site of the New Mexico State Fair. The former Albuquerque High School campus at Central and Broadway has been converted to loft apartments. The Nob Hill neighborhood is home to a number of Route 66-era commercial buildings including Jones Motor Company, the Nob Hill Business Center, and the Lobo Theater. The 17-story Bank of the West Tower at Central and San Mateo is a highly visible landmark. =Former landmarks= Some of Albuquerque's most famous former landmarks were located on Central, including the Alvarado Hotel, the Franciscan Hotel, the Castle Huning mansion, and the old Bernalillo County Courthouse in Old Town. More recently the list has also grown to include the Castle Apartments on West Central and the Aztec Motel in Nob Hill. Transportation A Rapid Ride bus on Central The Central Avenue public transit corridor is the most heavily traveled in the city with 350,000 monthly boardings in 2006. ABQ RIDE operates three city bus routes on Central: the 66 Central local route and the 766 Red Line and 777 Green Line Rapid Ride express routes. The Alvarado Transportation Center, located at First and Central, provides access to many other ABQ RIDE routes as well as Greyhound Lines, the Amtrak Southwest Chief, and the New Mexico Rail Runner Express commuter train. Formerly, Central was also served by an electric street railway between 1904 and 1928. The City Electric Company owned twelve streetcars and provided service on a three-mile route between Old Town Plaza and the university. Another former transportation facility on Central was the West Mesa Airport, which operated from 1929 to 1967. In 2006, the city proposed building a new streetcar line along Central between Old Town and Nob Hill. With no clear source of funding, the project eventually fell victim to widespread opposition from the City Council and the public. Albuquerque Rapid Transit was introduced in 2017, bringing bus rapid transit service to Central Avenue via dedicated bus lanes and transit priority signals.

They were one of the pioneers of rock and roll in The Netherlands, and are credited with releasing the first Dutch rock and roll single, Rock Little Baby of Mine in 1958. The band became famous in Europe for playing a kind of rock and roll later called Indorock, a fusion of Indonesian and Western music with roots in Kroncong. At the height of their career, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the band was hailed as one of the greatest live-acts in Europe. History The founders of the band are the children of Herman Tielman from Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), Eastern Indonesia and Flora Lorine Hess: Andy (vocals, guitar), Reggy (guitar), Ponthon (bass) and Loulou Tielman (drums). They grew up in Indonesia, where they first performed under the names Timor Brothers and the Four T's.Tielman Brothers Muziekencyclopedie. Retrieved 26 September 2018.

In 1958 the band were part of the Dutch pavilion at the Brussels World Fair. They were the relief band. While the Hawaiian band took a break, the Tielman brothers were supposed to be on for just 15 minutes but took advantage of the opportunity. While on stage they excited the audience with their stage antics while tossing instruments to each other and playing the bass with their teeth etc.American Studies in a Moment of Danger George Lipsitz Page 310 Their energetic stage performance drew the attention of international concert promoters, and the band was booked to play for several concerts in German night clubs, including on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. After the World Fair, The Tielman Brothers were signed by the Belgian record label Fernap Records to record their first single, a song called Rock Little Baby of Mine. This is considered to be the first Dutch rock 'n' roll record. \\"De eerste Nederlandse rock-'n-rollsingle\\", in: Koopman, Tiemen (2008). 50 jaar Nederpop.

In Germany, the band grew out to be a popular live act. The band received there a fee of 20,000 guilders to perform for a month, and Ariola released records especially for the German market. In their wake many more indorock bands started to perform in Germany. The Tielman Brothers also performed in Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Italy and Sweden. In The Netherlands, they were less successful, mainly performing in their hometown The Hague. The band got little attention from the Dutch media: a performance on the TV program Avro Weekend Show in January 1960 was criticized because they incorporated a Mozart melody in the song 18th Century Rock. At the beginning of 1964, Andy and Reggy were involved in a serious car accident in Germany. It marked the start of many line-up changes, with Andy Tielman as the only permanent member. Luyten en Alfons Faverey left the Tielman Brothers in 1964 to form the rhythm & blues band The Time Breakers.

Early life He was born 8 February 1835 in Canard, Nova Scotia to Thomas Woodworth Rand, deacon of First Cornwallis Baptist Church, and Eliza Irene Barnaby. A Baptist, Rand attended Acadia College in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, which had been founded by the Baptist community in 1838. Rand graduated from Acadia College in 1860. Career Upon graduation, Rand became Professor of Classics at the Provincial Normal School in Truro, Nova Scotia. Working at a normal school, which was charged with training future teachers, Rand soon developed an interest in education policy. He became interested in the common school movement and travelled to Great Britain and the United States to study the common school phenomenon. He began to advocate common schools for Nova Scotia and produced writings and lectures on the topic. He also married Emeline Augusta Eaton on 5 November 1861 in Canard. Rand's advocacy proved successful in 1864, when the government of Nova Scotia, led by Conservative Premier Charles Tupper passed legislation creating a common school system for Nova Scotia. Tupper appointed Rand as Nova Scotia's first Superintendent of Education, and Rand oversaw the creation of Nova Scotia's public education system. In 1871, the Province of New Brunswick, under the leadership of Liberal-Conservative Premier George Edwin King, passed the Common Schools Act to create a series of common schools in New Brunswick. Upon King's invitation, Rand became New Brunswick's first Superintendent of Education and oversaw the creation of public education in New Brunswick. Rand continued his own education during this time, receiving his D.C.L. from Acadia College in 1874. Later life Rand left the world of public education in 1883 when he became Professor of History and Didactics at Acadia College. In 1885, he moved to Toronto to take a position at the Toronto Baptist College (created in 1881 through funding provided by William McMaster). In 1886, he moved to Woodstock, Ontario to become college president of the Baptist Woodstock College. In 1890, the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec voted to merge Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College. The merged university was named McMaster University in honour of William McMaster's financial support. Rand served as chancellor of McMaster University from 1892 to 1895.

He was elected as the member for the Division of Moore in Western Australia for the Liberal Party. Biography Hyde was born and educated in Western Australia before farming wheat and sheep at Dalwallinu. He lost his right arm as a result of a farming accident. A successful farmer, he was a councillor and deputy-President of the Shire of Dalwallinu and won the federal seat of Moore in 1974, holding it until he was defeated in 1983. With three other MPs he formed \\"the Dries\\" which were then a backbench group which advocated economic conservatism and soundness in public finances and rejected short-term populism. He opposed the economic policies of the Whitlam Government which was defeated in December 1975, and also many of the policies of the succeeding Fraser Coalition Government which he considered to be in many ways hardly if at all better. Among his campaigns was to stop the two-airline monopoly and various subsidies to the aircraft, shipping and car industries (former Navy Minister and \\"Dry\\" Bert Kelly, author of \\"The Modest Member\\" and \\"The Modest Farmer\\" columns in various papers, had described the aircraft and shipping industries in Australia as \\"Our flying and floating feather beds.\\"). Hyde's central concern was the harm being done to the Australian economy, particularly to the export industries, by tariffs and other trade-barriers, and he approved Whitlam's 25% across-the-board tariff cut, though it was unpopular with much of his own party, or at least seen by them as something to be used against Labor. Indeed, although a competent and professional politician and a hard-working electorate member, his outspoken and independent attitude and readiness to express his strong economic convictions, probably affected his career within the Liberal Party adversely. Despite his undoubted high abilities, his frequent outspoken opposition to Fraser probably prevented him being considered for the Ministry which his intelligence and grasp of affairs would ordinarily have warranted. Upon his defeat in 1983, with the Clough family, he developed the Australian Institute for Public Policy in Perth and was its Executive Director until it merged with the Institute of Public Affairs, a rather similar \\"dry\\" and pro-free-enterprise think tank. He had joined the IPA on a part-time basis in 1988, and he took it over from the Kemp brothers (also Liberal MPs) and ran it from 1991 to 1995. His wife Helen also worked there. Political Scientist Professor Patrick O'Brien of the University of Western Australia described him as: \\"The only ex-politician I know who continues to do sane and useful work.\\" A feature of the AIPP was a weekly \\"Soviet\\" where new ideas could be put forward by all staff and discussed. A disciple of Bert Kelly, he wrote a long series of articles in The Australian and elsewhere, mainly on economic topics. In 2002 he wrote a book, Dry,National Library of Australia Catalogue published by the IPA and mainly concerned with the fight for public economic conservatism during the years of the Fraser Government, and the elimination of uneconomic tariffs and bounties. Although critical of some of Prime Minister John Howard's policies, he wrote of him warmly in Dry as \\"a man of more than ordinary decency.\\" He and his wife Helen are notable growers of roses. They wrote the book Ellenbee: A Tale of Roses Among Gum Trees in 2006.

Playing career Parker was born in Bow, Devon and after his national service in the Royal Air Force he joined Plymouth Argyle as an amateur in 1949. He failed to make the grade at Argyle and was playing for Newton Abbot on a part-time basis, where he was spotted by Southampton when the clubs met in a pre-season friendly. Manager Sid Cann signed Parker in August 1951 and, after a few reserve team matches, he made his first team debut away to Leicester City on 3 September 1951. His early career was blighted by broken legs, firstly in a pre-season friendly against his former club in 1952 and then a year later in another friendly against an RAF team. He eventually overcame these difficulties and in April 1954 he replaced Stan Clements at the heart of Saints' defence. He retained his place for the start of the following season before losing out to Len Wilkins. He continued to turn out regularly for the reserves and in turn replaced Wilkins in the centre for the first team; in 1956‚Äì57 he was ever-present and his \\"sterling performances in the heart of the Southampton defence\\" earned him Divisional representational honours. He was selected to play for the Third Division South team in 1955‚Äì56 and 1956‚Äì57. After 145 games for the Saints, he was transfer listed in 1959 and moved on a free transfer to Poole Town, along with Southampton teammates Bryn Elliott, Sam Stevens and Barry Hillier. After a year with Poole, he moved to the Isle of Wight to join Cowes Sports starting a long association with the Cowes club, where he became manager in 1961, continuing to play until 1978. After retiring from full-time professional football, he worked as a production controller before becoming a sales administrator for International Computers Limited.

Johnsonville railway station is the terminus of the Johnsonville Line, one of eight stations on the commuter branch railway north of Wellington in New Zealand‚Äôs North Island. It serves the suburb of Johnsonville, and as a bus interchange attracts traffic from other suburbs to the north and east. The station is beside the Johnsonville Shopping Centre (also known as the \\"Johnsonville Mall\\"), a major regional shopping centre, which incorporates a Countdown supermarket. Numerous other businesses and organisations are nearby in a busy retail and commercial area. Electric multiple unit trains are operated as part of the Metlink network to and from Wellington.  History  The original Johnsonville station was constructed by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company and was completed in 1883 though it was not used until the commencement of services on 24 September 1885 with the station having been officially opened along with the Wellington to Paremata section of the line on the 21st. Johnsonville was one of three stations built by the WMR on the section of the Wellington ‚Äì Manawatu Line that is now the Johnsonville Line. It remained a through station following government purchase of the line and its incorporation into the North Island Main Trunk Railway, for freight until 1935 and passengers until 19 June 1937, when the Tawa Flat deviation was opened to all traffic and the old line between Johnsonville and Tawa was closed. This coincided with the opening of the new Wellington railway station. While part of the NIMT, goods trains from Wellington often required a banking engine (e.g. \\"Jumbo\\"; NZR Wj class) for the steep grades up to Ngaio and Khandallah, and were rearranged at Johnsonville. The siding originally accommodated a loco and only 16 wagons, and was extended in 1894 to take 34 wagons. The (old) Broderick Road overbridge crosses the line just south of the station. This photo showing commuter \\"park and ride\\" parking was taken before the platform was lengthened in 2010 The station used to be a much more extensive facility. In the WMR days, the station consisted of a platform, wooden station building, sidings, and extensive stockyards. In 1913 the NZR general manager Mr Hiley said relief for traffic on the steep grades out of Wellington was urgent, but with the Great War in 1914 the Johnsonville rail yards were greatly enlarged as an interim measure. Level crossings in Johnsonville Road and from Bill Cutting Place to Frankmoore Avenue were closed. An island platform with a new station replacing the original WMR building in 1915, and a signal box plus two pedestrian overbridges spanning the yard and connecting to Wanaka Street were built. The main road was diverted and a new connecting street built. Up to the last major reconfiguration of the yard there were four roads beside the platform, the outer most of which served the goods shed, with a separate siding serving the stockyards. The track had been removed from one side of the island platform to make way for a car park. Though the Railways Department wanted to keep the line closed, public pressure prevailed and the line was upgraded and electrified. The track between Johnsonville and Tawa was removed, and the new Johnsonville Line reopened on 2 July 1938 with Johnsonville as its terminus. Significant sources of goods traffic through this station included livestock from the Manawatu for the abattoir at Ngauranga and timber. Local pressure led to the transfer of livestock traffic to new sidings near Raroa station in 1958, though the Johnsonville sidings were not lifted until 1970. In 1984 the yard was realigned to make way for an expansion of the nearby shopping facilities. The line was truncated; all sidings, ancillary buildings, and stockyards were removed; the platform was moved further south, closer to Broderick Road; and a new station building was constructed. These changes meant that there are no \\"run-around\\" facilities, making it difficult to operate locomotive-hauled trains on the line. A Countdown supermarket occupies the site of the former platform and station building. As part of the Johnsonville line upgrading in 2009‚Äì10, upgrading work on the Johnsonville Station platform started on 26 April 2010. The station was not closed, although some sections of the platform and some adjacent \\"park and ride\\" carparks were not available at times.

Access is from Moorefield Road or Johnsonville Mall. Behind the station building are the bus interchange and mall car park. There is \\"park and ride\\" commuter parking by the south end of the platform separate from the Mall car park, and further parking in Moorefield Road across the line and north of the traffic lights. The rail overbridge immediately south of the station was being upgraded in late 2014‚Äì15 to include cycle lanes and extra road lanes. Provision is made for dual tracks underneath (currently one track) into the station, as requested by the Greater Wellington Regional Council. With the temporary loss of some park and ride commuter car parks by the south end of the station and in Burma Road, additional car parks were provided at Raroa railway station.Metlink, Reduced car parking at Johnsonville Station  References  * *  Footnotes   External links  *Train and bus timetables from Metlink. *Photo of one of the last main line trains to enter Johnsonville Station, c1937 *Scene from a locomotive cab while running downhill from Johnsonville c1930  Category:Rail transport in Wellington Category:Public transport in the Wellington Region Category:Buildings and structures in Wellington City Category:Railway stations in New Zealand Category:Railway stations opened in 1885 ","title":"Johnsonville railway station"},{"id":"14999119","text":"Kannoth Muraleedharan (born 14 May 1957) is an Indian National Congress politician from Kerala, the son of eminent congress leader K.

They allied with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for the local panchayat elections of 2005 and had some success. However, for the Kerala Assembly elections of 2006, DIC(K) made a pact with UDF as LDF declined to make any electoral arrangements with DIC(K). DIC(K) contested in 17 constituencies but managed to get elected only from one seat mostly because of grassroots level cross-voting by Congress. Muralidharan lost the election in Koduvally constituency to P.T.A. Rahim. With the future of the DIC(K) party untenable, some party members of the DIC(K) returned to the Congress party whilst others, including Karunakaran and Muraleedharan, decided instead to join the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

It educates students from pre- kindergarten to twelfth grade and is within the Tri-Valley Central School District. It gets its name from the three streams that rise in that area of the Catskill Mountains, Rondout Creek, Chestnut Creek, and the Neversink River. The original school building is currently used by the high school grades. It dates to the early 1950s and faces the church and cemetery in the Grahamsville Historic District just across the road. It was built on the site of the former Grahamsville one room schoolhouse. Two additions have been constructed to create the present middle and elementary schools, which combine to create a C-shaped structure with a parking lot in the middle. 2007 student protest Shortly after the beginning of the 2007 school year, a confrontation between a school security guard and a student led to an unusual student protest that made international news. In February 2007, parents were notified of a new regional policy that prohibited students from carrying their books, school work, and belongings in backpacks between classes, as well as banning jacket wearing. The policy was intended for both student health concerns, safety concerns, and to limit the possibility to conceal weapons and other contraband. The new regulations still allowed girls to carry purses to hold their personal items. Some female students used larger purses that would accommodate their school materials as well, functioning as a book bag. After the boys of the school complained on the basis of gender discrimination, the school announced the policy would be amended to ban purses as well. Some of the students misunderstood the announcement, believing that the size of the purses was all that mattered. Rumors quickly began spreading that girls would only be allowed to carry purses during their menstrual periods. On September 19, security guards were conducting a sweep to enforce the new rule. A ninth grade girl was among several students called out of a class to see if their bags were within the new regulations. She said that security guard Mike Bunce, upon seeing her bag, asked her if she was having her period. Later that evening she spoke to her mother about the confrontation. More girls may also have been asked the same type of question by the security guard. Soon after the incident, some girls of the school began wearing tampon boxes on necklaces in protest. Some boys wore sanitary napkins taped to their shirts as a show of support. A classmate of Martin's, Hannah Lindquist, claimed that principal Robert Worden threw her out of his office and told her she was \\"part of the problem\\" for wearing \\"an ob. tampon box on a piece of yarn as a necklace\\" to a meeting to discuss a student who might have been suspended for her protest. Another male student was arrested and charged with public lewdness, a misdemeanor in New York, after he streaked through the school wearing only a paper bag over his head, claiming he was protesting against the backpack policy. The school board eventually placed Security Guard Mike Bunce on paid administrative leave at the beginning of October while it decided the future of his employment. Bunce had previously been forced to resign from the police department in the nearby village, Monticello, along with its then-chief, for operating a process-serving business while on the job. A month later, the district fired him.

The band was founded in 1997 by guitarist Aaron Butler and vocalist Adam 'Hutch' Glynn and have since released three full-length albums and one EP. Frankenbok have toured Australia on numerous occasions, building a strong cult following in their homeland. The current Frankenbok line-up consists of Aaron Butler (guitar), Tim Miedecke (bass and backing vocals), Mick Morley (drums), Dan McDougall (vocals) and Nathan 'Yeti' Amatnieks (guitar).MySpace.com - FRANKENBOK - Melbourne, AU - Metal / Thrash / Rock - www.myspace.com/frankenbok The group is currently signed to Perth-based record label Prime Cuts.Prime Cuts Music Band history =Formative years, 1997-1999= Following his return from Florida and having been heavily influenced by that region's death metal scene, Aaron Butler recruited former Bacterium vocalist Adam 'Hutch' Glynn.Encyclopaedia Metallum - Frankenbok Their moniker was taken from a demo tape Butler had made during his time in the United States. Whilst teaching some locals a few Australian colloquialisms, one participant mispronounced the slang term \\"fair dinkum\\" as \\"frankenbok\\". Butler and Glynn were later joined by former Zombonol members Tim Miedecke and Scott Lang, on bass and guitar respectively. Unable to find a suitable drummer, the band took to playing live with a drum machine. In 1998, a demo was recorded. Little came of it, and it was never officially released. Frankenbok's unusual mix of grinding, death metal rhythms, thrashing riffs and eclectic, Mike Patton-inspired vocals interspersed with guttural death growls helped them gain attention and stand out from the majority in the metal scene of the time. In 1999, following sustained gigging in the local underground metal scene, Frankenbok attracted the attention of producer/engineer Richie 'DW' Norton (also known for playing guitar in Australian band Superheist), who offered to record Frankenbok's debut album and release it via his Faultline Records imprint. =Greetings & Salutations, 1999-2000= Recording sporadically between February and September at Backbeach Studios in Rye, Victoria, Frankenbok's debut album finally saw the light of day in early 2000. Greetings & Salutations features ten tracks, ranging from the grindcore moments of \\"Linguistics\\" to the tongue-in-cheek, Faith No More-inspired \\"P. Cloned\\". Frankenbok later jokingly dubbed their sound as \\"Taco Metal\\". Bassist Miedecke described it as \\"A lot of meat with a little bit of cheese\\"TE Archive - Metal Bloody Metal - \`Taco' Metal With Chilli And Cheese) amidst the radical categorization within the heavy metal fraternity. Despite the album being recorded with a drum machine, Mick Morley had joined the group in August 1999 before the album was completed. This allowed Frankenbok more freedom and versatility on the live front, evidenced by the band winning the Melbourne Metro Nightclub's Battle of the Bands.Australian Music Online :: Artists :: Frankenbok Frankenbok went on to tour supporting US metallers Skinlab in May. They made their first of many appearances at the Metal for the Brain Festival in Canberra in October, alongside the likes of Voivod, Alchemist and Blood Duster. Following a continued strong showing on the live front, the group signed with Dark Carnival, the developmental offshoot of Roadrunner Australia, in late 2000. =Loopholes & Great Excuses, 2001-2002= Released in early 2001 on Dark Carnival, The Loopholes & Great Excuses EP, recorded with DW Norton at Backbeach Studios, proved a minor hit for Frankenbok. Their tongue- in-cheek cover of Madison Avenue's kitsch dance hit \\"Don't Call Me Baby\\" earned the group airplay on youth/alternative radio. Mid-2001 saw the commencement of the six-week, nationwide 'Devastation Vacation' tour with Dreadnaught. Frankenbok also opened for Slayer and Machine Head in May. They played Metal for the Brain for the second time on 20 October 2001. Also around this time the group landed the support slot for two cancelled Slipknot tours as well as the cancelled Kittie tour. In 2002, their debut album Greetings & Salutations (Special Edition) was re-released on Dark Carnival with an additional eight bonus tracks recorded at the Bleach Club in Sydney in August 2001. Also around this time, Frankenbok opened for System of a Down, toured with Sydneysiders Psi.Kore, and appeared at the Overcranked Festival in Brisbane, Australia.The Australian Metal Guide - Frankenbok Despite regular touring and small-scale commercial success, vocalist Adam 'Hutch' Glynn left the band due to a falling out between band members and Glynn in November 2002 with recording time set for their follow-up to Loopholes... Adam Glynn went on to form his own various side projects including technical metal band Five Star Prison Cell and Coitus Bund (with Rebekah Chapman). =Blood Oath, 2003-2005= Blood Oath line-up (l-r): Mick Morley, Adam B. Metal, Scott Lang, Tim Miedeckie, Aaron Butler Following Glynn's departure, Frankenbok carried out auditions to fill the vocal position, with former Negative Hold frontman Adam B. Metal (a.k.a. Adam Miles) finally selected to fill the vacancy in January 2003. Drummer Mick Morley suffered a hand injury in early 2003, causing Devolved drummer John Sankey to fill in behind the kit for Frankenbok's national tours with Skinlab and Swedish melodic metallers Soilwork. The year also saw release of Frankenbok's second official studio album and first for Roadrunner Australia, entitled Blood Oath (in reference to the Australian colloquialism \\"bloody oath\\"). Despite being recorded again at Backbeach Studios with DW Norton behind the mixing desk, Blood Oath saw a change in direction for the band, with more thrash metal influences being introduced, more melodic passages present and Adam B. Metal's vocals being in stark contrast to those of former vocalist Glynn. Despite their change in direction, Blood Oath proved to be Frankenbok's most successful album to date, and eventually gained a European release in 2004. Live dates followed, including an appearance at Metal for the Brain (in December 2003, as 2002's event had been cancelled due to litigation which Frankenbok had also been confirmed for) and the nationwide 'Blood Letting' tour with Daysend (who featured members of former touring companions Psi.Kore) in support of their recent album.Frankenbok The following year (2004) included the 'Army of Darkness' tour with Sunk Loto, Full Scale and 8 Foot Sativa as well as further touring the east coast with Walk the Earth (producer DW Norton's group) and Frankenbok's first live dates overseas, touring New Zealand with local band 8 Foot Sativa in late 2004 on the 'Hatred Forever' tour. The 2005 edition of Metal for the Brain saw Frankenbok play both the Canberra (the traditional venue) and Brisbane (for the only time in the event's history) dates. Despite sustained activity on the live front, including another string of dates in New Zealand with 8 Foot Sativa in April, longtime guitarist Scott Lang left the group in late 2005 for professional reasons, relocating overseas to Hong Kong. Fans were surprised when Frankenbok appeared at Brisbane's Overcranked Festival in early 2006 with Adam B. Metal now occupying the second guitarist slot as well as supplying vocals. =Murder of Songs, 2006-2008= Flyer for one-off show, 29 November 2007 Persistent touring, Lang's departure and their amicable split with their label Roadrunner in 2005 led to new recorded material being long overdue, despite the fact the band had been playing songs such as \\"Worship Before the Dead\\" and other rough versions of songs as far back as 2004. Throughout 2006, the group periodically lay down tracks for their third full-length release, handling the recording and producing duties themselves with the aim of capturing their renowned live energy onto tape. This marked the first time they recorded away from Backbeach Studios, with guitars and bass recorded at 'The Bat Cave', vocals tracked at 'The Fight Club House' and drums and final mixing overseen by Reggie Bowman at Scream Louder Studios. They also played the final Metal for the Brain on 4 November 2006, the group's fifth appearance at the popular underground heavy metal festival (not including the cancelled 2002 event). Despite the album being completed by the conclusion of 2006, it did not see release until mid-2007, due to Frankenbok having to find a suitable label. Murder of Songs was finally released on 6 August 2007 on Perth-based label Prime Cuts. Including the already live favourites \\"Sludge (I Will Make/Take These Horizons)\\", \\"Walk This (LIE)fe\\" and \\"What Is Real?\\", Frankenbok's third full-length also proved to be their last with vocalist/guitarist Adam B. Metal, who departed the group in early 2007 prior to the album's release. McDougall Brothers vocalist Dan McDougall was recruited as his replacement soon after. Plans to have former guitarist Scott Lang return did not come to fruition, however. The guitar slot was eventually filled by Cheshire Pile guitarist Nathan 'Yeti' Amatnieks. A small controversy, seen by many fans as a 'hatchet job', occurred just prior to the release of Murder of Songs when Zoo Magazine published a particularly unfavourable reviewZoo Weekly slams Frankenbok's new album - Ultimate Metal Forum which detailed little to nothing about the actual release, included unauthorized use of artwork, and stated: > \\"Aussie hard rockers Frankenbok havent done themselves any favours with this > whiffy deposit of ten smelly turds. The songs are nothing if not ironically > titled - Failure To Learn? More like Failure To Learn... When To Quit! Tired > stuff from a band of blokes who ought to chuck it in and get jobs in IT.\\" Despite this, the album fared well critically, receiving positive reviews from other sources.PyroMusic.net - Review of: Frankenbok - Murder of Songs Frankenbok was inactive for most of 2007 due to guitarist Aaron Butler breaking his leg in January in a skateboarding accident. The break was so serious it required a further bone graft operation in October. With the line- up of Aaron Butler, Tim Miedecke, Mick Morley, Dan McDougall and Yeti now firmly in place, and having made their live debut on 29 November 2007, they started working on a follow-up EP titled Last Ditch Redemption in 2008.

Boston was platted in 1861 with a New England-style town square. The town became a stagecoach stop, and \\"Boston Mills\\" post office was established in 1869. Efforts to get the Oregon and California Railroad, which was being built south from Albany, to come through Boston Mills were unsuccessful. The railroad was instead built through the nearby land donated by Civil War veteran Captain Frank Shedd, and \\"Shedd's Station\\" was created in 1871. The post office was moved soon after. Many of Boston's buildings, though not the mill itself nor the Farwell DLC homestead, were moved west to the new Shedd's Station to be near the railroad. In 1899, the railroad changed the name of the station to \\"Shedd\\", but the name of the post office did not change until 1915.

He grew up in the Philippines and spent much of his life working in the Philippines. In 1995 he left with a Chemical Engineering degree travelling to Winnipeg, Canada to pursue his calling to become a Roman Catholic Priest. In 1997 he joined the Companions of the Cross community of priests and seminarians in Ottawa, Canada. (He left the Companions of the Cross in 2011.) Suarez was ordained to the priesthood in 2002 and began to focus on faith healing. In July 2003 he was assigned to begin a ministry of healing. He established Mother Mary of the Poor Healing Ministry with the mission and intent \\"to seek holiness in evangelizing and working with the poor through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\" Early life Father Fernando Suarez was born in Barrio Butong in Taal, Batangas, Philippines on 7 February 1967. His father, Cervando, was a tricycle driver and his mother, Azucena, was a seamstress. He was the oldest of four siblings and attended public school. At the age of 12, he worked by renting inflatables (salbabida) at Butong Beach. He attended Adamson University and earned a Chemical Engineering degree. After college, he briefly entered Christ the King Seminary, leaving after six months after being absent without leave. In 1986, at the age of 18, he became aware of his healing gift. He prayed over a paralyzed 60-year-old beggar woman who he found outside Quiapo Church; according to Suarez, the woman was able to walk again after his prayers. In 1995, he met French- Canadian student Mark Morin, who invited him to Canada and paid for his fare. They intended to enter into a business partnership but Suarez later decided to enter the priesthood. In 1997 he joined the Companions of the Cross, a newly established community of priests and seminarians in Ottawa. He was ordained in 2002 at age 35. He left the Companions of the Cross in 2011. In Canada, when Suarez was still a seminarian, a Canadian woman declared dead eight hours earlier also opened her eyes after he prayed over her. From there his healing ministry continued and in 2008, he returned to the Philippines to resume his healing work. Healing ministry In 1997 he joined the Companions of the Cross religious community of priests and seminarians in Ottawa, Canada. Fr. Fernando was ordained to the priesthood in 2002. Since his ordination to the priesthood, Fr. Fernando has found that the gift of healing became more pronounced in him. In July 2003 he was assigned to begin a ministry of healing. He established Mother Mary of the Poor Healing Ministry with the mission and intent \\"to seek holiness in evangelizing and working with the poor through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\" He spent the first year of his priesthood as the associate pastor of St. Timothy¬πs parish in North York, Ontario, however, since July 2003, in order to foster the spiritual gifts God has given him, he was assigned to begin a ministry of healing. He was regularly conducting Healing Masses, retreats and missions, with large numbers of people now in attendance. On 11 January 2008, Manila Cardinal Archbishop Gaudencio Rosales officiated for Suarez's celebration of the Mass which started the three-day, 40-hour vigil at Suarez' Batangas City Montemaria mega-shrine. Hundreds of devotees and the sick gathered. On 26 January 2008, two died and seven were rushed to James Gordon Hospital due to exhaustion, Olongapo City while waiting for Suarez' healing Mass. Juanito Eleazar, 69, died of a heart attack amid more than 15,000 worshippers having lined up.2 die of exhaustion while waiting for Fr. Suarez healing Mass - 26 January 2008 (in Filipino) Also in 2008 Suarez was banned by Archbishop Oscar Cruz and Bishop Jose Oliveros from their diocese citing the Catholic Church‚Äôs Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, which requires a local bishop‚Äôs permission for Church-related activities conducted by those who do not belong to the diocese. Suarez announced his return to and resumption of his healing in the Philippines on May 2008 He left the Companions of the Cross in 2011. In 2015, he appeared on The Bottomline with Boy Abunda and shared his encounter with Pope Francis and Suarez said that Pope Francis is human, yet he is a man of God. He said he concelebrated mass with Pope Francis at the Sta. Marta Chapel in Vatican in the previous year. Suarez also said that on that occasion, they exchanged skull caps, and that the Pope told him to continue his mission. In 19 January 2020, Suarez gave a public interview with the Philippine Inquirer news agency, regarding his exoneration from alleged activities of monetary corruption, sexual molestation, and the merchandising of religious articles for profit from the Holy Office which he cited ruling in his favor on 6 January 2020. During his interview, Suarez claimed he was deprived of Due process within the structure of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, prompting him to take his case directly to the Vatican for a permanent resolution. He further questioned the motives of some select bishops within the Catholic Church in the Philippines, which he viewed as consistently persecuting both his name and reputation on social media, pertaining to his healing ministry and global outreach outside of the Philippines. He also declared that his local ordinary Bishop gave him authorization to conduct his ministry of healing, formerly sanctioned by Cardinal Ricardo Vidal.(needs a reference 2 April 2020) Death Suarez died of a myocardial infarction on 4 February 2020 while playing tennis at the Ayala Alabang Clubhouse, three days before his 53rd birthday.

The newspaper is affiliated with the Missouri School of Journalism, and is owned as a 501c3 non-profit under the Missourian Publishing Association. Students enrolled in staff classes produce the newspaper, which is managed by working professionals who also serve as professors. History The Columbia Missourian headquarters. A former member of the University of Missouri Board of Curators and the Missouri School of Journalism's first dean, Walter Williams (1864-1935) helped establish the Missouri School of Journalism in 1908. The first issue of the Columbia Missourian was printed on the day that classes started, September 14, 1908. Prior to his appointment as dean of the Journalism School, Williams worked at several newspapers in Boonville, served as president of the Missouri Press Association and was eventually offered a position as editor of the Columbia Herald. He faced much resistance of the prospects of a journalism school from editorial boards across the state, but when he was appointed by Governor Lon V. Stephens to the Board of Curators in 1899, a school of journalism became a more likely prospect. In 1959, construction began on a new headquarters for the Columbia Missourian. The addition to Jay H. Neff Hall included of floor space with newsroom, composing room, and press room. The new headquarters was dedicated in May 1962. On September 19, 1968, the Columbia Missourian switched from afternoon to morning delivery. The change was originally opposed by Dean Earl English for fear that students would abandon coursework and spend all night working on the newspaper. Printers also threatened to quit because of the change in printing schedule. In 1970, the Missourian obtained four federally licensed press-radio units. The radios had a range of and enabled students to learn of new assignments without returning to the newsroom, and they were used heavily in field reporting. In 1985 the Missourian became the first daily newspaper in the world to use a local-area network for production, and in 1986 the Missourian became the first newspaper in the state of Missouri to install a computerized pagination system. The $250,000 system eliminated hands-on page designing. In 1992, the Missourian became one of the first newspapers in the world to offer content in a digital format as well as the traditional print format. On April 18, 1995, Lee Hills Hall was dedicated as the new home of the Columbia Missourian. The new headquarters was funded by approximately $5 million in gifts from former Missouri journalism student Lee Hills, who served as the first president of the Knight Ridder news service. On July 1, 2018, Ruby Bailey became the Missourian's first female executive editor. Today, the newspaper is a web-first publication with a print edition published five days a week.

Playing career Born in Derry, Shields was a Northern Ireland youth international. He started his professional career in Belfast with Crusaders and was part of the Crusaders side which claimed their first major honour, the 1953‚Äì54 Ulster Cup. He was rewarded with an inter-league appearance (in a 5‚Äì0 defeat by the Football League at Windsor Park in September 1953) and an Amateur cap (when he scored in a 3‚Äì2 win over Wales in January 1954).

It was primarily used for baseball and was the home of the Memphis Chicks minor league baseball team until the spring of 1960. The ballpark was originally built in 1896, and was known as Elm Wood Park or Red Elm Park. In 1915, team owner Russell E. Garner incorporated his name into the ballpark's name. The \\"wood\\" part of the name would figure into its demise. Prior to its dramatic end, the ballpark was best known for being among the more uniquely shaped ballfields in the country. As with Nashville's Sulphur Dell, it was in a natural \\"bowl\\". The slopes were used as convenient foundations for seating areas. Constrained by its topography, a creek, and pre-existing buildings, the park was on an asymmetrical lot, with the deepest parts of left and right fields being significantly farther from home plate than straightaway center. City directories gave its street address as 914 Madison Avenue. Its boundary streets included Madison (south, home plate); Dunlap Street (west, left field); and Jefferson Avenue beyond bordering buildings (north, center field). The creek (later covered to make a parking lot) ran outside the right field fence. The outfield dimensions following the 1921 remodeling were: left field ; center field ; and right field , quickly angling out to a very deep right- center, about ; . The left field distance was later shortened somewhat by construction of an inner fence and bleachers. One of its better-known non- baseball events was a concert held by Memphis' adoptive son Elvis Presley on July 4, 1956. Coincidentally, 21 years later Elvis would be pronounced dead at the Baptist Hospital across Madison Street to the south. The largest crowd attendance for wrestling in Memphis was set on August 17, 1959 at Russwood Park. The main event was Billy Wicks and Sputnik Monroe fighting to a no contest for Monroe's Tennessee Championship. Attendance for the event has been reported to be between 17,000 and 18,000. The record would stand until the Monday Night Wars Era. The final event at the old ballpark was a pre-season exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox and the Cleveland Indians on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1960. The ballpark was a relic, constructed primarily of wood except for steel supports for the roof. That night after the game, a fire of undetermined origin destroyed the ballpark. The blaze threatened the Baptist Hospital across the street from it, and patients had to be evacuated. The Chicks played in several temporary facilities for the 1960 season, including a very cramped high school football field a couple of blocks northeast of the ballpark site, called Hodges Field; and then a city-owned field called Tobey Park. After the season, the club moved to Macon, Georgia. As it happens, the entire Southern Association disbanded after the 1961 season. A revived minor league entry for the city, called the Memphis Blues, began play in 1968 at Tim McCarver Stadium. Sources *Baseball Parks of North America by Michael Benson, 1989.

Then, against Illinois, he was placed in the lineup at tackle and became \\"the individual star of the Wolverines by a wide, handsome and undisputed margin.\\" On defense, he was taken out of the line and played at defensive fullback, and when an Illinois back found a hole in the line, Grantland Rice wrote that ‚ÄúMorrison usually picked him up bodily and hurled him back into the breach in the wall.‚Äù And occasionally, \\"he was content with merely smacking the ball carriers against the ground as they had never been smacked before.\\" After the Illinois game, Coach Kipke said of Morrison, \\"That boy will develop into the finest defensive back in Michigan‚Äôs history. His injured knee isn't entirely well, and when it is he will add more speed to his play.\\" At the end of the 1929 season, Coach Kipke touted Morrison as the best back to wear the Michigan uniform in 15 years: \\"Coach Harry Kipke says Maynard Morrison . . . is the nearest approach to Johnny Maulbetsch the Wolverines have seen in the last 15 years. Morrison is a husky sophomore of more than 200 pounds and hits the line with all the force and power that made Maulbetsch famous as a line smasher. Morrison suffered early season injuries that kept him from play during the first month but he is expected to show his stuff in the closing games.\\" He scored a touchdown in a 14‚Äì12 victory over Harvard, as he \\"hurled his 210 pound bulk through the Crimson forward wall for a touchdown.\\" After a scoreless tie with Iowa, the Associated Press reported that Morrison ‚Äúwas responsible for most of the Wolverine‚Äôs first downs.‚Äù 1930 season In the summer of 1930, Coach Kipke reported that he had 15 varsity caliber backs but was lacking in talent in the line. Accordingly, Kipke reported he was considering moving Morrison to the center position. Again in early September, Kipke announced that ‚Äúso great is the lack of linemen‚Äù that he proposed making a center of Morrison. However, before making the move, Kipke had to persuade Morrison's father. One newspaper account in 1930 reported: \\"Maynard Morrison was a pretty good fullback last year at Michigan. Coach Harry Kipke though he saw great center possibilities in the young man from Royal Oak. But Morrison‚Äôs father wanted him to carry the ball. Kipke made the trip himself to Royal Oak to persuade Papa Morrison that Maynard would be better at flipping the ball than lugging it.\\" After ten days of experimenting during fall practice, Kipke made the switch, moving Maynard from fullback to center. Morrison performed well at his new position in 1930, being praised by the AP for his ‚Äúdefensive genius.‚Äù At the end of the 1930 season, Morrison was named to All-Big Ten teams by the United Press and the NEA (Newspaper Enterprise Association) Service. One reporter noted that Morrison \\"was just about everything a coach could ask for in a center.\\" 1931 season In 1931, Morrison started nine games for the 8‚Äì1‚Äì1 Wolverines team that tied for the Big Ten Conference championship. Morrison was selected as a first-team All-American in 1931 by Grantland Rice for Collier‚Äôs magazine and by the NEA Service All-America Board. The NEA Service All-America Board made their All-American selections based on more than 680 reports from coaches, writers and officials representing every section of the country where football was played. According to newspaper accounts reporting on Morrison being the consensus selection by the board members at the center position, it was noted that his \\"great defensive ability gave him the call.\\" Thomas Yarr of Notre Dame was named the first-team center by the Associated Press in 1931. In announcing Morrison as its All-Big Ten team center, the Associated Press described him as \\"Michigan‚Äôs 210 pound center from Royal Oak, Michigan,\\" a player who was \\"big, shifty and fast,\\" and \\"the key man of Michigan's defense.\\" Football writer Merle Oliver called Morrison Michigan‚Äôs ‚Äúdiagnostician of enemy plays.‚Äù Morrison was part of a long line of All- American centers at Michigan, starting with William Cunningham and Germany Schulz followed by Ernie Vick, Jack Blott, Bob Brown, and Chuck Bernard. Honors and accolades Among the honors received by Morrison are the following: * First team All-Big Ten in 1930 and 1931; * First team All- American in 1931 (as selected by Grantland Rice and the NEA Service); * Inducted into the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in 1982. * Inducted into the Royal Oak High School (Royal Oak, Michigan) Hall of Fame in 1998.http://www.rohshalloffame.com/graduates/morrison-maynard-d.html * In 2005, Morrison was selected as one of the 100 greatest Michigan football players of all time by the \\"Motown Sports Revival,\\" ranking 50th on the all- time team.

It was the largest class of 2-8-2 locomotives anywhere, although other railroads had more Mikados in total. The L1s shared the boiler and many other components with the K4s 4-6-2 \\"Pacific\\" type, giving a total of 425 locomotives with many standard parts. Although the L1s type was quite successful, it was very much eclipsed in PRR service by the larger and more powerful I1s/I1sa 2-10-0 \\"Decapods\\", which arrived in service only two years after the L1s and were very suited to the PRR's mountain grades and heavy coal and mineral trains, and by the 1923 introduction of the M1 4-8-2 \\"Mountains\\" which took on the best high-speed freight runs. Large numbers of the class were stored out of service during the Great Depression, only to return to service during World War II. Design The L1s design was state-of- the-art for its time and comparable with the best being produced for any other road. In fact, the specifications of the L1s and the Santa Fe's similar 3160 class locomotives were the basis for the USRA's successful Heavy Mikado standard design, which was built to the total of 957 locomotives. As built, however, the class was lacking much in the way of modern appliances due to the PRR's conservatism; features missing included a mechanical stoker, power reverse, and a feedwater heater, although most of the class were later given a stoker and all received power reverse. Modifications in service The class remained largely as built until the 1920s. At that time, piston and valve tailrods were removed, wooden pilot beams were replaced with steel, footboard pilots replaced the pointed passenger-style previously fitted, and oil-burning headlights were replaced by electric lights. Power reverse gear was fitted slowly to the entire class per an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the task being complete by the early 1930s. Fitting this gear required moving the air tanks from the right-hand side of the boiler to the front deck, thus providing an easy visual indication of the modification. The tanks on the left-hand side of the boiler remained in their original location. Most (but by no means all) of the class were eventually fitted with mechanical stokers; by 1947, 512 locomotives were stoker-equipped, 39 still hand-fired, and the remaining ten were oil-fired, the latter being an experiment tried during the coal-miners' strikes of that period. The PRR experimented with booster engines on the L1s class as it did with the K4s Pacifics, but apart from a few test installations never proceeded with this modification. Also not generally fitted was the PRR's trainphone system, although early installations were tested on at least one L1s. A more serious modification was performed to L1s #2861, which was fitted with an experimental Emerson water-tube firebox at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Mount Clare Shops. Like most PRR locomotives, class L1s was subject to the post-World War II swapping of the locations of the headlamp and turbo-generator. The headlamp was placed in front of the stack on top of the smokebox, in the generator's former location, while the tubogenerator was mounted on the upper smokebox front in the location formerly occupied by the headlamp. This was for ease of maintenance; the turbogenerator needed work much more frequently than the headlight, so it was given the location with easier access. Many of the class were fitted with cab signal equipment, the electronics for which were largely contained in a wood box affixed to the right-hand side running board in front of the reversing gear and aft of the smokebox. Sale to other railroads Some L1s locomotives were sold by the PRR to other railroads. Four were sold to the Lehigh and New England Railroad in 1941; two were sold to the Cambria and Indiana Railroad in the same year. Three locomotives were sold to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1945. In 1948, two locomotives were sold to the Interstate Railroad and two to the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad. Preservation L1s #520, which remained in service until almost the end of steam operations, hauled one of the last steam-powered passenger trains on the PRR: a railfan special between Enola Yard and Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Shortly after that service it was added to the PRR's historic locomotive collection in the Northumberland roundhouse, and followed most of that collection to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania where it remains today a static exhibit. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Models In HO scale, hundreds of hand-made brass models of the L1s were supplied from 1965 to 1976 by United (Pacific Fast Mail), and also by Key Imports in 1978. Bowser Manufacturing offered a metal kit, now out of production [originally offered by Penn Line Manufacturing], of the L1s locomotive in H0 scale. In N scale, GHQ offered a kit to convert a Kato USRA Light Mikado into a L1s. LGB produced a USRA Light Mikado in G scale in multiple fallen flag railroad names including product number 21872, Pennsylvania Railroad No. 2809.

Presently, there are no legal restrictions on Jews in Jordan, and they are permitted to own property and conduct business in the country, but in 2006 there were reported to be no Jewish citizens of Jordan,US Department of State (2006), International Religious Freedom Report 2006. nor any synagogues or other Jewish institutions. Israelite tribes 1759 map of the initial tribal allocations - the actual territories occupied by the tribes during the United Monarchy and afterwards was somewhat different According to the Hebrew Bible, three of the ancient Israelites tribes were allocated lands on the east side of the Jordan River valley, in the territory of present-day Jordan. They were the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh. These tribes were members of the Northern Kingdom of Israel until the kingdom was conquered by Assyria in c. 723 BCE and the population deported. A nation related to the Israelites, the Edomites (Idumaeans) resided in present-day southern Jordan, between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. Iudaea Province on both sides of the Jordan River in the 1st century. The Hasmonean official Antipater the Idumaean was of Idumean origin. He was the progenitor of the Herodian Dynasty that ruled Judea after the Roman conquest. When Herod the Great became king, Idumaea was ruled for him by a series of governors, among whom were his brother Joseph Antipater and his brother-in-law Costobarus. Immediately before the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, 20,000 Idumaeans, under the leadership of John, Simeon, Phinehas, and Jacob, appeared before Jerusalem to fight on behalf of the Zealots who were besieged in the Second Temple.Josephus, Jewish Wars iv. 4, ¬ß 5 After the Jewish-Roman wars, the Idumaean people ceased to be mentioned in history. Roman era Roman rule in the region began in 63 BCE, when the general Pompey declared Judea a Roman protectorate. Over the years, Roman power over the Judean kingdom increased. Among the voices of opposition were John the Baptist, whose severed head was allegedly presented at the fortress of Machaerus to Herod. In 66 CE, the forces behind the First Jewish Revolt took control of Machaerus, and held it until 72 CE, when a siege secured the defeat of local Jewish forces. At the end of the Bar Kochba revolt of 132-135 CE and the destruction of Judea, the Romans joined the province of Judea (which already included Samaria) to Galilee to form a new province, which they called Syria Palaestina.http://www.usd.edu/erp/Palestine/history.htm#135-337 Lehmann, Clayton Miles (May‚ÄìSeptember 1998). Palestine: History: 135‚Äì337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy Following the Roman conquest, the lands on both sides of the Jordan River with its Jewish inhabitants came under the control and decrees of subsequent Roman emperors and Arab caliphates. Over the centuries, the Jewish population within present-day Jordan gradually declined, until no Jews were left. British Empire The British Balfour Declaration of 1917 endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The World Zionist Organization submitted to the Paris Peace conference of 1919 a memorandum specifying boundaries of Palestine, to be put under British Mandate and eventually to become an \\"autonomous Commonwealth\\". According to the document: > \\"The fertile plains east of the Jordan, since the earliest Biblical times, > have been linked economically and politically with the land west of the > Jordan. The country which is now very sparsely populated, in Roman times > supported a great population. It could now serve admirably for colonisation > on a large scale. A just regard for the economic needs of Palestine and > Arabia demands that free access to the Hedjaz Railway throughout its length > be accorded both Governments.\\" From as early as 1917, the land to the east of the Jordan River, known as Transjordan, was treated separately by the British administration, who saw it as a separate future state. A formal decision to restrict the Jewish homeland to west of the Jordan was made at the Cairo conference in March 1921, and accordingly a new article was added to the draft mandate text allowing the British government to administer Transjordan separately. The mandate was approved by the League of Nations in July 1922, and in September 1922 the League approved a memorandum spelling out in detail the exclusion of Transjordan from the Jewish homeland provisions. In 1927, Pinchas Rutenberg, founder of the Palestine Electric Company, signed an agreement with King Abdullah I of Jordan to build a hydroelectric power station on the territory of Transjordanian Emirate. Construction of the Naharayim hydroelectric power plant began in 1928.Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press/McGraw Hill, New York, Vol. 2, p.818 Tel Or was built near the power plant to house the permanent employees and their families. Tel Or was settled in 1930 and was the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. Residents also farmed thousands of dunams of land and sold some of the produce at a company workers‚Äô supermarket in Haifa. The town lasted until its depopulation in 1948 during the Arab-Israeli War, when it was overrun by Iraqi and Transjordanian forces and destroyed. 1948 Arab-Israeli War and beyond During the Arab-Israeli War, Jordan seized the West Bank and the Old City of Jerusalem, and expelled the Jewish residents of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. An Arab commander remarked: \\"For the first time in 1,000 years not a single Jew remains in the Jewish Quarter. Not a single building remains intact. This makes the Jews' return here impossible.\\" The Hurva Synagogue, originally built in 1701, was blown up by the Jordanian Arab Legion. During the nineteen years of Jordanian rule, a third of the Jewish Quarter's buildings were demolished. According to a complaint Israel made to the United Nations, all but one of the thirty-five Jewish houses of worship in the Old City were destroyed. The synagogues were razed or pillaged and stripped and their interiors used as hen-houses or stables.LETTER DATED 5 MARCH 1968 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF ISRAEL TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL Jordan and Palestine Jordan was not a member of the United Nations when the vote on the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine of 1947 was taken, but following the establishment of the state of Israel on 14 May 1948, Jordan, then known as Transjordan, was one of the Arab countries that immediately attacked the new country. It gained control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem (including the Old City), and expelled its remaining Jewish population. Jordan lost the West Bank during the 1967 Six-Day War, but did not relinquish its claim to the West Bank until 1988. Jordan significantly reduced its military participation in the Yom Kippur War in 1973 against Israel. Jordan eventually signed the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace in 1994, normalizing relations between the two countries. Trade and tourism Jordan has welcomed a number of Israeli companies to open plants in Jordan. Israeli tourists, as well as Jewish citizens of other countries, visit Jordan. In the year following the 1994 Israel-Jordan treaty, some 60,000 to 80,000 Israeli tourists visited Jordan. Expectations of closer relations between the countries led to a proposal to open a kosher restaurant in Amman. With a loss of Arab clientele, failure to secure kosher certification, and lack of interest among tourists, the enterprise failed. Following the Second Intifada (2000‚Äì2005), Israeli tourism to Jordan declined greatly, as a result of anti- Israeli agitation among a wide segment of the population. In August 2008, Jordanian border officials turned back a group of Israeli tourists who were carrying Jewish religious items. According to the guards, the items posed a \\"security risk,\\" even if used within the privacy of a hotel, and could not be brought into the country. In response, the tour group chose not to enter Jordan.Wagner, Matthew \\"Jordan bars Jews with religious items\\" Jerusalem Post August 14, 2008 The apparent ban on Jewish worship in Jordan was again enforced in August 2019, after a group of Israeli tourists shared a video of themselves dancing with a Torah scroll at the Tomb of Aaron on Mount Hor near Petra. Jordanian authorities confiscated Jewish religious items from the group and closed the summit to foreign tour groups that do not have permission to visit from the Awqaf Ministry. Part of the 1994 peace treaty restored political control of the 500-acre Tzofar farm fields in the Arava valley to Jordan, but Israel rented the land so that Israeli workers from the moshav could continue to cultivate it. This area is not subject to customs or immigration legislation.

History =Second Italo-Ethiopian War= The territorial division Cagliari was mobilized 1 October 1934, renamed Sabauda (30a) after a newly built town of Sabaudia and sent to Eritrea, arriving in Massawa 21 June 1935. During its absence on Sardinia until 9 February 1937, it was replaced in Sassari and Cagliari by Sassari II infantry division (130a) and Sassari II infantry brigade (130).http://www.regioesercito.it/reparti/fanteria/rediv30.htm Initially the Sabauda division was tasked with the defence of the Asmara-Dek‚ÄôemhƒÅre area. At the beginning of the war 3 October 1935, it held a defensive line near Barachit. After overcoming initial Ethiopian resistance at Fik‚Äôada (Focada) it advanced rapidly, but nearly came to a stop on 7 October 1935. In November 1935, it seized the Negash, Agula and Bolbala towns. It held positions on heights overlooking Tekez√© River during the Ethiopian Christmas Offensive. The division started to advance on 6 January 1936, but remained in Enderta Province during February 1936. The Sabauda division had a minor fight at Battle of Amba Aradam 13‚Äì27 February 1936. By 3 April 1936, the division arrived at Amba Alagi, where it won a decisive encounter and pursued the retreating Ethiopians to Agumserta and finally to Lake Ashenge. With way to Addis Ababa open, the division surged forward, reaching Shewa Kifle HƒÅger village on the capital's outskirts 26 April 1936, and captured Addis Ababa itself on 5 May 1936. The division remained in the capital area until December 1936, when it was recalled to Italy. =Second World War= 30th Division Sabauda was reorganized as a binary division 15 April 1939. It originally deployed between Cagliari and Iglesias, Sardinia, with headquarters in Cagliari. In June 1940, divisional positions were reduced to the area around Sulcis. The Sabauda division stayed there until Armistice of Cassibile was announced 8 September 1943. 10 September 1943 it repositioned to repel German forces at Villacidro-Samassi-Selegas-Suelli, facing north. After Wehrmacht forces evacuated to Corsica, the division was ordered to Sicily on 10 November 1943. It initially arrived in Enna-Caltanissetta region and until relocated to Messina-Catania-Syracuse area in September, 1944. On 1 October 1944, the division was relegated to security division status and performed various duties ranging from airfield and coastal defence to demining.

Students of the Talmud will also have a passive mastery of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. Adding hundreds of thousands of users with varying levels of Aramaic mastery. History Historically, eastern varieties of Aramaic have been more dominant, mainly due to their political acceptance in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Achaemenid Persian empires. With the later loss of political platforms to Greek and Persian, Eastern Aramaic continued to be used by the population of Mesopotamia. In Assyria, today's modern northern Iraq, south east Turkey and north east Syria, the local variety of eastern Aramaic, known as Syriac (the terms Syrian and Syriac originally being Indo-European derivatives of Assyrian) had emerged by the 5th century BC, and between the 1st and 4th centuries AD became a standard language among the Eastern Rite Christian Assyrians, being used in the Peshitta and by the poet Ephrem, and in the schools of Edessa and Nisibis, and later by the Saint Thomas Christians in India. In the region of Babylonia (modern Southern Iraq), rabbinical schools flourished, producing the Targumim and Talmud, making the language a standard of religious Jewish scholarship. Among the Mandaean ethnic community of Khuzestan and Iraq, another variety of eastern Aramaic, known as Mandaic, became the liturgical language of the religion. These varieties have widely influenced the less prominent Western Aramaic languages of the Levant, and the three classical languages outlined above have also influenced numerous vernacular varieties of Eastern Aramaic, some of which are spoken to this day, largely by ethnic Assyrians and Mandaeans (see Neo-Aramaic languages). Since the Muslim conquest of Persia of the seventh century, most of the population of the Middle East has undergone a gradual but steady language shift to Arabic. However there are still between some 550,000 - 1,000,000 fluent speakers among the indigenous ethnic Assyrians of northern Iraq, northeast Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran, as well as small migrant communities in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Armenia, Georgia, southern Russia and Azerbaijan. Most of these are members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, Chaldean Catholic Church, Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church. A further number may have a more sparse understanding of the language, due to pressures in their homelands to speak Arabic, Turkish, Persian or Kurdish, and due to the Assyrian Diaspora to the Western World.

The region has been heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and most recently, suburban development. These needs have wrought direct changes in the movement of water and the nature of the landscape, and indirect changes from the introduction of non- native species. New species have altered the architecture of the food web as surely as levees have altered the landscape of islands and channels that form the complex system known as the Delta.Kimmerer 2004 This article deals particularly with the ecology of the low salinity zone (LSZ) of the estuary. Reconstructing a historic food web for the LSZ is difficult for a number of reasons. First, there is no clear record of the species that historically have occupied the estuary. Second, the San Francisco Estuary and Delta have been in geologic and hydrologic transition for most of their 10,000 year history, and so describing the \\"natural\\" condition of the estuary is much like \\"hitting a moving target\\". Climate change, hydrologic engineering, shifting water needs, and newly introduced species will continue to alter the food web configuration of the estuary. This model provides a snapshot of the current state, with notes about recent changes or species introductions that have altered the configuration of the food web. Understanding the dynamics of the current food web may prove useful for restoration efforts to improve the functioning and species diversity of the estuary.  Physical geography  San Francisco Estuary c. 1770-1820 The San Francisco Bay is both a bay and an estuary. The former term refers to any inlet or cove providing a physical refuge from the open ocean. An estuary is any physiographic feature where freshwater meets an ocean or sea. The northern portion of the bay is a brackish estuary, consisting of a number of physical embayments which are dominated by both marine and fresh water fluxes. These geographic entities are, moving from saline to fresh (or west to east): San Pablo Bay, immediately north of the Central Bay; the Carquinez Strait, a narrow, deep channel leading to Suisun Bay; and the Delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. Until the 20th century, the LSZ of the estuary was fringed by tule-dominated freshwater wetlands. Between 80-95% of these historic wetlands have been filled to facilitate land use and development around the Bay Area.Conomos 1979 Habitat loss at the edges of the pelagic zone is thought to create a loss of native pelagic fish species, by increasing vulnerability to predation. The intertidal and benthic estuary is presently dominated by mudflats that are largely the result of sedimentation derived from gold mining in the Sierra Nevada in the late 19th century. The trend toward high sediment loads was reversed in the 1950s with the advent of the Central Valley Project, locking up most sediment behind dams, and resulting in an annual net loss of sediments from the estuary.Vayssieres 2006 Thus the mudflats appear to be slowly receding, although turbidity remains extremely high. The high turbidity of the water is responsible for the unique condition that exists in the San Francisco Estuary wherein high nutrient availability does not lead to high phytoplankton production. Instead, most algae photosynthetic organisms are light- limited.Jassby 2000 The Delta has likewise experienced heavy alteration. Beginning in the 19th century, naturally occurring levees were reinforced for permanency, to protect farmlands from regular flooding. Many of these farms were established on peat islands occurring in the middle of the Delta waterways. Intensive farming oxidized the high carbon content of the soil, causing considerable loss of soil mass. As a consequence, these islands have subsided, or sunk, to nearly 6 meters below sea level.Deverel 1998 The Delta today consists of highly riprapped waterways, punctuated by islands that appear like \\"floating bowls\\" with their basins far below the surface of the water.Philip 2007 These islands are at high risk for flooding due to levee collapse. The subsequent eastward shift in salinity is expected to dramatically alter the ecology of the entire LSZ of the San Francisco Estuary.Lund 2007  Hydrodynamics  Freshwater stream feeding into the San Francisco Estuary The LSZ centers around 2 psu (practical salinity units, a measurement of salinity) and ranges from about 6 psu down to 0.5 psu. The primary fresh water inputs to the estuary derive from runoff of regional precipitation, the Sacramento River, and the San Joaquin River.Kimmerer 2002 River inflow is largely controlled by upstream reservoir releases. A significant fraction of this inflow is exported out of the Delta by the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project to southern California for agricultural and urban use. These alterations have removed much of the variation in through-estuary outflow (i. e., freshwater that makes it out the Golden Gate), creating lower outflow in the winter and higher outflow in the summer than historically found in the estuary. On average, freshwater flows into the estuary are 50% of historic flows. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larval and adult fish can become entrained in the export pumps, causing a potentially significant but unknown impact on the abundance of these organisms. This may be particularly true of the endangered delta smelt, a small endemic fish; unexceptional except that it has been described as being tremendously abundant in historical accounts.Moyle 1992 The delta smelt is believed to migrate and spawn upstream in the Delta during the early summer, placing its eggs and larvae at high risk for entrainment.Bennett 2006 Management for the smelt is currently the source of controversy as its ecology brings into collision course the disparate water needs of conservation, development and agriculture in California. The movement of water out of the estuary is complex and dependent upon a number of factors. Tidal cycles cause water to move toward and away from the Golden Gate four times in a 24-hour period. Using 2 psu as a marker for the Low Salinity Zone, the direction and magnitude of fluctuations can be tracked as its distance in kilometers from the Golden Gate, or X2. Because the position of X2 relies upon a number of physical parameters including inflow, export, and tides, its position shifts over many kilometers on a daily and seasonal cycle; over the course of a year, it can range from San Pablo Bay during high flow periods, up into the Delta during the summer drought. The position of X2 is carefully monitored and maintained by releasing water from upstream reservoirs in anticipation of export demand. This is mandated by State Water Board Decision 1641 and requires that state and federal pumping be curtailed if X2 is shifted east of Chipps Island (75 river kilometers upstream of the Golden Gate Bridge) during the months of February through May, or east of Collinsville (81 river kilometers upstream of the Golden Gate Bridge) during the months of January, June, July and August. (D-1641 pp 150) Gravitational circulation causes stratified high salinity water at depth to flow landward while low salinity water on top flows seaward.Monismith 1996 The effect of gravitational circulation may be most pronounced during periods of high fresh water flow, providing a negative feedback for maintaining the salt field and the distribution of pelagic organisms in the estuary. Mixing is important at the landward edge of gravitational circulation, often around X2, where the water column becomes less stratified.Burau 1998 A fixed mixing zone occurs at the \\"Benicia Bump\\" at the east end of the Carquinez Strait, where the deep channel becomes dramatically shallower as it enters Suisun Bay.Schoellhamer 2001 Mixing is critical in maintaining salinity such that extremely large inputs of fresh water are required to move X2 a short distance to the west. Mixing also assists pelagic organisms in maintaining position in the estuary, slowing the advection of primary and secondary production out of the system. Pelagic zone Pelagic organisms spend all or part of their lives in the open water, where habitat is defined not by edges but by physiological tolerance to salinity and temperature. The Low Salinity Zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco Estuary constitutes a habitat for a suite of organisms that are specialized to survive in this unique confluence of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine influences. While there are many habitats with distinct ecologies that are part of the estuary (including marine, freshwater, intertidal marsh and benthic mudflat systems) each is linked to the LSZ by export and import of freshwater, nutrients, carbon, and organisms. The distribution and abundance of organisms in the LSZ is dependent upon both abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include the physical geography and hydrology of the estuary, including nutrient inputs, sediment load, turbidity, environmental stochasticity, climate and anthropogenic influences. Abiotic factors tend to drive production in the estuarine environment, and are mediated by biotic factors. Biotic factors include nutrient uptake and primary production, secondary production of zooplankton, food web and trophic dynamics, energetic transfer, advection and dispersal in and out of the system, survival and mortality, predation, and competition from introduced species.  Food web  trophic or ecological pyramid It is difficult to characterize the historic food web of the San Francisco Estuary because of the dramatic changes in geography, hydrology, and species composition that have occurred in the past century. However, monitoring begun in the 1970s gives some information about the historic dynamics of the foodweb. Prior to the 1980s the LSZ was dominated by a phytoplankton-driven foodweb, a stable mesoplankton population dominated by the copepod Eurytemora affinis, and large macrozooplankton typified by San Francisco bay shrimp and mysid shrimps.Orsi 1986 These provided nutrition and energy to native filter feeders such as the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and planktivores such as delta smelt and juvenile salmon. Food web change has been driven historically by increased turbidity, and more recently by introduced species, as described in the sections on primary and secondary production. Notably, the high clearance rate of the introduced Amur River clam Potamocorbula amurensis population has produced a ten-fold decline in plankton density, resulting in a carbon trap in the benthos and an assumed increase in waste detrital production.Kimmerer 1996 This waste is hypothesized to fuel the microbial loop, resulting in an increase in microzooplankton such as the copepod Limnoithona tetraspina, which utilize rotifers and ciliates. These changes are one cause for declining fish stocks. For example, the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, was until the 1980s quite abundant in the Low Salinity Zone, until its range in the estuary became restricted to the Central and South Bays.Kimmerer 2006 This is probably due to a behavioral response following the introduction of the Amur River (Potamocorbula amurensis) clam and the subsequent decline in plankton availability. More recently, a general pelagic organism decline (POD) was described, and this has been the source of much concern within the scientific, managerial, and political communities. Several key species, including delta smelt, longfin smelt, striped bass, and threadfin shad have been declared \\"species of interest\\" because of a stepwise decline in abundance beginning in 2001.Taugher 2005 This was attended by a similar decline in secondary productivity and is currently the source of much research. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the POD, including food web decline, water exports from the Delta, and toxics from urban, industrial, or agricultural sources.  Producers  = Primary production and nutrient uptake = Primary production by phytoplankton fixes energy and key nutrients into a biologically available form (i.e., food), via photosynthesis. Phytoplankton production is largely structured by physical parameters: nutrient availability, sunlight, turbidity, and temperature. The San Francisco Estuary has a numerous sources of nutrients that can be used for primary production, derived largely from waste water treatment facilities, agricultural and urban drainage, and the ocean.Smith 2002Dugdale 2003 In spite of this, the estuary is unique in that it tends to have a relatively depressed rate of primary production.Jassby 2002 This is probably due to two factors: large inputs of nitrogen in the form of ammonium, which suppresses nitrate uptake by phytoplankton, which prefer the metabolically cheaper NH4+, and high turbidity, which limits light required for photosynthesis to the top few centimeters of the water column. This turbidity is a legacy of hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada in the 1850s.Nichols 1986 High residence time of water in the estuary tends to allow phytoplankton biomass to accumulate, increasing density, while low residence time removes phytoplankton from the estuary. The latter is typical of the main channels of the estuary during periods of high flow, when surface waters tend to flush particles and plankton downstream. Herbivory also removes phytoplankton from the water column. While the pelagic food web is based upon phytoplankton production, most of this production is diverted to the benthos via predation by the introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Levels of phytoplankton biomass declined by an order of magnitude after the widespread introduction of C. amurensis in the mid-1980s, and have not rebounded.Kimmerer 1994 = Photosynthetic production = The main source of photosynthetically derived energy is phytoplankton. Generally speaking, diatoms and microflagellates produce most of the bioavailable carbon in the estuary.Jassby and Cloern 2000 Other types, notably the dinoflagellates, may produce harmful algal blooms, or red tides, that are less readily available for assimilation into the foodweb.Anderson et al. 2002 Primary production from phytoplankton is a function of two different factors: growth rates and accumulation (Fig. 1). Although the LSZ is a sink for high concentrations of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources, phytoplankton production rates are quite low.Jassby et al. 2002 Nitrate is optimally used by phytoplankton for growth, but ammonium (largely derived from sewage outfalls) has a suppressive effect on growth rate. Thus, while not nutrient limited, phytoplankton tend to grow more slowly due to the kinds of nitrogen present.Dugdale et al. 2003 Another suppressive factor on growth rate is the high turbidity of the estuary, which limits the ability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to penetrate beyond the top few centimeters of the water column. This limits phytoplankton photosynthesis to a relatively shallow photic zone. Thus, when the water column is stratified, turbidity is high, and ammonium is present, the growth rate of phytoplankton is typically suppressed.Cloern 1987Cole and Cloern 1987 Phytoplankton accumulation is primarily the result of residence time. The north Delta and Suisun Bay have relatively low residence times due to the high volume of water moving through the region for downstream flow and for export to southern California. Since water moves more rapidly through this part of the system, the rate of accumulation decreases as productivity is advected out of the system. In contrast, parts of the southern Delta have a higher residence time due to the low volume of water moving through the system; in fact the water on occasion runs backwards, due to the lack of inflow from the San Joaquin River, and export pumping. During summer, phytoplankton density may be an order of magnitude higher here than in other parts of the estuary.Ball and Arthur 1979 Harmful algal blooms (HAB's) of dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria produce toxic metabolic byproducts that render them noxious to many organisms. Fostered by a combination of high nutrient concentrations and temperatures, HAB's have a doubly negative effect on the food web by competitively excluding diatoms and microflagellates, further reducing bioavailable primary production. While certain invertebrates such as bivalves may not be directly affected, they may propagate toxins up the food chain, sickening or killing predators. It is not well understood how copepods are affected. The invasive algae Microcystis aeruginosa is now common in the Delta during summer months and may reduce copepod productivity (in addition to being potentially carcinogenic for humans).Lehman and Waller 2003 = Detrital production = Enormous quantities of sediment and detritus flux through the LSZ. Much of this is organic debris in the form of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM, respectively). In addition to upstream sources, organic matter may accumulate from local organism mortality and waste production.Murrell et al. 1999Murrell and Hollibaugh 2000 Detritivores capitalize upon this energy source, creating an alternate and parallel food web of potentially large importance. This is because carbon fixation into the detrital food web is not limited by stratification, turbidity or day length, all of which limit photosynthesis. Detrital production occurs continuously, limited only by inputs and advection out of the Delta system.Jassby et al. 1993 Bacteria are the chief agents of transformation of DOM and POM into bioavailable carbon through the microbial loop. This mechanism is particularly important in nutrient limited marine systems, where bacteria release nutrients from sinking detritus, allowing it to be recycled back to the photic zone. Little work has been applied to the function of the microbial loop in the San Francisco Estuary, but it may be that the role of bacteria is not critical for recycling nutrients in a eutrophic system. Rather, they may provide an alternative food chain through direct grazing by flagellates, rotifers and ciliates.Hollibaugh and Wong 1996 The high abundance of the cyclopoid copepod Limnoithona tetraspina may be due to its reliance on ciliates rather than phytoplankton as a primary food source.Bouley 2006 The major species of calanoid copepods may also use ciliates as a supplementary or even primary food source, but to what degree is unknown.Rollwagen-Bollens and Penry 2003Rollwagen-Bollens et al. 2006 = Secondary production = Secondary production refers to organisms that feed on primary production and transfer energy to higher trophic levels of the estuarine foodweb. Historically, secondary production in the San Francisco Estuary was dominated by mysid shrimp production.Modlin 1997Kimmerer 1998 However, the native mysid Neomysis mercedis has been largely replaced by the introduced Acanthomysis bowmani, which persists at lower densities. The introduced amphipod Gammurus daiberi may have taken over some of this niche, but it is largely restricted to fresh water. Today, the main source of secondary production derives from copepods. The naturalized native calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis is believed to have been introduced near the end of 19th century.Lee 1999 It dominated the zooplankton of the low salinity zone until the 1980s when it was largely replaced by another introduced calanoid copepod, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi.Orsi 1991 P. forbesi persists by maintaining a source population in freshwater, high-residence regions of the estuary, particularly in the Delta, outside the range of salinity tolerance of the Amur River clam.Durand2006 Because the once-dominant E. affinis lacks an upstream range, it is more vulnerable to predation by the clam, and suffers from apparent competition with P. forbesi. Other calanoid copepods that may be of significance are the recently introduced Sinocalanus doerri and Acartiella sinensis. Little is known about the life histories of these organisms, although based upon their morphology, they may prey on other copepods. They appear in irregular cycles of abundance, during which they may dominate the zooplankton.Orsi 1999 Yet another invasive copepod, the very small cyclopoid Limnoithona tetraspina, appeared in the Low Salinity Zone in the 1990s. Since then, L. tetraspina has become the numerically dominant copepod, reaching densities on the order of 10,000/m3. It relies on the microbial loop as its food source, feeding upon bacteria, ciliates and rotifers. In addition, it seems invulnerable to predation by the Amur River clam, for reasons that are unknown. Because of its small size, L. tetraspina is generally not available for consumption by larger predators, particularly fish, making it an energetic dead end.  Consumers  = Primary consumers = Primary consumers rely upon primary production as a main food source. The most important consumers of the pelagic web of the LSZ are copepods, along with the rotifers, flagellates and ciliates mentioned above. All species of calanoid copepods have declined under high predation pressure from the recently introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Because of this, and because copepods rely upon both photosynthetic and detrital food sources, copepods in the LSZ have limited feedback on primary production, unlike marine and lentic systems where copepods can graze down blooms in a matter of days. Pseudodiaptomus forbesi is the dominant calanoid copepod of the LSZ in terms of biomass. It has a sufficiently wide salinity tolerance that it can persist both at low salinity and in fresh water. This wide distribution helps the population maintain an upstream refuge from predation, unlike other species with narrower salinity tolerances. Limnoithona tetraspina has become the numerically dominant cyclopoid copepod since its introduction in 1993. It feeds primarily upon ciliates and microflagellates, but unlike P. forbesi, it is relatively impervious to predation by clams or fish, hence its abundance. Energetically, L. tetraspina may be a dead end for the food web; these copepods are either advected out of the system by tides and currents, or die and fall down to the benthos, where they may be available to the microbial loop, or to detritivores.Bouley and Kimmerer 2006 = Predatory copepods = A number of predatory copepods exist throughout the Delta, about which relatively little is known. Sinocalanus doerri, Acartiella sinensis, and Tortanus dextrilobatus all appear to be morphologically capable of predation upon other copepods. Each was introduced to the estuary, probably through ballast water exchange since the 1980s. Generally, they are not in sufficient abundance to negatively impact copepod consumers; however, periodic blooms of S. doerri and A. sinensis occur which have not been well studied.Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999 = Macroinvertebrates = A decline in mysids has been linked to a decline in some fish species that feed on them. While capable of filter-feeding, mysids (tiny shrimp-like creatures) are largely carnivorous, feeding on copepod adults. They provided an energetic conduit between plankton and planktivorous fishes, including juvenile fishes, sturgeon, Chinook salmon, and American shad. Mysids were once abundant until the native Neomysis mercedis was replaced in the mid-1980s by the invasive Acanthomysis bowmani, which is smaller and less abundant. Mysid decline has been linked to the subsequent decline in a number of fish species in the estuary in the 1980s and '90s.Orsi and Knutson 1979Modlin and Orsi 1997 Shrimp are generalist carnivores who prey largely on mysids and amphipods. Crangon franciscorum represents one of two remaining commercial fisheries in the estuary. While no longer used for \\"San Francisco Bay shrimp cocktails\\", they are harvested for bait. Other predators include striped bass and Chinook salmon adults and smolts.Sitts and Knight 1979 = Fish = Pregnant American shads compete for food with the Amur River clam. Because fish are a taxonomically and morphologically diverse group, species vary in their trophic ecologies. In general, fish can be divided into four broad feeding categories: filter feeders, planktivores, piscivores and benthic feeders. Filter feeders strain the water column indiscriminately for small prey, typically phyto- and zooplankton. This category of fishes includes threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), inland silversides (Menidia beryllina), and anchovies (Engraulis mordax). Some evidence suggests that some of these species are food-limited due to the depressed levels of plankton after the introduction of the Amur River clam. Anchovies have left the LSZ in favor of more productive regions of the estuary in the San Pablo and Central Bays. Planktivores selectively prey upon individual zooplankton, such as copepods, mysids and gammarids. This group includes most fish larvae, delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), tule perch (Hysterocarpus traski), and salmon smolts. The delta smelt is of particular interest due to its endangered status. It may be food-limited, but the evidence is somewhat contradictory. Other factors, such as entrainment of eggs and larvae in the export pumping of fresh water from the Delta may also explain the decline. The striped bass is the main piscivore of the LSZ. The main piscivore of the LSZ is the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), which was introduced in the 1890s and preys heavily upon native fishes. Striped bass are an important sport fishery in the San Francisco Estuary, and as such, represent a minor withdrawal of biomass from the estuary.Radovich 1963 Benthic, or bottom-dwelling, fishes include white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus). Because of their habitat orientation, they feed primarily on epibenthic organisms such as amphipods, bay shrimp, and bivalves. These fish are known to feed at least occasionally on the Amur River clam, which would represent one of the few channels for energy flow from that species, except for detrital production.Peterson 1997 The sole commercial fishery in the LSZ is for bait shrimp. There are a variety of sports fisheries that represent a minor flow of carbon, but significant flows of capital to local economies around the estuary. Most of the recreational fisheries surround striped bass, sturgeon, and introduced fresh water basses in the freshwater Delta. This paucity of fisheries makes the San Francisco Estuary unique. Nearly all estuaries worldwide support at least remnants of significant fisheries.Nichols et al. 1986 The San Francisco Estuary at one time supported major fisheries for salmon, anchovies, and Dungeness crabs until the 1950s. The demise of these fisheries was probably due more to habitat loss than overharvesting. = Birds = The San Francisco Estuary is a major stop on the Pacific flyway for migrating waterfowl. Yet little is known about the flow of carbon in or out of the estuary via birds. Millions of waterfowl annually use the bay shallows as a refuge. Most of the birds are dabbling ducks that feed on submerged aquatic vegetation. Diving ducks (such as scaups) feed on epibenthic organisms like C. amurensis, representing a possible flow of carbon from that otherwise dead end.Poulton et al. 2002Richman and Lovvorn 2004 Two endangered species of birds are found here: the California least tern and the California clapper rail. Exposed bay muds provide important feeding areas for shorebirds, but underlying layers of bay mud pose geological hazards for structures near many parts of the bay perimeter. Piscivorous birds such as cormorants and pelicans also inhabit the estuary, but their trophic impact remains poorly studied. In January 2015, scientists were working to identify a gray, thick, sticky, odorless substance coating on birds along San Francisco Bay shorelines. Hundreds of birds have died, and hundreds more have been coated with the substance. Scientists are concerned about other wildlife that may be at risk from the substance.Scientists race to identify goop on birds along San Francisco Bay shorelines(January 2015), Christian Science Monitor =Mammals= beaver in Alhambra Creek, downtown Martinezleft River otter sunning on rocks in the Richmond Marina Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious quantities of beaver (Castor canadensis), river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris). This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was more than any other single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the nearby Farallon Islands from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. By 1818 the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands until they began to recolonize the islands in 1996. Although 20th-century naturalists were skeptical that beaver were historically extant in coastal streams or the Bay itself, earlier records show that the California golden beaver (Castor canadensis ssp. subauratus) was one of the most valued of the animals taken, and apparently was found in great abundance. Thomas McKay reported that in one year the Hudson's Bay Company took 4,000 beaver skins on the shores of San Francisco Bay. Recently, beaver have recolonized the brackish Napa Sonoma Marsh in north San Pablo Bay and its Sonoma Creek and Napa River tributaries. Also recently re-colonizing the Bay and its tributaries, the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, and recently in Corte Madera Creek, and in the south Bay on Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. = Jellyfish = Jellyfish have not been prevalent in the estuary until recently. In East Coast estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay, they are often top-level predators, feeding indiscriminately on both fish and zooplankton. Several small invasive taxa have been identified in the LSZ and freshwater regions. These species strobilate in summer, but maintain polyps in the benthos year round. Their impact on the plankton is unknown, but research is underway to quantify it. In sufficient density, jellies may have a complementary role to C. amurensis in suppressing zooplankton, by inhabiting areas of low salinity outside the range of the clams, where planktonic species have had a predation-free refuge. = Benthic consumers = The benthic community has taken on a disproportionately large role in the food web ecology of the estuary due to key invasions by bivalves. The use of these clams, the Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis) has a wide salinity tolerance that extends into the low salinity zone, but not into freshwater. It filter feeds on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, such as calanoid copepod nauplii. The clam has few predators in the San Francisco Estuary and this allows it to grow to high densities (on the order of tens of thousands/m2). Because of its high clearance rates, it is capable of clearing the entire water column of portions of the estuary in a few days, leading to drastically depleted plankton populations.Werner and Hollibaugh 1993 This is thought to be the main cause of a decline in ecosystem productivity after the invasion of the clams in the mid-1980s.Carlton et al. 1990Nichols et al. 1990 This decline in productivity is essentially due to the redirection of the pelagic network to a benthic chain by this one species. Because the Amur River clam feeds on primary producers, consumers and predators, it impacts multiple trophic levels. Consequently, nearly all plankton exhibit signs of apparent competition, in that production at one trophic level impacts all others by increasing clam abundance. This results in a negative feedback loop: C. amurensis limits plankton biomass, which in turn limits C. amurensis. However, inputs from outside the system due to tidal advection or upstream sources may increase C. amurensis biomass, further driving plankton limitation. This feedback loop is further amplified because the clam may persist for more than one or two years, which puts added pressure on plankton populations during cycles of low productivity. The redirection of carbon by C. amurensis to the benthos has created a limited chain, leaving the pelagic web depauperate. Detrital production from clam excretion and death may fuel bacterial production, which may be circulated into the detrital food web, or microbial loop. While the recycled nutrients may support some phytoplankton growth, it ultimately feeds back to increased C. amurensis populations. The recent invasion success of Limnoithona tetraspina may be understood in terms of this phenomenon. It feeds on ciliates and microflagellates which are too small to be grazed by the clam, thereby avoiding competition. Additionally, L. tetraspina appears impervious to predation by the clam or (almost) anything else. The rise of the microbial food web and the invasion of L. tetraspina capitalize are the result of an untapped alternative path for energy flow in the food web, facilitated by C. amurensis. Subsequent patterns of invasion may reflect a similar pattern.  Introduced species  Species introductions have been increasing since at least the 19th century as a function of increasing trade and traffic. Introductions include numerous taxa, including copepods, shrimp, amphipods, bivalves, fish and both rooted and floating plants. Many pelagic species have been introduced most recently through ballast water releases from large ships directly into the estuary.Carlton 1996 As a result, many of these introduced species originate from estuaries around the Pacific Rim, particularly copepods such as P. forbesi and L. tetraspina. The Amur River clam originates from Asia, and has created significant and drastic changes to the ecology of the LSZ, primarily by diverting pelagic food to the benthos and into an accelerated microbial loop.Cole 1992 Species have also been introduced via attachment to sporting boats which are trailered between regions. This is the probable source of a number of low salinity plants like Egeria densa and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). These plants have created profound changes in the Delta by disrupting water flow, shading phytoplankton, and providing habitat for piscivorous fish like the striped bass, Morone saxatilis, itself intentionally introduced in the late 1800s from the Chesapeake Bay. The freshwater quagga mussel, originally from Europe, is expected to be introduced by boaters within the next two to ten years, in spite of precautionary measures.Dey 2007 Furthermore, the young age and isolated environment of the San Francisco estuary has resulted in the success of invasive invertebrates due to the lack of biodiversity. = Future invasions = The modern food web is derived from a series of invasions and trophic substitutions. This process is expected to continue, as new organisms arrive through accidental or intentional introductions. What is less clear is the extent to which previous introductions pave the way for future invasions. This may occur in one of three ways. * An early invader may provide a resource that is unutilized in the new system until a new predator is introduced (L. tetraspina and the microbial loop, as described above). * Early invaders may facilitate new ones by altering habitat and making it suitable for subsequent invasions (jelly polyps using Amur River clam shells for substrate). * Apparent competition between old and new residents may increase the possibilities for invasion and settlement of new organisms that can capitalize on unexploited resources (the subsidization of the Amur River clam by upstream populations of the introduced copepod P. forbesi, creating pressure on native copepods).  Summary  The LSZ food web of the San Francisco Estuary operates in two parallel and asymmetrical directions. The bulk of carbon is assimilated into the benthic and microbial loops, which represent energetic dead ends. A smaller fraction is delivered to higher pelagic trophic levels which may support copepods, fish, birds and fisheries. This redirection of the food web into these two narrow loops may be responsible for the decline in macroinvertebrates and fishes in the estuary, which operate outside of these chains. Restoration of the estuary to a higher degree of function relies upon the probability of delivering increased benefits to the pelagic web without subsidizing the benthic.  Future ecology  The ecology of the Low Salinity Zone of the San Francisco Estuary is difficult to characterize because it is the result of a complex synergy of both abiotic and biotic factors. In addition, it continues to undergo rapid change resulting from newly introduced species, direct anthropogenic influences and climate change. Future ecological changes will be driven on an ecosystem wide scale, particularly as sea level rise, tectonic instability and infrastructure decline cause levee failure in the Delta.Epstein 2006 The resulting back-surge in water flow is expected to force X2 into the Delta, jeopardizing spatially oriented habitat (like freshwater marshes), channelizing the low salinity zone, and threatening southern California's water supply, with unknown and unforeseeable consequences for the natural and human ecology of the West coast's largest estuary.

Artillery Regiment from Pinerolo Division entering Ohrid, Yugoslavia on April 12, 1941. The 24th Infantry Division Pinerolo was an infantry division of the Italian Army during World War II.  History  After the end of World War I the Pinerolo Brigade moved to Abruzzo and was garrisoned in the city of Chieti. In 1926 the brigade gained the 255th Infantry Regiment Arezzo and changed its name to XXIV Infantry Brigade. Along with the 18th Artillery Regiment the brigade formed the 24th Territorial Division in Chieti. In 1934 the division and brigade gained the name Gran Sasso and were forthwith known as 24th Infantry Division Gran Sasso and XXIV Infantry Brigade Gran Sasso. In 1935 the division was sent to Eritrea and participated in the Second Italo- Abyssinian War. The division operated in the Tigray Region and fought in the Battle of Shire. In 1939 the brigade lost the 255th Infantry regiment and was renamed 24th Infantry Division Pinerolo. This binary division consisted of only two infantry regiments (13th and 14th) and the 18th Field Artillery Regiment. In 1940 the Pinerolo took part in the Italian invasion of France. In January 1941 the division arrived in Albania to stabilize the crumbling Italian front during the Greek counteroffensive in the Greco-Italian War. On 18 January 1941 the division was in Berat and entered the approaching front near K√´lcyr√´. The division fought defensive battles for the next month ending with the defense of Tepelen√´. The division participated in the Italian Spring Offensive, and participated in a small offensive towards Ohrid in Macedonia during the German-led Invasion of Yugoslavia. In June 1941 the division transferred to Larissa in Thessaly to suppress the growing Greek Resistance. During its time in Thessaly the Pinerolo division committed the Domenikon Massacre against Greek civilians. The division continued on anti-partisan duty until the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of 8 September 1943. In the confusion after the armistice the division was the only one in continental Greece to refuse German demands to surrender. While the Piemonte, Forl√¨, Modena, Casale and Cagliari divisions surrendered to the inferior German forces the Pinerolo defended Larissa against German attacks and then retired towards the Pindus mountain range. There, it conflicted with the Greek People's Liberation Army. The presence of a well-disciplined and well-supplied military force in Greece not underneath ELAS' command worried ELAS. After the Allies refused ELAS' demands of breaking up Pinerolo and scattering it all over Greece, ELAS took matters into its own hands. It surrounded Pinerolo, forced them to surrender, confiscated their supplies and weapons, and used the Italian soldiers themselves for forced labour. After the war on 15 April 1952 the Italian Army raised the Pinerolo Infantry Division again, however on 1 September 1962 the division was reduced to brigade and it has been active as such since then. (see Pinerolo Mechanized Brigade) The remnants of the division were repatriated to Italy in March 1945.

Ritman Library - Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica ) was a Christian theologian and bishop. Sozomen Cites: Hist. eccl., III, xiv. names Titus among the great men of the time of Constantius. Life Sozomen also tells Cites: Hist. eccl., V, xv. of a mean trick played upon Titus by Julian the Apostate. It was expected that the reestablishment of paganism would cause riots, as it had elsewhere. Julian wrote to Titus, as bishop of Bostra (now Bosra) that he would hold him and the clergy responsible for any disorder. Titus replied that though the Christians were equal in number to the pagans they would obey him and keep quiet. Julian then wrote to the Bostrians urging them to expel Titus because he had calumniated them by attributing their quiet conduct not to their own good dispositions but to his influence. Titus remained bishop at Bostra until c. 371.Samuel N. C. Lieu, Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China (1992), p. 132. According to Socrates Cites: Hist. eccl., III, xxv. Titus was one of the bishops who signed the Synodal Letter, addressed to Jovian by the Council of Antioch (363), in which the Nicene Creed was accepted, though with a clause \\"intended somewhat to weaken and semiarianize the expression homoousios\\". Cites: Hefele, \\"Councils\\", II, p. 283. Works St. Jerome Cites:Ep. Lxx names Titus among writers whose secular erudition is as marvellous as their knowledge of Scripture; in his De Viris Illustribus, cii, he speaks of his \\"mighty\\" (fortes) books against the Manichaean and nonnulla alia. He places his death under Valens. Of the nonnulla alia only fragments of exegetical writings have survived. These show that Titus followed the Antiochene School of Scripture exegesis in keeping to the literal as opposed to the allegorical interpretation. His Contra Manich√¶os is the most important work of the kind that has come down to us; it is extremely valuable because of the number of quotations it contains from Manichaean writers. The work consists of four books of which the fourth and the greater part of the third are only extant in a Syriac translation. The Greek and Syriac texts of the Contra Manich√¶os were published by Paul de Lagarde (Berlin, 1859). Earlier editions of the Greek text suffer from an insertion from a work of Serapion owing to the misplacement of a leaf in the original codex. The latest edition by Paul-Huber Poirier of the extant Greek text and the more extensive Syriac translation appeared 2013 (Corpus Christianorum Series Graeca 82).Corpus Christianorum, Series Graeca 82: Titus Bostrensis: Contra Manichaeos Graece et Syriace, ed.

Namibia's declaration of independence, internationally recognized on April 1, eliminated the southwestern front of combat as South African forces withdrew to the east. The MPLA abolished the one-party system in June and rejected Marxist-Leninism at the MPLA's third Congress in December, formally changing the party's name from the MPLA-PT to the MPLA. The National Assembly passed law 12/91 in May 1991, coinciding with the withdrawal of the last Cuban troops, defining Angola as a \\"democratic state based on the rule of law\\" with a multi-party system. Observers met such changes with skepticism. American journalist Karl Maier wrote, \\"In the new Angola, ideology is being replaced by the bottom line, as security and selling expertise in weaponry have become a very profitable business. Michael Johns, The Heritage Foundation's primary Reagan Doctrine advocate and a key Savimbi advisor, described the Soviet Union and Cuba's diplomatic initiatives as \\"a perilous moment\\" and urged the U.S. to maintain military pressure on Angola's government through escalated support to UNITA in an effort to ensure the withdrawal of Soviet and Cuban troops and the establishment of free and fair elections. Savimbi wounded in combat U.S.-supported UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. In early 1990, the MPLA sought to overrun UNITA militarily in southern Angola in several major military offensives, coordinated with Soviet and Cuban troops and military advisors. While UNITA ultimately repelled the offensives, Savimbi sustained bullet wounds twice in battles in January and February 1990, though they did not restrict his mobilityAlao (1994). p. XX. In Washington, D.C., Savimbi's supporters warned that continued Soviet support for the MPLA was threatening U.S.-Soviet relations in global affairs and undermining Mikhail Gorbachev's promises of \\"new thinking\\" in Moscow's foreign policy. The Heritage Foundation's Michael Johns wrote that, \\"If there is 'new thinking' in Soviet foreign policy and if Gorbachev is, as he claims, very different from Leonid Brezhnev, then Moscow will call off the Angolan offensive. If not, then Gorbachev's 'new thinking' will fail its first regional test, forcing America to reconsider its new relaxed attitude toward the Soviet Union.\\"\\"Angola: Testing Gorbachev's 'New Thinking', by Michael Johns, Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #259, February 5, 1990. Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly As Washington's role in the Angolan conflict grew, Savimbi retained Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, an influential lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C., paying the firm US$5 million for government and public relations support on UNITA's behalf. Savimbi reaped huge rewards. Senators Larry Smith and Dante Fascell, a senior member of the firm, worked with the Cuban American Negro Foundation, Representative Claude Pepper of Florida, Neal Blair's Free the Eagle, and Howard Phillips The Conservative Caucus to repeal the Clark Amendment in 1985. From the amendment's repeal in 1985 to 1992 the U.S. government gave Savimbi $60 million per year, a total of $300 million. A sizable amount of the aid went to Savimbi's personal expenses. Black, Manafort filed foreign lobbying records with the U.S. Justice Department showing Savimbi's expenses during his U.S. visits. During his December 1990 visit he spent $136,424 at the Park Hyatt hotel and $2,705 in tips. He spent almost $473,000 in October 1991 during his week-long visit to Washington and Manhattan. He spent $98,022 in hotel bills, at the Park Hyatt, $26,709 in limousine rides in Washington and another $5,293 in Manhattan. Paul Manafort, a partner in the firm, charged Savimbi $19,300 in consulting and additional $1,712 in expenses. He also bought $1,143 worth of \\"survival kits\\" from Motorola. When questioned in an interview in 1990 about human rights abuses under Savimbi, Charlie Black, a partner in the firm, said, \\"Now when you're in a war, trying to manage a war, when the enemy... is no more than a couple of hours away from you at any given time, you might not run your territory according to New Hampshire town meeting rules.\\" In December 1990, Savimbi returned to Washington, D.C., meeting with President George H. W. Bush and several of his key American advisors, the fourth of five trips he made to the United States. Bicesse Accords President dos Santos met with Savimbi in Lisbon, Portugal and signed the Bicesse Accords, the first of three major peace agreements, on May 31, 1991, with the mediation of the Portuguese government. The accords laid out a transition to multi-party democracy under the supervision of the United Nations' UNAVEM II mission with a presidential election in a year. The agreement attempted to demobilize the 152,000 active fighters and integrate the remaining government troops and UNITA rebels into a 50,000-strong Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). The FAA would consist of a national army with 40,000 troops, navy with 6,000, and air force with 4,000. While UNITA largely did not disarm, the FAA complied with the accord and demobilized about half of its forces, leaving the government disadvantaged. Angola held the first round of its 1992 presidential election on September 29-September 30. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair, but he sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round.Rothchild (1997). Page 134. The election process broke down on October 31, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. This began what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. On November 2, assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy, pulling him from his car and shooting him and two others dead. Confiscated by the Angolan military, the three bodies were never seen again. =Savimbi and UNITA return to war= Following the Chitunda killing, Savimbi questioned the legitimacy of the general election, announced that he was withdrawing from the run-off election, and led UNITA to war, scoring major military successes in 1993. On April 13, 1993, The New York Times reported that, \\"Nearly six months after the elections that were supposed to cement the peace in Angola, the rebel leader who lost in the vote has resumed the civil war and scored such enormous advances that there is talk he might engineer an outright military victory.\\"\\"Angola Rebels Rebound, Within Reach of Victory,\\" The New York Times, April 13, 1993. UNITA regained control over Caxito, Huambo, M'banza Kongo, Ndalatando, and U√≠ge, provincial capitals it had not held since 1976, and moved against Kuito, Luena, and Malange. Although the U.S. and South African governments had stopped aiding UNITA, supplies continued to come from Mobutu in Zaire.Hodges (2004). Pages 15-16. UNITA tried to wrest control of Cabinda from the MPLA in January 1993. Edward DeJarnette, Head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Angola for the Clinton Administration, warned Savimbi that, if UNITA hindered or halted Cabinda's production, the U.S. would end its support for UNITA. On January 9, UNITA began a 55-day-long battle over Huambo, the War of the Cities. Hundreds of thousands fled and 10,000 were killed before UNITA gained control on March 7. The government engaged in an ethnic cleansing of Bakongo, and, to a lesser extent Ovimbundu, in multiple cities, most notably Luanda, on January 22 in the Bloody Friday massacre. UNITA and government representatives met five days later in Ethiopia, but negotiations failed to restore the peace. The United Nations Security Council sanctioned UNITA through Resolution 864 on September 15, 1993, prohibiting the sale of weapons or fuel to UNITA. Perhaps the clearest shift in U.S. foreign policy emerged when President Clinton issued Executive Order 12865 on September 23, labeling UNITA a \\"continuing threat to the foreign policy objectives of the U.S.\\". By August 1993, UNITA had gained control over 70% of Angola, but the government's military successes in 1994 forced UNITA to sue for peace. By November 1994, the government had taken control of 60% of the country. Savimbi called the situation UNITA's \\"deepest crisis\\" since its creation.Rothchild (1997). Pages 137-138. Lusaka Protocol Savimbi, unwilling to personally sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the Lusaka Protocol in Lusaka, Zambia on October 31, 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire as part of the protocol on November 20. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would ceasefire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan National police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on November 15, 1994, to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said they would be willing to meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement which granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the protocol's collapse. Arms monitoring In January 1995, United States President Bill Clinton sent Paul Hare, his envoy to Angola, to support the Lusaka Protocol and impress the importance of the ceasefire onto the Angolan government and UNITA, both in need of outside assistance. The United Nations agreed to send a peacekeeping force on February 8. Savimbi met with South African President Nelson Mandela in May. Shortly after, on June 18, the MPLA offered Savimbi the position of Vice President under dos Santos with another Vice President chosen from the MPLA. Savimbi told Mandela he felt ready to \\"serve in any capacity which will aid my nation,\\" but he did not accept the proposal until August 12. The United States Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency's Angola operations and analysis expanded in an effort to halt weapons shipments, a violation of the protocol, with limited success. The Angolan government bought six Mil Mi-17 from Ukraine in 1995.Vines (1999). Pages 103-104. The government bought L-39 attack aircraft from the Czech Republic in 1998 along with ammunition and uniforms from Zimbabwe Defence Industries and ammunition and weapons from Ukraine in 1998 and 1999. U.S. monitoring significantly dropped off in 1997 as events in Zaire, the Congo and then Liberia occupied more of the U.S. government's attention. UNITA purchased more than 20 FROG-7 scuds and three FOX 7 missiles from the North Korean government in 1999.Vines (1999). Page 106. The UN extended its mandate on February 8, 1996. In March, Savimbi and dos Santos formally agreed to form a coalition government. The government deported 2,000 West African and Lebanese Angolans in Operation Cancer Two, in August 1996, on the grounds that dangerous minorities were responsible for the rising crime rate. In 1996 the Angolan government bought military equipment from India, two Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters and three Sukhoi Su-17 from Kazakhstan in December, and helicopters from Slovakia in March. The international community helped install a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation in April 1997, but UNITA did not allow the regional MPLA government to take up residence in 60 cities. The UN Security Council voted on August 28, 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA through Resolution 1127, prohibiting UNITA leaders from traveling abroad, closing UNITA's embassies abroad, and making UNITA-controlled areas a no-fly zone. The Security Council expanded the sanctions through Resolution 1173 on June 12, 1998, requiring government certification for the purchase of Angolan diamonds and freezing UNITA's bank accounts. The UN spent $1.6 billion from 1994 to 1998 in maintaining a peacekeeping force. The Angolan military attacked UNITA forces in the Central Highlands on December 4, 1998, the day before the MPLA's fourth Congress. Dos Santos told the delegates the next day that he believed war to be the only way to ultimately achieve peace, rejected the Lusaka Protocol, and asked MONUA to leave. In February 1999, the Security Council withdrew the last MONUA personnel. In late 1998, several UNITA commanders, dissatisfied with Savimbi's leadership, formed UNITA Renovada, a breakaway militant group. Thousands more deserted UNITA in 1999 and 2000. The Angolan military launched Operation Restore, a massive offensive, in September 1999, recapturing N'harea, Mungo and Andulo and Bailundo, the site of Savimbi's headquarters just one year before. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1268 on October 15, instructing United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to update the Security Council to the situation in Angola every three months. Dos Santos offered an amnesty to UNITA militants on November 11. By December, Chief of Staff General Jo√£o de Matos said the Angolan Armed Forces had destroyed 80% of UNITA's militant wing and captured 15,000 tons of military equipment.Martin (2004). Page 141. Following the dissolution of the coalition government, Savimbi retreated to his historical base in Moxico and prepared for battle. Diamonds UNITA's success in mining diamonds and selling them abroad at an inflated price allowed the war to continue even as the movement's support in the Western world and among the local populace withered away. De Beers and Endiama, a state-owned diamond-mining monopoly, signed a contract allowing De Beers to handle Angola's diamond exportation in 1990. According to the United Nation's Fowler Report, Joe De Deker, a former stockholder in De Beers, worked with the government of Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, allegedly flew from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth US$6 million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's buying office in Antwerp, Belgium. De Beers openly acknowledges spending $500 million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72 billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions. Executive Outcomes (EO), a private military company which had fought on behalf of UNITA prior to the 1992 elections, switched sides after the election. EO played a major role in turning the tide for the MPLA with one U.S. defense expert calling the EO the \\"best fifty or sixty million dollars the Angolan government ever spent\\". Heritage Oil and Gas, and allegedly De Beers, hired EO to protect their operations in Angola. Executive Outcomes trained 4,000 to 5,000 troops and 30 pilots in combat in camps in Lunda Sul, Cabo Ledo, and Dondo. Cabinda separatism Cabindan rebels kidnapped and ransomed off foreign oil workers throughout the 1990s to in turn finance further attacks against the national government. FLEC militants stopped buses, forcing Chevron Oil workers out, and setting fire to the buses on March 27 and April 23, 1992. A large scale battle took place between FLEC and police in Malongo on May 14 in which 25 mortar rounds accidentally hit a nearby Chevron compound. The government, fearing the loss of their prime source of revenue, began to negotiate with representatives from Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Renewal (FLEC-R), Armed Forces of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC), and the Democratic Front of Cabinda (FDC) in 1995. Patronage and bribery failed to assuage the anger of FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended. In February 1997, FLEC-FAC kidnapped two Inwangsa SDN-timber company employees, killing one and releasing the other after receiving a US$400,000 ransom. FLEC-FLAC kidnapped 11 people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a US$500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an Angolan, on March, 1999. While militants released the Angolan, the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5 million for the hostages. When Ant√≥nio Bento Bembe, the President of FLEC-R, showed up, the Angolan army arrested him and his bodyguards. The Angolan army later forcibly freed the other hostages on July 7.

It is part of group of religious buildings that include the Royal Church, and originally built by the Visigoths in the 7th century, in the form of a Greek cross. Since 1944, it has been classified as a National Monument (). History The Church of S√£o Francisco and the lateral Chapel of S√£o Frutuoso, with dependencies associated with the Monastery of S√£o Salvador, as seen from the square The alternating exterior angular and rounded frieses on the southwest corner of the Chapel The triple horseshoe-shaped arch division between the arms of the Chapel Based on historical accounts, and oral tradition, the site of the chapel was (around 560 A.D.) the location of a small Roman villa and, likely, a temple dedicated to the god Asclepius. In 656, Fructuosus of Braga, then Bishop of Bracara, founded on this site the Monastery of S√£o Salvador, ordering the construction of the chapel, as his tomb. In the biography of his life, S√£o Valerius confirms as much, mentioning that the saint who founded the convent was buried there (between 665 and 666). In the 9th-10th century, the chapel was reconstructed and redecorated. From a document dated in 883, the chapel was reconsecrated to S√£o Salvador, also affirming the original construction to between 656 and 665. Around the 12th century, following the Reconquista from the Arabs, with the revival of the Christian community and affinity for Saint Frutuoso of Braga, a cult to the saint was begun. In 1102, the Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, D. Diogo Gelmires, transferred the mortal remains of Frutuoso to Compostela. In 1523, Archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa founded the Franciscan convent of the Order of the Capuchos da Piedade, alongside the chapel of S√£o Frutuoso, likely destroying the older Monastery of S√£o Salvador. From notes by friar Manuel de Monforte (in 1696), in his Cr√≥nica da Prov√≠ncia da Piedade (Chronicle of the Province of Piedade), the chapel \\"is in [the shape of a cross] with all sides equal; whose points form four chapels, whose walls close in a half-circle. One of the chapels, which one can call the foot of the cross, serves as the entrance where the door is; another which rightly corresponds to this one, as the head of the cross, serves as the principal chapel, or where the altar is; in the other two, which are the arms, are the two collateral altars; having both about 17 palms, and half a square, in this so small space this church has 24 columns: four at the main entrance to the door, six in each collateral chapel, and eight in the main of all...\\". In 1728, by order of Archbishop D. Rodrigo de Moura Teles, the beginnings of a reconstruction and remodelling of the Convent of S√£o Francisco's Church is undertaken, with the chapel of S√£o Frutuoso integrated into the Church. From this point forward, the Chapel is accessible from the main Church, owing to significant alterations; this changes include, the destruction of the main fa√ßade, the modification of the eastern and western arms of the Latin cross-design; and alterations to the internal columns, including changes to the baldachins. It was architect Ernest Korrodi who first promoted the recuperation of the original plan for the chapel (in 1897), publishing a small note entitled \\"Um Monumento Latino- Bizantino em Portugal\\" (A Latin-Byzantine Monument in Portugal). More than a century would pass, before Jo√£o de Moura Coutinho e Sousa Lobo would begin to restore the original plan in 1931. The architect followed the original hypothesis that the chapel was ordered constructed by Fructuosus of Braga as his 6th century tomb, following a model/design aesthetic based on the mausoleum Galla Placidia in Ravenna. This redesign was followed by the DGEMN reconstruction of cupola and roof in 1939, again in 1941, repairs in 1958, that included the reconstruction of the walls, door, plastering of the cupola and several projects around the churchyard. In 1961, the pavement, main arch, reconstruction of the staircase and consolidation of the vaulted ceiling were undertaken, followed by conservation projects in 1966. Similar repairs were undertaken in 1970 (repair and cleaning of the roof), in 1973 (checking of the rood, repairs, painting conservancy and arrangement of the area around the chapel), in 1984 (arrangement of the roof and paintings) and in 1987 (new projects evolving conservancy). Architecture The chapel is situated on the eastern lateral fa√ßade of the church of the Convent of S√£o Francisco, below the level of the latter. While access to the interior of the chapel is made from the church, its original exterior access was made from through a small enclosed courtyard and gates. East of the chapel are the ruins of the old convent and its dependencies, in addition to the Fountain of Santo Ant√≥nio () which is further below these buildings. To the southeast, the old granite pavement leads to the Quinta do Lago (Estate of the Lake) and the Escola Prim√°ria de Real (Primary School of Real) to the west. The chapel of S√£o Frutuoso continues to be an enigma, but it is a uniquely rare example of Visigothic structures in Portugal, based on a Greek-cross, which may have followed the design of a Byzantine mausoleum comparable to the Galla Placidia, in Ravenna. The church is laid out in a Greek cross design, with a rectangular exterior, and semi-circular interior arms (to the north, south and east). From the exterior, the main volume of the chapel is surmounted by a tower-like cupola and cross, with the roof covered in rounded tiles. The limestone walls are surmounted by edged cornices, preceded by frieses, also in limestone, in the shape of rope, semi-circles, six-pointed rosettas and fleur-de-lis. The collateral fa√ßades are decorated with blind arcades, alternating between angular and double rounded-frieses, which are repeated in the tower cupola, and intersected by small round windows. The principal fa√ßade, which was the main entrance at one time, is highlighted by a grand arch portico, preceded by staircase. In northern part of the eastern arm of the chapel is an arcosolium, where the mortel remains of Saint Fructuosus was originally entombed, and exposed to the exterior. =Interior= The inner masonry walls are defined by round arches, supported by large pillars, above which are large decorated friezes, with triple horseshoe-shaped arches, and a larger central arch. The chapel's arms are crossed in the middle of the wall by a narrow ribbon of limestone. While the interior arms are supported by wooden joists, the interior part of the hemispherical dome is plastered and painted white. The granite floor slabs are inscribed with coat of arms, and preceded from the main church by a staircase to the lower chapel.

The other main piece of equipment is the rugby ball. Some modest padding is allowed on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet World Rugby standards. Players may wear a mouthguard to guard against concussion and chipping of the teeth. Famous Rugby Jerseys, early 1920s boys' magazine illustration of the playing stripes of the top clubs and countries Ball The ball used in rugby union is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured of synthetic waterproof materials, and in a variety of colors and patterns. Boots Traditionally, rugby boots were of a high cut above the ankle. Over the years, such boots have become less common, although many players still wear mid-cut boots, just below the ankle. Additional ankle support was seen as appropriate given the nature of the game, particularly the stresses of forward play and the amount of physical contact involved. Higher cut boots also provided some protection against knocks. Modern boots are now more similar to football boots, with a low cut offering less ankle support but maximum flexibility with minimum weight. It is essential for safety considerations, particularly in the scrum, that forwards wear boots with removable studs. The studs may be metal (aluminum) or plastic and must conform to Regulation 12 of World Rugby.\\"REGULATION 12. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PLAYERS‚Äô DRESS\\", IRB This regulation dictates the permissible dimensions of the studs and also defines a standard for the hardness of the material. Backs would be advised, on most ground types, to wear boots with some form of a stud, to ensure adequate grip when changing direction. Referees are required to check all players' studs before a game and ensure that the studs conform to the laws and have no sharp edges. Any studs that are worn down so that the steel fixing is showing must be changed before the player is allowed to join in the game. The intent of the standard and these pre-match checks is to eliminate the potential for a stud to cause a cut if it comes into contact with a player's skin. Generally, there are two types of stud pattern worn: the 8 stud or the 6 stud. The 8 stud is most often worn by the tight forwards (props, hooker and second row) to provide them with extra grip for scrummaging and mauling. The 6 stud is worn by backs as it allows for more agility and quicker movement around the field. Plastic \\"blade\\" studs, common in football, are an increasingly frequent choice among backs. Goalposts Rugby union uses H-shaped goalposts at each end of the playing field. The posts are 5.6 metres (18 ft) apart, and the crossbar is 3 metres (9.8 ft) from the ground. Training equipment Some specialist items of equipment are used for rugby training, including: =Tackle bags= These are used during training and warmup in rugby union. Tackle bags are padded equipment which allows players to tackle without another player being involved. Tackle bags come in two forms: the rucking shield and the tackle bag. The rucking shield is held in the hand of a coach or fellow player and allows the tackler to drive against the person holding the shield safely. The tackle bag stands on the ground held loosely by another person, and allows the tackler to practice a full tackle. =Scrum machine= A scrum machine, or scrummaging machine, is a padded, weighty device against which a pack of rugby football forwards can practice scrummaging and rucking to improve the strength and skills of their players.

The history of the Jews in Kuwait is connected to the history of the Jews in Iraq.  History  The noted British businessman Naim Dangoor is an Iraqi Jewish exile in his 90s whose grandfather was the chief rabbi in Baghdad. He came to Britain in the 1930s to study engineering at Queen Mary College in London and returned to Iraq to join the army and then set up his business empire. He spent the 1950s running the Coca-Cola franchise in Iraq with a beloved Muslim business partner. He states that: :In 1776 Sadeq Khan Zand captured Basra, many of the inhabitants left the country and among them were Jews who went to Kuwait. Around 1860, their number increased and their trade flourished. The Jews had a market called \\"The Jews' market \\", which was next to the market Mosque. It was known that the Jews used to make alcohol and sell it to the public. The Jews were known to be very careful with trading. They were mostly wholesalers and worked with India - Baghdad and Aleppo. They even exported to Europe and China. There were about 80 Jewish families in Kuwait living in one district where the Bank of Trade is now. The Jews used to wear long gown (Zboun) and Fez which made them look different from the others. Some used to wear European suits but they covered their head with Fez. They had their own Synagogue with their Sefer Torah. In the Synagogue, they had separate place for the women. Saturday is a sacred day. Jews didn't work that day. They also had their own Cemetery which shows that they lived there for a long time. Before 1914 there were about 200 Jews. Most of them went back to Baghdad and few went to India. There were two wealthy Jews in Kuwait but the rest were middle class, being Jewellers or material traders. Among the wealthy Jews were Saleh Mahlab who owned the first ice factory in 1912, which he later sold to the Arms Trader and Merchant Mohammed- Ali bin Haidar Marafi. Gurgi Sasson and Menashi Eliahou who were traders and financiers. When Sheikh Salem al Mubarak came to power in February 1917 (he was the 9th ruler). He wanted to stop the Jews from dealing with alcoholic spirits. He called them and warned them. There is no evidence that they were kicked out of Kuwait. The truth is that they went back to Iraq when King Faisal the first came to rule Iraq. The King had Jewish acquaintances like Wiseman and Sasson Heskel who became the Minister of Finance in Iraq. During the twenties, all the Jews left Kuwait.. Professor Faisal Abdulla Alkanderi of Kuwait corroborates the above in his essay in Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations, 2006, as summarized: :Kuwait in the last decades of the nineteenth century had become a dynamic place for its time. There was a building boom in both houses and ships, and business opportunities abounded. The country was peaceful and stable. The combination of services available and economic prospects drew people from surrounding countries searching for a better life. This article deals with the little-known Jewish community that began to come to Kuwait during that time. It also discusses the possible reasons why they left. These Jews belonged to the 'Babylonian' Jews who had lived in Mesopotamia for millennia. Their language was Arabic, and they had traded between Baghdad and India for centuries. The majority were involved in textiles, and they had their own market where people of all origins came to buy the cloth they imported. They usually educated their children in their synagogue. It was a community in flux, with constant comings and goings, rather than a stable group who arrived together and left together, and it was made up of diverse individuals.

It has existed since the third century. From 1653 to 1954, the historic diocese was the diocese of Pistoia and Prato. The Diocese of Prato has been separate from 1954.On 7 July 1954, a Bishop of Prato, Pietro Fiordelli, Secret Chamberlain of His Holiness, was appointed: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 46 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1954), p. 420. The diocese is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Florence. History The name of Pistoia appears for the first time in history in connexion with the conspiracy of Catiline (62 BC),Patricia J. Osmond, \\"Catiline in Fiesole and Florence: The After-Life of a Roman Conspirator,\\" International Journal of the Classical Tradition 7, no. 1 (2000): 3-38. but it was only after the sixth century that it became important; it was governed, first, by its bishops, later by stewards of the Marquis of Tuscany. It was the first to establish its independence, after the death of Countess Matilda, and its municipal statutes were the most ancient of their kind in Italy. Pistoia claims to have received the Gospel from Romulus of Fiesole, the first Bishop of Fiesole. There is no proof of this claim. Neither is there evidence of a 3rd century foundation of the diocese. The first documentary evidence of a Bishop of Pistoia, however, is c.492, though the name of this prelate is unknown. In 998, the cathedral of Pistoia was dedicated in honor of Ss. Zeno, Rufinus and Felix, none of whom was a bishop of Pistoia.Lanzoni, p. 584. As early as 1409, Florence had asked for the creation of a diocese at Prato, on account of the dissensions of the collegiate church of Prato with the Bishops of Pistoia; and in 1460, it had been made a prelatura nullius, and often given to some cardinal, in commendam. On 22 September 1653, Prato was made a diocese by Pope Innocent X through the bull Redemptoris Nostri, and united aeque principaliter, with Pistoia.Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia XVII, pp. 148-153. In the first half of the 20th century, both the populations and the commercial activities of Pistoia and of Prato had greatly increased. Explicitly recognizing these facts, on 25 January 1954, by virtue of the bull Clerus Populusque, Pope Pius XII separated the diocese of Prato from the diocese of Pistoia, which had up to then been united through having one and the same bishop, though maintaining separate diocesan structures.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 46 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1954), pp. 390-392: \\"Pratensem et Pistoriensem dioeceses in vicem separamus, quae ad hunc diem aeque principaliter ac perpetuo unitae exstabant; ita ut in posterum tempus unaquaeque earum dignitatem dioecesis servet, ac proprium Episcopum habeat.\\" Prato was to have its own bishop, and any adjustments which had to be made between the two dioceses were to be adjudicated by the Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Florence. =Chapter and cathedral= The cathedral, which was dedicated to S. Zeno, was originally administered by a Chapter, composed of twenty-two Canons, led by four ancient dignities; to these four were later added six more. The dignities included: the Archdeacon, the Dean, the Primicerius, the Treasurer, the Prior, the Sacristan, the Rector, and the Custos. At Pistoia the right of patronage over individual dignities was recognized: the Pandolfini of Florence over the Archdeaconate; the Panciatici over the Deanship; the Conversini over the Primicerius; the Bracciolini over the Treasurership; the Panciatici over the Priorate; the Alfarali over the Sacristan; the Gualfreducci over the Rectorate; and the Marchettae over the Custos.Ughelli, Italia sacra III, p. 284. In 1667, Bishop Francesco Rinuccini (1656‚Äì1678) and the cathedral Chapter clashed over the right to appoint to vacant canonries, which were supposed to be done jointly by the bishop and Chapter. The matter was settled in an agreement of 27 September 1667, in which it was agreed that the bishop and the Chapter would make appointments alternately.Rosati, p. 202. In 1776 the Chapter of the cathedral of Pistoia was composed of eleven dignities and twenty-seven Canons. The Chapter of Prato was composed of five dignities (originally six: the Provost, the Primicerius, the Archpriest, the Archdeacon, the Dean, and the Treasurer) and twenty-six Canons.Cappelletti, XVII, pp. 150-151. Ritzler- Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VI, p. 340, note 1. =Diocesan synods= A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. Bishop Thomas held a synod in 1322. Bishop Hermannus Anastasi (1307‚Äì1321) presided over a diocesan synod on 8 December 1308. He held another synod in 1313.J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XXV (Venice: A. Zatta 1782), pp. 169-174 (in Latin). Rosati, pp. 106-107. Bishop Baronto Ricciardi (1322‚Äì1348) held a diocesan synod on 7 September 1322, at which the bishop and synod ratified the decrees of the synods of Bishop Thomas and Bishop Ermanno Anastasi.Rosati, p. 111. Bishop Francesco Rinuccini (1656‚Äì1678) held a diocesan synod in Prato in 1662. He held synods in Pistoia in 1662 and 1669.Rosati, p. 202. Bishop Gherardo Gherardi (1679‚Äì1690) held three diocesan synods in Pistoia, the third of which was celebrated on 21 May 1685.Tertia Synodus dioecesana Pistoriensis celebrata duodecimo kalendas Iunii ab illustriss. ac reverendiss d.d. Gherardo Gherardio episcopo Pistoriensi et Pratensi, (Pistoia: Fortunati 1685). Bishop Leone Strozzi, O.S.B. (1690‚Äì1700) held a diocesan synod in Pistoia in the cathedral on 19 September 1694. Bishop Michele Cortigiani (1703‚Äì1713) held a diocesan synod in the cathedral of Pistoia on 28 April 1707.Constitutiones synodi dioecesanae pistoriensis habitae in cath. Eccl. IV Kal. Maii MDCCVII Michaele Carolo Vicedomino Cortigianio episcopo pistoriensi et pratensi (Pistoia: Gatti 1707). Bishop Colombino Bassi, O.S.B. (1715‚Äì1732) held a diocesan synod on 5 June 1721. In September 1786, Bishop Scipione de' Ricci (1780‚Äì1791) held a diocesan synod, and published the constitutions and decrees. Eighty-five of the propositions in the decrees were condemned by Pope Pius VI in the bull Auctorem fidei of August 28, 1794, four of which were specifically labeled as heretical.

He began his service by vigorously claiming his rights, both spiritual and temporal, in his diocese, and did not hesitate to level excommunications to enforce his will. Cardinal Egidio Albornoz, the papal Legate in Italy, was compelled to intervene and cancel Remigio's excommunications. In 1369, his own Canons were so exasperated with him that they wrote to Pope Urban V, the college of cardinals, and the auditors of the rota, detailing his actions which jeopardized souls and led to loss of episcopal income. He was prevailed on to resign, and died shortly thereafter. Rosati, p. 116, points out the errors that report his resignation in 1367 (Ughelli), though he wrongly calls Remigio a Dominican, and names the pope to whom the complaint of the Canons was directed as Urban VI.

Biography Sibanda was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. He was raised in the Seventh-day Adventist Church by his father, who was a pastor in the church. Sibanda earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a bachelor of science degree and trained to be a pastor in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He was a pastor for three years, a teacher for nine years, and a headmaster of a school for fifteen years. He married his wife Priscilla in 1958 and eventually fathered three children. In April 1976, during the Rhodesian Bush War, Sibanda's house was burned by Zimbabwe African National Union guerrillas who accused him of being an informant for the mostly white Rhodesian government. Sibanda and his wife walked from Salisbury to Bulawayo to try to escape hostilities. In December 1979, Sibanda met Mormon missionaries while working in Bulawayo. After reading from the Book of Mormon, Sibanda resolved to be baptized into the LDS Church, and he was baptized within two weeks of first meeting the missionaries. A few weeks later, in early 1980, Sibanda's wife was baptized into the church. Sibanda was the first black person to become a member of the LDS Church in Rhodesia. The Sibandas experienced some difficulties in being accepted by the white members of the LDS Church in Bulawayo, particularly when they were asked to serve in leadership callings in the church. Sibanda was asked by the president of the South Africa Johannesburg Mission of the church to translate some of the LDS Church hymns from English into the Shona language. References *E.

The car has two seats, with the passenger sitting behind the driver. It is built using carbon fibre and costs between 48,000 and 58,000 euro including taxes in Germany The manufacturer has limited production of the vehicle to 100 cars. The car consumed 2.8l of diesel per 100 kilometers (82miles per US gallon) during an official T√úV test. Top speed for the car is 160 km/h (100mp/hr). The drivers seat looks similar to a cockpit, which may be the reason for car's name. The engine is the diesel engine from a Smart (car). Due to its length of over 4 metres, it does not qualify as a Kei car in Japan. The company's web site mentions the similarity of the seating arrangement to that of the Messerschmitt Kabinenroller and FMR Tg500. Like the Fritz Fend‚Äìdesigned cars, it is a highway microcar (or perhaps one should call the Jetcar a minicar) and therefore needs to have very low air drag.

The North Saskatchewan River valley west of William Hawrelak Park in Edmonton Looking south over the North Saskatchewan River valley, with a view of Victoria Golf Course and the University of Alberta Wooden stairs into the river valley Downtown and Garneau neighbourhoods Terwillegar Park The North Saskatchewan River valley parks system (Also known as River Valley Parks; and Ribbon of Green) is a continuous collection of urban parks in the North Saskatchewan River valley of Edmonton, Alberta. The parks range from waterside to cliff side to cliff top locations bordering the North Saskatchewan River. Edmonton's river valley comprises over 20 major parks and attractions and forms the largest expanse of urban parkland in Canada. The public river valley parks provide a unique urban escape area with park styles ranging from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities. At in size and in length, the river valley parks system includes 22 ravines, which have a combined total length of . It also includes 11 lakes. Most of the city has bicycle and walking trail connections. These trails are also part of the Waskahegan walking trail. Several golf courses, both public and private, are also located in the river valley. The long summer daylight hours of this northern city provide for extended play well into the evening. Golf courses and the park system become a winter recreation area during this season. Cross- country skiing and skating are popular during the long winter. Four downhill ski slopes are located in the river valley as well, two within the city and two immediately outside. The City of Edmonton has named five parks in its river valley parks system in honour of each of \\"The Famous Five\\".  Parks and facilities  The largest share of the protected areas in the river valley is occupied by various municipal parks. Located on both sides of the North Saskatchewan River, moving from west to east along the river, are: * Terwillegar Park - south bank * Oleskiw River Valley Park - north bank * Whitemud Park (also known as Whitemud Creek)- south bank * Sir Wilfrid Laurier Park - north bank * Buena Vista Park - north bank * William Hawrelak Park - south bank * McKinnon Ravine Park - north bank * Government House Park - north bank * Emily Murphy Park (named for one of Alberta's/Canada's \\"Famous Five\\") - south bank * Victoria Park - north bank * Kinsmen Park - south bank * Queen Elizabeth Park - south bank * Nellie McClung Park (\\"Famous Five\\") - south bank * Irene Parlby Park (\\"Famous Five\\") - north bank * Rossdale Park - north bank * Louise McKinney Park (\\"Famous Five\\") - north bank * Henrietta Muir Edwards Park / Rafters Landing (\\"Famous Five\\") - south bank * Mill Creek Ravine Park - south bank * Gallagher Park - south bank * Riverdale Park - north bank * Allan Stein Park - north bank * Forest Heights Park - south bank * Dawson Park - north bank * Kinnaird Park and Ravine - north bank * Capilano Park - south bank * Gold Bar Park - south bank * Floden Park - north bank * Tiger Goldstick Park - south bank * Rundle Park - north bank * Hermitage Park - north bank The City also operates several public facilities in the river valley: *Fort Edmonton Park *Edmonton Valley Zoo *Muttart Conservatory *John Janzen Nature Centre *Riverside Golf Course *Victoria Golf Course (the oldest municipal course in Canada) *Rundle Park Golf Course The provincial government owns the following sites in the river valley: *Strathcona Science Provincial Park *Alberta Legislature Building and grounds *Government House Hiking, cycling, and multi-use trails run throughout these parks and connect to other trails through the city and outside as well forming an integrated system. The river valley parks in particular are part of the Waskahegan and Trans Canada trail systems.  Wildlife  Trail into the river valley, near downtown Edmonton's river valley park system is home to porcupines, deer, coyotes, skunks, muskrats, hares, and beavers. Edmonton's streets and parklands are also home to one of the largest remaining concentrations of healthy American Elm trees in the world, unaffected by Dutch Elm disease, which has wiped out vast numbers of such trees in eastern North America. Jack Pine, Lodgepole Pine, White Spruce, White Birch, Aspen, Green Ash, Basswood, various poplars and willows, and Manitoba Maple are also abundant; Bur Oak is increasingly popular. Introduced tree species include Blue Spruce, Norway Maple, Red Oak, Sugar Maple, Common Horse-chestnut, McIntosh Apple, and Evans Cherry. Three walnut species -- Butternut, Manchurian Walnut and Black Walnut‚Äîhave survived in Edmonton.  Politics and planning  The idea of uniting the parks of the river valley into one parks system dates back to at least the 1970s. In 1974, Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed announced the creation of the Capital City Recreation Park, consisting of a stretch of parks from the Legislature grounds east to the Beverly Bridge at an estimated cost of $30‚Äì35 million.Article. canada.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-13. The River Valley Alliance is a grouping of municipal governments in the Edmonton region that have committed to expanding the River Valley Parks System outside of Edmonton's city limits. The plan calls for a zone to be called the Capital Region Valley Park stretched over 88 kilometres running from Devon to Fort Saskatchewan. In January 2008, the City of Edmonton paid a record C$7 million to buy a parcel of land to fill in a gap in the otherwise continuous chain of parks. The city further promised to spend C$20 million of pedestrian bridges and trails, but said that the as yet unnamed park would be left in an undeveloped state.

He was a member of the German Reichstag and a wealthy lay officer of the Roman Catholic Church. During 1866, Cahensly noted that German immigrants to America were vulnerable due to poverty or cultural isolation, and suggested to the Catholic Congress meeting at Trier that a society should be established for the systematic protection of German emigrants at both the place of departure and the port of landing. He claimed that many were ending their relationship with Roman Catholicism, part of the problem being the domination of Roman Catholicism in America by English-speaking Irish clerics who were typically unsympathetic with the idea of preserving German culture among German immigrants, some of whom began attending German-speaking Lutheran congregations. As a result of his urging, the Mainz Katholikentag of 1871 initiated the St. Raphaelsverein zum Schutz deutscher katholischer Auswanderer (de), an aid organization for German Catholic emigrants. The activities of the St. Raphaelsverein resulted in increased controversy about \\"Americanism\\" of the Catholic Church in the United States. Cahensly also urged the reorganization of the church in the USA, particularly the formation of ethnicity-based parishes and the appointment of German bishops; such ideas were opposed by many of the Irish-American Catholic clergy. When, during the 1920s, the Vatican administration urged the creation of an African-American seminary, the American hierarchy reacted strongly to what one bishop termed \\"African Cahenslyism\\" .

Lansdowne is located 27 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown and is part of the South-western Sydney region. History Lansdowne took its name from the Lansdowne Bridge, which was named by Governor Richard Bourke to honour Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne (1780-1863), a Whig politician. The Lansdowne Bridge was built in 1834-35 from stone quarried on the banks of the Georges River. It replaced a hardwood bridge called Bowler's Bridge because it led to Bowler's Inn. The Lansdowne Bridge was one of the finest works by Scottish stonemason David Lennox (1788-1873), who arrived in Sydney in 1832 and was made Superintendent of Bridges with the task of replacing hardwood bridges that were frequently swept away in floods. In 1962 the World Scout Jamboree was held at Lansdowne and the site, now Mirambeena Regional Park, was reserved for a future recreation area. Money for the project was supplied by federal and state governments and by Bankstown council. Today the park is a people's playground, with a Lake Gillawarna, and ponds full of wildlife, native walks and a pedestrian/cycle way. The picnic area has barbecues and all kinds of play equipment for children.

It was previously served by Pakenham line commuter rail services, as part of the suburban rail system. It is located between Dandenong and Hallam stations, in the suburb of Dandenong South. History General Motors station was originally opened as a 'special platform' on 1 October 1956 to service the General Motors Holden car factory to the north. An alternate date for the opening is 18 November 1956. Work on the adjacent General Motors Holden factory commenced with the purchase of of land in 1951, construction commencing in 1955, and completed in 1956.Holden: Milestones Construction of the station was paid for by General Motors. The station opened at the site of a number of private railway sidings, two years after electrification of the line through it was commissioned, and at a time when suburban services to Pakenham did not exist. As a result, only a single platform was provided on the north side on the Down (Pakenham bound) track, and services operated as extensions of Dandenong trains at factory opening and close times. This was altered on 20 January 1975, when suburban services were extended from Dandenong to Pakenham. The Up (Melbourne bound) platform and footbridge to the north was provided in late 1974, and Pakenham trains were timetabled to stop at the station at factory opening and close times. The station was provided with a crossover between the double track lines, and a signal box to control it.Victorian Railways signal diagram: Dandenong to Hallam & Lyndhurst 1979 A number of railway sidings also branched from the station in a westerly direction along the main line. In 1979, they served the International Harvester, Heinz, and General Motors Holden factories. The station could not be accessed from public roads, with the only way in and out via a gate into the General Motors Holden factory. In 1991, the General Motors factory closed down, leaving the station essentially isolated. A notice was issued by the Public Transport Corporation stating that the station was to close from 5 November 1991, however it remained open for a further eleven years, despite the closure and demolition of the factory, and the fact that the footbridge now led to a fenced-off, empty paddock where the factory had once stood. It was estimated to be the least patronised station in the entire city network, with only an average of 11 passengers using it a day. By the time it closed, only eight trains stopped at the station each day, four each way. Visitors from the Signalling Record Society had to obtain permission from General Motors and be accompanied by a security guard while at the station. The Rail Appreciation Association Victoria was another group who organised a trip to the station, travelling via ordinary train services.Rail Appreciation Association Victoria: Farewell General Motors Tour Another group of railfans visited the station the last day of operation, again using regular trains. The only means of accessing the station was to jump off the platform and cross over the tracks on foot, as no new access paths were built after the closure of the factory. This meant that it was one of only two stations on the Melbourne network to be inaccessible to wheelchairs (the other one being Heyington). The Public Transport Users Association argued that it should be upgraded due to industrial growth in the area, but M>Train, which operated the Pakenham line at the time, requested permission to close the station in 2002 due to \\"safety concerns and a lack of legal access\\". The last train stopped at the station at 4:42pm on 26 July 2002, and the station officially closed on 28 July. Current status Posters about the closure referred to a \\"temporary suspension\\". While M>Train did not rule out the possibility of re-opening the station at a future time, the M>Train network is now operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, and any plans the company may have for the station are unknown as of 2018. If the station is to be reopened, both platforms and the footbridge above the station will require repairs and resurfacing, while the building and other fixtures will have to be demolished and new facilities will need to be built. In 2004, General Motors was still listed in the Pakenham line pocket timetable, and in 2005 the http://metlinkmelbourne.com.au trip planner was still displaying services to the station, despite the closure.Railpage Australia: observations by user Torykins However, the station is no longer displayed on any public transport maps. In late 2004, all signage was removed, \\"KEEP OUT\\" signage was installed, and access to the footbridge between platforms was fenced off.

Appointed jointly by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Gordon Brown) and the Deputy Prime Minister (John Prescott) in the summer of 2004, Sir Michael Lyons produced several reports over the next 3 years, culminating in a final report on the future of local government published alongside the Chancellor's Budget in March 2007. Origins of the Inquiry While local government activities in England are financed from a variety of sources, including central government grant, the key local taxes since 1992 have been the uniform business rate (set centrally but collected locally) and council tax. Both are property taxes, based on the rental or resale value of a property at a given point in time. The Local Government Act 2003Local Government Act 2003 introduced a commitment to revalue all domestic properties in England and Wales, for the purposes of calculating council tax bills, by 2007. This would have been the first revaluation to take place since council tax was introduced in 1993. Following that Act, the Government commissioned a Balance of Funding review,Balance of Funding Review 2004 , website which reported with recommendations in July 2004.Balance of Funding Review 2004 Final Report , (pdf document) At the same time, a House of Commons Select Committee conducted an inquiry into local government revenue, again reporting their conclusions in July 2004.Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions - Ninth Report, Local Government Revenue. Initial Inquiry In July 2004 the Government appointed Sir Michael Lyons to undertake a comprehensive Inquiry into local government funding, focussing in particular on: * the most pressing issues affecting local government funding * how council tax should be reformed * other possible sources of local funding, such as local income tax, reformed non-domestic rates and other local taxes and charges * the implications for the financing of possible elected regional assemblies Work on the Inquiry began in ernest in October 2004, and encompassed the commissioning of research and a number of public consultation events. In November 2004, the voters in North East England rejected a proposal for an Elected Regional Assembly, following which the Government abandoned its plans to proceed with the introduction elected assemblies across England. First extension of the Inquiry's remit In September 2005, the Government announced its decision to delay the revaluation of domestic properties by 2007, citing the ongoing Lyons Inquiry as a key reason for the delay.Council Tax (New Valuation Lists For England) Bill, explanatory notes to the bill. At the same time, the Government agreed an extension to his Inquiry with Sir Michael, \\"to cover questions relating to the functions of local government and its future role, as well as how it is funded.\\" The Inquiry published an interim report in December 2005,Lyons Inquiry Consultation Paper and Interim Report, December 2005 which detailed the work conducted on local government funding and invited views on the future form and function of local government. The report included detailed analyses of possible council tax reforms; conclusions on other potential local government revenue streams were not included in the document. Following the extension to his remit, Sir Michael launched a year-long, multi-stranded consultation exercise with a wide range of groups, as well as commissioning new research. In April 2006 the Government introduced the Dedicated Schools Grant, a ring-fenced grant to local authorities which could only be spent on schools. This marked a significant change in the structure of local government funding, as education was by far the largest service for which local authorities in England were responsible.teachernet website , dedicated schools grant Sir Michael Lyons published his second reportNational prosperity, local choice and civic engagement: a new partnership between central and local government for the 21st century, Lyons Inquiry second report, 2006 in May 2006. In this report, he concentrated on the form and function of local government in England. Key points included: * an analysis of future pressures on local government * the need to clarify the role between central and local government * the concept of 'place shaping', and the role of local government in promoting economic, social and environmental well-being of communities In October 2006 the Government published a White Paper on the future of Local Government.Strong and Prosperous Communities, Government White Paper, 2006 While the White Paper took on board some of the Inquiry's recommendations - for instance the concept of place-shaping - it was criticised in some quarters for being published before the Inquiry had finished its work on local government funding arrangements.BBC News Website, news report on the launch of the Government's local authority white paper Second extension of the Inquiry's remit Following the extension of his remit, Sir Michael had planned to publish his final report before the end of 2006. In December the Government announced that it had asked Sir Michael to further extend his Inquiry to take into account a set of other reports commissioned by the Chancellor.Lyons Inquiry Press Notice, 6 December 2006 Final report The Inquiry's final reportPlace-shaping: a shared ambition for the future of local government, Lyons Inquiry Final Report, 21 March 2007 was published on 21 March 2007, on the same day as the Chancellor's annual budget statement. In an accompanying Press Notice Sir Michael announced that his short term recommendations included: * greater flexibility for local authorities to place-shape with less control from the centre - by reducing specific and ring fenced grants, a new power to levy a supplementary business rate in consultation with business, and a new power to charge for domestic waste to help manage pressures on council tax, and an end to capping of council tax; * changes to improve fairness of council tax, recognising that council tax benefit is a rebate, automating the system to ensure 1.8billion pounds in unclaimed benefit helps the poorest households, and raising the savings limit for pensioners to 50,000 pounds; * improving transparency in the funding system by being clear about the contribution made by national taxation, and ensuring a more independent voice to inform Parliament and the public; and * improving incentives for local authorities to promote economic prosperity and growth, initially through reform of the Local Authority Business Growth Incentives Scheme. In the medium term, he advised that the Government should: * revalue council tax to update the tax base and improve fairness; * at the same time, reform council tax by adding new bands to reduce bills for those in the lowest value properties, paid for by increased bills for those in higher value properties paying more - there should be no increase in average council tax bills as a result of this; * consider assigning a fixed proportion of income tax to local government; * find ways to improve the incentives within the grant system; and * consider introducing the power to levy a tourist tax if local government makes a strong case based on local public support - this would be appropriate only in some areas. In the longer term, Sir Michael said that future governments could consider more radical reform options such as local income tax or re-localisation of the business rate, but these reforms may require greater public support and understanding than currently exists.

He was the son of Rukn al-Din Mahmud. Biography Qutb al- Din was appointed malik in December 1330 by the notables of Sistan following the death of his uncle, Nusrat al-Din Muhammad. A deeply religious man, he patronized the religious figures of Sistan and fed travelers and the poor. He also distributed the fortresses of the province to members of his family. During Qutb al-Din's reign the central Ilkhanid government in Soltaniyeh collapsed; Sistan's distance from the Ilkhanid center allowed it to mostly avoid the wars that plagued Persia during this time. Under Qutb al-Din Sistan did face one foreign invasion, by the Kartid malik Mu'izz al-Din Husayn, in 1333 or 1334 after he was invited by the Mihrabanid's opponents. Mu'izz al-Din decided to end the campaign after heeding the counsel of a Sufi adherent. In 1346 Qutb al-Din was killed by a plague, possibly the Black Plague. He was succeeded by his son Taj al-Din.

Scipione de' RicciScipione de Ricci, Scipione del Ricci, Scipio Ricci. (19 January 1741 ‚Äì 27 January 1810) was an Italian Catholic prelate, who was bishop of Pistoia from 1780 to 1791. He was sympathetic to Jansenist ideas in theology. Biography Scipione de' Ricci was born in Florence,The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought, ed. Mark Goldie and Robert Wokler, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 769-70 of an eminent family. Giving early promise of worth and eminence, he was made Bishop of Pistoia and Prato, the most populous of the Tuscan dioceses, 19 June, 1780. He planned and energetically pursued, with the encouragement of Pius VI, the work of much-needed reform.Peterson, John Bertram. \\"Synod of Pistoia.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 June 2017 With the support of Leopold I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, he attempted religious reforms, backed by the 1786 Synod of Pistoia.The Age of Absolutism and Unbelief: Febronianism and Josephism @ ELCore.NetNicholas Terpstra (2002), The Politics of Ritual Kinship: Confraternities, p. 272. There were models in Austrian Febronianism, and French Gallicanism. According to John Bertram Peterson, de‚Äô Ricci's zeal bordered on recklessness. He condemned devotion to the Sacred Heart, discouraged the use of relics and images, improvised liturgy, and founded a Jansenistic press. These moves however foundered, faced with eventual opposition from Pope Pius VI. Ricci had to leave Tuscany in 1790, as opposition grew, and resigned his see in 1791. In 1805 he submitted to Pope Pius VII. He died on 28 December 1810, and is buried at Rignana, near Greve in Chianti. Memoirs De' Ricci's own memoirs, Memorie di Scipione de' Ricci, vescovo di Prato e Pistoia, edited by Antonio Galli, were published at Florence in two volumes in 1865. Besides this, his letters to Antonio Marini were published by Cesare Guasti at Prato in 1857; these were promptly put on the Index. See also De Potter, Vie de Scipion de Ricci (2 vols., Brussels, 1825), based on a manuscript life and a manuscript account of the synod placed on the Index in 1823.

The model has never seen an official release in the country and was registered in May 2019 Japanese used vehicle exporting is a grey market international trade involving the export of used cars and other vehicles from Japan to other markets around the world since the 1980s. Despite the high cost of transport, the sale of used cars and other vehicles to other countries is still profitable due to the relatively low cost and good condition of the vehicles being purchased. Contributing factors to the feasibility of such export include Japan's strict motor-vehicle inspections and high depreciation which make such vehicles worth very little in Japan after six years, and strict environmental-protection regulations that make vehicle disposal very expensive in Japan. Japan has very stringent vehicle emission test standards. Nearly 1.4 million used vehicles were exported from Japan in 2006. The most popular destinations for used cars from Japan are Mozambique, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malaysia, Brunei, Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Congo, Ireland, Georgia, Dominican Republic, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Kenya, the United Kingdom, United States, Thailand, Myanmar, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. Additionally, Chile, Singapore, Lesotho and the United Arab Emirates are used as popular transit hubs. Overview =Supply of used cars= In Japan, used cars are mainly sold at auto auctions by car owners and dealers. At auto auctions, owners are hidden from bidders while the auctioneers provide independent car evaluations called inspection sheets. Exporters, acting as bidding agents for importers, use the auto auctions as their main supply. There are over 200 auto auction groups operating throughout Japan including JAA, JU Group, TAA, USS, and ZIP. Besides auto auctions, Japanese exports have access to vehicles from dealerships and private sellers. =Exporting methods= Vehicles which will be exported from Japan must be prepared before shipping. This includes de-registering the vehicle with the government, getting an export certificate, and cleaning the car to remove biosecurity risks. Car cleaning is especially necessary for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and New Zealand's Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI)Other Imports  MPI Biosecurity New Zealand agencies' clearances. Exporters can ship the car that is ready by ro-ro or container according to customer specification, ship schedules, and the capabilities of the destination port. =Market differences= The suitability of Japan's domestically sold cars for export to other countries is constrained by various factors. Vehicles in Japan have right-hand drive‚Äîthe steering wheel is on the right side of the vehicle‚Äîin accord with Japan's left-hand traffic. Some countries with right-hand traffic permit right-hand drive vehicles, though right-traffic headlamps are generally unavailable for models exclusive to Japan.Considerations for Approval of Lighting Equipment on Vehicles Imported to Canada, Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy, 2006, pp. 6-7 Some countries with right traffic do not allow right-hand drive cars, but in some such markets the extensive labor required to convert a car to left-hand drive is economically feasible; such conversions are sometimes done by the local importers. The Philippines is an example of a market where such conversion is common, until recently, when the importation of such used vehicles (except for heavy vehicles) was banned by E0 156. Japan's automobile safety regulations also differ substantially from the ECE Regulations used throughout most of the world and the North American regulations that apply in the United States and Canada.Perspective on Proposed Changes to Vehicle Import Regulations in Canada Vehicle components such as windows and windshields, seat belts, lamps and reflectors, and mirrors, as well as design features for crashworthiness such as bumpers, fuel tanks, and structural rigidity of vehicles meant for the Japanese market may not comply with non-Japanese standards.15yo ADR-ing ‚Äî Part 115yo ADR-ing ‚Äî Part 2 They often lack structural reinforcements needed to meet side-impact crashworthiness standards in effect outside Japan. Moreover, entire categories of vehicle, such as Kei cars, do not exist in regulations outside Japan.63 FR 33913 U.S. Department of Transportation Final RuleCan America Find True Happiness in a Microcar? =Responsibilities= Generally, most exporters are responsible for the organization and completion of the vehicle's transportation until it arrives at the importer's Port of Destination (POD). At the POD, possession of the vehicle, and the responsibility of possession, is laid on the importer. Financial responsibility, on the other hand, is transferred when ownership is handed over. Ownership is switched after the car has been purchased and before being exported. In the case of damage or losses occurring during shipping, the buyer is the one bears all financial loss. =Car export companies verification= Whilst the majority of websites in Japan are of genuine business companies, there are scams and fraud in Japan. Foreign importers must verify each company, and transfer money only when transactions are satisfactorily completed. Verification of Japanese companies under the Japan Company Trust Organization can be helpful. To specific countries =Canada= Nissan Cefiro, imported from Japan and registered in Alberta Any vehicle more than 15 years old may be imported into Canada without regard to its compliance with Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Vehicles are registered at the provincial level in Canada, and increasingly stringent sub-national vehicle safety requirements make it difficult to register a Japanese-market vehicle without replacement or modifications to the headlamps and other lights and reflectors, window glass, tires, seatbelts and other equipment. =Chile= A Toyota Corolla II switched to LHD and registered in Chile In Chile, second hand imported vehicles may only be registered in the extreme regions of Arica and Parinacota, Tarapac√°, Ais√©n and Magallanes. Japanese used vehicles must meet emission standards and be converted to left hand drive. However, a big market of non converted cars exists in the duty-free zone of Iquique, where customers from other countries buy them and sometimes drive them home. =Greece= In Greece, second hand vehicles are allowed but they cannot be older than three years old (ambulance or fire engine vehicles cannot be older than six years old), have to meet emission standards and be left hand drive. Right hand drive vehicles and tourist vehicles older than six years old that enter Greece from neighboring countries are usually towed to borders where they are allowed. =Hong Kong= 2002 Toyota bB, Japan Domestic version, exported and registered in Hong Kong. Many used cars from Japan are registered in Hong Kong, including both Japanese makes and even European makes, since both Hong Kong and Japan are right hand drive. In order to register the car in Hong Kong, the car must be less than seven years old, gasoline powered, meet Euro V emission, and noise standard, with E-mark for all glass and safety belts, and unleaded-fuel restrictor installed (if not already present). For cars over 20 years old, they can be imported as classic cars and need not meet Euro V emission standard. In addition, Hong Kong does not accept privacy windows. If a Japanese used car is fitted with privacy windows, it must be converted to clear glass in order to register in Hong Kong. =Ireland= Toyota WiLL in Dublin Ireland has relatively loose vehicle importing laws for Japanese cars. To keep imports down, Irish Revenue Commissioners require all new and imported cars to pay the VRT. Also, every car, both domestic and imported over four years old must pass the stringent National Car Test (NCT) in order to be given a road worthiness certificate. In the case of cars imported from Japan, all glass, tyres, noise, must meet EU approved levels. Imported Japanese used cars are easily recognisable as their rear Irish number plates are square in form and not the rectangular regular issued plates. This is because cars for the Japanese market have square recesses in the rear to accommodate Japanese plates. =Kenya= In Kenya, second-hand imported Japanese vehicles must undergo a worthiness inspection conducted by the Quality Inspection Services Japan as per mandate from the Kenya Bureau of Standards. The inspection aims to ensure that the vehicles are not more than eight years old, have genuine mileage and that the vehicles pass a safety and mechanical inspection as per the standards set by KEBS. Guide to Kenya Car Import Regulations = Macau = Honda Beat in Macau Although Macau is right hand drive, it does not allow imports of used car from Japan or any other country, unlike Hong Kong. However, brand new parallel imported cars from Japan are allowed in Macau. =Malta= Toyota ist, registered in Malta In Malta, second-hand imported Japanese vehicles must comply with Road Worthiness regulations which address Emissions, Lights Operability & Mechanical Operability. Vehicles thus in compliance can be imported and registered. Some Maltese importers apply corrosion protection to these vehicles due to the hot, humid climate. =Mozambique= In Mozambique, most of the cars in the roads are imported from Japan, where Toyota takes the lead in terms of brand. All cars to be imported to Mozambique must undergo a pre-inspection process in Japan performed by Intertek. The inspection will determinate the condition of the car to be imported and the right value of the car for custom clearance proposes. In Mozambique the custom clearance amount will depend on the type of car, engine size, number of seats and propose of use, and can cost up to 84% of the CIF of the Vehicle. Added to the custom clearance the importer will pay up 650 USD of port fees. =New Zealand= Nissan March Bolero, imported to New Zealand New Zealand has stringent safety and emission standards. Besides biosecurity and customs clearances, a vehicle must be Entry Certified by a Transport Services Delivery Agent (TSDA) which includes checking that paper data and physical data meet safety, emissions, and fuel consumption standards. =Pakistan= Pakistan applies strict controls on imports. Imported cars must be not more than three years old. High import taxes are levied on imported vehicles.Import of Vehicles, High Commission for Pakistan Special ships are sometimes used for exporting vehicles to Pakistan to meet the rising demand. =Russia= Right hand drive Toyota Sprinter in Seversk While Russia has right hand traffic, it allows the importation of LHT vehicles if they pass the technical inspection. This is compulsory for all street-legal vehicles in Russia. Although a prohibitively high import tariff is levied on cars more than seven years old, to protect local industry, the oldest Japanese vehicles usually pass the inspection, if they were well maintained. Vehicles imported to Russia are sometimes exported to North Korea and Central Asia. =Saudi Arabia= Unlike the UAE, Saudi Arabia does not allow imports of vehicles from Japan or any LHT country because only left hand drive vehicles are allowed. Additionally, right hand drive to left hand drive modifications as well as vehicles from Israel are not allowed due to the laws against Israeli goods. =United Arab Emirates= Some vehicles like the Toyota Fortuner, Toyota Hiace, and the Nissan Skyline R34 have been imported to the UAE and are sometimes converted to left hand drive. Right hand drive vehicles are legal and sometimes remain RHD for transit or sporting purposes. =United Kingdom= Toyota Comfort, import and registered in the UK Importing rules for the UK are stringent. Vehicles less than 10 years old must undergo Individual Vehicle Approval to assure compliance with applicable ECE Regulations or British national equivalents. The speedometer must be converted from kilometres per hour to miles per hour, a rear fog light and unleaded-fuel restrictor installed. Vehicles older than 10 years need only to fit a rear fog light and pass a MOT before applying for V55/5 (First vehicle tax and registration of a used motor vehicle). =United States= Nissan GT-R R34 in Connecticut Vehicles at least 25 years old may be imported to the US regardless of non-compliance with that country's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Vehicles are registered at the state level in the US, and increasingly stringent sub-national vehicle safety requirements make it difficult to register a Japanese-market vehicle without replacement or modifications to the headlamps and other lights and reflectors, window glass, tires, seat belts and other equipment. In 21 states, kei trucks less than 25 years old can be legally imported and registered as off-road utility vehicles with on-road usage and top speed restrictions varying by state, although states which allow mini trucks to be operated on public roads prohibit their operation on Interstate highways.

Thousands of packages containing kosher for Pesach MREs (meals ready to eat) have already reached U.S. army and navy supply bases, with special shipments aimed at Jewish troops in Iraq and Afghanistan... The Jewish Chaplains Council estimates that the number of Jews stationed in Iraq is between 500 and 600. Of the 30 Jewish chaplains on active duty around the world, eight chaplains are stationed in Iraq, including two female rabbis. Each chaplain stationed in Iraq will hold two seders at base camps, with central seders taking place in Baghdad, Falluja and Tikrit. There will also be two seders at the army headquarters in Bahrain, and air force headquarters in Qatar. Jewish soldiers stationed in remote locations will be able to attend seders led by soldiers who received special training for that purpose.

The outreach has the Bush administration's blessing: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said six Persian Gulf states and Egypt, Jordan and Israel are a new alignment of moderates to oppose extremists backed by Iran and Syria. She has said an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal would weaken militants such as Hamas and Hezbollah...Saudi and Gulf Arab contacts with Israelis and American Jews go back more than a decade but have never been so public. Arab countries have treated Israel as a pariah since it gained independence in 1948. Most Arab countries ban travel to Israel, investment there and other commercial ties with the Jewish state and routinely refer to it as the \\"Zionist entity.\\" ...Among the other recent Arab-Jewish contacts: Saudi national security adviser Bandar bin Sultan met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jordan in September, said Daniel Ayalon, Israel's former ambassador to Washington.

L. Stevens & Company, with an annex added in 1925‚Äì26, it is an eight-story building which is located between the Music Building and Information Sciences Building between Ruskin and Bellefield Avenues near Fifth Avenue on Pitt's main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ruskin Hall recently underwent a $19.4 million conversion and renovation from medical student housing into undergraduate apartment-style housing that opened in 2008. History Main entrance to Ruskin Hall Originally built in 1921‚Äì22 by H. L. Stevens & Company as the Ruskin Apartments, an annex facing Bellefield Avenue was added in 1925‚Äì26. The building has long seen usage by Pitt students, including use as the meeting place of the Omega Delta fraternity until the fall of 1926. Pitt purchased the Ruskin Apartments in February 1958 for $2.24 million ($ in dollars) as an investment, with the intention of using it eventually for faculty residences. Following the purchase, Pitt Chancellor Edward Litchfield held a tea for the 189 remaining tenants, many of whom were elderly, well-to-do widows, to ensure them that their leases and the staff and management would be maintained as long as they wished to stay. With time, the apartments were relinquished giving Pitt full control of the building. In 1966, Richard King Mellon donated $1,075,475 ($ in dollars) to the University to refinance and retain possession of the Ruskin Apartments so they could be used for members of the house staffs of the University-affiliated hospitals and their families. Ruskin Hall has also served as the home for university offices including those of the University of Pittsburgh Press. Through 2007, Ruskin Hall served as the primary residence for medical students and PhD candidates in the basic sciences of medicine, although students of other medical-related schools (including dental, nursing, and pharmacy) could be wait-listed for apartments. Beginning in the summer of 2007, medical student housing was replaced by the Darragh Street Medical Student Housing complex, allowing for a $19.4 million renovation by Graves Design Group to convert Ruskin Hall into undergraduate apartment-style housing was completed for fall 2008. Facilities Bellefield Ave side of Ruskin Hall between the Music Building and the School of Information Sciences Building Previously serving as a primary residence for medical students, Ruskin Hall contained 176 studio, efficiency, or one- to two-bedroom apartments each containing a living room, one to two bathrooms, and a kitchen. A ground floor study area, central courtyard, and laundry facilities were available and the building was outfitted with central air conditioning. A $19.4 million renovation was completed in 2008 that converted the Hall into an undergraduate residence hall with 178 apartment-style units with 416 beds in one, two, and three-person apartments and single-person efficiency apartments. The furnished apartments include private baths and kitchens and have cable and internet connection. Commons areas are also equipped with wireless internet. A University of Pittsburgh Police mini- station in Ruskin Hall was also part of the renovation.

In colloquial speech, plants may be classified as trees, shrubs, herbs (forbs and graminoids), etc. The scientific use of life-form schemes emphasizes plant function in the ecosystem and that the same function or \\"adaptedness\\" to the environment may be achieved in a number of ways, i.e. plant species that are closely related phylogenetically may have widely different life-form, for example Adoxa and Sambucus are from the same family, but the former is a small herbaceous plant and the latter is a shrub or tree. Conversely, unrelated species may share a life-form through convergent evolution. While taxonomic classification is concerned with the production of natural classifications (being natural understood either in philosophical basis for pre-evolutionary thinking, or phylogenetically as non-polyphyletic), plant life form classifications uses other criteria than naturalness, like morphology, physiology and ecology. Life-form and growth-form are essentially synonymous concepts, despite attempts to restrict the meaning of growth-form to types differing in shoot architecture.Du Rietz, G. E. (1931) Life-forms of terrestrial flowering plants. I. Acta Phytogeographica Suecica 3 (1): 95 pp. Most life form schemes are concerned with vascular plants only. Plant construction types may be used in a broader sense to encompass planktophytes, benthophytes (mainly algae) and terrestrial plants.Raven, J.A. (1986) Evolution of plant life forms. Pages 421-492 in T.J. Givnish (ed.) On the economy of plant form and function. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. A popular life-form scheme is the Raunki√¶r system. History One of the earliest attempts to classify the life-forms of plants and animals was made by Aristotle, whose writings are lost. His pupil, Theophrastus, in Historia Plantarum (c. 350 BC), was the first who formally recognized plant habits: trees, shrubs and herbs.Niklas, K.J. 2008. Life Forms, Plants. In: J√∏rgensen SV (ed.). Encyclopedia of ecology. Amsterdam: Elsevier, p. 2160‚Äì2167, . Some earlier authors (e.g., Humboldt, 1806) did classify species according to physiognomy,Humboldt, A. von (1806).

P. de Candolle (1818) attempt to construct a natural system of botanical classification.De Candolle, A.P. (1818) Regni vegetabilis systema naturale, Vol. 1. Paris. His system was based on the height of the lignified stem and on plant longevity. Eugenius Warming, in his account, is explicit about his Candollean legacy.Warming, E. (1909) Oecology of Plants - an introduction to the study of plant-communities, translated by P. Groom and I. B. Balfour. Clarendon Press, Oxford. 422 pp. Warming's first attempt in life- form classification was his work Om Skudbygning, Overvintring og Foryngelse (translated title \\"On shoot architecture, perennation and rejuvenation\\" - See line drawings) (1884). The classification was based on his meticulous observations while raising wild plants from seed in the Copenhagen Botanical Garden. Fourteen informal groups were recognized, based on longevity of the plant, power of vegetative propagation, duration of tillers, hypogeous or epigeous type of shoots, mode of wintering, and degree and mode of branching of rhizomes. The term life-form was first coined by Warming (\\"livsform\\") in his 1895 book Plantesamfund,Warming, E. (1895) Plantesamfund - Grundtr√¶k af den √∏kologiske Plantegeografi. P.G. Philipsens Forlag, Kj√∏benhavn; Chapter 2 \\"Livsform (Vegetationsform)\\" p. 3-6. but was translated to \\"growthform\\" in the 1909 English version Oecology of Plants. Warming developed his life-form scheme further in his \\"On the life forms in the vegetable kingdom\\".Warming, E. (1908) Om planterigets livsformer [translated title: On the life forms in the vegetable kingdom]. G.E.C. Gad, K√∏benhavn. He presented a hierarchic scheme, first dividing plants into heterotrophic and autotrophic, the latter group then into aquatic and terrestrial, the land plants into muscoid, lichenoid, lianoid and all other autonomous land plants, which again were divided into monocarpic and polycarpic. This system was incorporated into the English version of his 1895 book Oecology of Plants. Warming continued working on plant life-forms and intended to develop his system further. However, due to high age and illness, he was able to publish a draft of his last system onlyWarming, E. (1923) √òkologiens Grundformer ‚Äì Udkast til en systematisk Ordning [translated title: Fundamental ecological forms - draft for a system]. Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs Skrifter - Naturvidenskabelig og Mathematisk Afdeling, 8. Rk., vol. 4: 120-187. Following Warming's line of emphasizing functional characters, Oscar Drude devised a life-form scheme in his Die Systematische und Geographische Anordnung der Phanerogamen (1887). This was, however, a hybrid between physiognomic and functional classification schemes as it recognized monocots and dicots as groups. Drude later modified his scheme in Deutschlands Pflanzengeographie (1896), and this scheme was adopted by the influential American plant ecologists Frederic Clements and Roscoe Pound Pound, R. and Clements, F.E. (1898) Phytogeography of Nebraska. Lincoln, Nebraska. Reprinted in the History of Ecology Series by Arno Press, New York, 1977. Christen C. Raunki√¶r's classification (1904) recognized life- forms (first called \\"biological types\\") on the basis of plant adaptation to survive the unfavorable season, be it cold or dry, that is the position of buds with respect to the soil surface.Raunki√¶r, C.

He tabulated six parallel ways of life-form classification:Du Rietz (1931), p. 44. * 1. Main life-forms (\\"Grundformen\\"): based upon the general plant physiognomy (e.g., Theophrastus, 350 BC, Humboldt, 1806; * 2. Growth-forms sensu stricto: based upon the shoot architecture; * 3. Periodicity life-forms: based upon the seasonal physiognomic variation; * 4. Bud height life-forms: based upon the height above (or below) the ground-level of the uppermost buds perduring the most unfavourable seasons (e.g., Raunki√¶r, 1904); * 5. Bud-type life-forms: based upon the structure of the buds perduring the most unfavourable seasons; * 6. Leaf life-forms: based on the character (form, size, duration, structure, etc.) of the leaves (e.g., Raunki√¶r, 1916). Later authors have combined these or other types of unidimensional life-form schemes into more complex schemes, in which life-forms are defined as combinations of states of several characters. Examples are the schemes proposed by Pierre DansereauDansereau, P. (1951) Description and recording of vegetation upon a structural basis. Ecology 32 (2): 172-229. and Stephan Halloy.Halloy, S. 1990. A morphological classification of plants, with special reference to the New Zealand alpine flora. Journal of Vegetation Science 1 (3): 291-304. These schemes approach the concept of plant functional type, which has recently replaced life-form in a narrow sense.

Internet Archive, San Francisco, California. Retrieved May 21, 2020. Plot In the years following the Civil War, the state of Kansas is increasingly divided by opposing economic and social forces. Homesteaders are moving into the West, trying to start new lives, and their increasing presence is clashing with the established commercial interests of cattlemen, who had settled in the region before the war. Abilene, a major cattle town, is on the brink of an armed conflict between the cattlemen and the homesteaders, and the town marshal Dan Mitchell (Randolph Scott) strives to keep the peace between those two groups as well maintain the uneasy coexistence between Abilene's townspeople and the ranchers with their legion of cowboys. For years, the town had been literally divided, with the cattlemen and their supporters occupying one side of the main street and townspeople occupying the other side. Mitchell liked it this way; it made things easier for him, and prevented dangerous confrontations from arising between the two factions. However, when homesteaders decide to lay stakes on the edge of town that existing balance is upset and leads to a deadly showdown. The leader of the homesteaders is Henry Dreiser (Lloyd Bridges), a reasonable young man with common sense; and the county sheriff, \\"Bravo\\" Trimble (Edgar Buchanan), is a lawman who would rather play cards than get involved in any real or potential unrest in Abilene. Marshal Mitchell, however, does strive to prevent the upcoming confrontation while also dealing with a clash in his personal life, which is divided as well between Rita (Ann Dvorak), a flashy showgirl who works on the cattle drovers' side of the street, and Sherry (Rhonda Fleming), the modest, churchgoing daughter of a shopkeeper on the other side of the street.

Discovery announced on 22 November 2007 that they would launch a version of DMAX in the UK and Ireland market on 8 January 2008 after its initial success in Germany. On 16 July 2015, DMAX moved from 144 to 167 on Sky, switching places with sister channel Quest. Following the re-combination of the Entertainment and Lifestyle & Culture sections of the Sky guide, Discovery relocated some of their stations on the platform, resulting in DMAX being pushed down the grid to allow Discovery Home & Health to be moved up. In the May 2018 reorganisation of the Sky main guide, DMAX moved to channel 178. On 7 January 2019, it was announced that DMAX would become a free-to-air channel and be carried on Freeview (channel number 42) and Freesat (channel number 150) from 16 January, replacing sister channel Travel Channel. On 12 June 2019, DMAX moved to channel 37 on the Freeview platform as part of a reshuffle due to its owner, Discovery, Inc. acquiring Good Food, Home and Really from the UKTV network as part of a deal with BBC Studios. Timeshifted variants The one-hour timeshift service DMAX +1 has been available on Sky since the launch of DMAX, originally on channel 145. On 30 April 2013 TLC launched on channel 125, resulting in Challenge being relocated from there to channel 145, leading to DMAX +1 being moved to Sky channel 238. As of August 2014, following further guide changes DMAX +1 was on Sky channel 233. In the May 2018 reorganisation, timeshifts of channels in the first 99 places were placed on the corresponding position in the 200 range, so with DMAX moved to 178, DMAX +1 was shifted to 278. The DMAX +1 service went free-to-air alongside the parent channel in 2019 and took the place of Travel Channel +1 on the Freesat guide. A two-hour timeshift channel named DMAX +2 launched on Sky on 1 April 2008. DMAX +2 closed on 30 April 2013 when TLC launched, with the accompanying TLC +1 launched on channel 195, which had been DMAX +2. Another timeshift channel named DMAX +1.5 launched on Sky on 18 August 2008. DMAX +1.5 was closed down on 2 November 2009 when Quest +1 launched. Discovery decided to make a new division called Discovery Entertainment Group Ltd. in the UK. It operated Quest, Quest Red, Food Network, HGTV, Really, Discovery and Animal Planet.

The responsible German soldiers proclaimed to the gathered population that the Poles \\"pigs\\".

Members of these military units have been accused of perpetrating human rights abuses against local villagers. Fearing for the lives of its employees after a series of attacks, ExxonMobil shut down its Arun natural gas operations in Aceh in March 2001. In 2015, ExxonMobil sold its Aceh operations to Pertamina. The company denies these accusations; its primary defense is that the human rights violations which were occurring were not a result of specific intention of the organization and therefore it cannot be held liable.Aceh: Then and Now By Lesley McCulloch Aceh is located on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The region is rich in natural resources, including oil and natural gas. In 1992, it was reported that Aceh provided 15% of Indonesia's total exports, and the value of the oil and gas fields was estimated in 2003 to generate US$1.2-1.5 billion annually.  History of the Aceh gas fields  In 1968, Mobil began operating the Arun gas fields, which are owned by the Indonesian state oil company, Pertamina. In 1971, Mobil Oil Indonesia discovered massive reserves of natural gas in north Aceh, which led to the creation of the Lhokseumawe Industrial Zone (LIZ). After Exxon bought Mobil in 1999, the merged company, which is based in Irving, Texas, took over the management of Arun. The gas fields there, until their closing in March, contributed to the Indonesian budget with about $1 billion in revenue annually. Aceh, the home for the natural gas field has been witnessing an armed resistance organized under the banner of the Free Aceh Movement. From 1989 to 1998, the Indonesian government designated Aceh as a Military Operation Area, with thousands of troops assigned to defeat the armed independence force.Indonesian Separatist Movement in Aceh Larry Niksch Specialist in Asian Affairs Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division The litigation The International Labor Rights Fund took on the cause of people claiming to be victims of abuse. In 2001, ILRF filed an ATCA claim in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of 11 villagers from Aceh claiming to be victims of human rights abuses by security forces hired by ExxonMobil. The suit alleges that ExxonMobil employed military troops to protect its operations, and aided and abetted human rights violations through financial and other material support to the security forces. In addition, the suit alleges that the security forces are either employees or agents of Exxon Mobil, and thus Exxon Mobil is liable for their actions.A Matter of Complicity? Exxon Mobil on Trial for its Role in Human Rights Violations in Aceh In 2005 a US federal judge ruled that the case could proceed on District of Columbia state law claims, including wrongful death, theft by coercion and assault and battery, but dismissed claims under the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act. In 2006 a motion to dismiss filed by ExxonMobil was dismissed, as was an appeal in 2007. In 2008 the US Supreme court, having invited the US Solicitor General to comment, declined to hear an appeal. In 2009 the District Court accepted Exxon's motion to dismiss, based on lack of standing by the plaintiffs' in a US court; this was revered in 2011 by the appeals court. In 2014, a US federal court decided that the case could proceed; in 2015 that the claims sufficiently \\"touch and concern\\" the United States that they may proceed in US court.

Characteristics  Seonamsa is one of the head monasteries of the Taego Order, which includes over 8,000 monastics and 3,100 temples. What distinguishes the Taego Order from other forms of Korean Buddhism like the Jogye Order of Seon is that it allows ordained priests to marry, although nuns must remain celibate. This custom of married priests is a remnant of Korea under Japanese rule. However, not all Taego priests are married. This order also includes traditional monks. Monks tend to remain more separate from society and live in mountain temples, whereas the married clerics are more like parish priests, though this is not always the case. According to the Patriarch of the Taego Order Overseas Parish, Venerable Dr. Jongmae Kenneth Park, the Taego and Jogye orders follow the same PrƒÅtimok·π£a, the vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka also followed in Vietnam and China. There are 250 bhiksu precepts, 348 bhiksuni precepts, and 10 ≈õrƒÅma·πáera and ≈õrƒÅma·πáerƒ´ (novice) precepts. However, celibacy is optional. Both the Taego and the Jogye use the Brahma Net Sutra, which contain 10 bodhisattva vows and 48 lesser precepts. Contrary to some misconceptions, the Taego Order does not use bodhisattva vows as the basis of its ordinations. The Taego Order formed in the 1970s from the monks left out of the then Christian-dominated military government's officially recognized group of monks that became the Jogye Order. This group consisted of 300 celibate Seon practitioners. One result of this split was that the ritual masters all remained with what became the Taego Order. Today, the Taego Order preserves the full ritual tradition of Korean Buddhism, including the Yeongsanjae, which is a reenactment of the Buddha's preaching of the Lotus Sutra on Vulture Peak. This ritual is held each year at Bongwonsa on June 6, South Korea's Memorial Day, in part to pray for the dead from the Korean War.  History  Before 1945 the majority of Korean Buddhist monastics were descended from Taego Bou, especially within the Jogye Order, which was founded at the end of Goryeo. This unified order continued until 1954, when Syngman Rhee and a number of monks ordered a separation of the order into two parts, one composed of 300 celibate monks and the other a combination of celibate monks and priests, the latter of which would become the Taego Order. The group of 300 celibate monks retained the name \\"Jogye Order\\" but changed the color of the kasa, the outer monastic robe worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm, to brown despite the fact that the traditional color of a Korean kasa was red. This was done to create a visual distinction between the orders. North Korean Buddhist clergy most often use the most traditional robes ‚Äì a red kasa and a dark-blue or nearly black ceremonial robe. After the separation of the orders, the monastics in the Jogye Order as well as the government suppressed the group that became the Taego Order, in part by forcing married clergy out of the temples so these disestablished priests had to establish a new order that would carry the characteristics of the original Jogye Order, including the use of the original red kasa, though allowing for marriage. In 1970 a new order was officially founded that was named for Taego Bou. Of particular note in the Taego ritual tradition is the Yeongsanjae ritual. This is a reenactment of Shakyamuni Buddha's teaching of the Lotus Sutra on Vulture Peak. It involves a great deal of chanting and dancing. The full ritual is quite long, but is sometimes performed in an abbreviated fashion lasting just a few hours. This ritual is only preserved in the Taego Order and has been recognized as an intangible cultural asset by UNESCO.  Training for Clergy  The training for Taego clergy is similar to that of the Jogye Order. Taego novitiates can study at a gangwon, which is a traditional academic institute similar to the Tibetan shedra. They can also attend the Central Sangha College run by the Jogye Order. Another option in both orders is to pursue a modern education, generally in Buddhist Studies. For novice monastics who study at a gangwon or modern academic institution to fulfill their basic education requirement, four years of study/training are required. After this, they may be ordained a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni if they pass an examination and then either work at a temple in a capacity similar to that of a \\"parish priest,\\" or continue their training and education. For students at a gangwon, they would then have the option to study for four years at a yulwon, which is a Vinaya school. Upon graduation they would be known as Vinaya masters. For this reason, yulwon students must be celibate. Taego monastics may also study at a yeombulwon, which is a ritual training school focusing on traditional chanting, ritual, music, and dance after taking full ordination. These students may request private tutoring for further training in ritual after graduation from the full four-year program, though some programs offer two- and three-year options as well. Fully ordained monastics may train at a Seonwon in meditation as well. This consists of two roughly 3-month retreats each year. In between retreats, these monastics would travel from temple to temple until the next retreat starts. Students in this system do not study under one master at one temple, but participate in retreats at different temples under different masters for many years. For training in Seon, there is no \\"graduation\\" after a specific number of years. In rare cases, a student may receive dharma transmission or inka from a master of Seon after 20 or 30 years of practice. However, Dharma transmission in the Seon tradition is extremely rare.  America-Europe Parish  As for foreign clergy, there are a growing number of Taego Order clergy in the U.S., Canada and Europe. According to the Taego Order website (listed below), international clergy (that is, those who are not Korean) can study for ordination from home in a two-year program through the Institute for Buddhist Studies. This is a two-year program leading to ordination as a samanera (though not necessarily with vows of celibacy) or samaneri (requiring a vow of celibacy). The ordinations are carried out in South Korea. Dharma teachers can also be ordained after completing this program. These ordinations are conducted in the West. (Graduation from the seminary does not itself guarantee ordination. In addition, the seminary itself does not conduct ordinations - the Korean Taego Order conducts the ordinations.) The website does not clarify the difference between regular clergy and Dharma teachers, however the primary difference is that Dharma Teachers have fewer obligations and cannot be abbots of temples. Dharma Teachers also do not perform ordinations, memorial chanting, the \\"eye-opening ceremony\\" (consecrating religious images), nor do they perform the Dharma transmission rite (Inka). In both the Taego and Jogye orders, only monastics are eligible to receive Inka. The website currently lists more than 40 clergy in the America-Europe Parish (covering the U.S., Canada, and Europe) though a few are Koreans living overseas. There are also temples in New Jersey (Bogota and Warren), New York (Staten Island), Georgia (Hampton), Texas (Austin), Michigan (Royal Oak and Grand Rapids), Canada (Brampton, ON), California (Anaheim, Los Angeles, Seal Beach, and Pinion Hills), Idaho (Mountain Home), Missouri (St. Louis), the Washington, D.C. area, Hong Kong, and Germany in Solingen, Nuremberg and Munich). The first Westerner ordained as a Taego monk is Dae Il Sunim (Dr. David Zuniga). Dae Il Sunim is also the first board-certified Buddhist chaplain. He currently works as a psychologist in Texas. However, the majority of Taego clergy in the West are disciples or grand-disciples of Dr. Jongmae Park. Dr. Park retired from the faculty at Loyola Marymount University in the Los Angeles area as of 2014.

It runs from the classification yard at Loenga(Norway) to Alnabru Freight Terminal, typically serving twenty trains per day. It allows trains to pass from the √òstfold Line to Alnabru without passing via Oslo Central Station. It is also used by freight trains from the S√∏rlandet Line, which run via the Oslo Tunnel and cross over at Bryn Station. It is notorious for the steep hill Brynsbakken which it has to climb, giving it a gradient of 2.6 percent. The line was opened from Bryn to Alnabru Station in 1904, with completion to Loenga on 1 May 1907. The line was electrified in 1928. A new classification yard opened at Alnabru in 1970. The line was the site of the Sjurs√∏ya Accident in 2010. In order to bypass Brynsbakken, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has proposed building a tunnel from further south on the √òstfold Line, named the Bryn Diagonal. Route Alnabru Freight Terminal The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line connects the classification yard at Loenga with Alnabru Freight Terminal, both in Oslo. For most of the route the line follows the Alna River. The line has single track and standard gauge and is electrified at . It has centralized traffic control, automatic train control and GSM-R train radio. The railway line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration.Bjerke: 60 The line is notorious for its steep climb, Brynsbakken, which has a gradient of 2.6 percent.Faveo: 26 Only of the line is horizontal. Except for underpass under the Trunk Line, the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line has a minimum curve radius of . The line branches off from the √òstfold Line at Loenga, at an elevation of . Loenga is a classification yard which serves Oslo Central Station. While the √òstfold Line continues northeast to the station, the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line branches off in a northeasterly direction. It runs on overpasses over the √òstfold Line and the branch to Lodalen. The line curves to run parallel with the Trunk Line. At Etterstad there is a switch which allows trains to pass to and from the Gardermoen Line, just before the latter enters the Romerike Tunnel. Afterwards the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line runs parallel to the Trunk Line, but at a lower elevation. At Bryn Station, from Loenga, there is a switch allowing trains access from the Trunk Line. At past Loenga the line passes into a tunnel under the Trunk Line. The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line reaches Alnabru Freight Terminal after at . At this point the line has an elevation of . The line terminates as it reaches Alnabru S at .Bjerke: 61 History Alnabru Station in 1922 The Trunk Line was completed in 1854, followed by the √òstfold Line in 1879.Bjerke: 34 By the 1870s there was sufficient traffic on the Trunk Line that the Norwegian Trunk Railway was considering building double track along it. The economic decline throughout the 1880s put these plans on hold. Parliament decided in 1897 that the Gj√∏vik Line's freight trains would be handled at Loenga. This made it necessary for a separate freight track to be built through Loelvdalen. Surveys for a suitable place for cargo handling soon found that the steep gradient made it impossible to locate a cargo facility fore Alna.Norwegian Trunk Railway: 121 Oslo East Station was soon too small and there was need for additional sites for classification and cargo handling. Loenga was chosen as the site in 1903, and the railway bought Oslo Ladeg√•rds hage. Work on the yard started the same year and it was completed in 1909.Hol√∏s: 93 Alnabru Station was established in 1900 along with the Alna Line. It was a diagonal connection with the Gj√∏vik Line. The station featured a large cargo handling facility. Several routes were considered for the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line. The need to keep the gradient at bay meant that the tracks were placed at a lower elevation than the Trunk Line, with the two not reaching the same height until Bryn Station. At the same time the company needed to stay away from the Alna River. Meanwhile, the Gj√∏vik Line was built with a branch, the Alna Line, which connected to Alnabru. Just northeast of the Trunk Line was placed in a culvert under the Trunk Line so it would meet up with the Alna Line. The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line was completed between Bryn and Alnabru in May 1904. with this work being carried out at the same time as the doubling of the Trunk Line. The section from Loenga to Bryn opened on 1 May 1907. Alnabru Station became an increasingly important cargo handling station for the capital area. The Norwegian State Railways bought the farm Nordre Alna in 1918, allowing for a further development of the station. and from Loenga to Bryn on 1 May 1907. The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line was electrified on 15 October 1928. Loenga in 1952 The planning of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station quickly made it obvious that cargo handling could not take place at the same site. Alnabru was thereby selected as the site for a new classification yard and container terminal.Hol√∏s: 175 The old Alnabru Station was demolished and a new Alna Station was built on a new set of tracks on the Trunk Line. The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line and the Alna Line were connected to the western side of the new terminal, while the Trunk Line was not. The terminal opened in 1970,Bjerke: 33 and the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line received centralized traffic control from 24 January 1972. A series of road constructions in the Bryn area caused the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line to receive new structures. A concrete bridge was completed in 1969 to carry European Road E6 over the tracks. An underpass below the entrance to the V√•lerenga Tunnel was finished in 1987. An underpass below Kvernervegen was completed in 1999. The Sjurs√∏ya train accident took place on 24 March 2010. A set of sixteen freight cars bean to roll uncontrollably during shunting on Alnabru. The train dispatcher central chose to lead the runaway train along the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line and out onto the port facilities at Sjurs√∏ya. By then the trains had reached an estimated speed exceeding . Three people were killed and four seriously injured. Service The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line is only used by freight traffic heading to and from Alnabru Freight Terminal. These have three origins or destinations. Freight trains which originate on the S√∏rlandet Line pass through Oslo Central Station and continue along the Trunk Line until Bryn Station, where they switch onto the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line. Freight trains from the √òstfold Line connect to the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line at Loenga. There are also freight trains which originate at Sjurs√∏ya.Faveo: 22 These currently only consist of about nine weekly services which haul jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. About 20 trains use the line each day. Travel time is about 12 minutes from Loenga to Alnabru, with an average speed of about . Lacking any passing loops, the line has a theoretical capacity for two trains per direction per hour.Faveo: 52 Future Bryn Station looking west. The Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line is the tracks to the left. Domestically rail transport has a market share of between 52 and 66 percent of intermodal transport from Oslo to Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger. The corresponding market share on international routes is only 17 percent. It is an explicit political goal to increase rail transport's market share. The volume internationally is much higher than domestically, for instance 8.5 million tonnes from the south corridor compared to 1.6 million tonnes to Trondheim in 2011. The volume is expected to grow with 150 percent by 2040. The government is therefore prioritizing upgrading the corridor through √òstfold to handle more freight.Faveo: 44 Development of the corridor would allow for direct intermodal train services to destinations in Central Europe.Faveo: 46 The Port of Oslo is developing a new container terminal at Sjurs√∏ya. There is a significant amount of container traffic from the port to Alnabru, which is currently transported by road. If better infrastructure was established, this traffic could be transported by rail. Faveo: 34 The steepness of the Brynsbakken is a major inconvenience for freight operators. They must either use an extra locomotive, which adds time and cost, or operate shorter trains, which reduces the operating efficiency. Brynsbakken has therefore been identified as a bottleneck in transport from the S√∏rlandet Line, Sweden and the Continent to Alnabru.Faveo: 8 Increased capacity southwards will allow for more freight trains towards Gothenburg, Denmark and the continent. One alternative is to establish an extra locomotive at Loenga, which would require an upgrade of the track alignment at Loenga. Although this would cut some costs, it would still delay each train by about 25 minutes and requires additional tracks at both Loenga and Alnabru. Although freight trains from the √òstfold Line pass through Loenga, those from the S√∏rlandet Line do not, causing additional delays.Faveo: 86 The Bryn Diagonal (Norwegian: ) is a proposed new line which would connect to the √òstfold Line and run to Bryn or Alnabru. By extending the line further south, it would have a longer route and thus less gradient. This would allow trains up to 1,500 tonnes to operate to Alnabru without assistance. Several specific proposals have been launched. One would involve a branching near Nordstrand Station. It could be built in such a way that trains also could arrive from the north, so that also trains from the S√∏rlandet Line could use it. Alternatives include branching off further south, for instance at Hauketo Station. All alternatives involve building the line in a tunnel.Faveo: 9 During the planning of the Follo Line‚Äîa new high-speed connection between Oslo and Ski‚Äîthere were proposals to connect it to the Bryn Diagonal. This was discarded by the National Rail Administration in 2014. The number of passenger trains on the new line would be so high and operate at such speeds that the Follo Line could only be operated by freight trains at night. The complexity, cost and maintenance of an intersection was regarded as not worthwhile for the limited amount of traffic.

The concept is a form of piggyback transportation. The technical challenges to implement rolling highways vary from region to region. In North America, the loading gauge is often high enough to accommodate double stack containers, so the height of a truck on a flat car is no issue. However, in Europe, except for purpose built lines such as the Channel Tunnel or the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the loading gauge height is much smaller, and it is necessary to transport the trailers with the tires about above the rails, so the trailers cannot be simply parked on the surface of a flat car above the wagon wheels or bogie. Making the wagon wheels smaller limits the maximum speed, so many designs allow the trailer to be transported with its wheels lower than the rail wagon wheels. An early approach in France was the kangourouhttp://roadmaster-087.skyrock.com/3197907081-SNCF-Kangourou.html Piggyback transport in the 60s video in French with modified trailers. This technology did not survive, due to the market resistance to modified trailers. Today two designs for these special wagons are in commercial service, \\"Modalohr\\" and \\"Cargobeamer\\". During a rolling-highway journey, if the drivers accompany the trailer, they are accommodated in a passenger car with seats or beds. At both ends of the rail link there are purpose-built terminals that allow the train to be easily loaded and unloaded.  Examples of rolling highways  Rolling highways are mostly used for transit routes, e.g. through the Alps or from western to eastern Europe. = Austria = In Austria, rolling highways exist from Bavaria via Tyrol to Italy or to Eastern Europe. Traditionally, Austria is a transit country and therefore the rolling highway is of environmental importance. In 1999 the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) carried 254,000 trucks, which equals of load (including vehicle's weight) (158,989 trucks in 1993). The rolling highway trains in Austria are operated by √ñkombi GmbH, a division of Rail Cargo Austria, the cargo division of √ñBB. There is a direct rolling highway between Salzburg and the harbour of Trieste, Italy, where the trucks arrive on ferries from Turkey. In those cases, drivers arrive by plane via Ljubljana airport, to take over the trucks. = India = Trucks on the Konkan Railway Rolling Highway In 1999, the Konkan Railway Corporation introduced the Roll On Roll Off (RORO) service on the section between Kolad in Maharashtra and Verna in Goa, which was extended up to Surathkal in Karnataka in 2004. The RORO service, the first of its kind in India, allowed trucks to be transported on flatcars. It was highly popular, carrying about 110,000 trucks and bringing in about 740 million worth of earnings to the corporation until 2007.. These services are now being extended to other parts of India = Switzerland = In Switzerland, rolling highways across the Alps exist for both the Gotthard and L√∂tschberg - Simplon route. They are operated by RAlpin AG, headquartered in Olten.RAlpin AG On April 15, 2015, BLS cargo launched a service between Cologne and Milan capable to transport 4m articulated lorry trailers. = Italy = In 2018, 51% of the Ten-T network has been made adequate to P\\\\C 80 loading gauge, required for ERA Technical Specifications for Interoperability to conveying road trucks by train. Within 2026, 78% of the Ten-T network is going to be adequate. = France = Two rolling highways are currently in operation in France, both using French Modalohr technology: the Autoroute Ferroviaire Alpine, connecting the Savoy region to Turin through the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel owned and operated jointly by SNCF and Trenitalia, and the Lorry-Rail which connects Bettembourg, Luxembourg, to Perpignan operated by SNCF. Lorry-Rail only carries trailers, while the AFA carries accompanied and unaccompanied trailers. Since June 2012, these two are operated under the brand \\"VIIA\\" by SNCF Geodis. Plans have been announced to add two more routes in France. One was planned to link Dourges (near Lille) to Tarnos (near Bayonne) in spring 2016 and the other was an extension North from Bettembourg to Calais. Eurotunnel announced its intention to build a terminal at Folkestone to extend the Dourges-Tarnos route to the UK . However, in April 2015 the French ministry of transportation announced the cancellation of the Dourges - Tarnos route, officially due to financial concerns. = Canada = There is a service similar to rolling highways in eastern Canada, however, only the trailers of the trucks can be brought on to the train. Canadian Pacific Railway serves between Windsor, Ontario and Montreal (and further east). This corridor is normally truck serviced on the Ontario Highway 401, Quebec Autoroute 20 but this section of the highway becomes heavily congested in several areas, especially around Toronto and Montreal. With CP's service, one truck will drop off the trailer at the terminal and a different truck will pick up the trailer at the other end. This avoids truckers having to take overnight stops, and it greatly reduces costs in some situations. This service now accounts for a considerable percentage of CP's traffic in the area.

Biography  Tabouis was born in 1892, the daughter of Fernand Le Quesne (b. 1856), a noted French painter. She was first educated at the Convent of the Assumption, a fashionable Parisian convent. When she was 13 years old, the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State was passed. In her 1942 autobiography, she wrote that a few years later, the nuns were forbidden to teach students. She left the convent school and went to public high school, where she specialized in archeology and Egyptology. She studied at the Facult√© des Lettres in Paris and the School of Archeology at the Louvre. She wrote three popular books on the lives of Tutankhamen (1929), Nebuchadnezzar (1931), and Solomon (1936). Tabouis' family included French diplomats Jules Cambon (her uncle) and his brother Paul Cambon. Other relatives were senior diplomats and officials in the French military. Her autobiography does not mention her husband, , and refers only in passing to her son, who was called up into the French army in 1938, and to her daughter. She also mentions Arthur, her household servant. Tabouis moved in the highest social circles in France and England. She was invited to the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1936, referring in her autobiography to her coronation robe made by Edward Molyneux and to having her hair coiffured by one of the most popular hairdressers in London. Career In 1903, she spent several months at the French embassy in Madrid with her uncle, Paul Cambon. In 1906, she and her cousin saw the wedding of Alfonso XIII of Spain and Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg. From 1907 to 1914, she visited Berlin for a month or two each year to visit her uncle Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Berlin, meeting various German dignitaries. After World War I, she attended several sessions of the League of Nations with her uncle Jules. In 1924, she began writing articles about the League of Nations for the Le Petit Marseillais and La Petite Gironde, two large provincial newspapers. Her editor at Le Petit Marseillais told her to sign her names as \\"G. Tabouis\\" to hide her gender; La Petite Gironde told her to use only her initials. As their correspondent, she attended the signing of the Locarno Treaties in 1925. In 1932, following the death of Aristide Briand, Tabouis began writing a daily column for the Paris newspaper L'≈ìuvre in addition to reporting for La Petite Gironde and Le Petit Marseillais. In 1933, she accompanied French Prime Minister √âdouard Herriot who travelled to Moscow in an effort to forge a Soviet-French alliance against Germany. Tabouis repeatedly warned about Hitler's rise and German re-armament. For her troubles, the French writer L√©on Daudet nicknamed her \\"Madam Tata, the Clairvoyant\\" in 1933. After Germany announced that it was re-introducing compulsory military conscription rebuilding its armed forces in March, 1935, the Greek diplomat Nikolaos Politis warned her \\"You better watch out, Madame Tabouis, or they'll begin to call you Cassandra. You predict dire events, and, the worst of it is, they always happen.\\" Hitler himself attacked her writing in a May 1, 1939 speech where he sarcastically said \\"As for Madame Tabouis, that wisest of women, she knows what I am about to do even before I know it myself. She is ridiculous.\\" When Tabouis vigorously campaigned for French support for Republican Spain against Franco, La Petite Gironde (which was supported by Spanish businessman and Franco ally Juan March) dropped her as a correspondent in 1935. Le Petit Marseillais (whose director was married to a Spanish Fascist) asked her to \\"modify\\" her tone‚Äîshe left that paper as well. Tabouis became the Foreign Editor of L'≈ìuvre in 1936, where her pro-Republican stance lead to attacks by the Parisian weeklies Candide and Gringoire as well as Action Fran√ßaise. She strongly supported intervention to prevent the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, but the French chose not to intervene. Tabouis was accused of being a warmonger. On the eve of World War II, she was a regular correspondent for London's Sunday Referee in addition to her role at L'≈ìuvre. Tabouis fled France just before its surrender to Germany in 1940, having been warned that an arrest warrant was soon to be issued for her. She was forced to leave her husband, son, and daughter behind. She travelled to England and then to America. In New York, she wrote for New York's Daily Mirror and for London's Sunday Dispatch and edited the French-language Pour la victoire. After the war, she returned to Paris where she wrote for: Free France (1945‚Äì1949), Information (1949‚Äì1956) and Paris-Jour (from 1959). From 1957 to 1981, she had a radio program on Radio Luxembourg.

There is a small Jewish community in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). There is only one known synagogue, in Dubai, which has been open since 2008. The synagogue also welcomes visitors. As of 2019, according to Rabbi Marc Schneier, it is estimated that there are about 150 families to 3,000 Jews who live and worship freely in the UAE. The synagogue in Dubai is supported by the UAE, with the appointment of a Minister for Tolerance in 2016. The Ministry of Tolerance led to the creation of the National Tolerance Programme and official recognition of the Jewish community in the UAE. Early history Map of the route. A historical journey to visit far-flung Jewish communities was undertaken by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela from 1165 to 1173 that crossed and tracked some of the areas that are today in the United Arab Emirates, which had also been under the control of the Persians. His trek began as a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He may have hoped to settle there, but there is controversy about the reasons for his travels. It has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. On the other hand, he may have intended to catalogue the Jewish communities on the route to the Holy Land so as to provide a guide to where hospitality may have been found for Jews travelling to the Holy Land. He took the \\"long road\\" stopping frequently, meeting people, visiting places, describing occupations and giving a demographic count of Jews in every town and country. One of the known towns that Benjamin of Tudela reported as having a Jewish community was in a place called \\"Kis\\", located in Ras al-Khaimah, one of the seven emirates of the UAE. Modern Ras Al Khaimah covers an area of 656 square miles (1700 km¬≤) in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Modern history Since the formation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 1971, a small Jewish community grew and lived in the UAE for many years. The community includes Jews who call the United Arab Emirates home, as well as Jews who moved to the UAE because they are involved in business and commerce in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. According to Rabbi Marc Schneier, an estimate of about 150 families to 3,000 Jews live in the UAE. = Community Heads = Solly Wolf is the head and the president of the Dubai Jewish Community. Ross Kriel is the President of the JCE Rabbi Yehuda Sarna is the (non-resident) official Chief Rabbi of the United Arab Emirates. =Synagogue= There are two permanent synagogues in Dubai, the Jewish Community of the Emirates (JCE) which is led by Ross Kriel since 2013 and the Jewish Community Center (JCC) of the UAE, is led by Rabbi Levi Duchman. In 2019, the United Arab Emirates government announced the year of tolerance, officially recognizing the existence of Jews in the UAE. A Jewish benediction is also recited to the president of the UAE Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan as well a to the rest of the rulers of the UAE during Shabbat. The first synagogue in Abu Dhabi will be part of the Abrahamic Family House, an interfaith complex dedicated to the three Abrahamic religions. The complex, designed by Sir David Adjaye, is due to be completed by 2022. =Kosher food= A kosher catering company called Kosher Arabia has been established in Dubai. The company is founded by Ross Kriel, one of the Orthodox Jewish community leaders in the UAE. The company plans to serve to all gulf states. A kosher restaurant is planned to be open in the United Arab Emirates as well and Kosher food is also expected to soon be a feature on Gulf airlines. Supply of 1,000 kosher chickens per week is provided to the community by local Kosher Shechita. In May 2020, it was reported that the JCC of UAE has imported the largest meat shipment in history of the community. = Talmud Torah School = A new Talmud Torah was reported in 2020 to have been recently established and now has around 40 pupils. Attitudes toward Jews =Prior to 2010= A Jewish Telegraphic Agency report in 1999 stated that: \\"A British university has banned Jewish authors from its courses at its campus in the United Arab Emirates. The University of Lincolnshire and Humberside has confirmed that books by Jews, as well as those that mention Jews in their bibliographies, are banned by its affiliate in the Persian Gulf state. In addition, the British Council, a state-run organization designed to promote British cultural achievements abroad, also conceded that it acquiesces in the censorship of works by Jews to accommodate \\"local political, religious or moral publishing laws.\\" In July 2000, the Harvard Divinity School accepted $2.5 million from the founder of the United Arab Emirates, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. In 2002, the Zayed Center published a report on the Holocaust that said Zionists - not Nazis - \\"were the people who killed the Jews in Europe.\\" This led to an uproar that the money be returned and that the center be closed. In August, the UAE government closed the Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-up, which is a think tank that published and distributed literature, sponsored lectures, and operated a website. The center published some books with themes such as \\"The Zionist Movement and its Animosity to Jews,\\" and \\"Al Buraq Wall, Not Wailing Wall\\" [...] According to a statement from President Zayed's office, the Government closed the center because its activities \\"starkly contradicted the principles of interfaith tolerance advocated by the president.\\" In 2007, there were \\"some anti-Semitic or religiously intolerant editorials, op-eds and editorial cartoons in the English and Arabic-language electronic and print media. The Arabic-language press, including government subsidized and quasi- governmental newspapers such as Al-Ittihad, Al-Bayan, and Al-Khaleej, carried editorial cartoons depicting negative images of Jews; Al-Bayan carried religiously intolerant articles as well.\\" As an example, they cite Al-Ittihad, which \\"carried a cartoon of \\"the Zionist Lobby\\" who was depicted as a stereotypical Jew with a hooked nose and wearing a yarmulke;\\" an op-ed from Al-Bayan in 2006, which poses the question as to whether Zionists were a \\"part of humanity\\" and compared Israelis to Nazis; and a cartoon in Al-Ittihad, \\"in which a stereotypically depicted Jew was standing astride the globe, a reference to the long-standing anti-Semitic conspiracy that Jews control the world.\\" All of the examples stated were described by the U.S. State Department as antisemitic. =After 2010= In February 2019 and as part of the United Arab Emirates's national tolerance program, the Ministry of Tolerance officially recognized the UAE's local Jewish population and, according to Rabbi Marc Schneier, were in talks of establishing a proper synagogue, kosher foods and even a mikveh. Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the chief Rabbi of Poland, during a visit to Abu Dhabi said \\"There were Jews in Bahrain, Yemen, Egypt and across North Africa, but this corner they didn‚Äôt get to...the fact the newest Jewish community is in an Arab country is a tremendous statement.\\" The Rabbi attended the Global Conference of Human Fraternity alongside Pope Francis in Abu Dhabi, he clarified ‚ÄúThere is a wrong stereotype that we use that says different religions can‚Äôt speak to each other ‚Äì that a Jew can‚Äôt talk to a Muslim‚Äù. According to the Rabbi, Pope Francis visit to the UAE depicts the presence of all religions coexisting together and confronting a stereotype. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hopeful, naively perhaps, that this could be another step to break that. It is also helpful that it is in the UAE to break that stereotype.‚Äù In August/September 2020 the last 100 Jews of Yemen are in the process of Immigrating from Yemen to U.A.E.The LAst Jews of Yemen September 5,2020 Aish.com Israeli-Emirati relations Ties between Israel and the UAE have been slowly warming.

According to USA Today (2010 article), Arab states are increasing relations with Israel and American Jews in an effort to undercut Iran's growing influence, contain violence in Iraq and Lebanon and push for a Palestinian solution. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said Israeli-Palestinian peace deal would weaken militants such as Hamas and Hezbollah. According to the article, Arab states' contacts with Israelis and American Jews go back more than a decade but have never been public. Since 2017, the UAE together with its allies of the Gulf Cooperation Council formed stronger coordination ties with Israel, in their mutual standoff against the Islamic Republic of Iran. On August 13, 2020, Israel and the UAE announced the initiation of normalization of relations between the two countries, starting with a meeting to sign bilateral agreements in areas including energy, tourism, direct flights, investment, security, communication and technology over the coming weeks.

In Roman times it was named Colonia Ulpia Traiana Ratiaria. It is located 2 km west of the present village of Archar in Vidin Province, northwestern Bulgaria. The closest modern cities are Vidin (27 km. to the north west) and Lom (28 km. to the east). An archaeological museum for the site has recently been established in Dimovo.http://www.ratiaria.archbg.net/index_en.html  History  Governor's residence, Ratiaria Ratiaria was conquered by the Dacians of Burebista and later by the Romans. The city had a gold mine in the vicinity, which was exploited by the Thracians. The earliest involvement of the Romans occurred in 75 BC when Gaius Scribonius Curio, prefect of Macedonia, entered this territory to ward off the Scordisci, the Dardani and the Daci. In 29 BC, Marcus Licinius Crassus chased the Triballi here to a fortress.Cassius Dio, LI 23, 2-27 It was not until the principate of Augustus that the Romans conquered the region, which was organised into a province named Moesia. In 33/34 AD Tiberius built the road linking the Danube forts including Viminacium and Ratiaria. The city was certainly less important than the nearby Sirmium, Viminacium and Naissus, but its associated fortress located along the Danubian Limes made it a key legionary station. Legio IV Flavia Felix was based here at least until the conquest of Dacia (101-106 AD), together with the fleet of the Classis Moesica under Vespasian. After the conquest of Dacia, the castrum was abandoned and the settlement became a colonia within Moesia Superior named Colonia Ulpia Traiana Ratiaria (107 AD) after its founder the Emperor Trajan. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries Ratiaria became prosperous as a trade centre and customs port. A number of Roman patricians (aristocrats) lived in Ratiaria, while the nearby Bononia (today's Vidin) was home to a small military unit. With the definitive abandonment of Dacia Traiana by Aurelian in 271, the old castra in the region were reopened. It is unclear whether Aurelian or the Emperor Diocletian replaced Dacia Aureliana with two provinces,Bury, p. 135. The date must be A.D. 283, and it is obvious that Aurelian set up the boundary stones, one of which Gaianus restored. There were, then, two Dacias when Diocletian came to the throne and, therefore, Mr. Fillow has inferred that we should read in our List: Dacia , that is presumably Dacia Ripensis and Dacia Mediterranea. Aurelian's Dacia mediterranea might have included Dardania, and Dardania, Mr. Fillow thinks, was split off as a distinct province by Diocletian. but by 285, there were two: ‚Äì Dacia Mediterranea with its capital at Serdica and Dacia Ripensis with its capital at Ratiaria. As the capital of the new province Ratiaria served both as the seat of the military governor (or dux) and as the military base for the Roman legion XIII Gemina. Later these two ‚ÄúDacias‚Äù along with Dardania, Moesia Inferior and Praevalitana constituted the Diocese of Dacia. An important bishop's cathedra was established in the town in the 4th century AD. The city became an important Christian centre in the 4th century and several bishops are recorded. Palladius of Ratiaria, an Arian Christian theologian, lived here in the late 4th century. Rebuilding works were done under Anastasius I, celebrated in the new town's name, Anastasiana Ratiaria. Priscus calls it a prosperous city in the 5th century.Kazhdan 1991, \\"Priskos\\" In AD 586 the town was sacked by the Avars. Archaeological excavations of the site began in 1958 and have continued sporadically since then.

It serves the Needham Line. It is located on Junction Street near Chestnut Street in the southwestern part of Needham. It opened in 1906 when the New Haven Railroad built the Needham Cutoff to connect the Charles River Railroad to its main line. The station is fully accessible. History =Charles River Railroad= On June 1, 1853, the Charles River Branch Railroad was extended from Newton Upper Falls into Needham as the first stage of a line to Dover and beyond. The railroad was not able to follow its original plan to go through the East Village, Needham's historical center, because one landowner refused to sell; instead, it was routed to Great Plain station in Great Plain Village further to the east. The line was extended to Medway on November 18, 1861 and to Woonsocket on November 16, 1863. =Needham Cutoff= 1910 photo of Needham Junction station The 1906-built station building, now an ice cream shop, in March 2016 The New Haven Railroad opened its Needham Cutoff from West Roxbury to Needham Junction on November 4, 1906, allowing trains from the former Charles River Branch Railroad to reach Boston without needing to use the rival Boston and Albany Railroad's Highland Branch. A wye was constructed at Needham Junction, allowing trains from Needham to use the cutoff as well. West Street station opened with the cutoff on November 4, 1906; it is positioned east of the junction, so as to only serve trains running on the cutoff. No station had previously been located in the area. A large granolithic platform with a canopy over much of its length was completed in 1911, by which point it was known as Needham Junction. Loop service jointly run by the B&A; and the New Haven operated over the Cutoff and the Highland Branch via Needham from 1911 to 1914; after that, most Needham trains originated at Needham Heights. Service between Newton Highlands and Newton Upper Falls ended in 1927, and between Needham Heights and Newton Upper Falls in 1932, leaving Needham Heights as the terminus of the line. The West Medway Branch shared the line from Forest Hills to Needham Junction until 1938 and from 1940 to 1955; from 1955 to 1967 the line operated as a shuttle from West Medway (Millis after 1966) to Needham Junction. =MBTA era= The station was closed with the rest of the line from October 13, 1979 to October 19, 1987 during Southwest Corridor construction. A mini-high platform was added during the closure, making Needham Junction fully handicapped accessible. The original station building is now an ice cream parlor; MBTA tickets are sold as well. Since April 1981, MBTA bus route has terminated in a loop at the west end of the station parking lot.

Supporters of Kibaki's opponent, Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement, alleged electoral manipulation. This was widely confirmed by international observers, as being perpetrated by both parties in the election. In part due to the ethnic and geographic diversity of Kenyan politics, no singular narrative can explain the reaction of opposition supporters to the announcement of Kibaki's swearing-in, which was done on December 30, 2007 in the evening. In addition to staging several non-violent protests, opposition supporters went on a violent rampage killing Kikuyus. Raila Odinga encouraged supporters to engage in mass protests which he announced on local television and radio stations, most noticeably in Mombasa, Eldoret, Kericho, Kisumu, Nakuru and parts of Nairobi. Police shot hundreds of violent demonstrators, including a few in front of TV news cameras, causing more violence to erupt. Targeted ethnic violence (as opposed to violent protests) escalated and at first was directed mainly against Kikuyu people‚Äîthe community of which Kibaki is a member‚Äîliving outside their traditional settlement areas, especially in the Rift Valley Province.Samir Elhawary (2008) Crisis in Kenya: land, displacement and the search for 'durable solutions' Overseas Development Institute The violence started with the murder of over 50 unarmed Kikuyu women and children, some as young as a month old, by locking them in a church and burning them alive in Kiambaa village in the outskirts of Eldoret Town, on New Year's Day. Tensions in the Rift Valley have caused violence in several previous Kenyan elections, most notably in the 1992 Kenyan Elections. This prompted the Kikuyu to start defending themselves which forced the Luos and Kalenjins to stop the killings of the Kikuyus. In Mombasa, the Kenyan coastal residents took to the streets to protest the electoral manipulations and support their preferred candidate, Odinga. Tensions rose as the landless indigenous Coastal communities felt this was a time to avenge the grabbing of their land by mainly up‚Äìcountry Kikuyu. Looters also struck a number of stores in Mombasa. The slums of Nairobi saw some of the worst violence, some of it ethnically motivated, some expression of outrage at extreme poverty, and some the actions of criminal gangs. The violence continued sporadically for several months, particularly in the Rift Valley. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in the country about a month after the election and successfully brought the two sides to the negotiating table. On February 28, 2008, Kibaki and Odinga signed a power- sharing agreement called the National Accord and Reconciliation Act 2008, which established the office of the Prime Minister and created a coalition government. The power-sharing Cabinet, headed by Odinga as Prime Minister, was eventually named on April 13, after lengthy negotiations over its composition;\\"Kenya unveils 40-seat cabinet\\" , Al Jazeera, April 13, 2008. it was sworn in on April 17.\\"Odinga sworn in as Kenya PM\\" , Al Jazeera, April 17, 2008. Background Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga speaks with Kenyan media The post-election demonstration and violence stemmed from a mixture of motives. Some included: *Voting in elections has widely been along ethnic lines in many Kenyan communities *Widespread perception that the count of the presidential election was modified in favour of Kibaki *During colonial times Kikuyu people were displaced from their fertile highlands and after independence they were settled outside their traditional areas especially in the Rift Valley, where the ethnic Maasai people had populated originally before Kenya's colonization by the British. *A belief among other tribes that the Kikuyu community in Kenya has dominated the country since independence\\"Information Bulletin; Kenya: Ethnic Clashes\\", Kenyan Red Cross Society, July 25, 2007. Reports by international observers about manipulations and admissions by members of the Electoral Commission of Kenya that their staff provided them with incorrect figures have further fuelled this anger. The violence has been directed mainly against Kikuyus, belonging to the same ethnic group as Kibaki. The violence against Kikuyus occurred all over the country but was higher in areas like the Nairobi slums, Nyanza Province, the Rift Valley, and the Coast, where opposition against Kibaki was particularly strong. The ethnically diverse Nairobi slums have also seen violence by Kikuyu-dominated groups‚Äîamongst them the infamous Mungiki‚Äîagainst neighbours hailing from western parts of Kenya.

Please note that the area size on the map does not indicate population density: the provinces to the East and North East are generally low population density provinces. A BBC reporter saw 40 bodies with gunshot wounds in a mortuary in Kisumu, which was the opposition's main base. A witness also told them that armed police shot protesters at a rally. There were running battles in the Nairobi slums. The local KTN television station said that 124 people died nationwide in the first two days of unrest. On December 31, 2007, police reported that 40 people were killed in Nairobi and 53 in Kisumu, a major support base for Odinga. Four bodies were discovered in Mathare, in Nairobi, seven people were killed in Nakuru, and four people found dead in a village near Kapsabet.\\"Election riots worsen in Kenya\\" , Al Jazeera, December 31, 2007. =Disputed results= Early results tallied indicated that Odinga held a strong lead on December 28, the day after the election, and the ODM declared victory for Odinga on December 29;\\"Kenya opposition declares victory\\", AFP (IOL), December 29, 2007. however, as more results were announced on the same day, the gap between the two candidates narrowed, and with almost 90% of the votes counted (180 out of 210 constituencies), Odinga's lead shrank to only 38,000 votes.\\"Kenya election results expected today\\", SABC News, December 30, 2007. At a press conference on the morning of December 30, Odinga accused the government of fraud, urged Kibaki to concede defeat, and called for a recount. He said that the ODM would not take the matter to the courts claiming that the courts were controlled by Kibaki.Stephen Ndegwa, \\"Kenya: Raila Calls for Vote Recount\\" , The East African Standard (allAfrica.com), December 30, 2007. The Electoral Commission declared Kibaki the winner on December 30, placing him ahead of Odinga by about 232,000 votes.Barney Jopson, \\"Kenyan police try to block opposition rally\\" , Reuters (Financial Times), January 3, 2008. According to Odinga, as many as 300,000 votes for Kibaki were falsely included in his total. The Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Samuel Kivuitu, said that while irregularities affecting the entire exercise did occur, they were a matter for the courts, not the Electoral Commission.Jeffrey Gettleman, \\"Tribal violence breaks out in Kenya over disputed election result\\" , International Herald Tribune, December 30, 2007. Supporters of Kibaki, meanwhile, said that discrepancies had actually worked in Odinga's favor, arguing that discrepancies between polling station tallies and Electoral Commission results meant that Odinga had gained 53,000 votes while Kibaki had lost 106,000. Following the Commission's declaration of his victory, Kibaki was promptly sworn in for his second term late in the evening on the same day, calling for the \\"verdict of the people\\" to be respected and for \\"healing and reconciliation\\" to begin. Kivuitu said that there were some problems in the vote counting, noting that in one constituency the reported turnout rate was 115%. According to the European Union's head observer in the election, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, the election was \\"flawed\\" and the Electoral Commission failed to establish \\"the credibility of the tallying process to the satisfaction of all parties and candidates\\";\\"Kibaki re-elected as president of Kenya\\" , Reuters (Financial Times), December 30, 2008. he said that in some places EU observers were not allowed to see vote tallies until the Electoral Commission announced them: \\"the whole point...is to verify that the results are the same\\". The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, said that his country had \\"real concerns\\" about the election. While the United States initially congratulated Kibaki and called for the results to be respected, it also expressed concern, and on January 2, 2008 a spokesman for the U.S. State Department declined to confirm U.S. recognition of Kibaki's victory.David Gollust, \\"US in Diplomatic Push to End Kenya Violence\\" , VOA News, January 2, 2007. In a telex from then US Embassy in Nairobi to the State Department in Washington DC [released in July 2012], US Ambassador Michael Ranneberger set out five scenarios as to who really won the election. He wrote, ‚ÄòIn all cases the margin of victory for either side is slim and ultimately unknowable‚Äô. The telex also noted that there was ‚Äòevidence of rigging on both sides‚Äô and Kivuitu said on January 2, that he had been pressured by PNU and ODM-K (Kibaki's and Kalonzo Musyoka's parties) into announcing the results without delay, and he claimed that he did not personally know who really won. Within minutes of the Commission's declaration of Kibaki as victor, tribe-based rioting and violence, primarily directed against Kikuyus, broke out across Kenya, and the government suspended live television coverage for some days.The Nation, \\"Kenya: Violence Erupts After Kibaki Sworn in\\" , The Nation (allafrica.com), December 30, 2007.The Nation, \\"Kenya: Death and Chaos After Kibaki Win\\" , The Nation (allafrica.com), December 31, 2007. Odinga alleged that \\"a clique of people around Kibaki\\" sought to rig the election, but said that democracy \\"is unstoppable like the flow of the Nile\\". The ODM announced its intention to hold a ceremony on December 31, in which Odinga would be declared the \\"people's president\\", but police said that this could incite violence and that Odinga could be arrested if the ceremony occurred. Odinga then delayed this, but called for a million- strong rally on January 3, 2008 and for his supporters to wear black armbands as a show of mourning. Odinga said that the ODM would not negotiate with Kibaki unless he resigned, because to do so would, according to Odinga, mean acknowledging Kibaki's legitimacy; he also said that, unless stopped, the \\"ruling clique\\" could rig the next election in five years as well, and that he was not afraid of being arrested, having been jailed many times in the past.\\"Raila‚Äôs terms for talks with Kibaki on crisis\\", Daily Nation (Kenya), January 1, 2008. For his part, Kibaki emphasized the importance of peace, stability, and tolerance in his 2008 New Year's message, speaking of the election as a concluded event and warning that law-breakers would be punished.Fred Mukinda and Samwel Kumba, \\"Kibaki warns law breakers of stern action\\", Daily Nation (Kenya), January 1, 2008. =Rallies= Orange Democratic Movement supporters at a rally during the 2007‚Äì08 Kenyan crisis Odinga said that the million-strong rally in his support planned for January 3 would take place in spite of a government ban, and he accused the government of being directly responsible for \\"genocide\\". Electoral Commission Chairman Kivuitu said on January 1, that he had been pressured by the PNU and ODM-Kenya to announce results immediately, despite the urgings of Western ambassadors to delay the results so that concerns about irregularities could be addressed. On January 3, opposition supporters attempted to gather for the planned rally in Uhuru Park, but police fought them off with tear gas and water cannons. Another attempt to hold the rally was planned for January 4. Also on January 3, Kibaki said that he was willing to engage in dialogue \\"once the country is calm\\", and he described the continuing violence as \\"senseless\\", while Attorney General Amos Wako called for a recount, an investigation into the election, and the formation of a national unity government, saying that the situation was \\"quickly degenerating into a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions\\". Finance Minister Amos Kimunya said that if the ODM did not allege fraud, that would make it easier for the two sides to talk; Kimunya also said that the government wanted to mediate through Kenyan elders and did not want international mediation involving the African Union. KANU's Uhuru Kenyatta said that it might be possible for the two sides to work together, but that the ODM's position that Kibaki should resign before any talks took place was unacceptable, because then there would be \\"no government\\". On January 4, ODM Secretary-General Anyang Nyongo called for a new presidential election to be held,\\"Kenya opposition demands new vote\\" , Associated Press (Globe and Mail, Canada), January 4, 2008. without the involvement of the Electoral Commission. Government spokesman Alfred Mutua said that this would be possible only if it was decided by the courts. After meeting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer, Kibaki said on January 5, that he was willing to form a national unity government, but Odinga, who also met with Frazer, rejected this, saying that Kibaki \\"should not come to the negotiating table as the president\\" and calling for the creation of a transitional government leading to a new election in three to six months.C Bryson Hull and Barry Moody, \\"Opposition brushes aside Kibaki offer\\" , Reuters (IOL), January 5, 2008. However, after Odinga met with Frazer for a second time shortly afterward, Odinga's spokesman said that the ODM would not demand that Kibaki resign or admit defeat if he accepted an international mediator. At about the same time, while violence continued, it was reported to be decreasing in Nairobi. =Kufuor mediation= On January 6, Odinga called for rallies to be held on January 8, despite the government's insistence that the rallies would be illegal. Odinga's spokesman said that while the ODM ruled out a government of national unity, it could discuss \\"a coalition government with genuine power sharing\\" (which it said would leave less power for Kibaki than would be the case in a national unity government) or establishing an interim government to hold a new election.\\"Kenyan opposition leader willing to discuss power sharing, calls mass rallies\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), January 6, 2008. Odinga subsequently cancelled the rallies planned for January 8,Lucas Barasa and Rachel Ombaka, \\"End of turmoil in sight as AU boss jets in\\", Daily Nation, January 8, 2008. saying that the mediation process, facilitated by Ghanaian President and African Union Chairman John Kufuor, was about to begin, with Kibaki having officially invited Kufuor, and that negotiations needed to take place in a peaceful atmosphere. Odinga said that he anticipated direct talks involving both himself and Kibaki, with Kufuor's participation. Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said that by calling off the rallies, Odinga opened the way for negotiation and reconciliation.\\"Kenya leaders agree to talk\\" , Al Jazeera, January 7, 2008. There exist doubts that Kibaki really invited Kufuor (as opposed to him having come as a result of international concern for the worsening situation in Kenya). PNU members of parliament, newly appointed cabinet ministers and even the government spokesman, Dr Alfred Mutua, are known to have said Kufuor \\"was coming to take tea\\", and not to \\"negotiate with the warring factions regarding the elections\\"; this was captured both on TV and print media. In addition, the PNU side was actively downplaying the seriousness of the post-election crisis, saying that this was a local problem that would be dealt with locally. It even urged the displaced people at various police stations and camps to 'return home' and generally tried to dissuade international attention to the crisis. It is also worth noting that there were conflicting reports from Ghanaian weblogs about President Kufuor's visit. Some weblogs said he was not going to travel to Kenya, since the government did not view him as a welcome visitor, others saying he was required by his official responsibility as AU chairman to try to resolve the crisis in Kenya. Just before Kufuor's travel to Kenya, Moses Wetang'ula, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs travelled to Ghana to 'brief Mr. Kufuor' on the situation in Kenya, ahead of his trip to Kenya. These actions were perceived to be an indication of bad faith on the part of Kibaki and his team, and they preempted their bias against the talks between President Kibaki (and his PNU side) and Raila (and his ODM side). There were also indications that PNU did not want the discussion to be mediated by an outsider. Odinga refused to accept Kibaki's offer to hold talks unless they took place as part of international mediation, saying that without having Kufuor present to mediate the talks would be a \\"sideshow\\" and a \\"public relations gimmick\\", and he claimed that Kibaki was using the offer of talks between himself and Odinga to divert attention from Kufuor.Nicolo Gnecchi, \\"Kenya's Odinga rejects bilateral talks with government\\", Reuters (swissinfo), January 8, 2008. Meanwhile, Frazer said on January 7, that there had been rigging in the election, but she said that both sides could have engaged in rigging. She also previously said that Kenyans had \\"been cheated by their political leadership and their institutions\\". Kibaki appointed 17 ministers as part of a new Cabinet on January 8, saying that the rest of the Cabinet would be appointed later. The Cabinet included the ODM-K's Kalonzo Musyoka as Vice- President and Minister of Home Affairs and KANU's Uhuru Kenyatta as Minister of Local Government.\\"Kenya: Kibaki Names Cabinet\\" , The East African Standard (allAfrica.com), January 8, 2008. Announcing these appointments, Kibaki said: \\"I have considered the importance of keeping the country united, peaceful and prosperous and a strong broad-based leadership.\\" The ODM's Nyongo said that this Cabinet, in which the ODM was not included, was illegitimate because Kibaki did not win the election. Renewed outbreaks of violence were reported following Kibaki's announcement. With almost half of the Cabinet yet to be named, it was suggested that Kibaki intended to leave the remaining ministries open so that they would be available for the ODM following the negotiations; however, it was also noted that the most important ministries were already filled. Musalia Mudavadi, a leading figure in the ODM, denounced Kibaki's announcement as being intended only to sabotage mediation with Kufuor.\\"Kalonzo VP in Kibaki‚Äôs new Cabinet\\" , The Standard (Kenya), January 9, 2008. The Daily Nation said that Kibaki's move would \\"be seen as a sign of bad faith\\" and that it could \\"poison the atmosphere\\". U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that it appeared Kibaki was setting up a fait accompli, that the U.S. was \\"disappointed\\" by the move, and that it had \\"expressed its displeasure\\".Wangui Kanina and Duncan Miriri, \\"African Union head meets Kenya's feuding parties\\", Reuters (swissinfo), January 9, 2008. =Annan mediation= On January 9, Kufuor met separately with Kibaki and Odinga. Government statements on that day emphasized Kibaki's commitment to dialogue and said that he had \\"already initiated a process of dialogue with other Kenyan leaders\\". Kibaki also gave a speech in which he said that the vote was concluded, that it was impossible to change the outcome, and that any complaints should be handled through the courts. The two sides agreed to \\"an immediate cessation of violence as well as any acts which may be detrimental to finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing crisis\\", but the talks otherwise failed when, according to Nyongo, Kibaki refused to sign an agreement (which was already signed by ODM representatives) presented to him by Kufuor that would have provided for an interim coalition government and an inquiry into the Electoral Commission; the government, however, blamed Odinga for the failure of the talks, saying that he was not responsive to Kibaki's offer of dialogue. Kufuor left Kenya on January 10, saying that both parties had agreed to continue talks together with former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and \\"a panel of eminent African personalities\\"; Annan's office subsequently said that he would lead future talks but that he was not likely to go to Kenya before January 15,. Kibaki's new Cabinet ministers were sworn in on January 10,. On January 11, the ODM called for mass rallies to be held in about 30 places in the following week; the police said that the rallies were banned. Nyongo also called for international sanctions against Kibaki's government. On January 12, the EU said that there could not be \\"business as usual in Kenya\\" without a compromise and a solution to the dispute, and Frazer also said that the US could not conduct \\"business as usual in Kenya\\" under the circumstances, saying that Kibaki and Odinga should meet in person, \\"without preconditions\\", and that both sides \\"should acknowledge serious irregularities in the vote tallying which made it impossible to determine with certainty the final result\\". In addition, she called for the lifting of the bans on live television coverage and rallies. Roads and Public Works Minister John Michuki said on January 14, that Annan was not coming at the government's invitation and reiterated the claim that Kibaki won the election. EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel said on the same day that EU aid to Kenya could be reduced as a result of the election. Parliament opened on January 15, and Annan was expected to arrive on the same day. ODM Members of Parliament said that they intended to sit on the government side in Parliament, asserting their claim to have won the election. They took the opposition side, however, with Odinga taking the Leader of the Opposition's seat. Although the ODM wanted an open ballot instead of a secret one in the election for the Speaker of Parliament, the government side opposed this and the vote was conducted through secret ballot. In the first round of voting, the ODM's candidate for Speaker, Kenneth Marende, received 104 votes and the government's candidate, Francis ole Kaparo, received 99 votes; in the second round Marende received 104 votes and Kaparo received 102. Although a two-thirds majority was required in the first two rounds, subsequently only a simple majority was required, and Marende was elected in the third round with 105 votes against 101 for Kaparo. Meanwhile, it was announced that Annan's visit would be delayed for a few days because he had fallen ill with the flu. In Nairobi threats and killings were carried out against the Asian and white Kenyan minorities by the banned ethnic sect Mungiki, which prompted a temporary exodus of the minority groups, until their protection was guaranteed by the government, prompting further economic hardship in the country. The ODM's planned protests, intended to last for three days, began on January 16,. Police met the protests with force and prevented them from reaching Uhuru Park in Nairobi; protests also took place in other parts of the country, including Kisumu and Eldoret. At least two people were reported killed in Kisumu as police used live ammunition against the protesters, along with tear gas. Odinga, in an interview with BBC's HARDtalk, responded to Justice Minister Martha Karua's earlier claim that the ODM had planned \\"ethnic cleansing\\" by saying that her accusation was \\"outrageous\\" and that the violence perpetrated by his supporters was a reaction to the actions of the police, who he said had been ordered to shoot \\"members of certain ethnic communities\\". The protests continued on January 17, with police continuing to use force against them. Government spokesman Alfred Mutua said that the government would not be swayed by the threats of development partners to withdraw aid. A train was looted in Kibera by residents due to shortages caused by the crisis. Odinga alleged that police killed seven people in Nairobi, while the police spokesman, Eric Kiraithe, said that the police were acting lawfully and were showing restraint because the protesters were being \\"used by politicians\\". The ODM said that after the last day of protest on January 18, it would focus on boycotting companies controlled by Kibaki's allies. By January 18, at least 22 people were reported to have been killed in the three-day protests, with the last day seeing the most deaths. The protests were considered to be substantially diminished in strength compared to those in late December. On January 19, despite the ODM's earlier announcement that it would cease protests, it said that protests would resume on January 24. =Boycott and further violence= Police cordon off Uhuru Park to bar opposition from holding a mass protest rally Further violence in Nairobi and the Rift Valley followed the protests. On January 21, Minister of State for Internal Security George Saitoti warned against further protests, saying that they would only be \\"an opportunity for criminals to loot and commit other crimes\\" and that \\"illegal acts will be dealt with accordingly\\".Andrew Cawthorne and Wangui Kanina, \\"Kenya government turns on critics\\", Reuters (swissinfo), January 21, 2008. The government also said in reference to the opposition's planned boycott that it was illegal to \\"sabotage\\" businesses. The businesses targeted for the boycott included Equity Bank, Brookside Dairies, CityHoppa, and Kenya Bus; it was speculated that the boycott would not have a substantial impact and that many Kenyans would find it too impractical to observe. Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula, in reaction to criticism from the United Kingdom, summoned the UK's High Commissioner to complain, and he said that \\"our elections don't need a stamp of authority from the House of Commons\\".\\"Kenya opposition in boycott plan\\" , Al Jazeera, January 21, 2008. Annan arrived in Kenya on January 22,.\\"Annan calls for fresh talks in Kenya\\", Reuters (IOL), January 22, 2008. Archived copy at WebCite (February 1, 2010). On January 23, the ODM held a memorial service in Nairobi for victims of the violence, at which Odinga said that tribes should not fight because \\"this is a war between the people of Kenya and a very small bloodthirsty clique clinging to power\\". Meanwhile, police fired tear gas at some of his supporters outside; some tear gas affected the mourning service, dispersing it. The state-owned telecommunications building was attacked and set on fire. On the same day, Kibaki and Odinga met separately with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, and according to Museveni's press secretary an agreement was reached in principle to establish a judicial commission that would investigate the accusations of vote rigging; however, the two sides disagreed as to whether the government alone should appoint the members of the commission. Museveni was also said to have proposed a power-sharing deal, which was rejected by the government on the grounds that it was unwilling to share power with the ODM due to the latter's alleged responsibility for the killing of innocent people.\\"Kenya: Museveni Proposes Power Sharing Deal to Raila, Kibaki\\" , The Monitor (allAfrica.com), January 24, 2008. Annan also met with Odinga, and the latter agreed to cancel the protests that were to have been held the next day.\\"Rival Kenyan leaders hold talks\\" , Al Jazeera, January 24, 2008. =Beginning of talks, killing of MPs= Kibaki and Odinga met for the first time since the crisis began on January 24, together with Annan. Annan called the meeting \\"very encouraging\\", saying that it represented \\"the first steps towards a peaceful solution of the problem\\". Kibaki and Odinga both said after the meeting that they were working towards a solution and urged the people to be peaceful. On January 25, Odinga said in an interview that a power-sharing deal was out of the question, and that the only possibilities acceptable to him were that Kibaki resign or that a new election be held. Responding to a claim by Human Rights Watch that ODM leaders were orchestrating violence, he said that the people were reacting spontaneously. As violence continued in the Rift Valley, Annan asked both sides to designate negotiators by January 29,.\\"Annan presses Kenyan rivals to end bloodshed\\", Reuters (swissinfo.ch), January 28, 2008. Meanwhile, serious violence broke out in Nakuru on January 24‚Äì25, apparently as a reaction to Kibaki describing himself as the \\"duly elected president\\" after meeting in person with Odinga. Kikuyus were attacked and a number of buildings were set on fire, along with Nakuru's only fire engine; at least 12 deaths were reported. Another town, Total Station, was half-destroyed in violence between Kikuyus and Kalenjin, with at least two deaths reported, and as many as 50,000 people fled from violence near Molo. By January 27, at least 55 people had been killed in Nakuru, along with at least five in Kaptembwa and Sewage, two slums near Nakuru, while at least nine deaths were reported in Naivasha, where Kikuyus set Luo homes on fire. By January 28, at least 64 people had been killed in Nakuru and at least 22 in Naivasha; 19 of the deaths in Naivasha occurred when Kikuyus set fire to a place where Luos had fled for safety. ODM chairperson Henry Kosgei accused the government of facilitating the killing in Nakuru by imposing a curfew, which he said was used \\"to keep some groups indoors to be killed\\", on January 28,.\\"Kibaki facing genocide claims\\", AFP (News24), January 28, 2008. Mugabe Were, an ODM Member of Parliament, was shot and killed early on January 29, 2008. Renewed protests and violence followed his death. Addressing the National Assembly before beginning talks, Annan called for an end to the \\"downward spiral into chaos that is threatening this beautiful country.\\" The talks then began, although they were delayed by 90 minutes due to disputed seating arrangements. Annan said that resolution of short-term issues might occur in four weeks, although he thought deeper talks might continue for a year. Another ODM MP, David Kimutai Too, was shot and killed by a policeman in Eldoret on January 31, 2008.\\"Kenya talks suspended after shooting\\", AFP (IOL), January 31, 2008. Archived copy at WebCite (February 1, 2010). Police said the killing was related to a love triangle involving him, the officer who shot him, and a female officer, but the ODM called it an assassination, accusing the government of seeking to reduce the number of ODM Members of Parliament, and protests and violence broke out. The talks were postponed until the next day due to the killing. =Continued negotiations, signing of power-sharing agreement= ODM supporters at a political rally during the crisis UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon arrived in Kenya for a visit to assist the talks on February 1.\\"UN chief backs Kenya talks\\" , Al Jazeera, February 1, 2008. During the same day, Annan announced that the two rival leaders had agreed on an agenda for peace talks, which included both short-term and long-term goals. The talks would last a month and would include the topics of ending the violence, the humanitarian situation, resolving the political crisis, and land and historical injustices. Annan said that he believed the first three of these four points could be resolved within seven to 15 days, and he said that an agreement had been reached on 18 measures to end the violence, including the demobilization of gangs and ceasing speeches and text messages that incite hatred and violence. Violence nevertheless continued; on the next day at least 20 people were reported to have been killed since the agreement. On February 3, Odinga called for African Union peacekeepers to be sent to Kenya.\\"Odinga urges peacekeepers for Kenya\\" , Al Jazeera, February 3, 2008. South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa was unanimously chosen by Annan's team as chief mediator to lead long-term talks,\\"Kenya rejects S African mediator\\" , Al Jazeera, February 4, 2008. but the government had concerns about Ramaphosa's involvement, saying that he and Odinga had business links. Ramaphosa consequently withdrew from the talks and Annan accepted his withdrawal on February 4,. Odinga said on the same day that the ODM would withdraw from the talks if a deal was not reached, and he said that his party wanted a new presidential election to be held within three months, with a new electoral commission and the same voter register. The alternative possibility of a transitional coalition government, in which a new position of Prime Minister would be created for Odinga and Kibaki's power would be reduced, was something Odinga said he could consider, although it was not the option he preferred.Fiana Forde, \\"Withdrawal threat to peace talks\\", Daily News (South Africa), February 5, 2008, page 5. Archived copy at WebCite (February 1, 2010). Opposing plans for a meeting of foreign ministers from the countries of the East African Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in Kenya, Nyongo said that the ODM would hold protests if the meeting went ahead, believing that the meeting would be a means to legitimize Kibaki's government. Annan was critical of this threat, saying that \\"provocative statements outside negotiations\\" were supposed to be avoided.\\"Kenya opposition threatens protests\\" , Al Jazeera, February 5, 2008. The government subsequently said that the meeting would not officially be considered an IGAD meeting, and the ODM called off the protests on February 6,.\\"East African statesmen converge in Kenya\\", AFP (IOL), February 7, 2008. Archived copy at WebCite (February 1, 2010). On February 7, the two sides remained deeply divided in talks, although they agreed that there should not be a recount of votes. Annan said that he was \\"totally opposed to a re-election in this climate\\", referring to the persistent violence. Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council called for peaceful resolution of the dispute through negotiations, the United States imposed a travel ban on ten unnamed Kenyans (a move that was praised by Kibaki's government), and a policeman, Edward Kirui, was arrested for allegedly shooting two protesters to death in Kisumu on January 16,. Progress in the talks was reported on February 8, with Annan saying that both sides had agreed on the need for a political settlement\\"Kenya parties see progress\\" , Al Jazeera, February 8, 2008. and that he hoped talks on point three (the resolution of the political crisis) could be concluded early in the next week. The ODM's William Ruto said that although there was progress, a solution had still not been reached, and he denied that a national unity government had been agreed upon; Mutula Kilonzo, a negotiator for the government, reported \\"excellent\\" progress. Saitoti, the Internal Security Minister, announced the end of the ban on rallies on the same day due to improved security, but said that rallies must be held only for peaceful purposes. Despite the reported progress and his earlier adoption of a more conciliatory tone, Odinga returned to a hard-line stance on February 9, repeating his earlier demand that Kibaki should either resign or a new election should be held, and he said that he would not compromise on that point. Speaking before the National Assembly on February 12, Annan said that both sides in the talks had agreed to set up \\"an independent review committee that will be mandated to investigate all aspects of the 2007 presidential election\\".\\"Kenya panel to probe disputed elections\\", AFP (IOL), February 12, 2008. Archived copy at WebCite (February 1, 2010). He also said that both sides in the National Assembly would have to work together to pass legislation needed to resolve the crisis. On the same day, as talks approached a potential agreement, talks were moved to a secret location, with Annan requesting a \\"complete news blackout\\" and asking participants in the talks to not disclose what was under discussion. Ruto said that the ODM had proposed forming a government in which the two sides would share power for two years before a new election.\\"Kenya rivals in power-sharing talks\\" , Al Jazeera, February 12, 2008. Although Annan suggested that the two sides had agreed to a two-year power-sharing transitional government, the government objected, with the Justice Minister, Martha Karua, saying that this suggestion had misrepresented and undermined the government's position. On February 13, the mediators said in a statement that Annan had only expressed his own perspective and that he had not meant to suggest that the two sides had formally agreed on the proposal. As talks adjourned on February 14, scheduled to resume the following week, government negotiator Kilonzo said that an agreement had been reached to restart the process of writing a new constitution after it had stalled following the failure of the 2005 constitutional referendum.\\"Kenyans to 'rewrite constitution'\\" , Al Jazeera, February 14, 2008. On February 15, Annan said that the two sides had agreed to a range of reforms, including the improvement of electoral laws and human rights, as well as a review of the constitution, although they had yet to agree upon the composition of a power- sharing government. It was reported that the government side wanted Kibaki to retain strong executive powers, while the opposition wanted Odinga to have extensive powers in a new position of Prime Minister. According to Annan, they were about to take \\"the last difficult and frightening step\\" to conclude a deal, and he said that he intended to remain in Kenya until a new government was in place, by which time he thought the process would be \\"irreversible\\". The commission charged with reviewing the election was to be established by March 15, with a report to follow within three to six months.\\"Kenya peace deal 'very close'\\" , Al Jazeera, February 15, 2008. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in Kenya to support the talks on February 18. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Wetangula said that help was welcome but he stressed that ultimately the problem had to be solved by Kenyans and that no one should make the \\"mistake of putting a gun to anybody's head and saying 'either/or'\\" in an attempt to force a solution. Rice met with Kibaki, Odinga, and Annan, and she emphasized the importance of reaching a settlement, saying that one should have already been in place; however, she also said that the U.S. was not trying to \\"dictate a solution to Kenyans\\".\\"Rice calls for Kenya power-sharing\\" , Al Jazeera, February 18, 2008. On February 19, Kibaki said that, while he was willing to share power in the government, an agreement should be made in the context of the existing constitution. Nyongo then called for the National Assembly to be summoned within a week \\"to enact the necessary changes in the constitution to implement these mediation proposals\\", warning that the ODM would otherwise resume protests.\\"Kenya opposition threatens protests\\" , Al Jazeera, February 20, 2008. On February 21, Mutula Kilonzo said that the government side had accepted \\"the creation of the post of a non- executive prime minister with substantial responsibilities\\", but the opposition wanted the prime minister to be a head of government with executive powers. Nyongo said that he thought an agreement would be reached by the next day.\\"Kenyan parties tackle PM problem\\" , Al Jazeera, February 21, 2008. On February 21, East African Community Secretary-General Juma Mwapachu said that the crisis was having a negative effect on the regional economy. Speaking in Nairobi on February 22, newly elected Chairman of the African Union Commission Jean Ping said it was hoped that an agreement would be reached by the next week.\\"AU chief urges Kenya political deal\\" , Al Jazeera, February 22, 2008. An impasse was reached on February 25, 2008. While both parties agreed to the creation of the post of prime minister, they disagreed about the powers the newly created post should have, over government posts and over a possible election in case the coalition should split. Annan declared the talks suspended on February 26, saying that they had \\"not broken down\\" but that the leaders needed to \\"become directly engaged in these talks\\". Mutula Kilonzo said that media reports of supposed deals had caused problems and complained of unfair pressure. The ODM's Mudavadi expressed frustration at the situation. Jakaya Kikwete, the President of Tanzania and Chairman of the African Union, arrived in Kenya on February 27, to assist in the talks. On the same day, Odinga said that the ODM had decided not to resume protests as planned on February 28, expressing continued commitment to the talks.\\"Kenya opposition calls off protests\\" , Al Jazeera, February 27, 2008. On February 28, Kibaki and Odinga signed the agreement meant to end the crisis at a ceremony in Nairobi;\\"Kenya's rival politicians reach an agreement\\" , Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), February 28, 2008. Annan said that the agreement was to be known as the National Accord and Reconciliation Act. The two leaders agreed to form a coalition government, with Odinga set to receive the new position of Prime Minister, in which capacity he was to \\"coordinate and supervise government affairs\\"; it remained unclear whether, as Prime Minister, he could still be overruled by Kibaki. According to the agreement, the Prime Minister must be an elected member of the National Assembly as well as the parliamentary leader of the party or coalition holding a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The agreement also provided for two Deputy Prime Ministers, one for each of the two parties, while the allotment of Cabinet portfolios was to reflect the relative strength of the respective parties in the National Assembly. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Ministers can only be removed from their positions if they lose a no- confidence vote in the National Assembly. Kibaki said that he would reconvene the National Assembly on March 6, so that it could make the constitutional changes needed in order to implement the agreement. =Implementation of the agreement= Annan left Kenya on March 2, leaving Oluyemi Adeniji, a former Nigerian Foreign Minister, to lead talks on remaining issues, such as land, political reforms, and the uneven distribution of wealth between various ethnic groups. On 3, March 13, people were killed in an attack near Mount Elgon that was attributed by police to the Sabaot Land Defence Force. Kibaki and Odinga met again on March 4, as part of the follow-up negotiations. Odinga said that this meeting was \\"very productive\\". On March 6, rights groups including Reporters Without Borders stated that the Kenyan media played a positive role during the violence despite being inexperienced with such situations. Speaking in the National Assembly when it convened on March 6, Kibaki urged it to quickly pass the legislation required to implement the power-sharing agreement; he said that the people were watching and that they wanted to see \\"pragmatic solutions, not ideological posturing\\". He named four bills that the National Assembly needed to pass: the National Accord and Reconciliation Bill, a bill amending the constitution, a bill establishing the truth, justice and reconciliation commission, and a bill dealing with ethnic issues.\\"Kenya leader urges backing for deal\\" , Al Jazeera, March 6, 2008. On March 9‚Äì10, the army attacked the Sabaot Land Defence Force near Mount Elgon; this attack included aerial bombardment. 30,000 people were reported to have fled from the army's attack, although this number was disputed and the army said that it was \\"not intimidating or harassing residents\\".\\"Kenyan army crackdown reported in west; parliament to debate power-sharing agreement\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), March 10, 2008. On March 10, Francis Muthaura, the head of the public service, stirred controversy by saying that Kibaki would remain both head of state and head of government\\"Protests at Muthaura‚Äôs power deal talk\\" , Daily Nation, March 12, 2008. and that Odinga would only rank third in the government, after Kibaki and Vice-President Musyoka. Government negotiator KilonzoBarney Jopson, \\"Challenge to Odinga role threatens Kenya pact\\" , Financial Times, March 12, 2008. and Foreign Minister Wetangula backed this interpretation of the agreement, with the latter saying that \\"we are not setting up a government within a government\\". The ODM, however, angrily rejected Muthaura's interpretation. William Ruto said that \\"Kenyans should treat Mr Muthaura's statement with the contempt it deserves\\" and that it was \\"uncalled for, unnecessary and contemptuous of the agreement\\". ODM spokesman Salim Lome said that it was unacceptable to have Odinga ranking third, as \\"a minor hanger-on\\", and that the ODM would never have agreed to such an arrangement. On March 11, a parliamentary committee made a request for the bills implementing the agreement to be fast-tracked, which would provide for them to be considered within five days, rather than two weeks. The National Assembly passed two bills implementing the agreement on March 18,. The first of these was the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, which passed unanimously with 200 votes in favor; this constitutionally established the posts of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. The amendment was followed by a law providing for those posts in a new government and detailing the terms of the power-sharing arrangement. Kibaki signed the bills into law a few hours later. He said that he was \\"now confident a permanent solution to the crisis will be achieved\\" and called for the drafting of a new constitution; meanwhile, Odinga called for a \\"national ethnic conference where we will have representatives from all the 42 tribes in the country come together to discuss openly how we want to lead this country\\".\\"Kenyan leader signs power-share law\\" , Al Jazeera, March 18, 2008. As part of consultations on the composition of the new Cabinet, the ODM proposed a Cabinet with 34 members (twice the number in the partial Cabinet named by Kibaki in January), while the government proposed a Cabinet with 44 members. On April 1, a protest of about 100 people was held in Nairobi against these proposals on the grounds that it was unaffordable to have so many ministers and that having them would not serve a constructive purpose; the protesters demanded that the Cabinet be limited to no more than 24 members. This protest was broken up by police with tear gas.\\"Kenyan police break up protest\\" , Al Jazeera, April 1, 2008. In a statement on April 2, Annan expressed concerns about the length of time that it was taking to name a new Cabinet. He urged Kibaki and Odinga to put the national interest first, conclude consultations, and name a Cabinet with an equal division of power in line with the agreement.\\"Kofi Annan worried about sluggishness in naming new Kenyan cabinet\\", African Press Agency, April 2, 2008. On April 3, the two sides announced that they had reached an agreement on the size and composition of the Cabinet. According to a statement from Kibaki's office, the new Cabinet would have 40 ministers, would be announced on April 6, and would be sworn in on April 12,.\\"Kenya rivals break ministry impasse\\" , Al Jazeera, April 3, 2008. This Cabinet would be the largest in Kenya's history, and the announcement of its size was greeted with substantial dissatisfaction among the people, with many believing a 40-member Cabinet to be wasteful, unnecessary, and intended merely to provide additional jobs with which to reward politicians. The government argued that the large size of the Cabinet was needed in order for it to be properly inclusive. Alfred Mutua, the government spokesman, said that \\"there is no price that is too high for our country to ensure peace, harmony and reconciliation, healing and stability that will spur and grow the economy and create even more wealth\\", and he suggested that the cost would not be as great as anticipated because \\"most of the new ministries are subdivided from formerly existing ministries and therefore the budget and members of staff for those new ministries already exist.\\"\\"Kenya cabinet delayed over posts\\" , Al Jazeera, April 5, 2008. On April 5, the day before the Cabinet was to be announced, the ODM said that the announcement had been delayed because there was still disagreement on the allotment of ministerial portfolios. The disagreement reportedly hinged on the particularly important portfolios of finance, local government, energy, and internal security. According to the government, the finance, defence, foreign affairs, and justice portfolios were to go to Kibaki's party, the PNU, while the ODM was to receive the roads, public works, tourism, and agriculture portfolios. Mutua said that Odinga had not submitted his list of proposed ministers to Kibaki, and he said that Kibaki had invited Odinga for talks on the morning of April 6,. Kibaki and Odinga accordingly met, and afterwards they said in a joint statement that they had made \\"substantial progress\\" and that they expected an agreement to be reached in further talks on April 7,. However, on April 8, the talks were suspended due to the continued disagreement; according to Nyongo, they were suspended \\"until [the PNU] fully recognises the 50/50 power-sharing arrangement and the principle of portfolio balance\\". Odinga said that he had received a letter from the PNU, which asserted that \\"the constitution grants the president exclusive executive powers to run his country on his own and ... his powers supersede the provisions of the accord\\". Meanwhile, a protest in Kibera was broken up by police with tear gas; this was the largest protest to occur since the agreement was signed.\\"Kenya opposition suspends talks\\" , Al Jazeera, April 8, 2008. It was reported on April 12, that Kibaki and Odinga had reached an agreement on the Cabinet and that it would be announced on the next day.\\"Kenyan leaders reach cabinet deal\\" , Al Jazeera, April 12, 2008. Accordingly, the Cabinet, with 40 ministersPatrick Wachira, \\"Kibaki names new Cabinet\\" , The Standard (Kenya), April 14, 2008. and 50 assistant ministers, was named on April 13,; there were 20 ministers each for PNU and the ODM. The PNU was considered to have kept most of the main portfolios despite the dispute that led to the delay, and some in the ODM complained that because of this there was not a true balance in portfolios. The PNU took portfolios such as foreign affairs, finance, internal security, defence, and energy, while the ODM took portfolios such as local government, agriculture, immigration, roads, and public works. Odinga was named Prime Minister, Uhuru Kenyatta was named as the PNU's Deputy Prime Minister (as well as Minister of Trade), and Musalia Mudavadi was named as the ODM's Deputy Prime Minister (as well as Minister of Local Government). Kibaki challenged politicians to put politics aside and \\"get to work\\". Odinga and the Cabinet were sworn in on April 17, 2008 at State House. Annan travelled to Kenya again for the occasion; he called on Kenyans to support the new Cabinet and, noting that there was \\"still a long way to go\\", said that the next task would be to \\"mould the cabinet as a cohesive, effective and productive thing that will help steer this nation right\\". =After the formation of the unity government= In the absence of an opposition due to the formation of the coalition government, more than 70 backbencher MPs supported the creation of a coalition opposition, feeling that it was important to have an opposition for the sake of democratic governance. However, on May 22, 2008, the Cabinet decided to oppose the creation of such an opposition, saying that it would be unconstitutional and would violate the spirit of the coalition. On the same day, the Cabinet decided to fast-track the commission of inquiry that was intended to investigate the causes of the violence.\\"Kenya: Government opposes formation of opposition\\", African Press Agency, May 23, 2008. A proposed bill that would allow the backbenchers to create an official opposition (the National Assembly (Parliamentary Opposition) Bill 2008) was published in August 2008 and was passed a few months later.Alex Ndegwa, \\"‚ÄòOpposition‚Äô MPs edge closer to recognition as Bill is published\\", The Standard (Kenya), August 16, 2008. In addition to the two vacancies in Parliament created by the killing of ODM MPs Mugabe Were and David Too, results were never announced in two parliamentary constituencies due to violence, and another vacancy was produced by the election of Kenneth Marende as Speaker of Parliament. The five by-elections to fill these seats were to be held on June 11, 2008. During the campaigning for the by-elections, which concluded on June 9, the politics of ethnicity was again evident, causing anxiety among some observers; increased tension was also evident between the PNU and the ODM.

Up to 600,000 people have been displaced. The largest single loss of life was when a church providing shelter from the violence to 200 people was set on fire by rioters, killing 35 people. The people who were sheltering were members of President Kibaki's tribe, the Kikuyu. Former Olympic athlete Lucas Sang died under unknown circumstances in a riot at Eldoret on January 1.The Standard, January 3, 2008: Poll violence claim former athlete Sang Politician G. G. Njuguna Ngengi was hacked to death in Kuresoi, near Molo, on January 2,. Marathon runner Wesley Ngetich Kimutai died after he was shot with an arrow on January 19, in the Trans Mara District, becoming the second international athlete to lose his life. On January 20, Donald Odanga, former basketball international was fatally wounded by a stray police bullet. On January 29, opposition MP Mugabe Were was shot to death on his driveway, and on January 31, another opposition MP, David Kimutai Too, was shot by a policeman in disputed circumstances. On January 13, Human Rights Watch accused the police of having a \\"shoot to kill\\" policy, using live ammunition against protesters and looters. According to the police, they have shot looters but not protesters. On January 18, police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said that 510 people had been killed in the violence and that 82 of them were killed by police.\\"Kenya: Police Termed Kisumu Shooting Regrettable\\" , The East African Standard (allAfrica.com), January 19, 2008. According to Kiraithe, the police were acting lawfully and were showing restraint because the protesters were being \\"used by politicians.\\" Later in January, Human Rights Watch accused \\"ODM politicians and local leaders\\" of organizing, instigating and facilitating violence against Kikuyus. The BBC reported on March 5, that government officials had met with members of the Mungiki militia, which is banned, at State House to arrange for the militia to protect Kikuyus. The government denied this. Regional implications The violence in Kenya has had serious economic ramifications throughout East Africa, particularly for the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes region (Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo). These countries depend upon Kenyan infrastructure links (particularly the port at Mombasa) for important imports as well as export routes. Significant shortages of gasoline were reported in Uganda as well as Zanzibar following the elections. The East African Community, despite having election observers in Kenya, did not issue a statement. Reactions A government spokesman claimed that Odinga's supporters were \\"engaging in ethnic cleansing\\". Odinga countered that Kibaki's camp was \\"guilty, directly, of genocide\\" as he called for international mediation. Possible continuation The UN had warned that a repeat of the problems could occur after the next election unless Kenya strengthens its institutions and the perpetrators of the 2007 violence are punished. A BBC report in 2009 found that rival groups in Rift Valley Province, such as the Kalenjin and Kikuyu, were purchasing firearms such as AK-47 and G3 rifles, in readiness for anticipated violence at the 2013 poll. There is, however, concerted efforts from the civil society to help avert such an eventuality. There is even a campaign dubbed The Wazi campaign, that aims to prevent the recurrence of the violence through the use of animated cartoon PSAs that preach peace. Despite these concerns, Kenya had a peaceful election in 2013 with a record 85.91% voter turnout. However, during the 2017 general elections there was an annulment of the results when the opposition leader pulled out.

The first station at Needham opened in 1853; it burned in 1887 and was replaced with a stone station, some of which is still in place. The station is fully accessible. History =Great Plain= On June 1, 1853, the Charles River Branch Railroad was extended from Newton Upper Falls into Needham as the first stage of a line to Dover and beyond. The railroad was not able to follow its original plan to go through the East Village, Needham's historical center, because one landowner refused to sell; instead, it was routed to Great Plain station in Great Plain Village further to the east. Great Plain served as the terminus of the railroad until it was extended to Medway in 1861 and to Woonsocket in 1863. =Needham= 1887-built Needham station on a postcard One corner of the 1887 station is extant and used as a restaurant With the coming of the railroad, Great Plain Village eclipsed East Village as the primary business district of Needham, and it officially became the town center in 1879. The station's name was gradually changed to Needham Plain, then Needham. By the 1880s, the line was part of the New York and New England Railroad. The original gable-roofed wooden station burned in 1887 and was replaced with a stone station with a turreted roof. Most of the building was destroyed in the mid 20th century, but one corner remains and is part of a restaurant. =Needham Cutoff= The line became part of the New Haven Railroad's Midland Division in 1898. In 1906, the New Haven opened the Needham Cutoff, a faster route to Boston that avoided the rival Boston and Albany Railroad's Highland Branch tracks. The line through Needham was thus downgraded from an intercity route to a branch line. Loop service jointly run by the B&A; and the New Haven operated over the Cutoff and the Highland Branch via Needham from 1911 to 1914; after that, most Needham trains originated at Needham Heights. Service between Newton Highlands and Newton Upper Falls ended in 1927, and between Needham Heights and Newton Upper Falls in 1932, leaving Needham Heights as the terminus of the line. =MBTA era= The MBTA bought Penn Central's southside commuter rail assets, including the Needham Line, on January 27, 1973. The station was closed with the rest of the line from October 13, 1979 to October 19, 1987 during Southwest Corridor construction. Upon reopening, the station was renamed as Needham Center to differentiate it from Needham Heights and Needham Junction stations. A mini-high platform was added during the closure, making Needham Center fully accessible. The MBTA acquired a brick structure next to the remaining part of the station building in 1991 for use as a waiting room. After years of disuse, the agency sold the building in 2012.

Built on a site originally set aside for the third phase of Basingstoke's shopping centre, The Anvil was built to tackle what was then seen as a 'cultural desert' in the Basingstoke area. The aim of the project was to raise the profile of the Borough and to establish it as a major regional centre with a range of first class facilities. Twenty years since its opening, it is still not exactly clear how effectively these aims have been fulfilled, but the Hall seems quite popular within the local area. The building's name reflects its unusual shape, particularly when seen from the western approach as it vaguely resembles the horn end of a traditional blacksmith's anvil. It has also been likened to the bow of a ship. The hall plays host to a variety of touring productions, stand up comedians, live bands, opera, and most famously classical music. The hall is designed to be multi purpose, and has multiple stage formats that fit shows according to their needs, plus a removable proscenium to cater for more theatrical performances that require more than a standard 'black box' stage, notably opera and pantomime. The auditorium has adjustable seating and considered some of the finest acoustics of any concert hall in Europe. The acoustic design was by Richard Cowell of Arup Acoustics. There is a small second auditorium, The Forge, which primarily plays host to acoustic and folk acts.

It has been identified with the modern village of Hersek, in the district of Altƒ±nova, Yalova Province. It is traditionally considered as the birthplace of Saint Helena.  History  According to the 6th-century historian Procopius, Helena's son Emperor Constantine the Great renamed the city \\"Helenopolis\\" to honor her birthplace; but the name may simply have honored her without marking her birthplace.Harbus, Antonia. Helena of Britain in Medieval Legend. Rochester, NY: D.S. Brewer, 2002, p. 12ff Constantine also built there a church in honour of the martyr Saint Lucian; it soon grew in importance, and Constantine lived there very often towards the end of his life. Near it were some famous mineral springs. These mineral springs might be those of Termal near Yalova. Emperor Justinian built there an aqueduct, baths and other monuments. It does not seem ever to have grown, and it was slightingly called (a pun on its name) Eleinou Polis, \\"the wretched town\\".  Ecclesiastical history  The see of Helenopolis in Bithynia was a suffragan of the Metropolis of Nicomedia. Michel Le Quien mentions nine of its bishops. Macrinus, the first, is said to have been at the Council of Nicaea (325), but his name is not given in the authentic lists of the members of the council. About 400, the church of Helenopolis was governed by Palladius of Galatia, the friend and defender of John Chrysostom, and author of the Historia Lausiaca.

He was the author of Kelal ·∏≤a·∫ìer mi-Kol ha-Rashum Beketab (Short Abstract of All That Has Been Published), containing a short compendium of rabbinic theology, Halakah, morals, ethics, jurisprudence, and political science. The book appeared in manuscript in Istanbul in 1530, and could be obtained from the author only for a limited time, on the payment of one florin as a fee for perusal. Besides, Bulat published the Talmud methodology Halikot 'Olam of Joshua ben Joseph (Constantinople, 1510). Tam ibn Ya·∏•yah, in his work \\"Tummat Yesharim,\\" and Elijah Mizra·∏•i, in his responsa, both colleagues of Bulat in Istanbul, cite some of his responsa. Bulat, possessing a thorough knowledge of the Talmud, opened up new methods in Talmudic study. He decided that the method of Talmud interpretation practiced by some of his contemporaries was contradictory to the real meaning of the Talmud. It was their custom to regard every opinion, even every sentence, in the Talmud as a binding rule; and they went so far as to look upon every \\"pose·∏≥\\" (post-Talmudic Halakah) in the same way. Consequently, a vast number of new \\"·∏•umrot\\" (intensifications of the Law) continued to be introduced; and it was considered a duty of the pious to refrain from acts tabooed by their predecessors, though only by a few of them. Similarly, the theoretical opinions of earlier Talmud commentators were studied in a receptive, uncritical spirit. Bulat, however, returned to the Talmud itself. He distinguished between the decisions arrived at in the Talmud, that should be regarded as standard, and the opinions of individuals, which might be disregarded. He sought for the true meaning, the motives and aims of the Talmudic controversies and Halakot; and he considered needless intensifications of the Law, especially in marital and juridical questions, as criminal. He maintained that whoever was unable to find in the Talmud a true solution of new circumstances, by means of logic and analogy, was not worthy to work in the province of Halakah; and that investigations into the meaning of \\"pos·∏≥im\\" as a rule lead to nothing. \\"Many times,\\" said Bulat, \\"the reader is perplexed because of the disagreement between the various writers; and often the different parts of a pose·∏≥ contradict one another, thus perplexing and completely bewildering the reader. For this reason the true rendering of the text must be sought in the original source\\" (\\"Tummat Yesharim,\\" No. 34). It was natural that in his endeavor to carry his views into practise he should meet with the opposition of his colleagues at Constantinople (ib. No. 39). Nevertheless, it is reported that even his opponents respected him; and one of them, Tam ibn Ya·∏•yah, used to address him with the most flattering epithets (ib. Nos. 35, 38).

The history of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to Biblical times. The Arabian Peninsula is defined as including the present-day countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (a federation of seven Sheikhdoms: Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain) and Yemen politically and parts of Iraq and Jordan geographically. Jewish communities have lived mainly in present-day Iraq and Yemen, but most have migrated to Israel as a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Currently, some Jewish communities develop in the Arabian peninsula as a result of expanding business and commerce as well as increased tolerance to Jews, such as in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. History of the Jews in Iraq The history of the Jews in Iraq is documented over twenty-six centuries, from the time of the Babylonian captivity c. 600 BCE, as noted in the Hebrew Bible and other historical evidence from the period, to modern Iraq. Iraqi Jews constitute one of the world's oldest and most historically significant Jewish communities. In the 1930s, the situation of the Jews in Iraq deteriorated. Previously, the growing Iraqi Arab nationalist sentiment included Iraqi Jews as fellow Arabs, but these views changed with ongoing conflict in the Palestinian Mandate. Despite protestations of their loyalty to Iraq, Iraqi Jews were increasingly subject to discrimination and harsh laws. On August 27, 1934 many Jews were dismissed from public service, and quotas were set up in colleges and universities. Zionist activities were banned, as was the teaching of Jewish history and Hebrew in Jewish schools. Following Rashid Ali's pro-Axis coup, the Farhud (\\"violent dispossession\\") pogrom of June 1 and 2, 1941, broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 200 Jews were murdered (some sources put the number higher), and up to 2,000 injured‚Äîdamages to property were estimated at $3 million. There was also looting in many other cities at around the same time. Afterwards, Zionist emissaries from Palestine were sent to teach Iraqi Jews self-defense, which they were eager to learn. .\\" (Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p. 364) From 1950 to 1952, Operation Ezra and Nehemiah airlifted 120,000 Iraqi Jews to Israel via Iran and Cyprus. By 1968 only 2,000 Jews remained in Iraq.Immediately prior to the Gulf War, the U.S. State Department noted that there was no recent evidence of overt persecution of Jews, but travel, particularly to Israel, was restricted, as was contact with Jewish groups abroad. In 1997, the Jerusalem Post reported that in the previous five years, some 75 Jews had fled Iraq, of whom about 20 moved to Israel and the rest mostly went to the United Kingdom and Netherlands.Bard, Mitchell (2013). \\"The Jews of Iraq\\".

Six chose to emigrate, among them Ezra Levy, the father of Emad Levy, Baghdad's last rabbi. After the defeat of the Ba'ath regime, the process of establishing a new democratic government began. Among the subjects for debate over the Iraqi constitution was whether Jews should be considered a minority group, or left out of the constitution altogether.Jerusalem Post In October 2006, Rabbi Emad Levy announced that he was leaving for Israel and compared his life to \\"living in a prison\\".

According to the Hebrew Bible, three Israelite tribes lived on this territory: the Tribe of Reuben, the Tribe of Gad and the Tribe of Manasseh. Since its 1516 incorporation in the Ottoman Empire, this territory was part of the vilayet (province) of Damascus-Syria until 1660, then part of the vilayet of Saida (Sidon), briefly interrupted by the 7 March ‚Äì July 1799 French occupation of Jaffa, Haifa, and Caesarea. During the siege of Acre in 1799, Napoleon issued a proclamation to the Jews of Asia and Africa to help him conquer Jerusalem. On 10 May 1832 it was one of the Turkish provinces annexed by Muhammad Ali's shortly imperialistic Egypt (nominally still Ottoman), but in November 1840 direct Ottoman rule was restored. The British Balfour Declaration of 1917 promised both sides of the Jordan River to the Jewish people, but that was changed by the Churchill White Paper which split off Transjordan from the British Mandate of Palestine. Following the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine of 1947, Jordan was one of the Arab countries that attacked the new Jewish state of Israel. It gained some victories but it was eventually defeated during the Six-Day war when it attacked Israel again. Jordan eventually signed the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. Currently, there are no legal restrictions on Jews in Jordan, and they are permitted to own property and conduct business in the country, but in 2006 there were reported to be no Jewish citizens of Jordan,US Department of State (2006), International Religious Freedom Report 2006. nor any synagogues or other Jewish institutions. History of the Jews in Bahrain The Arab states of the Persian Gulf Bahrain's Jewish community is tiny; however, the history of the Jews in Bahrain goes back many centuries. Relations between Bahraini Jews and Bahraini Muslims are highly respected, with Bahrain being the only state on the Arabian peninsula where there is a specific Jewish community. Bahrain is the only Gulf state with two synagogues and two cemeteries next to each other. One member of the community, Rouben Rouben, who sells TV sets, DVD players, copies, fax machines and kitchen appliances from his downtown showroom, said ‚Äú95 percent of my customers are Bahrainis, and the government is our No. 1 corporate customer. I‚Äôve never felt any kind of discrimination.‚Äù Members play a prominent role in civil society: Ebrahim Nono was appointed in 2002 a member of Bahrain's upper house of parliament, the Consultative Council, while a Jewish woman heads a human rights group, the Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society. According to the JTA news agency, the active Jewish community is \\"a source of pride for Bahraini officials\\".Jewish Telegraph Agency Bahraini Jews constitute one of the world's smallest Jewish communities. There was a Jewish presence in Bahrain for many centuries, now mostly the descendants of immigrants who entered the country in the early 1900s from Iraq, Iran and India, numbered 600 families in 1948. Over the next few decades, most left for other countries, especially England, some 36 families remain as of 2006 with the total of over then 100 members.Jewish Telegraph agency Today the community has a synagogue, which though disused is the only one in an Arab Persian Gulf state, and a small Jewish cemetery.Chana Ya'ar (28 November 2010). \\"King of Bahrain Appoints Jewish Woman to Parliament\\".

In 1776 Sadeq Khan captured Basra, many of the inhabitants left the country and among them were Jews who went to Kuwait. With the Jews' efforts, the country flourished with its buildings and trades. Around 1860, their number increased and their trade flourished. They were mostly wholesalers and worked with India‚ÄîBaghdad and Aleppo. They even exported to Europe and China. There were about 80 Jewish families in Kuwait living in one district where the Bank of Trade. They had their own synagogue with their Sefer Torah. In the synagogue, they had separate place for the women. Saturday is a sacred day. Jews didn't work that day. They also had their own cemetery which shows that they lived there for a long time. Kuwait's population is now thirty five thousand and most of them are Arabs. Before 1914 there were about 200 Jews. Most of them went back to Baghdad and few went to India. There were two wealthy Jews in Kuwait but the rest were middle class, being Jewellers or material traders. The government of Kuwait had approved on building a new city called Madinat al-Hareer. A super mega-project that will host 1001 m high skyscraper. The tower will include a mosque, a synagogue and a church under a single roof. There are no Jewish citizens in Kuwait, though there are a dozen foreign Jews. History of the Jews in Oman The Tomb of Job. The history of the Jews in Oman goes back many centuries; however, the Jewish community in Oman is no longer extant. The Tomb of Job is located 45 miles from the port city of Salalah. The documented Omani Jewish community was made famous by Ishaq bin Yahuda, a merchant who lived in the 9th century. Bin Yahuda lived in Sohar, and sailed for China between the years of 882 and 912 after an argument with a Jewish colleague, where he made a great fortune. He returned to Shoar and sailed for China again, but his ship was seized and bin Yahuda was murdered at the port of Sumatra. In the mid 19th century, the British Lieutenant James Raymond Wellsted documented the Jews of Muscat in his memoirs Travels in Arabia, vol. 1. He mentions that there are \\"a few Jews in Muskat (sic), who mostly arrived there in 1828, being driven from Baghdad . . .by the cruelties and extortions of the Pacha Daud.\\" He also notes that Jews were not discriminated against at all in Oman, which was not the case in other Arab countries. Despite the lack of persecution in Oman, the community is believed to have disappeared before 1900. During World War II, a Jewish American Army enlisted man, Emanuel Glick, encountered a small community of Omani Jews in Muscat, but this community consisted mostly of recent migrants from Yemen. Today the community no longer exists. History of the Jews in Qatar There are few Jews in Qatar. However, the Anti-Defamation League has protested the existence of anti-judaic stereotypes in Qatar‚Äôs newspapers. As an indication of the opening up of Qatari society to Western influence, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that a forum on U.S.-Islamic relations in Qatar will feature Israeli and U.S. Jewish participants. Former President Clinton and Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, are the scheduled keynote speakers at the Jan.10‚Äì12 U.S.-Islamic Forum in Doha. The forum is sponsored by the Project on U.S. Policy Towards the Islamic World, funded by the Saban center, which was founded by American-Israeli entertainment mogul Haim Saban. A news report describes the preparations for US troops stationed in Qatar: \\"NEW YORK ‚Äì The Jewish members of America's armed forces will again receive kosher K-rations this Pesach throughout the holiday, provided by the U.S. Defense Department...Each chaplain stationed in Iraq will hold two seders at base camps, with central seders taking place in Baghdad, Falluja and Tikrit. There will also be two seders at the army headquarters in Bahrain, and air force headquarters in Qatar. Jewish soldiers stationed in remote locations will be able to attend seders led by soldiers who received special training for that purpose.\\" History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia The first mention of Jews in the area of what is today Saudi Arabia dates back, by some accounts, to the time of the First Temple. By the 6th and 7th centuries there was a considerable Jewish population in Hejaz, mostly in and around Medina (or Yathrib as it called by the time), Khaybar, and Tayma. There were three main Jewish tribes in Medina, forming the most important Hejazi community before the rise of Islam in Arabia. These were the Banu Nadir, the Banu Qainuqa and the Banu Qurayza. Banu Nadir, the Banu Qainuqa, and the Banu Qurayza lived in northern Arabia, at the oasis of Yathribu until the 7th century, when the men were sentenced to death and women and children enslaved after betraying the pact made with the Muslims following the Invasion of Banu Qurayza by Muslim forces under Muhammad.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", p. 95f.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 213. There was a small Jewish community, mostly members of Bnei Chorath, lived in one border city from 1934 until 1950. The Yemeni city of Najran was conquered by Saudi forces in 1934, absorbing its Jewish community, which dates to pre-Islamic times.Gilbert, Martin, \\"In Ishmael's House\\", 2000, (p. 5) With increased persecution, the Jews of Najran made plans to evacuate. The local governor at the time, Amir Turki ben Mahdi, allowed the 600 Najrani JewsAhroni, Reuben \\"Jewish emigration from the Yemen, 1951-98\\", 2001 (p. 27) a single day on which to either evacuate or never leave again. Saudi soldiers accompanied them to the Yemeni border. These Jews arrived in Saada,Shulewitz, Malka Hillel \\"The Forgotten Millions\\", 2000 (p.86) and some 200 continued south to Aden between September and October 1949. The Saudi King Abdulaziz demanded their return, but the Yemeni king, Ahmad bin Yahya refused, because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. After settling in the Hashid Camp (also called Mahane Geula) they were airlifted to Israel as part of the larger Operation Magic Carpet.Gilbert, Martin, \\"In Ishmael's House\\", 2000, (p. 271) There is limited Jewish activity in Saudi Arabia today. Jews and all other non-Muslims are not permitted to visit or live in Mecca or Madinah. Public worship of all religions but Islam is strictly forbidden. However, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the first Jew to hold that position, came to Saudi Arabia on ten official trips on diplomatic missions on behalf of the United States. During the Gulf War (1990‚Äì1991), when approximately a half million US military personnel assembled in Saudi Arabia, and many were then stationed there, there were many Jewish US service personnel in Saudi Arabia. It is reported that the Saudi government insisted that Jewish religious services not be held on their soil but that Jewish soldiers be flown to nearby US warships. There has been virtually no Jewish activity in Saudi Arabia since the beginning of the 21st century. Census data does not identify any Jews as residing within Saudi Arabian territory. History of the Jews in the United Arab Emirates A historical journey to visit far-flung Jewish communities was undertaken by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela from 1165 to 1173 that crossed and tracked some of the areas that are today in the United Arab Emirates, which had also been under the control of the Persians. His trek began as a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He may have hoped to settle there, but there is controversy about the reasons for his travels. It has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. On the other hand, he may have intended to catalogue the Jewish communities on the route to the Holy Land so as to provide a guide to where hospitality may have been found for Jews travelling to the Holy Land. He took the \\"long road\\" stopping frequently, meeting people, visiting places, describing occupations and giving a demographic count of Jews in every town and country. One of the known towns that Benjamin of Tudela reported as having a Jewish community was in a place called \\"Kis\\", located in Ras al-Khaimah, one of the seven emirates of the UAE. Modern Ras Al Khaimah covers an area of 656 square miles (1700 km¬≤) in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Since the formation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 1971, a small Jewish community grew in the UAE. The community worships freely in a dedicated synagogue in Dubai and has done since 2008. Visitors are also welcome to attend and pray there. Its existence is supported by the UAE's policy of tolerance, with the appointment of a Minister for Tolerance in 2016 leading to the creation of the National Tolerance Programme. The community includes Jews who call the United Arab Emirates home, as well a Jews who moved to the UAE because they are involved in business and commerce in the emirates, particularly Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In 2019, the United Arab Emirates government announced the year of tolerance, officially recognizing the existence of Jews in the UAE and documenting them as part of the nation's various religion minorities. According to Rabbi Marc Schneier, an estimate of about 150 families to 3,000 Jews live in the UAE. The synagogue in Dubai is tailored to the local atmosphere with a Jewish benediction being recited to the president of the UAE Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan as well a to the rest of the rulers of the UAE during Shabbat. As of June 2020 community is headed by, the president of the Dubai Jewish Community, Solly Wolf, and Rabbi Levi Duchman. The community has Talmud Torah, Kosher Chicken Shechita and a permanent synagogue located in Dubai. History of the Jews in Yemen alt=Map of modern Yemen Local Yemenite Jewish traditions have traced the earliest settlement of Jews in this region back to the time of King Solomon. One explanation is that King Solomon sent Jewish merchant marines to Yemen to prospect for gold and silver with which to adorn the Temple in Jerusalem. Another legend places Jewish craftsmen in the region as requested by Bilqis, the Queen of Saba (Sheba). The immigration of the majority of Jews into Yemen appears to have taken place about the beginning of the 2nd century CE, although the province is mentioned neither by Josephus nor by the main books of the Jewish oral law, the Mishnah and Talmud. In 500 CE, at a time when the kingdom of Yemen extended into far into northern Arabia and included Mecca and Medina, the king Abu-Kariba Assad (of the Tobban tribe) converted to Judaism, as did several tribal leaders under him and probably a significant portion of the population. Pagans and Christians were not forced to convert, since Judaism teaches that there are righteous and godly people in all religions, who will be saved as such. It is interesting that the Book of Job, in the Bible, concerns a wholly righteous man identified in its first sentences as a pagan Arab of the land of Uz, probably north-central Arabia. The kingdom had a tumultuous history. In 520, Abu-Kariba's son or relative Zoran Yusuf Dhu-Nuwas, took over the kingdom, and, in revenge it is said for the persecution of Jews in Byzantium, instituted taxes on the Christian population and especially harshly treated Byzantine merchants. This spurred Christians to appeal to the Byzantine Emperor to invade, but he referred the request onto the Christian Ethiopian king who obliged, crushing the Jewish kingdom and causing many Jews to flee northward into central Arabia and Medina. They added to the majority of Jews already in Medina. The average Jewish population of Yemen for the first five centuries CE is said to have been about 3,000. The Jews were scattered throughout the country, but carried on an extensive commerce and thus succeeded in getting possession of many Jewish books. It seems that they were not deeply learned in Rabbinic traditions (although they were familiar with many midrashic interpretations of Torah passages), but they were certainly devout and observant Jews. Messianic hopes were strong and many messianic movements occurred down through the centuries. Maimonides, the great rabbi and thinker of the 12th century, leader of Egyptian Jewry, wrote his famous Letter to Yemen in response to desperate appeals from Jewish elders there about how to handle a madman who claimed to be the messiah and was wreaking serious harm on the community. Just within the nineteenth century there were three pseudo- messiahs: Shukr Kuhayl I (1861‚Äì65), Shukr Kuhayl II (1868‚Äì75), Joseph Abdallah (1888‚Äì93). Emigration from Yemen to Palestine ‚Äì then ruled by the Ottomom Empire ‚Äì began in 1881 and continued almost without interruption until 1914. It was during this time that about 10% of the Yemenite Jews left. Due to the changes in the Ottoman Empire citizens could move more freely and in 1869 travel was improved with the opening of the Suez Canal, which shorted the travel time from Yemen to the Holy Land. From 1881 to 1882 a few hundred Jews left Sanaa and several nearby settlements. This wave was followed by other Jews from central Yemen who continued to move into the Holy Land until 1914. The majority of these groups moved into Jerusalem and Jaffa. Before World War I there was another wave that began in 1906 and continued until 1914. The State of Israel airlifted most of Yemen's Jews to Israel in Operation Magic Carpet in 1949 and 1950 shortly after the end of the Israeli War of Independence. In February 2009, ten Yemeni Jews immigrated to Israel, and in July 2009, three families, or 16 people in total, followed suit. On October 31, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that in June 2009, an estimated 350 Jews were left in Yemen, and by October 2009, 60 had emigrated to the United States, and 100 were considering following suit. The BBC estimated that the community numbered 370 and was dwindling. In 2010, it was reported that 200 Yemeni Jews would be allowed to immigrate to the United Kingdom. In August 2012, Aharon Zindani, a Jewish community leader from Sana'a, was stabbed to death in a market in an anti-Semitic attack. Subsequently, his wife and five children emigrated to Israel, and took his body with them for burial in Israel, with assistance from the Jewish Agency and the Israeli Foreign Ministry. In January 2013, it was reported that a group of 60 Yemenite Jews had immigrated to Israel in a secret operation, arriving in Israel via a flight from Qatar. This was reported to be part of a larger operation which was being carried out in order to bring the approximately 400 Jews left in Yemen to Israel in the coming months. In March 2015 it was reported that the Jewish population in Yemen numbered 90 On October 11, 2015, Likud MK Ayoob Kara stated that members of the Yemenite Jewish community had contacted him to say that the Houthi-led Yemen government had given them an ultimatum to convert or leave the country. A spokesman for the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh denied the reports as incorrect. On March 21, 2016, a group of 19 Yemenite Jews were flown to Israel in a secret operation, leaving the population at about 50.Some of the last Jews of Yemen brought to Israel in secret mission In April 2017, it was reported that 40 of the last 50 Jews were in an enclave next to the American Embassy in Sana'a, and they were subject to threats of ethnic cleansing by the Houthis.Jewish Blog spot April 17, 2017 On May 2017 the Yemeni-based charity Mona Relief (Yemen Organization for Humanitarian Relief and Development) gave aid to 86 members of the Jewish community in Sana'a.

[See above listing] *The Jews of Aden suffered anti-Jewish riots in December 1947 in which 76-82 died and 76 wounded. Virtually the entire population emigrated from Aden between June 1947 and September 1967.In March 2020 it is reported that the Jewish Cemetery in Aden had been destroyed.See Related to this community is that Addis Ababa Ethiopia at one point had a prominent Adenite community. Most of them left fairly quickly, with many making aliyah, however some stayed and established synagogues and Hebrew schools. By 1986, there were only six Adeni families left in the city, and almost all of their property was seized by the Mengistu regime. *The Jews of Djibouti. The vast majority of the community made aliyah to Israel in 1949. After their departure most Jewish properties were settled by the local Issa people. A modest cemetery and the grand synagogue (which was renovated into office spaces in 2012, leaving only the original outside facade) are the only two Jewish structures still standing in the country.

The community thrived for several decades before mass emigration began during the Eritrean War of Independence. Eritrea formally gained its independence in 1993. At the time, there were only a handful of Jews still left in the country. All but one have either died or emigrated. Today, there is only one last native Jew left in Eritrea, Sami Cohen, who runs an import-export business and attends to the Asmara synagogue. There are also a few non-native Jews residing in Asmara, some of them Israelis attached to the local Israeli Embassy.

Freeman was born in Helena, Montana, and began working as a stage actor in his 20s. He did not enter the film industry until he was over 40, in 1942, when he played a small uncredited role in Inflation. Despite his late start in film acting, Freeman would build himself a fairly substantial career in that field that would last over twenty three years. From 1943 onward he worked on a regular basis, sometimes in uncredited roles, but more often than not in small but credited bit or supporting parts. He appeared in ten films in 1943, and another eighteen from 1944 through 1945. In 1946 Freeman would appear in twelve films, the most notable of which was his first film of that year, Abilene Town, starring Randolph Scott and Lloyd Bridges, and California, starring Barbara Stanwyck and Ray Milland. From 1947 through 1950 Freeman appeared in twenty films, and in 1951 he began appearing on numerous television series, which would be his main acting roles for the remainder of his career, lasting into 1965. He appeared in three episodes of Studio One, along with many other TV series, including Car 54, Where Are You? and Route 66. He retired from film and television acting in 1965, and settled into retirement in New York City, where he was living at the time of his death on December 11, 1967.

Satellite Image of area Lake Bonney ( ) is a saline lake with permanent ice cover at the western end of Taylor Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It is long and up to wide. A narrow channel only wide (Lake Bonney at Narrows) separates the lake into East Lake Bonney () and West Lake Bonney (). To the north and south of the lake lie peaks that are over above sea level, and the Taylor Glacier is positioned to the west of the lake. It is deep and is perpetually trapped under of ice. It was first visited by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904. It was named by the Scott expedition of 1910-1913, for Thomas George Bonney, professor of geology at University College London, England from 1877 to 1901. Lake Bonney is one of the main lakes studied by the National Science Foundations, McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research site. Starting in 2007 NASA is funding an autonomous submersible robot called ENDURANCE to explore the water volume of the lake to study its shape and ecology. The robot is built by Stone Aerospace who also developed the DEPTHX submersible. The Endurance Project is led by Peter Doran with Bill Stone and John Priscu among the co- investigators. Scientists have discovered an ancient ecosystem beneath the Taylor Glacier, next to Lake Bonney. This ecosystem survives by transforming sulfur and iron compounds for growth.http://worldwidenewslinks.blogspot.com/2009/06/below-antarctica.html The work is seen as a stage in developing an autonomous submersible robot that could explore the ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa.

It has smooth greyish bark, sometimes with rough, flaky bark on the base of the trunk, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of nine or more, white flowers and barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus oraria is a mallee, rarely a tree or low shrub that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, greyish bark that is shed in strips, sometimes with rough, flaky bark on the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and nineteen or more on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel- shaped capsule with the valves below the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus oraria was first formally described in 1962 by Lawrie Johnson from specimens he collected near Dongara in 1960. The specific epithet (oraria) is from the Latin orarius meaning \\"pertaining to the coast\\". Distribution and habitat Ooragmandee grows in sand in coastal and near- coastal areas, often over limestone and is found from near Jurien Bay to near Kalbarri and on some nearby offshore islands.

History =Highlandville= Highlandville station in 1887 On June 1, 1853, the Charles River Branch Railroad was extended from Newton Upper Falls into Needham as the first stage of a line to Dover and beyond. The railroad was not able to follow its original plan to go through the East Village, Needham's historical center, because one landowner refused to sell. Instead, it was routed to Great Plain station in Great Plain Village further to the east. A station at Highlandville was added around 1860, by which time the line was under control of the New York and Boston Railroad. =Needham Heights= The line became part of the New Haven Railroad's Midland Division in 1898. Around 1900, a movement began to change the name of the Highlandville neighborhood. Needham Highlands was rejected for the similarity to Newton Highlands; on May 28, 1907, the post office was renamed as Needham Heights. The station was also changed to Needham Heights by November 1907. =Needham Cutoff= Mini-high platform built during the 1980s closure of the line In 1906, the New Haven opened the Needham Cutoff, a faster route to Boston that avoided the rival Boston and Albany Railroad's Highland Branch tracks. The line through Needham was thus downgraded from an intercity route to a branch line. Loop service jointly run by the B&A; and the New Haven operated over the Cutoff and the Highland Branch via Needham from 1911 to 1914; after that, most Needham trains originated at Needham Heights. Service between Newton Highlands and Newton Upper Falls ended in 1927, and between Needham Heights and Newton Upper Falls in 1932, leaving Needham Heights as the terminus of the line. =MBTA era= The Needham Heights station building, a gable-roofed wooden structure, was removed in the 1960s. The MBTA bought Penn Central's southside commuter rail assets, including the Needham Line, on January 27, 1973.

Adolf Aron Baginsky (May 22, 1843 - 15 May 1918) was a German professor of diseases of children at Berlin University. He was an older brother to otorhinolaryngologist Benno Baginsky (1848-1919).Aachen - Brani√ü by K. G. Saur Verlag GmbH & Company Baginsky was born in Ratibor (Racib√≥rz), Prussian Silesia. At the completion of his high-school education at the gymnasium of his native town (1861), he studied medicine in Berlin and Vienna. He was graduated from Berlin University in 1866, and in the same year accepted the position of private assistant to Ludwig Traube at the cholera hospital in Berlin; and in 1868 moved to Seehausen, near Magdeburg, where he began his career as a practising physician. Two years later, however, he accepted the post of chief physician in a military hospital in Nordhausen, and at the close of the Franco-Prussian war returned to Berlin, where he practised medicine, at the same time pursuing anew the studies which had been interrupted under the pressure of practical work in different hospitals. In 1881 Baginsky was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Berlin; and in 1892 promoted to an associate professorship at that institution. Baginsky devoted himself to the treatment of children's diseases. He was director of the Kaiser und Kaiserin Friedrich Kinderkrankenhaus, which he founded in Berlin with the assistance of Rudolf Virchow in 1890. The Berlin Poliklinik f√ºr Kinderkrankheiten was also established in the metropolis through his efforts. He was also the founder and editor-in-chief of the Archiv f√ºr Kinderheilkunde in 1880, in collaboration with Monti and Herz in Stuttgart. His services were recognized by the Prussian and foreign governments, and he received many orders and decorations. His numerous contributions to the science of medicine include treatises on school- hygiene, \\"Handbuch der Schulhygiene\\", Stuttgart, 1883; and on the cure of children's diseases, \\"Lehrbuch der Kinderkrankheiten,\\" Berlin, 1892 (these latter have been translated into several languages); \\"Praktische Beitr√§ge zur Kinderheilkunde,\\" T√ºbingen, 1880-84. All of these works have gone through several editions. Among his other writings, besides a great number of papers scattered through several medical journals, may be mentioned: \\"Pflege des Gesunden und Kranken Kindes\\" (The care of healthy and sick children), Stuttgart, 1885; \\"Das Leben des Weibes\\" (The life of women), ib. 1885; \\"Kost- und Haltekinderpflege in Berlin,\\" Brunswick, 1886, etc. Baginsky was a member of the several associations and committees formed in Berlin for the purpose of checking antisemitism in Germany. He is also the author of an essay entitled, \\"Die Hygienische Bedeutung der Mos√§ischen Gesetzgebung,\\" in which he comes forward as a stanch defender and enthusiastic admirer of the hygienic laws of Moses. He took active part in the social and religious life of the Jewish community in Berlin, and was one of the opponents of a movement to hold Sunday services in the synagogues of that city. Baginsky was a member of the Imperial Leopoldina-Carolina Academy; commander of the Spanish Order Isabella the Catholic; and was decorated with the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle, fourth class. He died in Berlin.  Sources  * J. Pagel, Biographisches Lexikon Hervorragender Aerzte des XIX.

The tests must be passed before enrolling onto an initial teacher training course, such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), or the Bachelor of Education (BEd). The goal of the tests is to \\"assess the core skills that teachers need to fulfil their professional role in schools, rather than the subject knowledge needed for teaching,\\" and \\"to ensure all teachers are competent in numeracy and literacy, regardless of their specialism.\\" Information about the tests Official information about the tests is provided by the Department for Education: Professional skills tests. The literacy test focuses on spelling, punctuation, grammar and comprehension. The test questions are randomly selected from a bank of standardised questions. The overall difficulty of the test varies, and the passmark is adjusted accordingly. The numeracy test starts off with a section of 12 mental arithmetic questions, each with a strict time limit, though paper working is allowed. These questions are spoken through headphones and do not appear on the computer screen. This is followed by a section of 16 more complex questions, displayed on the screen, involving interpretation of statistical data and graphs, and problem solving. For this section of the test an on-screen calculator is supplied. Practice tests which simulate the real tests can be accessed at practice.skillstestbooking.com. Access is open to anyone but a valid email address must be supplied. Candidates are restricted to one attempt and two re-sits for each of the tests. If not successful after three attempts, a candidate can make a further attempts. Candidates whose first language is not English, or who have a recognised special need (for example, dyslexia), are granted extra time to take the tests. Special arrangements are made in the case of visual or hearing impairment, or physical impairment. Until April 2012 there was also an ICT skills test. The areas of Information and communications technology tested were word processing, spreadsheets, databases, e-mails, the Internet, and presentation software.http://www.teacherstalk.co.uk/resources/qts-ict-test.php Making arrangements to take the test The tests are administered by learndirect and take place in learndirect test centres around England. Registration and bookings are made using the website www.skillstestbooking.com. The first attempt at each of the tests is free of charge, but learndirect charge a fee for re-sits. The tests are conducted on computers in supervised environments. Candidates cannot take any materials, phones, watches, etc. into the test room. Paper is provided for doing mental calculations. The tests can be taken on the same day, or at different times depending on the availability of test slots. Skills tests in the wider United Kingdom The professional skills tests are only required for initial teacher training in England. Teachers training in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland do not have to take the tests. However a B grade in GCSE English and Maths is required in Wales, compared to a C grade in England.

The station is accessible with a short mini- high platform on the outbound end of the main platform. History West Roxbury station shown on an early-20th-century postcard The Boston and Providence Railroad (B&P;) opened a branch line from Forest Hills to Dedham (where it connected with the B&P;'s preexisting branch to Dedham via Readville) via West Roxbury on June 3, 1850. South Street (Roslindale), Central (Bellevue), West Roxbury, and Spring Street stations all opened with the branch. The New Haven Railroad, successor to the B&P;, opened the Needham Cutoff on November 4, 1906 from West Roxbury to Needham Junction, allowing trains from the former New York and New England Railroad to reach Boston without needing to use the Boston and Albany Railroad's Highland Branch. Service to Dedham via West Roxbury ended in 1940, leaving West Roxbury an intermediate station on the commuter lines to Needham and West Medway. The entire Needham line was closed from 1979 to 1987 while the Southwest Corridor was reconstructed. During that time, most of the stations (including West Roxbury) were renovated for accessibility.

Recognizing these developments, the WCO, drafted the WCO Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate global trade (SAFE). In the framework, several standards are included that can assist Customs administrations in meeting these new challenges. Developing an Authorized Economic Operator programme is a core part of SAFE. The WCO framework of standards to secure and facilitate global trade The AEO concept is one of the main building blocks within the WCO SAFE Framework of Standards (SAFE). The latter is part of the future international Customs model set out to support secure trade. SAFE sets out a range of standards to guide international Customs Administrations towards a harmonized approach based on Customs to Customs cooperation and Customs to Business partnership. SAFE is based on four core elements: # harmonization of the advance electronic cargo information # each country that joins SAFE commits to employing a consistent risk management approach to address security threats # on request of the Customs administration of the receiving nation, the customs administration of the sending nation will perform an outbound inspection of high-risk containers and cargo. # definition of benefits that Customs will provide to businesses that meet minimal supply chain security standards and best practices. The essence of the AEO-concept can be found in the Customs-to- Business partnerships. Operators can be accredited by Customs as AEOs when they prove to have high quality internal processes that will prevent goods in international transport to be tampered with. I.e.: * Ensure the integrity of the information, i.e. what is said to be in a container, really is in the container and nothing else, more, or less; * Ensure the integrity of its employees, that they will not put goods in the container that should not be there; and * Secure access to its premises, to prevent unauthorized persons to put goods in the container. As a result, customs will trust the operator and perform less or no inspections on goods imported or exported by or via the AEO. This benefits the mover of the goods as goods are available more quickly, which means lower transport costs. Customs benefits as scarce inspection capacity can be targeted better at cargo of unknown and potentially unsafe operators. Different AEO programmes Most members of WCO have acceded to the SAFE framework and it can be expected that in the next few years, the majority of customs administrations will introduce AEO-programmes. According to the 2014 edition of the Compendium of Authorized Economic Operator Programmes,\\"Compendium of Authorized Economic Operator Programmes\\" published by the World Customs Organization, the following countries had either fully operational or pilot AEO programmes at that time: * Algeria (AEO Import/Export type); * Andorra (AEO Import/Export type); * Argentina, under the name of Customs System of Reliable Operators (SAOC) - export type launched in 2006, import/export type, since 2012 only for CUSE System which is a programme recently incorporated by the Federal Administration of Public Revenues of Argentina involving courier service providers; * Australia, under the name of Australian Trusted Trader (ATT) * Canada, under the name of Partners in Protection (PIP) - export/import type, launched in 1995 and Customs Self- Assessment (CSA) -Import type, since 2001; * Chile (AEO Export type), since 2012; * China, under the name of Classified Management of Enterprises - import/export type, since 2008; * Colombia (AEO Import/Export type), since 2011; * Costa Rica, under the name of Customs Facilitation Programme for Reliable Trade (PROFAC) - export type, since 2011; * Dominican Republic (AEO Import/Export type), since 2012; * European Union (AEO Import/Export type), since 2008; * El Salvador (AEO Import/Export type), since 2014; * Guatemala (AEO Import/Export type), since September 2011; * Hong Kong, China, under the name of Hong Kong AEO Programme - import/export type, since 2012; * India (AEO Import/Export type), since 2012; * Israel (AEO Import/Export type), since 2011; * Japan (AEO Import/Export type), since 2007; * Jordan, under the name of Golden List Programme- import/export type, since August 2005; * Kenya (AEO Import/Export type), since November 2010; * Korea (AEO Import/Export type), since 2009; * Malaysia (AEO Import/Export type), since 2010; * Mexico, under the name of Authorized Economic Operator - import/export type, since January 2012; * Morocco (AEO Import/Export type), since 2006 (two programmes: AEO Customs Simplification and AEO Security and Safety); * New Zealand, under the name of Secure Export Scheme (SES) - export type, since 2004; * Norway (AEO Import/Export type), since 2009; * Peru, under the name of Certified Customs User (UAC - OEA) - export type, since October 2012; * Singapore, under the name of Secure Trade Partnership (STP)- import/export type, since 2007; * Switzerland (AEO Import/Export type), since 2011; * Taiwan (AEO Import/Export type), ; * The United States, under the name of C-TPAT (Customs-Trade Partnership against Terrorism), since November 2001; * Thailand (AEO Import/Export type), import since 2011 and export since 2013; * Tunisia (AEO Import/Export type), since 2010 as a pilot programme; * Turkey (AEO Import/Export type), since 2013; * Uganda (AEO Import/Export type), since March 2012; * Uruguay (AEO Import/Export type), since 2014; * Zambia, under the name of Customs Accredited Clients Programme (CACP) - import type. At the end of 2014, Brazil has also launched its AEO Programme by the name of ‚ÄúOperador Econ√¥mico Autorizado‚Äù (OEA)Programa Brasileiro de OEA which will be implemented in three phases: OEA-Seguran√ßa - export type with focus on security, launched in December 2014 (certification based on compliance with a range of safety requirements), OEA-Conformidade - import type expected to be launched by December 2015 (certification will be based on compliance with customs regulations and procedures through the expansion and revision of the Blue Line Programme) and OEA-Integrado in which other public entities such as the Brazilian Health Agency (ANVISA) and the International Agricultural Surveillance System (VIGIAGRO) will be integrated into the AEO programme with the goal of further streamlining and integrating international trade controls - expected to be launched by December 2016. On 1 July 2016, Australia launched its AEO program ‚Äì Australian Trusted Trader (ATT). ATT accredits eligible entities supply chain security and trade compliance standards. ATT is open to all importers, exporters and service providers, via both air and sea cargo. Although all these programmes find their roots in the SAFE framework of standards, the approaches differ, e.g. the USA only allows importers to participate in C-TPAT, whereas the European AEO programme is open to all operators in the supply chain. The European AEO programme differs from the other programmes as that it has a wider scope, as it encompasses customs simplified procedures next to security and with that relates to compliance with all customs legislation, including customs duties. Mutual recognition The importance of coordinated, similar, programmes lies in the fact that the ultimate goal is to get all national programmes mutually recognized, meaning that AEO accreditations have the same value everywhere. As a result, secure supply chains can be established, as all parts of the chain from origin (place of stuffing of the container) to destination (place of unpacking of the container) are deemed to be safe, albeit under different AEO programmes. This would greatly facilitate global trade. By July 2008 the United States , had signed mutual recognition agreements with New Zealand, Canada and Jordan. Several other countries and trade blocks are starting their negotiations about it, e.g. the US and the European Union Recently, The EU and China have decided to facilitate trade between their economic operators by mutually recognising their respective programmes for Authorised Economic Operators (AEO).

History  The history of Grigeo starts in 1923, when Grzegorz Kurec, a mechanic, hydraulic engineer, and businessman, implemented his engineering designs and built a cardboard manufacturing factory at the confluence of Neris and Vokƒó rivers. The factory gave rise to the town of Grigi≈°kƒós, where the Grigeo Vilnius facility is currently located.

Early life Lucille Norman was born Lucille Pharaby Boileau in Lincoln, Nebraska, into a performing family. Her father was her first vocal teacher. During high school she performed frequent singing roles at her school and on local radio. At the age of 14 she did a summer stint singing with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. Her musical experiences earned her a two-year scholarship to the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. She appeared on the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air on December 7, 1941 singing an aria from Orfeo ed Euridice by Gluck. Although the radio show was interrupted by a bulletin about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, her appearance was met with the offer of a screen test for the movies. Unsure about moving in this direction, she took some time to consider the offer, but decided to give it a try. Her MGM screen test in New York was successful and she headed west to Hollywood. MGM films Norman's first film roles were in 1942. First, an uncredited part in the film Personalities, which was a vehicle that MGM used to showcase their new stars. Then she and Gene Kelly both made their official screen debuts singing and dancing with Judy Garland in the MGM film For Me and My Gal.

The story is set in the days leading up to the handover to China of Hong Kong from the British. Synopsis Bunt is made an offer for his textile factory by the shady Mr Hung from the People's Republic of China, and has no choice but to accept, when it is made clear that Mr Hung knows all about the part of Bunt's life that he has kept secret from his mother Betty, namely his frequenting of the \\"blue hotels\\" of Kowloon Tong and furtive sex with one of his workers, Mei- Ping. Reception Reception was mostly positive. Richard Bernstein in the New York Times wrote \\"Mr. theroux's novel is a tingly, spicy, melancholy story reminiscent of the novels of Graham Greene, and its most salient feature is the spiritual smallness, the plain bad taste of its characters\\".New York Times, 13 June 1997 The Wall Street Journal praises Theroux's satirization of British colonialism in his previous novels and in Kowloon Tong he \\"finds a natural target in the arrogant Betty but an even bigger one in the ruthless Mr. Hung. Bunt is skewered as well, but we are made to feel considerable pity for him, caught between the irrestible force of China's menacing emissary and the immovable object that is his mother\\".Wall Street Journal, 21 May 1997 Donna Seaman in Booklist contends that \\"Theroux's taut and suspenseful unraveling of Bunt's little world is absolutely riveting, capturing, as it does, the haunting sound of the last nail being pounded into the coffin of the British Empire\\".Kowloon Tong: Paul Theroux: 9780395860298: Amazon.com: Books Retrieved 2013-02-01. Barbara Hoffert in the Library Journal writes \\"The insipid Bunt and his coarse, avaricious mother are almost unbelievably awful, but in his ruthlessness Mr. Hung is even worse. The result can be pretty dispiriting, but this chilling little novel must be read to the end to catch the full effect of Bunt's breathtaking weakness. Whether it is read as a political fable challenging Britain's colonization and abandonment of Hong Kong or a morality tale about the worst in human nature, this is grim, note- perfect in its descriptions, and, one fears, absolutely honest.\\" A more critical note is struck by Kirkus Reviews which concludes \\"This hybrid story is infused with a powerful sense of menace (and an unfortunate whiff of racism) and manages a doggedly convincing characterization of its complex protagonist. But there are several long stretches during which nothing much happens, and Theroux overindulges a penchant for lengthy summaries in place of developed scenes. As a result, the book feels uneven, and sometimes hurried. A strongly imagined melodrama with a lot on its mind, but not the novel it might have been.\\"Kirkus Reviews Retrieved 2013-02-01.

Varne lightvessel on Varne Bank in the strait Ships that founder on the Varne Bank are often stated as being lost on the Goodwin Sands in error, perhaps because the Varne Bank is less well known than its close northerly neighbour. Due to the volume increase in shipping through the world's busiest channel, several proposals have been made to eliminate the Varne Bank through dredging. However, also due to its shallow depth, the Varne Bank is a productive location for fishing, especially for cod and scallops. In 1802, mining engineer Albert Mathieu made proposals to Napoleon for turning the Varne Bank into an island staging point for the Channel Tunnel. In the 20th century, a proposal was made for a Channel bridge, which would have used the Varne Bank as a staging post for a support structure. Several naval battles have been fought nearby, including the Battle of Goodwin Sands and Battle of Dungeness in 1652 and the Battle of Dover Strait in 1917.

It may also include the persecution or oppression of the Scottish people as an ethnic group, or nation. It can also be referred to as Scotophobia.  Middle Ages  Much of the negative literature of the Middle Ages drew heavily on the writings from Greek and Roman antiquity. The writings of Ptolemy in particular dominated concepts of Scotland till the late Medieval period and drew on stereotypes perpetuating fictitious as well as satirical accounts of the Kingdom of the Scots. The English Church and the propaganda of royal writs from 1337‚Äì1453 encouraged a barbarous image of the kingdom as it allied with England's enemy France, during the Hundred Years' War.The Hundred Years' War. W. R. Jones (1979). Journal of British Studies Medieval authors seldom visited Scotland but called on such accounts as \\"common knowledge\\", influencing the works of Boece's \\"Scotorum Historiae\\" (Paris 1527) and Camden's \\"Brittania\\" (London 1586) plagiarising and perpetuating negative attitudes. In the 16th century Scotland and particularly the Gaelic speaking Highlands were characterised as lawless, savage and filled with wild Scots. As seen in Camden's account to promote an image of the nation as a wild and barbarous people: > They drank the bloud [blood] out of wounds of the slain: they establish > themselves, by drinking one anothers bloud [blood] and suppose the great > number of slaughters they commit, the more honour they winne [win] and so > did the Scythians in old time. To this we adde [add] that these wild Scots, > like as the Scythians, had for their principall weapons, bowes and arrows. > Camden (1586)W. Camden, Britannia, or, A Chorographical description of the > most flourishing kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland. (London 1610), > p114-127 Camden's accounts were modified to compare the Highland Scots to the inhabitants of Ireland.Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts c. 1600 to 1800. Martin Rackwitz. Waxmann Verlag 2007. p33, p94 Negative stereotypes flourished and by 1634, Austrian Martin Zeiller linked the origins of the Scots to the Scythians and in particular the Highlander to the Goths based on their wild and Gothic- like appearance.Zeiller, Martin, Itinerarium Magnae Britanniae, 2nd ed. (1674) Zeiller's account is based on the travels of an anonymous Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1609, p. 232. Quoting the 4th-century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus,Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts c. 1600 to 1800. Martin Rackwitz. Waxmann Verlag 2007. p34 Ibid.p123 he describes the Scots as descendants of the tribes of the British Isles who were unruly trouble makers. With a limited amount of information, the Medieval geographer embellished such tales, including, less favourable assertions that the ancestors of Scottish people were cannibals. A spurious accusation proposed by Saint Jerome's tales of Scythian atrocities was adapted to lay claims as evidence of cannibalism in Scotland. Despite the fact that there is no evidence of the ancestors of the Scots in ancient Gaul,Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts c. 1600 to 1800. Martin Rackwitz. Waxmann Verlag 2007. p38, p39 moreover St. Jerome's text was a mistranslation of Attacotti,Camden Britain part i, p. 127 another tribe in Roman Britain, the myth of cannibalism was attributed to the people of Scotland: > What shall I [St. Jerome] say of other nations ‚Äì how when I was in Gaul as a > youth I saw the Scots, a British race, eating human flesh, and how, when > these men came upon the forests upon herds of swine and sheep, and cattle, > they would cut off the buttocks of the shepherds and paps of the woman and > hold these for their greatest delicasy. A part of the spurious De Situ Britanniae. Accepted as fact with no evidence, such ideas were encouraged and printed as seen in De Situ Britanniae a fictitious account of the peoples and places of Roman Britain. It was published in 1757, after having been made available in London in 1749. Accepted as genuine for more than one hundred years, it was virtually the only source of information for northern Britain (i.e., modern Scotland) for the time period, and historians eagerly incorporated its spurious information into their own accounts of history. The Attacotti were mentioned in De Situ Britanniae, and their homeland was specified (English) (Latin) as just north of the Firth of Clyde, near southern Loch Lomond, in the region of Dunbartonshire. This information was combined with legitimate historical mentions of the Attacotti to produce inaccurate histories and to make baseless conjectures. For example, Edward Gibbon combined De Situ Britanniae with St. Jerome's description of the Attacotti by musing on the possibility that a 'race of cannibals' had once dwelt in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. These views were echoed in the works of Dutch, French and German authors. Nicolaus Hieronymus Gundling proposed that the exotic appearance and cannibalism of the Scottish people made them akin to the savages of Madagascar. Even as late as the mid-18th century, German authors likened Scotland and its ancient population to the exotic tribes of the South Seas.Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts c. 1600 to 1800. Martin Rackwitz. Waxmann Verlag 2007. p40 With the close political ties of the Franco-Scottish alliance in the late Medieval period, before William Shakespeare's Macbeth, English Elizabethan theatre dramatised the Scots and Scottish culture as comical, alien, dangerous and uncivilised. In comparison to the manner of Frenchmen who spoke a form of English,Macbeth by William Shakespeare. A. R. Braunmuller p9 Cambridge University Press, 1997 Scots were used in material for comedies; including Robert Greene's James IV in a fictitious English invasion of Scotland satirising the long Medieval wars with Scotland. English fears and hatred were deeply rooted in the contemporary fabric of society, drawing upon stereotypes as seen in Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles\\" and politically edged material such as George Chapman's Eastward Hoe in 1605, offended King James with its anti-Scottish satire, resulting in the imprisonment of the playwright.Eastward Ho! by Ben Jonson, George Chapman, John Marston, Royal Shakespeare Company Despite this, the play was never banned or suppressed. Authors such as Claude Jordan de Colombier in 1697 plagiarised earlier works,C.

Martin Rackwitz. Waxmann Verlag 2007. However, the fact that Scots had married into every royal house in Europe who had also married into the Scottish royal house indicates that the supposed anti-Scottish sentiment there has been exaggerated as opposed to in England where the wars and raids in Northern England increased anti-Scottish sentiment. An increase in the English anti-Scottish sentiments after the Jacobite uprisings and the anti-Scottish bills of parliament are clearly shown in comments by leaders in English such as Samuel Johnson, whose anti-Scottish remarks such as that \\"in those times nothing had been written in the Earse [i.e. Scots Gaelic] language\\" is well known.  Anti-Highlander and anti-Jacobite sentiment  Sawney Beane at the Entrance of His Cave. published in the 1720s The Newgate Calendar caption: The woman in the background carries a severed leg. Stereotypes of Highland cannibalism lasted till the mid-18th century and were embraced by Lowland Scots Presbyterian and English political and anti-Jacobite propaganda, in reaction to a series of Jacobite uprisings, rebellions, in the British Isles between 1688 and 1746. The Jacobite uprisings themselves in reaction to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, were aimed at returning James VII of Scotland and II of England, and later his descendants of the House of Stuart. Anti-Jacobite predominantly anti-Highland propaganda of the 1720s includes publications such as the London Newgate Calendar a popular monthly bulletin of executions, produced by the keeper of Newgate Prison in London. One Newgate publication created the legend of Sawney Bean, the head of a forty-eight strong clan of incestual, lawless and cannibalistic family in Galloway. Although based on fiction, the family were reported by the Calendar to have murdered and cannibalised over one thousand victims. Along with the Bible and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, the Calendar was famously in the top three works most likely to be found in the average home and the Calendar's title was appropriated by other publications, who put out biographical chapbooks. With the intent to create a work of fiction to demonstrate the superiority of the Protestant mercantile establishment in contrast to the 'savage pro-Jacobite uncivilised Highland Gaels'.Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts c. 1600 to 1800.

From 1720 Lowland Scots Presbyterian Whiggish literature sought to remove the Highland Jacobite, being beyond the pale, or an enemy of John Bull or a unified Britain and Ireland as seen in Thomas Page's The Use of the Highland Broadsword published in 1746.\\"Contextualising Western Martial Arts The case of Thomas Page's The Use of the Highland Broadsword\\". 2007 By Bethan Jenkins cited in http://www.sirwilliamhope.org/Library/Articles/Jenkins/Contextualising.php Propaganda of the time included the minting of anti-Jacobite or anti- Highlander medals,Jacobite and Anti-Jacobite Medals by Michael Sharp. The Royal Stuart Society Paper LXXIV and political cartoons to promote the Highland Scots as a barbaric and backward people,The myth of the Jacobite clans by Murray Pittock p9 similar in style to the 19th-century depiction of the Irish as being backward or barbaric, in Lowland Scottish publications such as The Economist. Plays like William Shakespeare's Scottish play Macbeth, was popularised and considered a pro-British, pro-Hanoverian and anti-Jacobite play. Prints such as Sawney in The Boghouse, itself a reference to the tale of Sawney Bean, depicted the Highland Scots as too stupid to use a lavatory and gave a particularly 18th-century edge to traditional depictions of cannibalism.The myth of the Jacobite clans by Murray Pittock p10 The Highland Scots people were promoted as brutish thugs, figures of ridicule and no match for the \\"civilised\\" Lowland Scots supporters of the Protestant Hanovarians. They were feminised as a parody of the female disguise used by Bonny Prince Charlie in his escape, and as savage warriors that needed the guiding hand of the industrious Lowland Scots Protestants to render them civilised. William Hogarth's francophobic painting The Gate of Calais or O! The Roast Beef of Old England, in which in the foreground, a Highlander, an exile from the Jacobite rising of 1745,J. B. Nichols, 1833 p.63-p.64 \\"I meant to display to my own countryman the striking difference of food, priests, soldiers, &c.; of two nations\\" ... \\"The melancholy and miserable Highlander, browzing on his scanty fare, consisting of a bit of bread and an onion, is intended for one of the many that fled this country after the rebellion in 1745.\\" sits slumped against the wall, his strength sapped by the poor French fare ‚Äì a raw onion and a crust of bread.

Political cartoons in 1762 depict the Prime Minister, Lord Bute (accused of being a Jacobite sympathiser), as a poor John Bull depicted with a bulls head with crooked horns ridden by Jacobite Scots taking bribes from a French monkey Anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to various songs, including in its original form as an anti- Jacobite song Ye Jacobites By Name, God save the King with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army which attained some short-term use debatably in the late 18th century. This song was widely adopted and was to become the national anthem of Britain now known as \\"God Save the Queen\\" (but never since sung with that verse). :Lord, grant that Marshal Wade, :May by thy mighty aid, :Victory bring. :May he sedition hush, :And like a torrent rush, :Rebellious Scots to crush, :God save the King. The 1837 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745, and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s. On the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period, attacking Lowland Scots Presbyterianism: : God bless the prince, I pray, : God bless the prince, I pray, : Charlie I mean; : That Scotland we may see : Freed from vile Presbyt'ry, : Both George and his Feckie, : Ever so, Amen. Modern day In 2007 a number of Scottish MPs warned of increasing anti-Scottish sentiment in England, citing the increased tension over Devolution, the West Lothian question and the Barnett formula as causes. There have been a number of attacks on Scots in England in recent years. In 2004 a Scottish former soldier was attacked by a gang of children and teenagers with bricks and bats, allegedly for having a Scottish accent. In Aspatria, Cumbria, a group of Scottish schoolgirls say they received anti-Scottish taunts and foul language from a group of teenage girls during a carnival parade. An English football supporter was banned for life for shouting \\"Kill all the Jocks\\" before attacking Scottish football fans. One Scottish woman says she was forced to move from her home in England because of anti-Scottish feeling, while another had a haggis thrown through her front window. In 2008 a student nurse from London was fined for assault and hurling anti-Scottish abuse at police while drunk during the T in the Park festival in Kinross. In the media The term Scottish mafia is a pejorative term used to refer to a group of Scottish Labour Party politicians and broadcasters who are believed to have had undue influence over the governance of England, such as the constitutional arrangement allowing Scottish MPs to vote on English matters, but not the other way around. The termed had found usage in the UK press and in parliamentary debates. Members of this group include Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, Charles Falconer, Derry Irvine, Michael Martin and John Reid. An edition of the BBC satirical show Have I Got News for You aired on 26 April 2013 prompted over 100 complaints to the BBC and Ofcom for its perceived anti-Scottish stance during a section discussing Scottish independence. Panelist Paul Merton had suggested Mars bars would become the currency of a post-independence Scotland, while guest host Ray Winstone added, \\"To be fair the Scottish economy has its strengths ‚Äì its chief exports being oil, whisky, tartan and tramps.\\" In July 2006, former editor of The Sun Kelvin MacKenzie wrote a column referring to Scots as 'Tartan Tosspots' and mocking the fact that Scotland has a lower life expectancy than the rest of the U.K. MacKenzie's column provoked a storm of Scottish protest and was heavily condemned by numerous commentators including Scottish MPs and MSPs. In October 2007, MacKenzie appeared on the BBC's Question Time TV programme and launched another attack on Scotland, claiming that: Quotations * \\"The noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads to England.\\" ‚Äì Samuel Johnson * \\"It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine\\" ‚Äì P.

The series began on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X computers, and later expanded to iOS devices. The series' first title, Dance Praise, was released on September 29, 2005 and gained popularity in the Christian gaming industry. There have been four Dance Praise games for personal computers, and one final game released for iOS devices. The second game in the series, VeggieTales Dance Dance Dance, was a spin-off created in conjunction with Big Idea Entertainment for use of the VeggieTales characters and music. Development Peter Fokos, CTO of Digital Praise, started the Dance Praise series after his daughter asked him to create a dance game with Christian music for her homeschool exercise program. This series was created to allow children to enjoy dance games with music \\"fit for young ears\\".  Gameplay  Gameplay is virtually identical to the Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) series, with one key difference: DDR has the target arrows on the top portion of the screen, while Dance Praise places the targets on the bottom of the screen. This is essentially a forced Reverse modifier. When the arrows approach a target zone on the bottom of the screen, the player must step on the corresponding arrow on the dance pad when arrows reach the target zone. Players are judged on their accuracy and timing. The game also features multiplayer modes, such as \\"Shadow Dance\\" mode, where players \\"record\\" steps to be played by the other player. The \\"arcade\\" mode adds additional hazards and multipliers to gameplay, similar to Dance Magic in Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix and Battle in Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova. Lyrics to the songs being played are also shown on-screen, a feature also available in Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix and several Dancing Stage titles. The game also features an exercise mode, also offered in Dance Dance Revolution and Dancing Stage. Games =Dance Praise= Gameplay in Dance Praise, playing Spinnin' Around by Jump5 Dance Praise (marketed as Dance Praise theOriginal after the release of its sequel) is a Christian dance video game released on September 29, 2005. It contains 52 songs. The song list can be expanded using expansion packs, and songs from Dance Praise 2 are also backward compatible with Dance Praise. =VeggieTales Dance Dance Dance= Partnering with Big Idea Entertainment, Digital Praise announced VeggieTales Dance Dance Dance on July 13, 2006. It was released in time for the Christmas and holiday season of that year. The game is a modified version of Dance Praise featuring VeggieTales characters and music. A VeggieTales-themed dance pad was included, and a Deluxe variant of the pad was later released. =Dance Praise Party= Catering to large groups at schools and youth groups, Digital Praised released Dance Praise Party on May 23, 2007. The company claims that it is \\"the first large-group dance arcade system that allows up to ten players to dance simultaneously.\\" The game also included the first version of Dance Praise, the first four expansion packs compatible with both games, ten dance pads with a 1-inch foam insert in each, plus USB hubs and extension cables for the pads. The game was sold at the suggested retail price of US$2495, although Digital Praise offered different quotes for different setups such as for smaller groups. Although Party is based on the very first Dance Praise video game, it features several modifications to provide gameplay for up to ten players. For example, there are no on-screen dancers, and the album art cannot be used as the background picture while dancing. Competitors have subsequently been launched: Pump It Up Fitness, which allows up to 32 simultaneous players, and Dance Dance Revolution Classroom Edition, which allows up to 48 simultaneous players. These new additions use wireless pads. =Dance Praise 2 TheReMiX= mini-game is included and played using feet. Dance Praise 2 TheReMiX is the sequel to Dance Praise. The planned release date was September 25, 2007,Dance Praise 2: The ReMix - Press Release but the company postponed it to October 31, 2007. The game includes 52 new songs from 48 different artists, a wider variety than the original game offered. New features not available in the previous game include support for three or four players, animated backgrounds, dancing characters, minigames and a new interface. Its system requirements are also much higher than its prequel. It is the only Digital Praise game to use the Torque engine. Dance Praise 2 can use the dance pad not only for dancing, but also for single-player minigames. The game \\"DanceTris\\", a based on Tetris and controlled using the dance pad, is included. In addition, it is possible to obtain additional games, such as \\"Simon Says\\" and \\"Rock n' Block\\", by respectively installing the \\"Contemporary Hits\\" and \\"Top Hits\\" expansion packs. Similar minigames can be found in Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix. Music included with or added to the game plays in the background during minigames. This game supports Dance Praise dance pads without any configuration required, and third-party dance pads can used with the game by installing a separate patch. Songs from expansion packs and the original Dance Praise are also compatible, but sold separately.Expansion Packs - DancePraise.com Two free songs can be added with an add-on. =Dance Praise (iOS)= Screen shot from Dance Praise for iOS The final game in the series is Dance Praise for iOS devices, released on June 29, 2009. Its interface looks similar to that of Dance Praise 2, but is adapted to the iPhone and iPod Touch's smaller screen. The game was developed to capitalize on the success of the Tap Tap secular game series. It is designed for the HVGA resolution found in older iOS devices. It is not optimized for higher screen resolutions such as those found on the iPad or iPhone 4. A total of 15 songs were included in this game, with no ability to add new music. Eight of the songs come from Dance Praise 2: The ReMix, four are from the Top Hits expansion pack, two can be found on the Contemporary Hits expansion pack, and one can be found in the first Dance Praise game. The game is no longer available for download. Expansion packs Officially, a total of seven expansion packs and one downloadable add-on have been released for the Dance Praise series: * Modern Worship (June 20, 2006) * Hip-Hop & Rap (August 1, 2006) * Pop & Rock Hits (October 17, 2006) * God Rocks! BibleToons (February 20, 2007) * Praise & Worship (July 17, 2007) * Contemporary Hits (November 20, 2007) * Top Hits (April 4, 2008) Minigames can be added to Dance Praise 2 via some expansion packs. Contemporary Hits includes Simon says, while Top Hits includes Rock 'n' Block. The latter game works similarly to the Asteroids arcade title, but is controlled with the dance pad. All these expansion packs are compatible with the original Dance Praise, the Dance Praise 2 sequel, or both computer games installed on a single machine. The expansion packs were sold in retail and each included 35 new songs. A free downloadable add-on was also released; it came with two songs from Altared Life and was released on January 14, 2007. Reception In an interview with The 700 Club, Fokos commented that the game has been popular with church groups, especially due to its exercise modes and content. JustAdventure+'s Karla Munger gave the game an A, enjoying the gameplay and wide soundtrack, and recommending it for families. Plain Games' Dave Herbert gave Dance Praise a 4.5/5, noting the quality of the game's dance pad peripheral, its diverse soundtrack, and unique gameplay elements even amidst a quality of presentation lower than the Dance Dance Revolution series, and other noted differences between the two games.

Clapp 1919. Herbert Huntington Smith. The Nautilus, volume 33, 136-141. was an American naturalist and amateur conchologist who worked on the flora and fauna of Brazil. He wrote Brazil, the Amazons and the coast (C. Scribner's Sons, 1879) and Do Rio de Janeiro √° Cuyab√°: Notas de um naturalista (1922). He first went to Brazil in 1870 on the Morgan expedition led by Charles Frederick Hartt. He returned to stay in Santar√©m from 1874 to 1876, and then spent a year exploring the Amazon and Tapaj√≥s Rivers. Back in the United States, he began working for Scribner's Magazine, writing on Brazil and frequently returning, once with the artist James Wells Champney. In 1880 he married Amelia \\"Daisy\\" Woolworth, also a naturalist. They lived in Brazil until 1886, travelling widely and visiting Paraguay but spending most time at Chapada dos Guimar√£es, where intensive collecting (especially of insects) resulted in the discovery of many new species. After a few months in Rio de Janeiro, they returned to the United States. The insect collections were purchased by William Jacob Holland and Frederick DuCane Godman. In 1889 Smith collected in Mexico for Godman, the results appearing in Biologia Centrali- Americanum.Electronic Biologia Centrali-Americana at www.sil.si.edu He was then commissioned by the Royal Society to collect in the West Indies (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and the Windward Islands, 1889‚Äì1895). He then became Curator at the Carnegie Museum. In 1898-1902 he collected in Colombia for the American Museum of Natural History, where two of his letters are kept,AMNH Research Library, Manuscripts and Personal Papers resuming curatorship of the Carnegie Museum on his return. The couple then moved to Alabama, where they gathered freshwater and land mollusks to supply a \\"Shell Syndicate\\" consisting mainly of private collectors. Herbert Smith's abilities were eventually recognized by Eugene Allen Smith, the State Geologist of Alabama, and he was hired on as Curator of the Alabama Museum of Natural History in 1910. The very many new species collected by Herbert Huntingdon and Daisy W. Smith were described by Frederick DuCane Godman and Herbert Druce (Lepidoptera); Samuel Wendell Williston (Diptera); William Harris Ashmead and Ezra Townsend Cresson (Hymenoptera); George Charles Champion (Coleoptera); Philip Reese Uhler and William Lucas Distant (Hemiptera). Smith's death was tragic. On his walk to work at the Alabama Museum of Natural History, the deaf naturalist, who had recently endured a bout of influenza, was hit by a train. The spot on the University of Alabama campus was known for many years as \\"Smith's Crossing.\\" Some of Smith's papers are preserved in the collections of the Geological Survey of Alabama. Unfortunately, the current whereabouts of his field notes are unknown. Amelia (Daisy) W. Smith Herbert Smith's collections were, following his marriage, made jointly with his wife Daisy, an expert collector, specimen preparator; and taxidermist. Usually called Daisy, she was the daughter of New York missionaries. The couple had one son. Bibliography * Smith. H. H. 1912.

Retreating ISIS fighters blew up parts of the castle, including the stairway leading to the entrance, causing extensive damage.

Overview The site is located near a narrow gap in the Euphrates Valley that is created by basalt outcrops and that is called al-khanuqa, or \\"the strangler\\". On the opposite river bank, some upstream, lies the contemporary fortress of Halabiye. Zalabiye was built during the third century CE when the short-lived Palmyrene Empire, centred on the oasis-city of Palmyra, extended its reach toward the Euphrates area. The fortifications of the site were subsequently improved under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527‚Äì565) as part of his program to strengthen the eastern border of the empire. The site originally had a rectangular shape surrounded by a fortification wall protected by square towers. Due to poor construction, the site has suffered from earthquakes and erosion by the Euphrates. Stones have also been used as ballast for the nearby railway. Today, only the eastern wall with eight towers and a gate remains. Beyond the city walls, on Zalabiye's north and east sides, lay extensive suburbs. Approximately upstream from Zalabiye, a dam had been built in the Euphrates with a diversion canal on the river's right bank. It is thought that the canal was constructed during the first century CE or possibly even during the Late Bronze Age. The Arabs named the canal after legendary queen Semiramis. The proposed construction of the Halabiye Dam will lead to the flooding of Zalabiye by the dam's reservoir and the Syrian government works with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNESCO to limit the impact of the dam on the ancient ruins of Halabiye and Zalabiye.

In 1984, he had ten lengths to spare over Little Bay, and in his final success, he finished the same distance in front of Far Bridge. As of 2020 he remains the only horse with three wins in the race. His final trip into the winner's enclosure came in January 1987. Badsworth Boy was diagnosed with navicular disease as a juvenile and suffered from arthritis throughout his life. Michael Dickinson described him as the best horse he ever trained. Retirement and death Badsworth Boy was retired to his owner's Little Lane Farm at Thorpe Hensley, near Rotherham. He died of a heart attack at the age of twenty-seven in October 2002.

It is a seasonal candy in Denmark and Sweden during Christmas. It is usually made using only chocolate (one-half to two-thirds) and coconut oil (one-third to one-half). The reference to ice in the name relates to the fact that it melts very easily in the mouth and is perceived to have a cooling effect as the heat energy is absorbed. This effect is due to the melting point of coconut oil lying between 20 and 23 degrees Celsius, around 10 degrees lower than chocolate. In some recipes, menthol is added, and in industrial production, urea is often added, which both increase the cooling sensation. Ischoklad is a popular Swedish Christmas treat. In Germany, the largest producer of Eiskonfekt is Eichetti.

He was one of the earliest French settlers of New France, having arrived in 1659. Biography According to Roland-J. Auger (1921-1982); a professional genealogist and former president of the Genealogical Society of Quebec; Jean Houymet crossed over to New France in 1659 on the ship called \\"Le Sacrifice d'Abraham\\" in the company of the first bishop of New France, Fran√ßois de Laval. Jean Houymet landed in Qu√©bec City on Monday, June 16 at around 6 pm. This fact was taken from the series of books titled \\"The Jesuit Relations\\". In New France, more precisely at Ch√¢teau-Richer, he was hired to work for Guillaume Thibault. In November 1659, he bought a plot of land measuring 2 arpents of frontage (about ) on the Saint Lawrence River near a stream named \\"La Rivi√®re du Sault-√†-la-Puce\\". The spelling as \\"Houymet\\" is the one written by the notary Claude Aubert, when he signed the marriage contract of Jean Houymet and Ren√©e Gagnon, daughter of Jean and Marguerite Cauchon, October 3, 1660 in the seignory of Beaupr√©. On the same document, Jean Houymet indicated his mark at the bottom of the marriage contract with the letter \\"W\\", which seems to suggest that the family name may have originally been \\"Wuillemet,\\" as was noted in the archives of the Marne department in France. The first child of this couple, a boy also named Jean, was born in the fall of 1661 in the parish of La Visitation de Notre-Dame (Our Lady of the Visitation) located in Ch√¢teau-Richer. On April 10, 1662, a few months after the birth of this first child, Jean Houymet bought a plot of land measuring 2 arpents of frontage on the St Lawrence River, on the northern portion of the Isle of Orleans. He settled there, with his family, in the parish of Sainte-Famille. Jean and Ren√©e had nine children, of which three boys and a girl (Jean, Louis, Pierre, and Marguerite) later married and bore descendants. Jean Houymet died on November 18, 1687, at the age of 53 in Sainte-Famille and was buried in the parish the following day. The value of Jean Houymet's estate at the time of his death can be found in the inventory of his belongings in a contract dated October 26, 1688, written by the notary Vachon. This document reveals that Jean Houymet was relatively rich at that time. Ren√©e Gagnon, his wife, died between 1695 and 1702. Today, the majority of their descendants are living in Montreal and Laval regions in the province of Qu√©bec.

Waltraut Carola Seitter was born in Zwickau in 1930, where her father worked as an engineer with the Horch automobile company. She went to school in Cologne, where she finished high school in 1949 (after jobs as tramway ticket collector, refugee aide, and draftswoman), and entered the university to study physics, mathematics, chemistry and astronomy. She continued her studies at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts with a grant from the Fulbright Program, obtained her Master of Arts in physics in 1955, and became astronomy instructor. From 1958 to 1962 she worked at Hoher List Observatory of Bonn University, obtained her Ph.D., and held the positions of assistant, observer, and extranumeral professor at Bonn University. In 1967, she was a guest professor of the American Astronomical Society at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, afterwards professor at Smith College (since 1973, Eliza Appleton Haven Professor for Astronomy). In 1975, she was called to the chair of astronomy at Muenster University in Germany (the first woman in Germany to hold an astronomy chair), and became director of the astronomical institute up to her retirement in 1995. When in Bonn, she worked on problems of stellar statistics and on spectral classification of stars, publishing the Bonn Spectral Atlas (in two volumes). In Muenster, with a dedicated team of young researchers, she organized the Muenster Redshift Project (MRSP), a method to derive redshifts from UK Schmidt telescope objective prism plates, and the Muenster Red Sky Survey, a galaxy catalogue of the southern hemisphere, based on ESO Schmidt direct red plates. With the MRSP data, first indications of the action of the cosmological constant were found, shortly before major supernova searches established its existence without doubt. During most of her career, she also did research on novae and related eruptive stars. Exhibits arranged by her include Women in Astronomy, and Science in Exile (Smith College), as well as Kepler and his times (Muenster 1980). She also organized several international astronomical meetings. Since 1975, Waltraut Seitter was married to Hilmar Duerbeck, a fellow astronomer. The asteroid (4893) Seitter is named after her.

Racing at age three, he got his first significant win in the Gallinule Stakes at the Curragh. He also lost by a head to Akiyda in the 1982 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the final race of his career. Ardross first raced for Ireland's Paddy Prendergast and, after his death, was bought by Charles St. George and trained by Henry Cecil in England, winning fourteen of his twenty-four starts, thirteen of them coming at Pattern level. He twice won the Ascot Gold Cup and the Yorkshire Cup. His other major successes came in the Prix Royal-Oak, the Doncaster Cup, and the Goodwood Cup. Before moving to Newmarket, he was runner-up to the Henry Cecil-trained Le Moss in the Ascot Gold Cup. Background Ardross was bred by trainer Paddy Prendergast for his American owner Elisabeth Ireland Poe, who was also the breeder of Meadow Court. His sire was Run the Gantlet, a son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inducteeTom Rolfe. His dam, Le Melody, was a daughter of Levmoss. Racing career =1979: three-year-old season= Ardross finished unplaced over ten furlongs on his racecourse debut and then created a 50/1 upset when winning the Group Two Gallinule Stakes at the Curragh by two lengths from Palace Dan. As a result of his success, he was required to carry a seven-pound weight penalty when he was sent to England to contest the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. He finished unplaced behind Ela-Mana-Mou and did not race again in 1979. =1980: four-year-old season= Ardross finished unplaced over ten furlongs on his first appearance as a four-year-old and was then moved up in distance for the Saval Beg Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. Racing over a distance of two miles, he established himself as a contender for the major staying races with a six-length victory over Croghan Hill. At Royal Ascot in June, Ardross started at odds of 6/1 for Britain's premier long-distance event, the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles. He was always in touch with the leaders and produced a sustained challenge in the straight but failed by three-quarters of a length to overhaul Le Moss. In the Goodwood Cup the following month, Le Moss and Ardross dominated the race, with the former prevailing by a neck after a prolonged struggle. The third and final meeting of the two stayers came in the Doncaster Cup in September. The result was the same, with Le Moss holding off the challenge of Ardross to win by a neck. In October, Ardross was matched against the Jockey Club Stakes winner More Light in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket Racecourse. Starting the 5/6 favourite and ridden for the first time by Lester Piggott, he appeared beaten two furlongs from the finish but produced a strong late run to win by one and a half lengths. On his final appearance of the season, Ardross was sent to France for the Prix Royal Oak over 3100 metres in which he finished third to the three- year-old filly Gold River. Ardross was never beaten again at a distance beyond one and a half miles. =1981: five-year-old season= For the 1981 season, Ardross raced in the ownership of Charles St George and was sent to England to be trained at Newmarket by Henry Cecil. He began his season in the Yorkshire Cup in May, when he started at odds of 2/1 and won by three lengths from Nicholas Bill. In the Ascot Gold Cup, he faced three opponents, only one of whom, the filly Shoot A Line, was given any chance against him. Starting at odds of 30/100, he was sent into the lead by Piggott with half a mile to run and won by a length from Shoot A Line. The Goodwood Cup attracted a bigger field, including the Queen Alexandra Stakes winner Donegal Prince and the Cesarewitch Handicap winner Popsi's Joy. Ardross won by a length from Donegal Prince at odds of 2/9, becoming the shortest-priced winner of the race since 1935. Having dominated the stayers, Ardross was moved down in distance for the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in August. Despite a slow early pace, he drew away in the straight to win by five lengths from Castle Keep and Cut Above. The form of the race was boosted when Cut Above defeated Shergar in the St Leger Stakes a month later. In October, Ardross contested France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, over 2400 metres at Longchamp. Drawn disadvantageously in 24 of 24 on the wide outside he started at odds of 11/2 and proved the best of the British challengers, finishing fifth behind Gold River, Bikala, April Run, and Perrault. Among the horses finishing behind Ardross were Argument, Akarad, Kings Lake, Blue Wind, Cut Above, Detroit, Ring the Bell, and Beldale Flutter. Three weeks later, Ardross faced Gold River for the third time in the Prix Royal Oak. He took the lead on the final turn and drew clear of the field to win by four lengths from Proustille, with Gold River a further two and a half lengths back in third, becoming the first older horse to win the race which had been restricted to three-year-olds until 1979. =1982: six-year-old season= Ardross began his six-year-old season by dropping back to one and a half miles for the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket in April. Starting at odds of 2/1, he won from Glint of Gold and Amyndas. In the following month, he claimed his second Yorkshire Cup, carrying top weight and winning by a length and a short head from Capstan and Little Wolf. Later in May, he again successfully conceded weight to Capstan to win the Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park Racecourse. On 17 June, Ardross started 1/5 favourite for his attempt to win a second Ascot Gold Cup. His only opponents were the French-trained horses El Badr and Tipperary Fixer, first and second in the Prix du Cadran, the Irish six-year-old Noelino and the Swedish-trained Dzudo, making up the smallest field for the race in sixty years. Piggott settled the favourite in fourth place as Dzudo made the pace from El Badr and Noelino. Noelino took the lead on the final turn, but Ardross moved up quickly on the inside to take the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by three lengths and a neck from Tipperary Fixer and El Badr. It was a fourth successive win in the race for Henry Cecil and an eleventh for Piggott. Ardross was dropped back in distance for the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket in July. Carrying top weight on firm ground, he finished third behind Height of Fashion and Amyndas. He missed the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Dianond Stakes before returning to form with comfortable wins in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes and the Doncaster Cup.In the autumn he ran second in his last try, and final race ever, at winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe where he was narrowly beaten a head by the French filly Akiyda. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Ardross a \\"superior\\" Ascot Gold Cup winner and the third best British or Irish trained horse foaled in 1976 behind Troy and Kris. Stud career When he went to stud, Ardross was syndicated for ¬£2 million, but none of his progeny came anywhere near his level of ability. His best flat horses were Karinga Bay (Gordon Stakes) and the filly Filia Ardross. Overall, he did better as a sire of jumpers, with the Champion Hurdle winner Alderbrook, Anzum, Young Kenny, and Ackzo to his credit. Karinga Bay sired Coneygree who won the 2015 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Ardross died of a heart attack at age 18 on February 19, 1994, at Southcourt Stud in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, England.

He succeeded the patriarch Sabrisho V ibn al-Masihi and was followed by Denha I.  Sources  Brief accounts of Makkika's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the fourteenth-century Nestorian writers Amr and Sliba.  Makkikha's election  Makkikha won the patriarchal election of 1257 by slandering his chief rival, the metropolitan and future patriarch Denha of Erbil, as a friend of the Mongol khans who was too dangerous to elect as patriarch. Bribery was commonplace in the patriarchal elections of the Church of the East at this period. The following account of Makkikha's election is given by Bar Hebraeus: > In the same year in which the Nestorian catholicus Sabrisho Bar Masihi died, > namely the year 654 of the Arabs [AD 1256/7], the bishops gathered together > at Baghdad, and a quarrel arose between the men of Baghdad and the bishops > over the election of the catholicus. Some men preferred Eliya, metropolitan > of Ilam, others Makkikha, metropolitan of Nisibis, and others still Denha, > metropolitan of Erbil. After wrangling amongst themselves for six months, > they began to outbid one another in offering bribes to the caliph, so that > the sum of money promised rose as high as 45,000 gold dinars. They were then > told that the man who first raised this sum and handed it over would be made > patriarch. Mar Denha of Erbil raised this sum and handed over 4,000 gold > dinars as a down payment, but his enemies slandered him, saying, 'He is a > friend of the Tartar kings, and any money you accept from him now he will > soon take back from you twofold.' The caliph's advisers believed this > slander, and the three metropolitans were accordingly summoned to the > caliph's palace, where an edict was read out conferring the leadership on > the elderly metropolitan of Nisibis instead of his younger colleague of > Erbil. Then the firman was given to Makkikha and the mitre was placed on his > head, and they made him ride around on a mule, accompanied by two noblemen > who held the firman above his head. And so he went down to the church of the > third ward, and the fathers accompanied him to Seleucia and consecrated him > on the fifth Sunday of Lent. They gave Mar Denha back his gold, and the > arrival of the Tartars in Baghdad not long afterwards freed the catholicus > Makkikha from having to pay back the money he himself had borrowed.Bar > Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 424‚Äì6  Makkikha's patriarchate  Makkikha is well known for his friendly relations with the Mongol Ilkhanate and his involvement in the Siege of Baghdad, where all Christians were spared at the intervention of the Mongol Hulagu's Nestorian Christian wife Dokuz Khatun.Maalouf, p. 243\\"A history of the Crusades\\", Steven Runciman, p.306 The year following the fall of Baghdad, the Mongol ruler Hulagu offered the royal palace to Makikha, and ordered a cathedral to be built for him.Foltz, p.123 See also * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East Notes References * Abbeloos, J.

The film was re-released by the Fleischers on February 5, 1929 through Paramount Pictures with a new soundtrack recorded in RCA Photophone. This second film was the first entry in the Fleischers' new series Screen Songs.

Based on the book of the same name by the author Raymond Briggs, the film was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom at Christmas 1998 and released on Buena Vista Home Video in the United States in 1998. The show won a Peabody Award in 1998.58th Annual Peabody Awards, May 1999. In 2000, it won the Golden Butterfly Award for the best short film in the international cinema competition of the 15th Isfahan International Film Festival for Children and Youth in Iran. Like The Snowman, the film does not have any spoken dialogue, although for the American version, Judi Dench narrates the film. The musical score was by Howard Blake and the end theme \\"Somewhere A Star Shines For Everyone\\" was sung by Charlotte Church. Plot A young Polar Bear cub chases a bird and is captured by sea men on a ship after he is spotted. The bear, now grown up in captivity, looks up at a star before lying down to sleep. The next day, a red haired girl named Tilly is on a daytrip to the London Zoo, but accidentally drops her teddy bear into the bear pen. The bear wakes up and spots the teddy, paws at the bear and carries it off to his cave as Tilly looks on shocked. That night, Tilly cries over her lost bear and her mother attempts to give her a toy rabbit for her to use as a sleeping comfort. Tilly takes the rabbit, but then throws it on the floor and turns to sleep. Later that night, a figure is seen walking towards Tilly's window ‚Äî it is the polar bear from the zoo with her lost teddy bear, who lifts her window and enters her room. The bear wakes Tilly up and returns her bear to her. Tilly looks up surprised to see the polar bear looking at her smiling. Then Tilly yawns and falls asleep again. Then the bear sleeps in Tilly's bed. The following morning, Tilly wakes up and runs downstairs to get some food for the bear. When she runs upstairs, she finds that the bear has excreted on the stairs. Tilly cleans up the waste and empties it outside before walking into the bathroom and nearly slipping over the bear's urine. Crossed, she then mops up the urine and watches on as the bear drinks out of the toilet. Then Tilly moves the bear and runs a bath to wash him. He soaks Tilly in the process of getting into it and already beginning to tire of him, she washes the bear. In the kitchen, Tilly dries and brushes the bear and proceeds to feed him with honey. While eating the honey, the bear makes a mess of the kitchen and gets his nose stuck in the jar (to Tilly's amusement). Then Tilly and the bear go to her parents' bedroom and sleep. Tilly wakes up to the sound of the door of her parents returning from work. She hugs her mother and they later sit down to watch The Snowman as the bear walks in and heads out. That night, the bear hides under Tilly's bed as she is put to bed by her mother. Tilly falls asleep and moves over as the bear climbs onto the bed with her. A gush of wind knocks a snowglobe from Tilly's bedside table, attracting the bear's attention who looks at it, seeing the mother bear and cub looking back at him. Tilly follows the bear outside where he looks at the sky. The pair move to a wide open park area where they meet the Star Bear, which is a bear shaped constellation (like The Great Bear) and the trio embark on a tour around London, showing a wide variety of notable landmarks such as Nelson's Column, and bringing a display of Christmas angels to life with a Father Christmas display also coming to life. Then the trio skate on the frozen River Thames (to the refrains of \\"Somewhere A Star Shines For Everyone\\") and travel further to the London Docks where a ship cuts through the ice where Tilly is left stranded but is saved by the bear before the moving ship passes. The Star Bear looks up to the North Star and the bear looks at Tilly. Tearfully they say goodbye and the bear returns to its own family. The Star Bear returns home with Tilly, who has been given a shining star (the size of a small stone). The Tower of London is seen and the bear pen in the London Zoo as Tilly looks on in amazement. The polar bear returns to his natural habitat to find his family waiting for him. As the sun rises the next morning, Tilly wakes up looking for her bear and to find that the windows open and the Star Bear's constellation is fading. As it does, the shining star vanishes from Tilly's hand, and she wonders about the bear from her window.

Early life and public service His great- grandfather, Chelebi Mentesh Bally, banker to the Grand Vizier of Istanbul, aided Nicholas Mavrocordato to ascend the throne of Wallachia in 1716, and was taken by him to Bucharest, where, in recognition of his services, he was made a court counselor and received various privileges and exemption from taxation for himself and his descendants. Bally's grandfather, Isaac, inherited the privileges of his father, and became the intimate counselor of many of the Phanariot princes: he was especially favored by Mavrogheni, whom he aided to mount the throne. His father, Abraham, studied at Leipzig, then established himself as wholesale merchant in Bucharest, and exercised considerable influence with the Boyars. When Davicion Bally was twelve years old his father died, and it seemed as if the son would have to terminate his studies at that age, for the father's partner defrauded the family out of almost all their possessions; but, thanks to an excellent library which the elder Bally left Davicion, he familiarized himself with the Romanian, Greek, French, Italian, and German languages, in addition to Spanish, which he had learned in his father's house. He also made considerable progress in the study of Hebrew. Bally occupied himself at first in the law office of his uncle, who had studied law at Leipzig, but was soon appointed \\"camarash\\" (treasurer) of the salt magazines established in the Danube ports; in this capacity in 1829 he saved from destruction the large stores of provisions and ammunition which the Russians had gathered at Zimnicea during the war against Turkey. In recognition Tsar Nicholas I conferred upon him the Order of St. Anna, sending it personally by the hand of General Kisselef, and awarded him the privilege of trading unrestrictedly throughout the Russian empire. In 1836 Bally was appointed cashier of the \\"agie\\" (police department), an office which he occupied for ten years without any remuneration. An ardent patriot, he even frequently provided the necessary funds for his office, at the same time contributed to the establishment of the first fire-brigade in Bucharest, and maintained at his own expense a band of Italian artists who were invited to that city to foster a taste for the theater in Wallachia. Wallachian Revolution of 1848 In 1848 Bally embraced the cause of the Revolution, and got to know its leaders. He proclaimed the Revolution before the time they had agreed, and it is said that he thereby saved the lives of some of the leaders, as he had learned that the government had become aware of their preparations, and was proceeding to crush the movement by the execution of its chief promoters. Bally rendered services to the revolutionary government, and at the risk of his life helped certain members of the fallen r√©gime to places of safety. But the Revolution failed three months later, and Bally aided those banished, and only escaped exile himself through his close relations with certain influential Boyars. Nevertheless, he was the subject of sharp animosity, and lost the greater part of his fortune in the episode. Later life When in 1858 there appeared in Bucharest an anti-Jewish pamphlet entitled \\"Prashtia\\" (The Sling) and issued from the printing-office of the archbishop, C. A. Rosetti, chief of the Liberal party, criticised the publication harshly in the \\"Romanul\\" at Bally's request; and at the same time the latter made representations to the prince-kaimacam, requesting the confiscation of the pamphlet. Bally was repeatedly elected member of the administrative council of the Sephardic community, and there maintained himself as a champion of reform. He had the statutes amended so as to permit a fairer representation, introduced the distribution of clothing and shoes to poor children, projected a series of reforms for the Talmud-Torah (1863), which later became a modern school, established a free-loan institution (1860), and a society for free medical attendance (1872). He found time withal for literary pursuits, and left behind him many manuscripts in Jud√¶o-Spanish. Troubled by what he saw as persecutions of Jews inaugurated in 1866 by his former friends and allies of the Revolution of 1848, he left Bucharest for Jerusalem in August, 1882, dying there two years later.

Even when he seems to cheat, whether it be through dandysme, calculation or contempt of his contemporaries, he is still telling the truth in a certain way: it is not him, it is his epoque, that is not frank. But Gigon does not cheat. He is too spiritual to do that. Destiny has placed him in a time of transition where the atomic centrifuge has scattered the last rays of light of impressionism, while little by little, the uncertain lines of a new world are being drawn, still in a state of vapour or project. At this crossroad, Gigon gives witness of continuity of the spirit, and the light in his work comes as if through the folds of a certain which has been half opened onto another world. There is something apocalyptic about his vision of heaven and earth. But is not that the time we are living in ? And the Apocalypse is not an end, it is the beginning of something else, a totally new era, for which Gigon already proposes the indestructible elements of his faith.‚Äù Andr√© Frossard, Author (‚Ä† 1995). ‚ÄúUnder the absorbing eye of a God always master of the universe, the apocalyptic frescoes of Michel Gigon unfold in centripetal swirls which recall, -but in a quasi abstract manner- the dantesque effusions of Signorelli, Michael Ange or Gustave Moreau. They are, however, different from them in that they have nothing pathetic or paroxysmal about them infused as they are by the peaceful anticipation of Christ‚Äôs return. What inspired work, fluid and dynamic ; one of the most cosmic and spiritual of our time.‚Äù Yann le Pichon, historian of Art. ‚ÄúGigon‚Äôs pictures are often qualified as catastrophic, even morbid or bewildering. Michel Gigon‚Äôs art is resolutely religious and Christian. This fact signifies and implies that a painter can dedicate himself totally to service of his faith. In doing so he does not give up his own personality, as is often insinuated, since it is precisely through it that both the visions and their representations are made possible. Simply putting all his strength, all his torment and all his joy in his work, he esteems that the whole of what he is, feels and thinks can find its unity only in God. God in no case demands the sacrifice of the thousand particularities that constitute an individual, but their subordination to a superior order capable of evaluating them according to their true hierarchy. Having said this -and there again, contrary to what one is accustomed to think, and in the case of artists such a fact is evident- a person does not belong less to his time because hi is a believer. To the contrary even, it is through his characteristics as a man of such or such an epoque that he finds his own way (leading him) to God.‚Äù Jil Silberstein author and poet, extract from his monograph of Michel Gigon. ‚ÄúIn present circumstances of stagnation or misleading or incertitude in painting, your singular work is more than an interrogation, it is a real provocation and should not leave people of good will insensitive.‚Äù Extract form Fran√ßois Mathey‚Äôs correspondence with Michel Gigon (‚Ä†1993), Custodian of the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris ‚ÄúMichel Gigon gathers hope amongst the brutal humanities. His painting fascinates and shocks. It invites us to displace our senses, to turn them toward a more interior perception. One must follow the rhythm of the beings who vacillate, pitch, struggle and fade away. Follow the wave of the rocks, the clouds and the flames. The light of God guides our steps. There will remain nothing but ourselves in it so that joy may last. So much the worse if it takes more courage to ‚Äòbe‚Äô than to please. Art cannot be anecdotic, it should carry its meaning beyond the explicit. In speaking to the soul which burns in us, Michel Gigon invites us to live better. In the lineage of painters inspired by the sacred, Michel Gigon is a contemporary artist outside convention.‚Äù Henry Gama. =Michel Gigon's stained-glass windows in France=  North of France  *Pas-de-Calais Courset, Chapelle du foyer de charit√© *Pas-de-Calais Saint- Omer, Chapelle de la Malassise ¬´ Ecole ¬ª *Pas-de-Calais Wisques, Abbaye des Moniales ¬´ Eglise ¬ª *Nord Aulnoye, Eglise Saint-Eloi *Nord Haumont, Eglise Saint-Michel *Nord Mont-des-Cats, Eglise paroissiale Paris area *Yvelines Andr√©sy, Parish church *Yvelines Bois d‚ÄôArcy, Parish church *Aisne Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Saint-Cr√©pin church *Val d'Oise Hodent near Magny-en-Vexin, stained-glass windows for an old monastic farm In Normandy *Seine- Maritime Le Havre, CES Viviani, dalle de verre *Calvados Goustranville, Parish church *Manche Bricquebec, Abbaye Notre Dame de Gr√¢ce *Manche Canville la Roque, Eglise Saint Malo (to see painting ¬´ Transfiguration ¬ª) *Manche Cosqueville, Parish church *Manche Tamerville, Parish church South of France *Lot Bovila, Parish church *Lot Rouillac, Parish church related to Montcuq *Lot Saint Geniez, Parish church related to Montcuq *Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne Aix-en-Provence, Chapelle du s√©minaire *Alpes-Maritimes Saint Honorat island, L√©rins Abbey And Also *Ardennes Dom-le-Mesnil, Parish church *Charente-Maritime Saint-Sauvant, Parish church *Eure-et-Loir Dreux, school of la Sablonni√®re, stained-glass window and mosaic *Morbihan Arzal, church of Lantierne French Bibliography * Revue Vitrea: Vitrail - Verre - Architecture - Le vitrail fran√ßais moderne Revue du centre international du vitrail - n¬∞ 4 - 2eme semestre 1989 ISSN 0991-0131 Page 52: Les peintres et le vitrail =About Michel Gigon= * Monograph \\"Michel Gigon\\" Jil Silberstein, preface from Andr√© Frossard (1980). * Le vitrail fran√ßais contemporain Fran√ßoise Perrot - Centre international du vitrail - Chartres Edition: L'oeil & la main - La manufacture Diffusion LA MANUFACTURE 1984 Page 68 * Le vitrail Contemporain \\"Comme un chant de lumi√®re\\" Jean-Marie Geron - Albert Moxhet Edition: Dexia - La renaissance du livre Collection R√©f√©rences Pages 18, 146, 147 * Revue: Exposition - Un siecle de vitrail en picardie association Monuments de picardie April 1987 * L'Homme nouveau - Number 1411 - December 22sd 2007 Pages 4, 5 Portrait \\"Un artiste d√©concertant\\" Genevi√®ve Bayle  External links  * a few works from Gigon * drouot-cotation: other works * Arte Comunicarte Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French male painters Category:21st-century French painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:Abstract artists Category:French stained glass artists and manufacturers Category:1929 births Category:Living people ","title":"Michel Gigon"},{"id":"15003389","text":"Ingrebourne Marshes are a 74.8 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering.

One of the leading two-year-olds of 1901, he improved in 1902 to win The Derby, defeating the filly Sceptre. He returned from Injury problems to record his most important success when he defeated Sceptre and the Derby winner Rock Sand in the 1903 Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. He was then retired from racing and exported to Germany where he became a successful sire of winners. Background Ard Patrick was an exceptionally big brown horse, reportedly standing 17 hands high, who was bred by his owner John Gubbins at his Knockany Stud near Bruree, County Limerick, Ireland, (at that time part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) and named after the nearby village of Ardpatrick (Ard P√°draig). He was sired by St Florian, a well-bred horse by St Simon, who had an unremarkable record both as a racehorse and as a sire. He was a member of Thoroughbred Family Number 20, which at that time had a poor record of producing breeding stallions. His dam, Morganette, by Springfield was a roarer and did not advance beyond selling plates in her racing career, but proved an excellent broodmare. Before giving birth to Ard Patrick she had produced Galtee More who won the Triple Crown in 1897, and also Blairfinde a winner of the Irish Derby.Leicester, Sir Charles, Bloodstock Breeding, J.A. Allen & Co, London, 1969 Gubbins sent his colt into training with Sam Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. Racing record =1901: two-year-old season= Ard Patrick was a \\"powerful and massively- built youngster\\" who was slow to mature and did not appear on the racecourse before autumn. He made his debut in one of the season's most valuable races for juveniles, the six furlong Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton on 12 October. Carrying 119 pounds he won by a head from Royal Lancer who was carrying three pounds more. Four days later he met Royal Lancer again in the Clearwell Stakes at Newmarket and won by a neck, receiving three pounds. On his third and final start of the year he finished second to the black filly Game Chick in the Dewhurst Stakes. At the end of the season Ard Patrick was being offered by the bookmakers at odds of 7/1 for the following year's Derby, the other leading fancies being Duke of Westminster (the horse, not the owner) and William Collins Whitney's American import Nasturtium. =1902: three-year- old season= Ard Patrick as a three-year-old According to press reports, Gubbins turned down an offer of 20,000 guineas for his colt from an unnamed source. As a three-year-old, Ard Patrick was slow to reach peak fitness. In the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 30 April he was ridden by Kempton Cannon and started at odds of 9/2 in a field of fourteen runners behind the joint favourites Sceptre and Duke of Westminster. Sceptre won the race in a record time of 1:39.0, beating Pistol by two lengths with Ard Patrick a further three lengths further back in third. He then finished second in a Three-year-old Plate over one mile at Kempton in which he attempted to conceded twenty-two pounds to Royal Ivy and was beaten two lengths. On his final start before the Derby, Ard Patrick finished first in the Newmarket Stakes on 14 May, beating Fowling Piece by a head, but was disqualified for \\"bumping and boring\\" and relegated to third place behind Fowling Piece and Royal Lancer. He had looked likely to win easily before struggling and drifting from a straight course in the last fifty yards, leading some to question the colt's attitude. At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 4 June, Ard Patrick was ridden by the American jockey John \\"Skeets\\" Martin and started at odds of 100/14 for the Derby in a field of eighteen runners. Sceptre who had also won the 1000 Guineas started evens favourite, having been the subject of an unprecedented gamble which saw her backed to win over half a million pounds. The King and Queen were in attendance for the \\"Coronation\\" Derby but the crowd was smaller than usual as a result of heavy rain. Ard Patrick was in the leading group from the start and went to the front just after half way, followed by Sceptre, Rising Glass and Csardas. In the straight Ard Patrick pulled clear and won easily by three lengths from Rising Glass, with Friar Tuck third and Sceptre fourth. According to \\"Robin Hood\\" in The Australasian Ard Patrick confounded those critics who had questioned his temperament as he \\"finished like a lion and as straight as an arrow.\\" The remainder of Ard Patrick's three-year-old campaign was disappointing as he failed to reproduce his Epsom form. At Royal Ascot on 17 June he started 11/10 favourite for the thirteen furlong Prince of Wales's Stakes in which he was required to concede weight to seven opponents. The Duke of Westminster's Cupbearer, who was receiving thirteen pounds from the Derby winner, won the race by three-quarters of a length from Ard Patrick, but was disqualified for \\"bumping and boring\\" the runner-up and placed last after an objection. Ard Patrick then developed leg trouble and was withdrawn from the Eclipse Stakes, which was won by Cheers, a colt he had beaten at both Epsom and Ascot. He also missed the St Leger his intended autumn target, which was won in his absence by Sceptre. Ard Patrick returned on 1 October for the ¬£10,000 Jockey Club Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Newmarket. Carrying 131 pounds, he finished third to Rising Glass (119 pounds) and the four-year-old Templemore (122). =1903: four-year-old season= The finish of the 1903 Eclipse Stakes: Ard Patrick beats Sceptre Before the start of the 1903 season, Gubbins reportedly turned down an offer of ¬£15,000 for Ard Patrick from Samuel S. Brown of Pittsburgh. Ard Patrick showed his best form in two races as a four-year-old. He made his first appearance on 1 July in the ¬£10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket. He conceded weight to his opponents and won \\"in a canter\\" from Royal Lancer and Cheers. Before his next race, Ard Patrick was sold as a prospective stallion to Count Lehndorff acting for the German government for ¬£21,000, although a condition of the sale was that he would run in Gubbins' colours in his remaining races. The 1903 Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 17 July was one of the most anticipated British races of the early 20th century with Ard Patrick and Sceptre facing that year's Epsom Derby winner, Rock Sand. The race thus brought together \\"the three best horses in England\\", and perhaps \\"the most valuable field of horses that ever started in a race in any part of the world\\". The King was among the immense crowd which was drawn to Sandown for the \\"Battle of Giants\\". The odds at the start were 5/4 Rock Sand, 7/4 Sceptre and 5/1 Ard Patrick. Ard Patrick was settled in third behind Rock Sand in the early stages by his rider Herbert \\"Otto\\" Madden, before going to the front and leading into the straight. As Rock Sand weakened, Sceptre emerged as the only challenger and looked the likely winner a furlong from the finish but Ard Patrick rallied and got the better of a \\"desperate finish\\" to win by a neck with Rock Sand three lengths away in third. The contest was favourably compared to the race for the 1887 Hardwicke Stakes between Ormonde, Minting and Bendigo. This was the second time in three attempts that Ard Patrick had beaten Sceptre. A rematch between Ard Patrick, Sceptre and Rock Sand was expected in the Jockey Club Stakes, but Ard Patrick's leg problems recurred and he never raced again. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Ard Patrick a \\"great\\" Derby winner and the twentieth best British-trained racehorse of the 20th Century. The authors described Ard Patrick as \\"the greatest unsung hero of British Flat racing.\\" Stud record Retired to stud duty, he was the Leading sire in Germany three times and notably sired Deutsches Derby winner, Ariel, the successful mare Antwort and the dams of Herold and Alchemist.Pryor, Peter, The Classic Connection, Cortney Publications, Luton, 1979 On 5 April 1923 it was reported that Ard Patrick had died after failing to recover from the effects of an experimental procedure known as a \\"Steinach rejuvenation operation\\".

He won the 2000 Guineas in 1926 and the Eclipse Stakes in 1927. He was also noted for his rivalry with the Derby winner Coronach whom he defeated on three of their four meetings. Background Until the emergence of Fairway at the end of the decade, Colorado was regarded as the best racehorse sired by Phalaris, who became the most influential stallion of the 20th Century. His dam, Canyon, won the 1000 Guineas in 1916 and was a successful broodmare. In addition to Colorado she produced the Eclipse Stakes winner Caerleon. He was a small, but powerfully built colt standing just over 15 hands, known to be a particular favourite of his owner, Lord Derby. He was trained at Lord Derby's Stanley House stable by George Lambton who found him a difficult horse to prepare because of his habit of \\"choking\\" in exercise gallops. Racing career =1925: two-year-old season= Colorado was a leading two-year-old in 1925, winning the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. In the Free Handicap, an official assessment of the year's two-year-olds, Colorado was assesses on 118lbs, eight pounds below the joint topweights Coronach and Legatee. =1926: three-year- old season= At three he won the Union Jack Stakes over a mile at Liverpool in March but worked poorly before the 2000 Guineas and started at 100/8 behind the strongly favoured Coronach. Colorado \\"dashed\\" into the lead in the final furlong and went clear to win by five lengths, giving Lord Derby his first win in the race. He started favourite for the Derby but Coronach reversed the placings, winning by five lengths, with Colorado losing second place by a short head to Lancegaye. Weston, was certain that he would have at least been closer at Epsom if he had not been instructed to employ exaggerated waiting tactics. His cause was not helped when he had to swerve when a spectator's dog ran onto the course. In his next race Colorado started odds-on favourite for the Rous Memorial Stakes at Royal Ascot, but finished third of the four runners. =1927: four-year-old season= After having taken a long time to recover his form after the Derby, Colorado returned to beat Coronach in their two meetings in 1927. He was unplaced on his debut, but won the one and a half mile Newbury Summer Cup in June. In a much anticipated race for the Princess of Wales's Stakes Tommy Weston tracked Coronach in the early stages before moving Colorado up to challenge for the lead. After a brief \\"duel\\" Colorado pulled away to win by eight lengths. In the Eclipse Stakes he beat the three- year-old Mario by six lengths with Coronach a length further back in third. In the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October he was narrowly beaten by the French-trained Asterus and was retired to stud as the winner of nine races, worth ¬£30,358. Stud career Colorado died on 16 September 1929, after only two seasons at stud, of gastroenteritis. He had made a promising start as a stallion, siring Felicitation who defeated Hyperion in the 1934 Ascot Gold Cup. He also got the Eclipse Stakes winner Loaningdale, Scarlet Tiger, who was third in the St. Leger, the top sprinter Coroado and the very versatile Colorado Kid. Pedigree * Colorado was inbred 3 √ó 4 to St Simon, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Thomas A Dorsey =Marker text= Thomas A. Dorsey historical markerTHOMAS A. DORSEY Father of Gospel Thomas Andrew Dorsey, composer of over 400 blues and gospel songs, lived here following his birth in Villa Rica on July 1, 1899. At Mt. Prospect Baptist Church he was exposed to shape-note singing and at home learned to play a used pump organ, experiences he said \\"sprang\\" his career. The young blues pianist moved to Chicago in 1919 in the Great Migration. Dorsey wrote the world's most popular gospel-blues song after his wife and newborn son died unexpectedly on August 26 and 27, 1932. That song, Take My Hand, Precious Lord has been translated into 32 languages. Aretha Franklin recorded Take My Hand, Precious Lord in 1956, the same year Tennessee Governor Frank Clement recited it during hsi keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. It became the anthem of Fannie Lou Hamer's Mississippi Summer. Dorsey's friend, Mahalia Jackson, sang it at Martin Luther King, Jr.'s funeral. Elvis Presley's recording of Dorsey's second-most-popular gospel song, Peace in the Valley, sold millions of copies. For a while, any new gospel-blues song, regardless of who wrote it, was called a \\"Dorsey\\" until Dorsey himself coined the name \\"gospel\\". Dorsey died in Chicago on January 23, 1993. 022-8 GEORGIA HISTORIC MARKER 1994 =Historical information= This historical marker sits alongside U.S. Hwy 78 because the actual house Dorsey was born in has been gone a long time. Dorsey's home was approximately 1/4 mile NNW of the marker's location. The Mt. Prospect Baptist Church building Dorsey learned music in has also been gone a long time although the church itself is still an active part of the Villa Rica community. Thomas Andrew Dorsey (July 1, 1899, Villa Rica, Georgia - January 23, 1993, Chicago), is known as \\"the father of gospel music\\". Earlier in his life he was a leading blues pianist known as Georgia Tom. As formulated by Dorsey, gospel music combines Christian praise with the rhythms of jazz and the blues. Dorsey was the music director at Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago from 1932 until the late 1970s. His best-known composition, \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\", was performed by Mahalia Jackson and was a favorite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and \\"Peace in the Valley\\", which was a hit for Red Foley in 1951 and has been performed by dozens of other artists, including Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored his album Precious Lord: New Recordings of the Great Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey (1973), by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry. Villa Rica Explosion =Marker text= Villa Rica Explosion historical markerVilla Rica Explosion Around 11:00 a.m. on December 5, 1957, a natural gas leak under Berry‚Äôs Pharmacy caused an explosion that destroyed four buildings and damaged several others in Villa Rica‚Äôs downtown. The explosion killed twelve and injured twenty. The tragedy highlighted the need for both an organized local emergency response unit and the use of odor in the natural gas supply. The civil defense unit that resulted became a model for west Georgia. Ensuing litigation placed a considerable financial burden on the city, suppressing economic development for years. In terms of injury and loss of life, the explosion remains the most catastrophic event in Carroll County history. 2007.11 Erected by the Georgia Historical Society, City of Villa Rica, and Villa Rica Downtown Development Authority 22-1 =Historical information= This historical marker sits in front of Berry's Pharmacy on U.S. Route 78 in downtown Villa Rica. The building was completely destroyed but was immediately rebuilt and served as a pharmacy until the late 1990s. A restoration project began in 2005 and the building was reopened to the public on December 5, 2007, the 50th anniversary of the explosion. The other three neighboring stores destroyed by the explosion were Harris Five and Ten Cent Store, Reeves Jewelry, and A & B Dress Shop. Numerous local citizens and groups responded to the emergency including fire and police forces from four surrounding counties, Civil Defense, the Army National Guard, the Georgia State Patrol, the high school football team, the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, and two fire companies from the City of Atlanta. Southwire, a major manufacturer from nearby Carrollton, supplied cranes to help move debris in the search for victims. Crews from Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas and Light Company stayed for several days to ensure there was no further danger. And Americans from as far away as California and New York State sent contributions and letters of condolence to the local ministers to help with the aftermath of the tragedy.Mary Talley Anderson (1976), The History of Villa Rica (City of Gold), Privately Published.Program, 50th Anniversary Remembrance Ceremony, December 5, 2007, Villa Rica Historic Preservation Committee. The Grove =Marker text= THE GROVE In the mid-17th century, John Tyson traveled from the British Isles to Virginia. Over the next 200 years, his descendents migrated to North Carolina and on to Georgia. Alexander, Clement, and Jehu Tyson and their mother Penelope settled this land in 1853. Their children, including Willie, Joseph T., and Solomon, were born here and helped establish local churches and schools. Descendents of Willie's five children, Oscar, Lizzie T. Gardner, Tom, Fannie T. Payne, and Will D., consider this their ancestral home and return to the Grove each year to renew family ties.

FOOD was a place where artists in SoHo, especially those who were later involved in Avalanche magazine and the Anarchitecture group, could meet and enjoy food together. FOOD was considered to be both a business and an artistic \\"intervention in an urban setting.\\" It has also been called a \\"landmark that still resonates in the history and mythology of SoHo in the 1970s.\\"  History  Before they founded FOOD, Goodden and Matta-Clark were already cooking for artists in New York and were already known for throwing dinner parties for friends, mainly hosted at their loft. In 1971, they roasted an entire pig under the Brooklyn Bridge. The roast was known as the Brooklyn Bridge Event. The Event was accompanied by outdoor sculpture and celebrated the opening of the Alternative Gallery Space on Greene Street. The sculptures at the pig roast had been curated by Alanna Heiss of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA.) Music for the roast was done by Dickie Landry and the Phillip Glass Ensemble. Matta-Clark suggested to Goodden the idea for a restaurant, which she found appealing. They chose a location in SoHo on the corner of Prince and Wooster streets. There was a struggling restaurant there called Comidas Criollas and Goodden negotiated the lease from them. At that time, SoHo was considered a cultural desert, with struggling businesses. Goodden had access to an inheritance which she was able to use as the initial investment for the restaurant. Gooden and Matta-Clark wanted to create a space where they could help their friends find jobs while giving people a place to eat in what would later be known as SoHo. Matta-Clark and Girouard began to renovate the place. FOOD opened in October 1971 at 127 Prince Street. During the renovations, Matta-Clark was inspired to do some of his original \\"cutting\\" art works. FOOD was intended to be a simple project designed to bring the artistic community together. Artists were invited to be guest chefs, as well as working at the restaurant on a regular basis. There was no ordering of many different dishes at FOOD, diners ate what was offered on that day. The menu was simple and affordable. Meals included items like raw mackerel in wasabi sauce, Creole- style stuffed tongue and anchovy onion pie. FOOD was considered to be an \\"active and dynamic site\\" which served nearly one hundred people daily in 1972. In 1972 Matta-Clark created a 43-minute documentary of the restaurant. He was often seen as the center of the energy surrounding FOOD restaurant. FOOD only lasted about three years with the original founders. After Matta- Clark lost interest in the project and Goodden was left to carry on mostly on her own. Eventually, the restaurant was handed over to new operators who ran FOOD until the 1980s. However, FOOD did not retain its artistic roots under the new management.  Legacy  FOOD was said to inspire others who create food art, or work in the field of relational art.\\" Many famous artists and performers, such as Donald Judd, Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage created meals at FOOD. The cooking and the meals themselves were a kind of a performance art, especially the soup. Gooden felt that soup could be used as a sort of \\"painting\\" for the table. Matta-Clark developed a meal that he based on bones called Matta-Bones which cost $4. After the meal, the bones were used to create necklaces for the diner to wear. Matta-Bones once served over 100 people and after they ate, Richard Peck scrubbed the bones clean in the kitchen after which Hisachika Takahashi, an assistant to Rauschenberg and a jeweler, drilled holes in the bones so that they could be strung onto rope. Another unusual meal was made of living brine shrimp swimming in egg whites called Alive. Perhaps the most unusual dinner was never realized: Mark di Suvero wished to serve meals through the windows of the restaurant using a crane and directing diners to eat with tools such as screwdrivers and hammers. FOOD was noted for using fresh and seasonal foods, which was a \\"vaguely countercultural\\" idea for the time. FOOD was one of the first New York restaurants to serve sushi which had been suggested by Takahashi. Another unusual feature of FOOD was that it was one of the first places to serve vegetarian meals. FOOD also \\"championed\\" the use of the open kitchen which is seen in many modern restaurants. Other famous artists who were frequently seen at FOOD included the members of Mabou Mines, the Phillip Glass group and dancers of Grand Union.  FOOD 1971/2013  The Frieze Art Fair recognized the contributions of FOOD to the artistic community in 2013 by inviting several chefs from the original FOOD to participate at the fair. Goodden and Girouard both contributed to the tribute of FOOD with Goodden preparing her famous soups and Girouard paying homage to the pig roast under the Brooklyn Bridge. FOOD 1971/2013 was created by curator, Ceclia Alemani and conceived of as a special project for the fair.

Biography  He is the son of the engineer Jo√£o Nobre and of Anita Nobre. His mother, Anita Nobre, controlled three pagode bands, where Dudu, already in his infancy, used to play with tam-tam and pandeiro with the same ease that his neighbors were applied in marbles. And he did not reject this apprenticeship in his backyard. Official Site As a result, when he was six years old, he started to study classic piano, and when he was nine he received the instrument that would never separate from him‚Äîthe cavaquinho. When Dudu was ten years old, he initiated his career in the samba schools for beginners. There he met the mythical Beto \\"Sem Bra√ßo\\" (Without arm) and the two starred in the samba- enredo of Alegria da Passarela, a school that later became Aprendizes do Salgueiro, the school for beginners owned by GRES Acad√™micos do Salgueiro. \\"Beto was one of the most experienced (sambistas) that I ever knew,\\" Dudu cites in his official site. After this he attributed credit to three sambas in Aprendizes do Salgueiro, another in Herdeiros da Vila, and one more in Estrelinha da Mocidade and also in Imp√©rio do Futuro. This as an adolescent composer. As a musician, when he was thirteen he made a cycle of shows with Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel and when he was 15 he rotated in Switzerland, Finland, England, and Germany, with Cia. Brasiliana. Back in Brazil, he joined the band of Almir Guineto and later played with Dicr√≥ and Pedrinho da Flor. When Dudu was 19 years old, he joined the band of Zeca Pagodinho, same epoch when Dudu entered into the Law Faculty. The advocacy was repealed in the fifth year.Getmein Dudu writes that \\"Zeca is a godfather. And he tells me that the samba is a passion and that I was chosen by the samba\\".

Between 1840 and his death he served as rabbi of W√ºrzburg, and is therefore often referred to by his position as the W√ºrzburger Rav. Life He commenced his yeshiva studies in F√ºrth at the age of fifteen, under Rabbis Wolf Hamburger and Judah Leib Halberstadt. Five years later he received semicha (rabbinic ordination), but did not enter the rabbinate because a university degree was required for that in 19th-century Germany. He opened a general business store in Kitzingen. The store was not successful (possibly because Bamberger preferred to spend as much time as possible studying Talmud). He married two years later, to the daughter of Rabbi Seckel Wormser of Fulda. In 1838 he represented the Orthodox camp at a conference instigated by the Bavarian government at which several Reform-minded notables had hoped to bring about changes in the organisation of the Jewish communities. As a result of his success at this conference he was invited to succeed Abraham Bing as rabbi of W√ºrzburg. In W√ºrzburg he rapidly opened a yeshiva. In 1855 he opened an elementary school, the first of its kind in Germany (previously children had been instructed in small synagogue schools). In 1864, after a two-year preparation, he also opened a seminary specifically for the training of teachers of Jewish subjects, of which there was a shortage in Germany. This yeshiva was called Bais Medrash L'Morim (◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊û◊ì◊®◊© ◊ú◊û◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù - A House of Learning for Teachers) or in German Israelitische-Lehrer-Bildungs-Anstalt often referred to by its initials I.L.B.A. Works Bamberger was one of the last rabbinical writers in Germany. His first work was Melecheth Shamayim (◊û◊ú◊ê◊õ◊™ ◊©◊û◊ô◊ù - The Work of the Heavens, Altona, 1853, a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 13a) on the laws pertaining to Torah scrolls, tefillin (phylacteries) and mezuzot (door scrolls). A work first published in 1858 titled Amirah le-Beth Ya'akov (◊ê◊û◊ô◊®◊î ◊ú◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë - Words to the House of Jacob, a reference to Exodus 19:2 and Rashi's commentary there) deals with the three areas of practical Jewish law pertaining specifically to women: niddah (separation during menstruation), challah (a tithe from dough) and the lighting of candles on the night of the Shabbat. [There is also a section dealing with the laws of Melicho.] Originally published in his native German, subsequent publications have been made in multiple languages. The original Hebrew translation was produced by Rabbi Simcha Bamberger.See Korban Mincha Siddur; New addition of ◊ê◊û◊®◊ô◊î ◊ú◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë An English translation was produced by Rabbi I. Nathan Bamberger. More than a dozen editions have been published to date. It has been widely translated and is still in use today. The famed Korban Mincha Siddur (◊°◊ô◊ì◊ï◊® ◊ß◊®◊ë◊ü ◊û◊†◊ó◊î) includes a copy of the Amirah le-Beth Ya'akov. Other great rabbinic luminaries such as Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank wrote additions to this work. Those additions have been included in the most recent editions of this work. A modern day chalitza shoe designed after the chalitza shoe used by the W√ºrzburger Rav, Rabbi Seligmann B√§r Bamberger. Moreh la-Zovechim (◊û◊ï◊®◊î ◊ú◊ñ◊ë◊ó◊ô◊ù - Teacher for those who bring Sacrifices, 1863) deals with the practical laws of shechita (ritual slaughter). Nachalath Devash (◊†◊ó◊ú◊ô ◊ì◊ë◊© - An Inheritance of Honey, 1867) deals primarily with the halizah ritual, and his work Yitzchak Yeranen (◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ß ◊ô◊®◊†◊ü - Isaac will Rejoice, 1861-2, a reference to the Sabbath afternoon prayers) is a commentary on Shaarei Simcha (◊©◊¢◊®◊ô ◊©◊û◊ó◊î) by Rabbi Yehuda ibn Gayat. This work in particular was a great breakthrough in the world of academia since it was the first time that this manuscript had been printed. Koreh be-Emeth (◊ß◊ï◊®◊ê ◊ë◊ê◊û◊™ - Reading in Truth, 1871 and 1879, a reference to Psalms 145:18) addresses Torah exegesis where Talmud or Midrash use changes in letters to derive meanings from particular words. In 1850 he published a pamphlet outlining the attitude towards non-Jews in the Talmud. This was intended to inform a debate in the Bavarian parliament on civil rights for the Jews. The Austrittsgesetz On 28 July 1876 the German parliament passed the Austrittsgesetz, which allowed Jews to secede from their religious community. Many Jewish communities had by that time been dominated by the Reform movement, with Orthodox members forming informal groups (minyanim) to represent their interests. Following the passing of the Austrittsgesetz, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch of Frankfurt, who had campaigned for the law to be passed, declared that Orthodox Jews in Frankfurt had the duty to officially secede from the Liberal Grossgemeinde. Bamberger visited Frankfurt, and declared that this was not mandatory. A heated exchange of open letters followed between the rabbis. The conflict ultimately led to only a relatively small number of Orthodox Jews seceding from the main community, and until the Second World War there were two Orthodox communities in Frankfurt: one under the auspices of the Grossgemeinde and the other one being Hirsch's community Adath Yeshurun.

Glutaminolysis: an important energy source in tumor cells Glutaminolysis takes place in all proliferating cells, such as lymphocytes, thymocytes, colonocytes, adipocytes and especially in tumor cells. In tumor cells the citric acid cycle is truncated due to an inhibition of the enzyme aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3) by high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) Aconitase catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. On the other hand, tumor cells over express phosphate dependent glutaminase and NAD(P)-dependent malate decarboxylase, which in combination with the remaining reaction steps of the citric acid cycle from Œ±-ketoglutarate to citrate impart the possibility of a new energy producing pathway, the degradation of the amino acid glutamine to glutamate, aspartate, pyruvate CO2, lactate and citrate. Besides glycolysis in tumor cells glutaminolysis is another main pillar for energy production. High extracellular glutamine concentrations stimulate tumor growth and are essential for cell transformation. On the other hand, a reduction of glutamine correlates with phenotypical and functional differentiation of the cells. = Energy efficacy of glutaminolysis in tumor cells= *one ATP by direct phosphorylation of GDP *two ATP from oxidation of FADH2 *three ATP at a time for the NADH + H+ produced within the Œ±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction, the malate dehydrogenase reaction and the malate decarboxylase reaction. Due to low glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities, in tumor cells the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate mainly takes place via glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase. =Advantages of glutaminolysis in tumor cells= *Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the plasma and an additional energy source in tumor cells especially when glycolytic energy production is low due to a high amount of the dimeric form of M2-PK. *Glutamine and its degradation products glutamate and aspartate are precursors for nucleic acid and serine synthesis. *Glutaminolysis is insensitive to high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). *Due to the truncation of the citric acid cycle the amount of acetyl-CoA infiltrated in the citric acid cycle is low and acetyl-CoA is available for de novo synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. The fatty acids can be used for phospholipid synthesis or can be released. *Fatty acids represent an effective storage vehicle for hydrogen. Therefore, the release of fatty acids is an effective way to get rid of cytosolic hydrogen produced within the glycolytic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.9) reaction. *Glutamate and fatty acids are immunosuppressive. The release of both metabolites may protect tumor cells from immune attacks. *It has been discussed that the glutamate pool may drive the endergonic uptake of other amino acids by system ASC. *Glutamine can be converted to citrate without NADH production, uncoupling NADH production from biosynthesis.

The association never had more than 500 members. It was the first Scout association in Germany to admit boys and girls. It was interdenominational and politically neutral. History =1923-1933= Since 1923, there had been Scout groups within the International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT) in Germany. There was a strong influence from the Neupfadfinder. The Neupfadfinder was a group of German and Austrian Scouters and Scouts, who tried to modernize Scouting under the influence of the Wandervogel movement and of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. They founded among other things a publishing house and published the translation of the books of John Hargrave in their Verlag Der Wei√üe Ritter. The Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder continued the traditions and style of the Neupfadfinder, after the Neupfadfinder and other groups of the German Youth Movement founded the Deutsche Freischar. In 1927 there were three Scout groups which formed the District Sturmtrupp S√ºd: * Jukkasj√§rvi in Stuttgart * R√ºppurr, named after a quarter of Karlsruhe, in Karlsruhe * W√∂lfe in Mannheim In the following years, Scout groups of the association were founded all over the German Reich, and groups of the Wandervogel and other Scout associations joined. In 1929, Erich M√∂nch (Scout name: Schnauz) and Helmuth H√∂vetborn (Scout name: Doktor) founded the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder-die Reichspfadfinderschaft im Deutschen Guttemplerorden (IOGT). After the Bundesthing (general assembly) in Ro√ülau the name was changed in \\"Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder, eine deutsche Waldritterschaft\\". Helmut H√∂vetborn and Erich M√∂nch became Chief Scouts. At the National Jamboree () in 1931 at the Hoher Mei√üner, the Districts \\"Sturmtrupp Nord\\" and \\"Sturmtrupp Mitte\\" became part of the Scout association. In 1932 it became an independent organization. Scout groups within the IOGT were founded in the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder had strong contacts with groups in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Still active is the Nykterhetsr√∂relsens Scoutf√∂rbund, it is the Scout association of the IOGT in Sweden. There were plans to found a federation with the groups in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Germany and name it Northern European Scout Association (). =1933-1945= In 1934, the last meeting of the association took place. Shortly after, the voluntary liquidation followed, the equipment and the Scout houses were destroyed, so that the Hitler Youth was not able to take them. The Scout center Jungenland was sold in 1934. Scouting continued in different ways: *The Scout group R√ºppurr and the Cub Scout pack Zeisige in Karlsruhe joined the Reichsschaft Deutscher Pfadfinder (another Scout association), that was banned shortly afterwards. *The Scout group Grauer Reiter in Soldin continued its work until it had to join the army. All its members died on the Eastern Front. This group consisted of sons of farmers and were horse riders. *The Scout group Braune B√§ren in Berlin was able to continue as a special unit called Technische Bereitschaft within the Hitler Youth until 1939, when the unit was disbanded. New members gave the Scout Promise. Helga Barth, the Cubmaster of the pack Zeisige in Karlsruhe, was arrested and died in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. =1945-1948= In 1945, there were plans of a re-foundation by the Chief Scout Helmut H√∂vetborn and other old scouts of the association. In 1946, former members of the Scout group R√ºppurr met in Ettlingen. In 1947, there were groups in Mannheim, Heidelberg and Karlsruhe. The Landesmark Nordbaden and later the T√ºbinger Bund were founded and allowed by the French Military government. On 14 March 1948, the Chief Scout Helmut H√∂vetborn died. He was succeeded by Richard K√∂nig (Scout name: Alter), a member of the Scout group R√ºppurr. The T√ºbinger Bund had contacts with Scout groups in Bavaria, Hesse and Alexander Lion, one of the founders of German Scouting. In 1948, the T√ºbinger Bund joined the Bund Deutscher Pfadfinder, the interreligious member organization of the Ring deutscher Pfadfinderverb√§nde. Erich M√∂nch, one of the founders of the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder was a founder member of this association. In 1956, the Gau Grauer Reiter, named after the Scout group Graue Reiter in Soldin of the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder, left the Bund Deutscher Pfadfinder. Today, there is still a group of former Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder within the association \\"F√∂rdergemeinschaft Grauer Reiter e. V.\\" The F√∂rdergemeinschaft Grauer Reiter e. V. is a group of adults, grown up in different youth and Scout association, which support the work of the Scout association Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter and especially its national centre, the Castle Hohenkr√§hen near Lake Constance (Bodensee). The Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter is a small independent Scout association in Germany with about 350 members. It was founded by Erich M√∂nch. It preserves the history and traditions of the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder. Program The work of the Scout association was based on the teachings of Ernest Thompson Seton. A big part of the programme was arts and crafts and adventurous travels, especially to Sweden and Norway. Each member of the association should make one piece of art or handicraft each year. All the pieces were shown at the National Jamborees. Decision making was organised as a grassroots democracy. Decisions on national level were made by a meeting of all leaders of the local Scout groups called Bundesthing. On a group level, decision were made in a similar way. The magazine of the association was Jugendland. Between 1929 and 1933, 24 issues were published, and between 1946 and 1948, 3 more. The national camp site of this Scout association was called Jungenland and it was situated near D√∂ffingen. D√∂ffingen is today a quarter of Grafenau. It was bought in 1927. Troops of the association travelled to foreign countries and took part in international camps with scouts from groups associated with the International Organisation of Good Templars from the United States, Great Britain, The Netherlands and Scandinavia. Membership Most groups of the association were based in Southern Germany and there never was more than 500 members. =Known groups= *Founder members of the Sturmtrupp S√ºd: Scout group W√∂lfe (Wolves) ‚Äì Mannheim Scout group Jukkasj√§rvi - Stuttgart Scout group R√ºppurr ‚Äì Karlsruhe *Further members of the Sturmtrupp S√ºd: Girl Guides group Wildkatzen (Wildcats)-Stuttgart Cub Scout pack Zeisige-Karlsruhe Scout group F√ºchse (Foxes)-T√ºbingen Girl Guides group Burg (Castle)-T√ºbingen Scout group Adler (Eagle)- Rottenburg am Neckar *Members of the \\"Sturmtrupp Nord\\": Scout group Grad d√∂r- Bremen Scout group Widukind-Oldenburg Scout group Wiking (Viking)-D√ºsseldorf *Members of the \\"Sturmtrupp Mitte\\": Scout group Braune B√§ren (Brown bears) -Berlin Scout group Grauer Reiter (Grey riders) -Soldin Scout group Goten (Goths)-Dessau Literature *Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter: Der Graue Reiter 106/107-Vierzig Jahre Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter-Bundesschrift der Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter, March 1997 (German) *Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter: Der Graue Reiter 109-Bundesschrift der Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter, March 2000 (German) External links *Editorial staff (Schriftleitung) of the Scout association Grauer Reiter (German) Sources Category:Scouting and Guiding in Germany Category:Disbanded Scouting organizations Category:Youth organizations established in 1929 Category:Youth organizations disestablished in 1934 ","title":"Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder"},{"id":"15003869","text":"Park Top (May 1964 - 1989) was a British racehorse. She had an unfashionable pedigree, cost only 500 guineas as a yearling and did not run as a two-year- old. Her Grand-dam Oola Hills was the dam of Pappa Fourway, but unlike him, Park Top was at her best over middle distances. Her career tally was 13 races worth ¬£136,440. She was disappointing as a broodmare and her few foals had shown minimal talent before she was retired in 1979. Park Top was bred by Joan Scott of Buttermilk Stud Farm, South Newington, Oxfordshire. Racing career =1966: two-year-old season= Being a late foal she was backward as a two year old and also suffered from problems with her fetlock joints and later developed a cough. All of these were factors in the decision not to run Park Top as a two-year-old. =1967: three-year-old season= She began her career with an easy win in the Mar Lodge Place (for 3-y-o maidens) at Windsor. A second easy win, in the Twyford Stakes (3-y-o fillies) at Newbury, encouraged her owner to aim higher by tackling the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. Starting second favourite she won smoothly, defeating St Pauli Girl who had earlier finished second in The Oaks. Six weeks later she won the Brighton Cup (then a good handicap). =1968: four-year-old season= Won the Brighton Challenge Cup again, and also took the Prix d'H√©douville at Longchamp. =1969: five-year-old season= It was as a five-year-old that she really shone. That year she was largely ridden by Lester Piggott but he was unable to ride her in the Hardwicke Stakes and Geoff Lewis took over for that race and the Eclipse Stakes . A victory at Longchamp in May was followed by a success in the Coronation Cup, Hardwicke Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. She was beaten in the Eclipse Stakes by Wolver Hollow when her rider Geoff Lewis pulled her off the rail allowing Piggott on Wolver Hollow to nip up the rail and go clear . When Park Top was extricated from a pocket she ran on strongly but was unable to reel in the winner . Piggott was reinstated as her rider when she easily won the King George at Ascot later in July 1969. In the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe she was stuck behind a wall of horses and finished fast to be second behind Levmoss. Piggott blamed himself for her defeat but her owner the Duke of Devonshire was more forgiving in the book he wrote about Park Top A Romance of the Turf. =1970: six-year-old season= After a warm up win at Longchamp in May, Park Top was beaten into second when trying to win the Coronation Cup at Epsom for the second time. Jarred up by the firm ground at Epsom she did not race again until the Cumberland Lodge stakes at Ascot in September. She won well, but finished lame. Appearing to have made a full recovery from what was only temporary lameness, she returned to Longchamp, for a seventh time, to bid farewell. Sadly she was well below her best and could only finish third. Park Top was retired from breeding in 1980 and died in 1989.
