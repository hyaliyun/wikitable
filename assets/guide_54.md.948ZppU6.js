The only impact that was reported from Dolphin was to the M/Bca Mae Jan, which was a cargo passenger ship which sank on December 14, due to rough seas caused by Dolphin. There were 46 people reported dead while seven were reported as missing. Dolphin formed as a tropical depression early on December 8, 2008 to the northwest of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Over the next few days as the depression moved towards the west, the depression slowly intensified into a tropical storm being named Dolphin by the JMA on December 12. The next day as Dolphin moved into PAGASA's area of responsibility, it was assigned the local name of Ulysses. Dolphin was then upgraded to a typhoon the next day and reached its peak winds off 65 kts (75 mph; 120 km/h 10-minute winds) and 90 kts (105 mph; 165 km/h 1-minute winds) later that day. On December 17, as Dolphin was approaching the edge of PAGASA's Area of responsibility, it was downgraded to a tropical storm by both the JMA and the JTWC. Dolphin was then declared as extratropical the next day as it moved towards the northeast. Meteorological history On December 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to issue gale warnings on a new-born extratropical cyclone around the Ogasawara Islands, and JMA started to issue storm warnings when the system accelerated eastward on the next day. The storm reached storm-force and attained its extratropical peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 60 knots (110 km/h, 70 mph) on December 4, when it was located far east of Japan; however, the low became developed late on the same day. The storm north of Wake Island started to track east-southeastward on December 5, as well as it tracked southeastward then southward on December 6. At noon, it became a developing low again and reached its extratropical peak intensity for the second time, before it moved into the tropics. On December 7, the storm started to track southwestward and weakened into a gale-force system; eventually, the system transformed into a tropical depression southeast of Wake Island early on December 8. However, early the next day, the JMA downgraded the depression to a low pressure area, as the depression's low level circulation center was partially exposed, and was in an area of moderate to high vertical wind shear. However the JMA re-upgraded the disturbance to a weak tropical depression 24 hours later. At 0600 UTC that morning, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), released a significant tropical weather advisory and rated the chances of the disturbance becoming a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as poor, due to a quikscat pass had shown that the low level circulation center had broken down into a wave. However, after the advisory was released the low level circulation center started to rapidly consolidate, and thus the JTWC initiated issuing warnings at 1200 UTC, December 10, and designated it as Tropical Depression 27W, while it was about to the east of Guam and moving towards the west. Early the next day the depression's centre passed about to the south of Guam and made its closest approach. Track map of the precursor to Typhoon Dolphin The JTWC upgraded the depression to a Tropical Storm late the next day and then early on December 12 the JMA designated the depression as a full tropical depression. The Tropical Depression was then upgraded to a Tropical Storm and named Dolphin later that morning as it moved westwards towards the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) area of responsibility. The next day as Tropical Storm Dolphin moved into PAGASA's area of responsibility, PAGASA assigned the local name of Ulysses to Dolphin. The JMA upgraded Tropical Storm Dolphin to a Severe Tropical Storm late on December 14. Whilst Dolphin was upgraded to a Typhoon by the JTWC early the next day as Dolphin recurved towards the North. Later that day the JTWC reported that Typhoon Dolphin had reached its peak winds of 90 kts (105 mph; 165 km/h 1-minute winds) which made Typhoon Dolphin a category two Typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. At the same time the JMA reported that Severe Tropical Storm Dolphin had intensified into a Typhoon and had also reached its peak wind speeds of 65 kts (75 mph; 120 km/h 10-minute winds). Early in the afternoon of December 16, the JMA downgraded Typhoon Dolphin from a Typhoon to a Severe Tropical Storm, as it moved towards the northwest. This came as the JTWC reported that Dolphin had weakened into a Category One Typhoon. Early the next day the JTWC downgraded Typhoon Dolphin to a Tropical Storm, whilst later that day the JMA also downgraded Dolphin to a Tropical Storm. This came as Tropical Storm Dolphin moved out of PAGASA's Area of responsibility. Early in the afternoon of December 18, both the JMA and the JTWC released their final advisories on Tropical Storm Dolphin as they downgraded Dolphin to an extratropical low. The extratropical low dissipated two days later. Preparations, impact and aftermathMicronesia= From December 8 to December 12, large sea swells up to 3 m (9.8 ft), generated by the extratropical cyclone that was to become Typhoon Dolphin and Tropical Disturbance 03F, affected many islands throughout Micronesia including Papua New Guinea and Hawaii. The most affected areas included New Ireland, Bougainville, Manus, East Sepik, Morobe, and West Sepik. The waves affected over 50,000 to 80,000 people with over 400 people left homeless after their homes were destroyed. =Guam and Rota= Late on December 10, as the JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 27W had formed, the National Weather Service forecast office in Guam issued a tropical storm warning for Guam as tropical storm conditions were anticipated to impact the island within 24 hours. A tropical storm watch was also declared for Rota at this time as tropical storm-force winds were possibly going to affect Rota within 24 hours. Early the next day the tropical storm watch for Rota was cancelled followed by the tropical storm warning for Guam later that day as the depression was accelerating away from the Islands. The Guam Emergency Operations Center was partially activated and Guam Homeland Security and Office of Civil Defense personnel were on call in case they were needed. Residents were advised to bring in all holiday decorations that may become airborne and prepare their emergency disaster kits. Within Guam, flights in and out of Guam International Airport were not cancelled as winds did not exceed 90 km/h, (55 mph). The maximum reported rainfall amount was at Inarajan Handar which reported 2.05 inches of rainfall in the 48 hours starting on December 10 at 0100 UTC. Guam government officials reported that there was not much significant damage, with power outages around the island being sporadic which were primarily caused by falling trees and debris. There was also some minor flooding and beach erosion caused by storm tides. Also, Sean had no power. =M/Bca Mae Jan= The M/Bca Mae Jan was a cargo passenger ship which sank on December 14 due to rough seas caused by Typhoon Dolphin. The M/Bca Mae Jan was only licensed to carry 40 passengers and 10 members of crew; however, at the time of its sinking the M/Bca Mae Jan was carrying 97 people. Of the 98 people, 47 died and 7 were missing. Vessels operating in the area were asked to help in the search and rescue operation, whilst the Philippine coastguard directed three ships to perform aerial and surface searches. The Philippine National Disaster Coordinating Council reported on December 17 that the local Government unit of Ballesteros, Cagayan had provided assistance worth 16,500 PHP ($352 2008 USD). Whilst the Department of Health-Center for Health Development had provided 27,203 PHP ($582 2008 USD) worth of assistance, in the form of drugs, fluids and medicines for the injured victims that were confined at the Ballesteros District Hospital. The Department of Social Welfare and Development provided cash and relief goods totalling up to 128,000 PHP ($2,740 2008 USD), The Department of Social Welfare and Development also propositioned standby funds of 255,000 PHP ($5,453 2008 USD).

He served as Archbishop of San Francisco from 1915 to 1935. Early life and education Edward Hanna was born in Rochester, New York, to Edward and Anne (n√©e Clark) Hanna, who were Irish immigrants. The eldest of six children, he had two brothers and three sisters, one of whom died in infancy. In 1867, at age seven, he began his education at Public School No. 2 in his native city. The following year, he was sent to St. Patrick's School. He entered Rochester Free Academy in 1875, and graduated as valedictorian in 1879. He there befriended his classmate, Walter Rauschenbusch, a future Baptist theologian and proponent of the Social Gospel. He and Rauschenbusch were two of the nineteen founding brothers of Pi Phi Fraternity at the academy in 1878. At the commencement ceremony, he delivered a well-received oration on Irish political leader Daniel O'Connell. Deciding to embrace the ecclesiastical state, Hanna was sent by Bishop Bernard John McQuaid to study at the Pontifical North American College and the Urban College of Propaganda. His professor at the Propaganda, Benedetto Lorenzelli (a future cardinal), selected him and fellow student Edward A. Pace as the American representatives at a philosophical disputation before Pope Leo XIII in 1882. Early ministry On May 30, 1885, Hanna was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Giulio Lenti at the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Pope Leo XIII was so impressed with his intellectual acumen that he conferred a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree without the need for an oral examination in 1886. He was a professor at St. Bernard's Seminary from 1893 to 1912. On October 22, 1912, he was named by Pope Pius X auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of San Francisco and titular bishop of Titiopolis. He was ordained to the episcopate on December 4, 1912. =Archepiscopate= Following the death of Archbishop Patrick William Riordan on December 27, 1914. Pope Benedict XV named Hanna the third Archbishop of San Francisco on June 1, 1915. Hanna had a close friendship with San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, Jr. The archbishop and \\"Sunny Jim\\" were seen at many civic functions. Edward J. Hanna would support Rolph in his run for governor in 1930. Governor Rolph died in office June 2, 1934; nine months later, Hanna asked to retire. As archbishop, Hanna was often tasked with helping resolve labor disputes. In 1921, he was named chairman of San Francisco's Wage Arbitration Boards; Hanna served on the boards through 1924. Governor James Rolph appointed Hanna as the chairman of a state mediation board to resolve the 1933 cotton strike in Corcoran, California. During the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, President Franklin Roosevelt named Archbishop Hanna chairman of the National Longshoremen's Board. The board was tasked with resolving the strike by mediating between the International Longshoremen's Association, the International Seamen‚Äôs Union, and their employers. In 1923 his portrait was painted three-quarters seated by the Swiss-born American portrait painter Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947), shortly afterwards being exhibited at Gumps, in San Francisco. Its present whereabouts is unknown. Hanna was key to the founding of St. Joseph's Seminary in Mountain View, California, and it was considered \\"the jewel of his accomplishments.\\" =National Catholic Welfare Council= In 1919, Hanna was elected by the bishops of the United States as the first chairman of the National Catholic Welfare Council, a predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which was renamed the National Catholic Welfare Conference in 1922; he continued as chairman through his retirement in 1935. As chairman, he was responsible for coordinating the American bishops' lobbying efforts and response to the domestic and foreign policies of the government. Retirement and death Hanna's vault at Holy Cross Archbishop Hanna retired March 2, 1935, due to ill health and advancing age. Pope Pius XI appointed Hanna the titular Archbishop of Gortyna. He was succeeded as Archbishop of San Francisco by John Joseph Mitty. Archbishop Hanna moved to Rome after his retirement, where he died on July 10, 1944. Archbishop Hanna's body was returned to San Francisco in 1947. He is buried in the Archbishop's Crypt at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

During his service he was present at the capture of numerous French frigates and later served in the War of 1812. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars he remained in service and commanded several ships in the Mediterranean before he retired from active service in 1837. He remained a commissioned officer and later rose through the ranks to become a vice-admiral. For his services he was knighted in the Royal Guelphic Order and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Family background Born in 1785, William Augustus Montagu was an illegitimate son of John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, by Maria. He was baptised at St Anne's Church, Soho, Westminster. William is thought to be named after his uncle, William Augustus, who died at Lisbon in 1776. His grandfather was John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who served three terms as the First Lord of the Admiralty, to 1783. Military and Parliamentary Service, and Awards Montagu joined the army young, going to sea aged 11 in 1796 as a volunteer on HMS Glatton commanded by Captain Henry Trollope. Montagu remained with Trollope when he moved, first to HMS Russell in which Montagu saw action at the Battle of Camperdown and subsequently HMS Juste. In late 1800, Montagu was commissioned as a midshipman and joined the frigate HMS Sirius. In Sirius he was present at the capture of D√©daigneuse and then moved into the brig HMS Dasher for four years, spent in the West Indies. In 1804 Montagu returned to Europe as a lieutenant and the following year was promoted to commander. In 1807, Montagu became a post captain and took command of the small frigate HMS Terpsichore in the Indian Ocean. In March 1808, Terpsichore was attacked by the larger French vessel S√©millante and despite heavy losses, Montagu was able to outfight his opponent although he could not capture her. Soon afterward Montagu moved to and served in the East Indies, forming part of the squadron that captured Amboyna from the Dutch and seized two Dutch frigates in the harbour. By 1810, Montagu was established in the Indian Ocean and was selected from the captains assembled for the Invasion of √éle de France to lead the naval brigade, a force of sailors and Royal Marines deployed on shore to support the British Army forces leading the attack. During the assault Montagu fought well and was commended after his brigade assisted in breaking the French resistance around the capital Port Napoleon.Gentleman's Magazine, January to June 1852, p. 407 In September 1812, Montagu returned to Europe to command HMS Niobe in the Channel Fleet, later serving off the United States during the War of 1812 and in Portuguese waters. In June 1814, with the war coming to an end, Niobe was paid off and Montagu was in reserve until 1819, when he took command of HMS Phaeton in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Between 1818 and 1820 he sat in Parliament for Huntingdon. In 1822, Phaeton was paid off and Montagu was in reserve until 1834, marrying Anne Leeds, daughter of Sir George William Leeds in 1823. Montagu took command of HMS Malabar in 1834 and remained in her until 1837 in the Mediterranean. This was his final commission and when he was placed in reserve again in 1837 he did not return to the sea. He remained in the Navy however and slowly rose through the ranks, becoming a rear-admiral in 1841 and a vice admiral in 1851. Montagu was knighted in 1830 in the Royal Guelphic Order and in 1832 became a Knight Commander, accompanied by a Knight Bachelor award for use in Britain. He had previously been made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1815 at the end of the war. He died at Ryde, on the Isle of Wight in March 1852.

It was held in Abuja, Nigeria, between 5 December and 8 December 2003, and hosted by President Olusegun Obasanjo. The Zimbabwean issue was dominant, leading to one of the highest media profiles for a CHOGM in recent times. The dispute over Zimbabwe's suspension led to a dispute over the re-election of Secretary- General Don McKinnon, and, before the end of the meeting, Robert Mugabe's announcement that Zimbabwe was withdrawing from the Commonwealth. The Aso Rock Declaration reaffirmed the Harare Declaration of 1991 and set the 'promotion of democracy and development' as the organisation's priorities. The meeting was attended by representatives of fifty-one countries out of the Commonwealth's fifty-four members (suspended members Zimbabwe and Pakistan were not invited, whilst Antigua and Barbuda sent no representative). Thirty- eight were represented by their Head of State or Head of Government. Zimbabwe Rather predictably, but despite attempts to the contrary, the issue of Zimbabwe dominated. Some African members had spoken out against what they saw as the 'undemocratic' suspension of Zimbabwe, but were criticised for not respecting the principle of consensus, under which dissenting voices to an issue that had already been decided and voting on are usually only heard privately. Olusegun Obasanjo was seen to have acquitted himself well in the Commonwealth's position of Chairperson-in-Office in the manner in which he addressed this issue. The issue was brought to a head in the election of the Secretary-General. The incumbent, New Zealander Don McKinnon, was nominated for another four-year term, and convention stipulates that an incumbent running again is to be unchallenged. However, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa spearheaded a campaign to have Sri Lanka's Lakshman Kadirgamar elected in protest over the handling of the Zimbabwe matter. Nonetheless, African countries were divided, with only five African Heads of Government voting with Mbeki, and the attempt to move the election down the agenda to provide time to develop momentum for the movement was unsuccessful. With Mbeki's tactics failing, and with neither Kadirgamar nor the Prime Minister or President of Sri Lanka in Abuja, the challenge was easily defeated, by forty votes to eleven. In response to the failure to overthrow McKinnon or to lift Zimbabwe's suspension, Robert Mugabe announced on 7 December that Zimbabwe was to leave the Commonwealth immediately: marking only the third occasion (after South Africa in 1961 and Pakistan in 1971) that a country had withdrawn voluntarily.

It utilises a system manufactured by the French Translohr company. Shanghai originally had a steel wheeled electric tramway network in its urban center. Routes expanded gradually and reached largest extent in 1925 with 328 tramcars; this tram system shut down in 1975. Tram service returned to Shanghai with the opening of a rubber tired Translohr line in the suburban Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in 2010. It is the second rubber- tired tram system in both China and Asia, the first being TEDA tram in Tianjin. Zhangjiang Tram started construction on December 23, 2007. Construction was originally planned to be completed on December 2008, but this was delayed a year, until December 31, 2009 when it was opened to traffic. Passenger operations started on January 1, 2010. Zhangjiang Tram runs for from Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park Station of the Shanghai Metro Line 2 to Heqing Town with 15 stops. Zhangjiang tram is build in phases. The first phase runs from Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park Station on Shanghai Metro Line 2 (formerly Songtao Road Zuchongzhi Road Station) in the east, to Zhangdong Road Jinqiu Road Station in the west, which covers a distance of about 10 km, with a total of 15 stops, 1 depot. It will be followed by an extension to Tangzhen. History The new system was built in Zhangjiang Town, because it is a planned area, and commuting between neighborhoods of the town has always been difficult. The Translohr tramway is constructed in Zhangjiang Town which is in the heartland area of Pudong New Area (east shore of Huangpu River). Due to Economic-Technological Development Area ordinances, sound pollution must be kept to a minimum in this area. Traditional steel-wheeled trams generate much vibration and sound during their journey. Rubber tires on the trams reduce vibration, and as a result noise, substantially. Additionally, the Zhangjiang Town roads are very hilly, and rubber tired trams can more easily climb steeper grades than traditional trams. Another advantage is that rubber-tired trams don't require tracks, as steel wheeled cars do, so there is less disturbance of underground networks like power cables, phone lines, and sewer and water mains. =Timeline= *2007 ‚Äì Construction of rubber tired tram started. *2009 ‚Äì Test runs occurred. *2010 ‚Äì Commercial services began.

It consists of 9 multiple units of three cars each. They are low floor, fully air conditioned, and can operate at high speeds. Features Most Zhangjiang tram lines run along the centre of the roads, while some stations are situated at intersections and have side platforms, while the two terminals have a central platform. Zhangjiang streetcar doors are on a \\"Request stop\\" mode. If a passenger requests a stop, a green light is illuminated and the doors open at the next stop. If no stop is requested, the doors remain closed. Depots and termini Zhangjiang Hi- Tech Park Station and Zhangdong Road Jinqiu Road Station are the two termini of the Zhangjiang Tram line. Trams are stored in an indoor facility at the eastern end of the line in Heqing Town. Alignment The modern tram routes completely run on unreserved tracks and in the middle of the road. Because of the rubber tires, it is not possible to lay track in grass, as the trams can only run on concrete or paved roads. All stops have island platforms. Tickets There is a single fare of 2 Yuan.

The Conference's purpose is to \\"promote improvements in the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the procedures by which federal agencies conduct regulatory programs, administer grants and benefits, and perform related governmental functions.\\" To this end, the Conference conducts research and issues reports concerning various aspects of the administrative process and, when warranted, makes recommendations to the President, Congress, particular departments and agencies, and the judiciary concerning the need for procedural reforms. Of these recommendations, 33% have focused on reducing government costs and increasing revenue, 26% on improving the use of science in the administrative process, and 20% on reducing litigation in the regulatory process. Implementation of Conference recommendations may be accomplished by direct action on the part of the affected agencies or through legislative changes.  Structure  The Chairman is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a 5-year term. The other ten members of the Council, which acts as an executive board, are appointed by the President for 3-year terms. Federal officials may comprise no more than one-half of the full membership of the Council. The Chairman is the only full-time compensated member. In order to draw on a wide array of expertise and ensure diversity of views that contribute to the formulation of ACUS recommendations, the Conference's membership consists of no fewer than 75 and no more than 101 members who are chosen from government agencies, the practicing bar, academia, corporations, and non-profit entities. Each member serves on one of ACUS's committees, which are devoted to one of five administrative procedure subjects: adjudication, administration and management, judicial review, regulation, and rulemaking. ACUS estimates that its volunteer experts bring an added $1.1 million of value to the agency's work. History ACUS was formed as a permanent agency to continue the bipartisan efforts of the two temporary Administrative Conferences that operated during the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations. Each of the temporary Conferences had recommended the establishment of a permanent body to continually study, and recommend improvements to, administrative procedures.Memorandum Convening the President's Commission on Administrative Procedure, Public Papers 219-22 (Apr. 29, 1953); Executive Order 10934, 26 Fed. Reg. 3233 (Apr. 13, 1961). ACUS began operations with the appointment and confirmation of its first Chairman in 1968. In just under three decades, the Conference undertook over 200 recommendation projects examining various areas of administrative law and practice. In 1995, the Conference ceased operations due to loss of funding, but the statutory provisions establishing ACUS were not repealed. Indeed, the Conference's work received continued recognition over the years. In 2007, the Congressional Research Service remarked that ACUS offered ‚Äúnonpartisan, nonbiased, comprehensive, and practical assessments and guidance with respect to a wide range of agency processes, procedures, and practices.‚Äù In support of ACUS's reauthorization, Justice Antonin Scalia, a former Chairman of ACUS, testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the Conference represented ‚Äúa unique combination of talents from the academic world, from within the executive branch . . . and . . . from the private bar, especially lawyers particularly familiar with administrative law.\\" He also described ACUS as ‚Äúone of the federal government‚Äôs ‚Äòbest bargains . . . for the buck.‚Äô‚Äù Following this and other testimony, Congress reauthorized the Conference in 2004 and again in 2008.Pub. L. 108-401, sec. 2(a), Oct. 30, 2004, 118 Stat. 2255; and Pub. L. 110-290, sec. 2, July 30, 2008, 122 Stat. 2914. The 2004 legislation expanded the responsibilities of ACUS to include specific attention to achieving more effective public participation and efficiency, reducing unnecessary litigation, and improving the use of science in the rulemaking process. Funding was approved in 2009, and the Conference was officially re-established in March 2010, when the United States Senate confirmed Paul R. Verkuil as Chair. The re-established ACUS started a new online presence, including a searchable database of publications and recommendations throughout its existence from 1968 to 1995 and its re-establishment in March 2010 to present. Recommendations and resources Many early ACUS recommendations were enacted by Congress, and more have been relied on by agencies and courts. For example, ACUS has made several influential recommendations to eliminate technical impediments to judicial review of agency decisions. Congress implemented each of ACUS's proposals through Public Law 94-574. ACUS also worked to develop and implement the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques in administrative practice, with the goal of decreasing litigation cost and delays in agency programs. These efforts resulted in the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act in 1990, by which Congress provided a framework for agencies to use alternative dispute resolution to resolve administrative litigation.Pub. L. 101-552, 104 Stat. 2736 (1990). ACUS also explored‚Äîand worked to implement through legislation‚Äîalternative dispute resolution techniques in rulemaking. The Conference's recommendations on negotiating regulations served as the groundwork for the Negotiated Rulemaking Act.Pub. L. 101-648, 104 Stat. 4970 (1990). Since its re-establishment in 2010, the Conference has adopted over 40 recommendations and statements providing recommended reforms directed to federal agencies, Congress, the President, and the Judicial Conference of the United States. Although ACUS recommendations are formally non-binding, some of the more significant developments to grow out of ACUS's work include its recommendation addressing agency adjustments to civil monetary penalties was implemented by Congress in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated would increase government revenue by $1.3 billion over the next ten years. Another recommendation was implemented through Executive Order 13,609, which seeks to reduce unnecessary international regulatory disparities that impose costs on business; yet another recommendation prompted the Office of Management and Budget to update its guidance on how federal agencies can incorporate standards set by industrial, scientific, and other entities in their own regulations. In addition to these recommendations, ACUS hosts trainings, working groups, and other initiatives for agency and Congressional staff. The Conference has also released a number of resources for agency officials and the general public. Two recent resources include the Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies, which comprehensively catalogs the agencies and other organizational entities of the federal executive establishment, and the Federal Administrative Adjudication Database, a joint project with Stanford Law School to ‚Äúmap the contours of the federal administrative adjudicatory process, including both ‚Äòformal‚Äô adjudication conducted under the Administrative Procedure Act (‚ÄòAPA‚Äô) and ‚Äòinformal‚Äô adjudication.‚Äù See also *United States Administrative Law *Administrative Law, Process and Procedure Project *Title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations ReferencesExternal links *Administrative Conference of the United States (official website).

Otter was then attached to the squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley that was ordered to blockade the French colonies of √éle Bonaparte and √éle de France in the Indian Ocean. Otter raided anchorages on the islands. For instance, on 14 August 1809 her boats were in action at Riviere Noire, √éle de France. Between 20 and 24 September she took part in the Raid on Saint Paul. Willoughby led the naval landing party that captured the harbour, for which he was promoted. Otter suffered one man killed and one man wounded.

He spent periods of time as a schoolmaster and then later as a clergyman in Norfolk, England. He wrote regular articles for The Nineteenth Century, variously on humorous, polemical and historical topics. He published scholarly work on local Norfolk history and on aspects of English literature. A good friend of M. R. James he is described by James' biographer R. W. Pfaff as \\"a fine specimen of the learned but somewhat eccentric country parson.\\" Early life Born in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 20 December 1823, the son of John Sympson Jessopp (c. 1780‚Äì1851), Barrister-at-Law, and Eliza Bridger Goodrich,Venn, J., Alumni Cantabrigienses; a biographical list of all known students, graduates and holders of office at the University of Cambridge, from the earliest times to 1900 part 2, vol. 3 (1922), p.572 he was educated at St. John's, Cambridge (B.A. 1848 and M.A. 1851Foster, Joseph. Alumni Oxonienses: The Members of the University of Oxford, 1715‚Äì1886). He took orders in 1848, the same year he married Mary Anne Margaret Cotesworth.England 1851 census Class: HO107; Piece: 1758; Folio: 155; Page: 1; GSU roll: 193648. He left with an ordinary degree to undertake the curacy of Papworth, Cambridgeshire, where he resided till 1854, when he became headmaster of Helston Grammar School. Here he remained until 1859, when he succeeded Dr. Vincent at Norwich School, being thus brought into relations with East Anglia, the region he came to write about. His tenure at Norwich (where George Meredith's elder son was among his pupils) was uneventful, and from the fact that he seldom, if ever, alludes to schoolmastering in his subsequent writing, it may not have been to his taste. He began work on his historic studies while at Norwich, and became rector of Scarning in 1879. During this period he was awarded a Bachelor and Doctor of Divinity (1870), from Worcester College, Oxford. Journalism for The Nineteenth Century The Nineteenth Century was under the direction of James Knowles, and Jessopp's success may be due to this circumstance. His work certainly was what the editor wanted, and he wrote well, in a forcible, colloquial style, with earnestness, full of knowledge of his subjects, and helped by boisterous illustrations. Joseph Arch loomed large in the public eye; people wanted to hear what a county parson had to say about the agricultural labourer. He was firmly convinced that things were not going well in the rural parishes, and he was righteously indignant at the condition of the labourer's cottage, and the growing tendency to deprive him of all chance of rising to a higher level, an evil aggravated by the abolition of small farms. He realised also, the dullness of village life, the grinding monotony, and the impossibility of escape, though perhaps he was too prone to assume that these burdens would be as heavy to his neighbours as to himself. His entire picture was unreal, giving the worst rather than the average conditions. He certainly did his best to brighten village life; he was quite free from clerical bigotry, and candidly admits that the stuffy little Ranter's chapel is too often the only place where the religious emotions of the rural poor can be stirred and the yearnings of the soul satisfied. Unfortunately his well-meant efforts came to little largely because he went too late to parish work. His best years had been spent as a schoolmaster. Jessopp was essentially a man of the study, and the \\"monsters of life's waste\\" he attacked were too often those he imagined must be the bane of his poorer neighbours‚Äîrather than those that really oppressed them. Again, he was not Norfolk born. He never comprehended the inner nature of the hard-grained East Anglians that rates stranger and foe as nearly equivalent. For those reasons, he came to cross purposes with his people. He lost his temper sometimes and wrote about his neighbours in terms some of them resented. Numbers of The Nineteenth Century travelled down to Scarning; and when local celebrities recognised their portraits, dancing with stage antics to amuse the rector's town friends, and understood he was getting paid handsomely for the show, the feud waxed bitter. Historical writings Jessopp in old age As early as 1855, Jessopp issued a reprint of Donne's Essays in Divinity with notes. In 1897, he wrote a short life of Donne in the Leaders of Religion series. His One Generation of a Norfolk House must have cost him much labour; it is the story of one of the Walpoles who became a Jesuit in the time of Elizabeth, and it was while he was engaged over it at Mannington Hall, Lord Orford's seat, that he was favoured by a nocturnal visit from a ghostly ecclesiastic in the library. Much good-humoured banter followed his communication of his experience to the press, and probably his picturesque statement helped to draw public attention to this Henry Walpole, an unimportant figure and quite undeserving of the toil and research his vates sacer bestowed upon him. In 1879, he published his History of the Diocese of Norwich; in 1885, The Coming of the Friars and Other Historical Essays; and in 1881 and 1890, Arcady for Better or Worse and The Trials of a Country Parson, his most popular works. In 1890, he edited afresh Bell's edition of the Lives of the Norths. In August 1884, Jessopp came close to eternal damnation of his soul when he ran foul of the Muggletonians. His article entitled \\"The Prophet of Walnut Tree Yard\\" appeared in the August issue of The Nineteenth Century. Lodowicke Muggleton had been born in Walnut Tree Yard, Bishopsgate, in 1609. Jessopp's article was written with robust humour, probably because the writer assumed the sect extinct or moribund. The mid-century Chambers' Encyclopaedia would have told him just that. Jessopp felt obliged to apologise, which he did on 20 September 1887. However, it could have been much worse. Until the middle of the century, Muggletonians condemned those who ridiculed them. Sir Walter Scott suffered just this fate.William Lamont, \\"Last Witnesses: The Muggletonian History, 1652‚Äì1979\\" Aldershot:Ashgate Publishing (2006), p. 198 In 1896 he and M. R. James co-edited an edition of Thomas of Monmouth's life of William of Norwich, containing historical essays on the background to the events, which were the origin of the antisemitic blood libel. Academic career and recognition Jessopp became a member by incorporation at Worcester College, Oxford in 1870, and in 1895 he became an honorary Fellow of that Society. His college at Cambridge conferred the same honour on him in the same year. In 1890, Oxford appointed him a select preacher, and his handsome presence and his sonorous voice made him an imposing figure in St. Mary's pulpit. In 1895, he became an honorary canon of Norwich, and he was Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King Edward from 1902 to 1910. In 1907, Jessopp was granted a Civil List pension of ¬£50, in addition to a ¬£100 pension previously granted in recognition of his services to arch√¶ology and literature. He resigned his benefice in 1911 and went to live at The Chantry, Norwich. On his removal from Scarning he sold most of his valuable library, and the sale attracted considerable attention. It included a number of letters addressed by George Meredith to Dr. and Mrs. Jessopp, and a number of Meredith first editions with autograph inscriptions of the author. Jessopp died on 12 February 1914 and was buried at Scarning on 14 February. A full biography of Jessopp has been published: Augustus Jessopp: Norfolk's Antiquary, Nick Hartley, Torre, M & M Baldwin, 2017, Jessopp gave a talk in the Reading Room in High Street Tittleshall in 1882 to mostly agricultural workers of the area where he compared life then (1882) to the much harsher conditions (he had discovered from a chest full of old documents) which existed in 1282, citing harsh punishments for very petty offences. The Reading Room still stands to this day.

He was a \\"citizen of the world\\", (His citizenship was listed as French, American and Australian) who played an important role in the development of commerce and banking in the English Colony of New South Wales. He became a successful merchant and business leader in Sydney. In 1825 he became the second person to be naturalised in the Colony. In addition to being one of the early directors of the Bank of New South Wales (the predecessor of Westpac Ld) (for periods between 1826 and 1842), he was also a founder of the local insurance industry, a member of the committee of the Agricultural Society of New South Wales, and became involved in importing, shipping and whaling. There are numerous references to his business activities in the Colonial Secretary's Papers of the day. Background De Mestre was also the father of Etienne Livingstone de Mestre (1832‚Äì1916), the trainer of Archer the horse who won the first and second Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862, and the foremost Australian horse trainer of his era. His other descendants include: Sarah Melanie de Mestre (1877‚Äì1961) who distinguished herself as a nurse in France and Flanders in World War I, and whose decorations included the Royal Red Cross which was presented to her at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 3 June 1918 (the King's birthday);War Records of Sarah Melanie de Mestre Roy de Maistre (1894‚Äì1968), a successful Australian artist; Guboo Ted ThomasGuboo, man with a dream (1909‚Äì2002) a prominent Aboriginal leader, and the last initiated tribal elder on the South Coast of New South Wales; Margaret Augusta de Mestre (1915‚Äì1942), a nurse who was killed in action on a hospital ship on 26 February 1942 in the bombing of Darwin during World War II;War Records of Margaret Augusta de Mestre Neville de Mestre (c.1938- ), an eminent Australian mathematician and author, Emeritus Professor of Maths at Bond University, and who has held the titles of World Iron Man champion in the 60-64 age group, and Australian and World Masters surfing champion in the over-65 group for body surfing;Interview with Neville de MestreHow to catch the tube and Lloyd Nolan HornsbyYuinart: Web-page of Lloyd Nolan Hornsby (1947- ), a prominent Aboriginal artist. It is not true that Prosper, or his younger sister Melanie, are the children of Julie de St Laurent. It is therefore also not true that Prosper is the son of a liaison between Julie de St Laurent and Edward Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria. This mistaken belief has become legend due to the incorrect assertion that Julie de St Laurent was the wife of Prosper's father Andr√© Charles de Mestre. It is true that Andr√© Charles lost his head and his life on the battle field at Martinique, and that Prince Edward was at Martinique at the time, but this death was of no significance to either Prince Edward or Julie de St Laurent. The other incorrect assertion about Prosper's birth was made by Prosper himself in a letter dated 25 March 1830 and written to both the Collector and the Comptroller of Customs of the Colonial Government of New South Wales stating his claim to be a British subject. In this letter he made a statement that claimed he had been born in 1793 while his parents had been fleeing the French Revolution on a British ship bound for Martinique.Prosper de Mestre's statement of 25 March 1830 This statement was made to protect Prosper's commercial interests when he had applied to register a British ship, and the legality of his claim to hold a British-flagged ship was questioned. Chief Justice (Sir) Francis Forbes of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, after various letters and evidence (including Prosper's letter to the Collector and Comptroller of Customs), ruled that because Prosper had been born on the high seas in a British ship he was a British subject, and therefore his application must succeed. However Prosper was not born on the high seas in a British ship, but was born on dry land in France. Prosper's lie was not exposed in his lifetime. Neither was it exposed by his many children & descendants in the intervening years, who had always believed that he had told the truth. It was exposed in 2008, nearly 180 years after the statement was made, by his great, great, great granddaughter Maree Amor (n√©e Wade) when she was finally able to track down the record of his baptism.From France to Martinique, Maree Amor, 12 September 2008. The correct details of Prosper's birth follow. Biography Prosper de Mestre, whose full name was Jean Charles Prosper de Mestre, was the son of Helene Thomasse CottrelThe spelling on her baptismal record is Heleine Thomasse Cotterel. French priests, however, would spell the same name two or three ways in the same baptismal document so that there was no consistency. This was the only time her first name appeared with this spelling, and her surname was most often spelt Cottrel in the French documents for her family. The most consistent spelling of her names in documents during her lifetime was Helene Thomasse Cottrel (pronounced Cotterel). (1760‚Äì1851). He was born illegitimately on 15 August 1789 in Lorient, in Brittany in France.Baptism of Jean Charles Prosper on 17 August 1789, two days after his birth. His father, who wasn't present at his birth, is believed to be Andr√© Charles de Mestre (c.1756-1794). Andr√© Charles and his elder brother Jean, after whom it appears Jean Charles Prosper was named, were both soldiers in the French Army, and Andr√© Charles rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Prosper's younger sisterNot older sister as Prosper's statement of 1830 suggested. Melanie Caroline Jeanne Mestre was born 15 months later on 15 November 1790 in Lorient, and her father Andr√© Charles and her mother Helene claimed at the time that they had married in 1788 in Helene's home town of Rennes. No record of a marriage has been found in 1788 at Rennes, or at any other time, or in any other place, and it is believed that they never did legalise their union. In March 1791 Andr√© Charles' regiment was transferred under the royalist new Governor-General Behague to the island of Martinique in the French Caribbean, regarded politically as part of France. It was here three years later, in March 1794, that Prosper's father Andr√© Charles died. The republican General Rochambeau, who had taken over in Martinique in February 1793, and who had promoted Prosper's father to the rank of colonel of artillery on 10 February 1793,Did Andr√© Charles de Mestre have royalist or republican leanings during the French Revolution? Andr√© Charles was posted to serve in Martinique in March 1791, and served there until early February 1793 under a royalist governor-general who deported troops showing republican leanings, and who may even have given Andr√© Charles a promotion (unrecognised by France) to lieutenant-colonel in 1792. At General Rochambeau's take over of the island in February 1793, Andr√© Charles then found himself serving under a republican, but was so highly regarded as to have almost immediately been given a promotion to colonel. Perhaps Andr√© did not have strong views either way; or as a career soldier chose to keep his views hidden; or even changed his views over time. Either way he loyally served his commanders, to the best of his ability. recorded details of Prosper's father's death in his journal. In the journal entry dated 14 March 1794 is the record \\"The Colonel Mestre of the artillery had his head taken off by a cannon ball. I was covered in his blood and I had a slight bruise of the heel. This officer was of great merit and his loss is irreplaceable. He was day and night on the ramparts. His talents were known to me during the war in the countryside that had already happened in this country and I have myself to recognise them on this occasion. His activities were greater during the siege and his multiple assets were to be at the same time director of the artillery, captain of the gun markers and the bombardier. He leaves a wife and two children. The republic should take care of them and give them a pension because this brave man had no fortune at all except his talents, his courage and his qualities.\\" There is another gruesome mention of Prosper's father's death further down in the journal entry where mention is made of Andr√© Charles' skull bones wounding the General's aide, Marlet, in the kidneys. A year later in March 1795, Prosper's mother Helene married an officer of the invading British Army, Captain James \\"Jean\\" Armstrong (1769-aft.1836) of the 6th (1st Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot.\\"Royal Mistresses and Bastards\\" Anthony J. Camp The next record of Prosper de Mestre is not in Martinique, but in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as his parents had moved; this is where he received his schooling. He was known at this time as Prosper Mestre. He was naturalised an American citizen by the Court of Quarter Sessions in Philadelphia on 5 June 1811; at this point he was 21 being \\"of full age\\", which confirms that he was born before June 1790. In his naturalisation papers he stated that he had arrived in Philadelphia on 14 April 1802, when he would have been 12 years old. He was to state in his statement in 1830 that he was sent to Philadelphia in 1802 following the (British) evacuation of Martinique after the Treaty of Amiens. Unlike much of the rest of his 1830 statement, the year of his arriving in Philadelphia appears to be true, as it agrees with his earlier statement in 1811. His given reason for leaving Martinique in his 1830 statement, however, was an embellishment. 12-year-old Prosper did not have any political reason to need to abandon Martinique, but was joining his mother who in 1795 had left the Caribbean for the United States where she gave birth to Prosper's younger brother Andrew Cottrel Armstrong,Helene's son to James Armstrong, Andrew Cottrel Armstrong, claimed in the US 1850 census to have been born in New Jersey between 1 June 1795 and 31 May 1796. There is also a baptism record for a friend's child in May 1797 showing that Prosper's mother was at that time in New York. leaving Prosper, and possibly also his younger sister Melanie, behind in Martinique. In 1802, when Prosper joined her, Prosper's mother was living in Philadelphia as a single-mother and a widow,Prosper's mother is listed in the 1803 Philadelphia Directories as a widow; and in 1801 is a sponsor at a baptism in Philadelphia together with her future husband Joseph Coulon. believing or asserting that her husband James Armstrong had died as a result of wounds sustained in the fighting in the Caribbean. Instead Prosper's British stepfather, who had indeed been invalided in the Caribbean, had been sent home to England, and had, knowingly or unknowingly, earlier remarried bigamously in England in late 1799 after having lost contact with Prosper's mother. Prosper's mother then, knowingly or unknowingly, remarried bigamously in Philadelphia in late 1803. She married Joseph Coulon (1763‚Äì1815), a Frenchman and naturalised American citizen (Philadelphia 1798), an import merchant, who had connections with France, with Pondicherry in India, with Mauritius, and possibly also with the Caribbean. According to Prosper's 1830 statement he left Philadelphia in 1812 and travelled to China, and he also resided in Mauritius, India and \\"other British Colonies\\". This part of Prosper's 1830 statement was largely correct. Prosper had left Philadelphia in 1812 working in the shipping industry for his stepfather, Joseph Coulon, as supercargo.De Mestre Family Then, no longer working for his stepfather who had died at the end of 1815 as the result of a shipwreck of the coast of New Jersey, the much travelled twenty-five-year-old arrived in Sydney on 4 April 1818Journal of Lachlan Macquarie on board the Schooner the \\"Magnet\\" which had sailed from Kolkata via Mauritius to Sydney. (Coincidentally a ship that was later wrecked off the coast of a whaling station in New Zealand less than 2 weeks before Prosper died in September 1844.New Zealand Ship Wrecks) After living in various countries and arriving in Sydney as supercargo on the \\"Magnet\\", Prosper liked what he saw, and decided to stay. Prosper set himself up in business in Sydney as an import merchant. Using his overseas trade connections through fellow American citizens in China, he began to import goods, including tea. He was able to import Chinese goods into Sydney because he was not a British subject but an American one. He was then able to undersell other Sydney merchants who, as British subjects, had to buy their tea and other Chinese goods from the British East India Company which had been granted a monopoly. (When he first arrived in Sydney Prosper never claimed to be a British citizen, as he later did in 1830, as it would not have served his then commercial interests. Even though the British East India Company retained its monopoly until 1833, and Prosper's claiming to be a British citizen in 1830 would hurt his trade in goods from China, he was no longer so dependent on this trade. He had branched out by that time into many other commercial dealings, of which obtaining the registration of his ship was the most important in 1830.) Prosper's commercial trading advantage, from his importation of goods form China, was seen by other Sydney merchants as unfair and caused resentment. One of the disgruntled was Edward Eagar, an emancipist who had been disbarred from practicing law in New South Wales and had instead become a merchant. In 1820 Edward Eagar brought a qui tam action against the American merchant Prosper de Mestre. This was a highly technical action under the antiquated Navigation Act which prohibited aliens from \\"trading in the King's plantations\\". Described by the court as a \\"gentleman convict\\", Eagar's legal ploy was an attempt to ruin Prosper, and to benefit financially himself. If successful Prosper would have been bankrupted as his estates would have been forfeited: two-thirds going to the Crown (the King and Governor); and the remainder to the informer, Eagar. Prosper successfully defended the action on a legal technicality. He pleaded \\"that a convicted felon could not sue in a British Court of Justice\\". Although in 1818 Governor Lachlan Macquarie had given Eager an absolute pardon, his name, like other former convicts, had not been inserted in any \\"General Pardon under the Great Seal\\". Therefore, under British Law, the colonial pardon was not recognised. Justice Barron Field of the Supreme Court of New South Wales agreed with Prosper's argument, and Eagar's action failed. As a result, Eagar, along with others of like mind, began to organize to protect the rights of emancipists and improve their doubtful status, advocating the cause of \\"equitable justice for all emancipists\\". One of those of like mind that Eagar collaborated with was the child of a convict, and barrister, William Charles Wentworth, who returned to Sydney from overseas in 1823. On 1 March 1821 31-year-old Prosper married 19-year-old Mary Ann Black (1801‚Äì1861) at St Philip's Church, Sydney. Mary Ann, not yet \\"of full age\\" and 12 years his junior, was the daughter of the privateer (state-sanctioned pirate) and ship's captain John Black, and the former convict Mary Hyde who in 1855 took the Commissioners of City of Sydney to the House of Lords and won. Mary was also the stepdaughter of Simeon Lord, an emancipist, and a pioneer merchant and magistrate in early Sydney. Mary Ann was a good catch for de Mestre, with her stepfather Simeon Lord's connections being invaluable to Prosper's business dealings. Over the next 20 years Prosper and Mary Ann had ten children. The youngest of their three sons was horse trainer Etienne Livingstone de Mestre (1832‚Äì1916) who after his father's death established a horse stud, stable and racecourse on Prosper's former property of \\"Terara\\" near the mouth of the Shoalhaven River, and won five Melbourne Cups winners, including the first two in 1861 and 1862. William Charles Wentworth's collaboration with Eagar, following Eagar's unsuccessful action against Prosper in 1820, did not stop Wentworth from acting professionally for Prosper. In 1825 William Charles Wentworth, who Prosper had met through his stepfather Simeon Lord, acted for Prosper in successfully urged the New South Wales Legislative Council for a special Act to naturalise de Mestre. The Act was passed on 30 August 1825, and published in the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser by the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane on 1 September. Under this Act of the First Legislative Council of New South Wales (6 Geo. IV, no. 17 Naturalization (Prosper de Mestre) Act. 30 August 1825) Prosper took the necessary oaths in September 1825, the second person, and second American citizen, to be naturalized in the Colony of New South Wales. This colonial naturalisation declared Prosper to be a \\"Natural-born Subject of Great Britain, and to be entitled to all the Rights, Privileges, and Advantages, which are conferred on Foreign Protestants\\". The legality of the colonial naturalisation to make Prosper a British subject was questioned five years later in 1830. Wentworth, who for political and professional reasons would not have wanted the court to need to consider the legality of naturalisation act passed by the Legislative Council of New South Wales in 1825, again advised Prosper during the 1830 action. The court needed to be able to declare Prosper a British subject by other means. It is of no co- incidence that, in 1790 shortly before his parents arrived at the penal settlement of Norfolk Island, Wentworth had been born at sea on a British ship. His place of birth ensured that Wentworth's legal status as a British subject was protected. If Prosper claimed to have been born at sea on a British ship, Prosper could establish that he was a British subject, and his application to register a British ship would succeed. As a supposed British subject by birth, Prosper's social and legal status in the colony would also be improved. A carefully crafted statement was drafted that mixed fact with fiction. Prosper had been born in France before his family had moved to Martinique, where his soldier father had been killed in action against the British in March 1794. If instead he said that he had been born at sea while his family had been escaping from the French Revolution on a British vessel, and, being careful not to mention which side his father had been fighting for, at a time before his father died; then Prosper could not only establish that he was a British subject, but also obtain a sympathetic hearing. He also needed to explain his known connection with America, and more sympathy would be given if he mentioned his residence in India and \\"other British Colonies\\", his mother's marriage to a British officer, his own marriage to a British subject, and his then 5 children. No one doubted the word and signed statement of such a prominent businessman. Chief Justice (Sir) Francis Forbes of the Supreme Court of New South Wales was impressed, and the court ruled (incorrectly) that Prosper was a British subject because he had been born on the high seas in a British ship. Prosper's commercial interests in the Colony of New South Wales were mainly in shipping and whaling, but he also became active in wider commerce. In June 1823 he was elected a director of Sydney and Van Diemen's Land Packet Company. In June 1825 he was elected to the committee of the Agricultural Society of New South Wales. Prosper was a director of the Bank of New South Wales (1822‚Äì23, 1826‚Äì28, 1829‚Äì42), and in the 1830s he was a director of the Australian Marine Assurance Company. In 1840 he was a founder of the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Sydney. Prosper de Mestre was a benevolent man, who regularly donated to charities. These included the Benevolent Fund, and the Catholic Chapel Fund, which financed the building of St. Mary's Cathedral, the first Catholic Church in the community. He had been born a Roman Catholic, but he also became active in church affairs of the Church of England, the religion of his wife and children, and the official religion of the Colony. In 1836 as a supporter of the Church of England he joined the committee in opposition to the proposed National School System and in 1841 he became a trustee of Christ Church St. Laurence. Prosper was also involved in many real estate dealings. His first property purchase was in 1821 in George Street, Sydney, an allotment that had been received by his brother- in-law John Henry Black as his dower, and that was next door to a portion of land that his wife Mary Ann had also received as her dowerAn inheritance from her father, ownership of which passed to her husband on her marriage. Property Rights of Women in Nineteenth-Century England (which also applied in the Colony of New South Wales) on her marriage, and had been held trust by her stepfather Simeon Lord from an original land lease given to her father Captain John Black. It was on the George Street properties that his wife had been born, and on the George Street properties that Prosper resided with his family, and also had his counting house. The site is found today at a small lane named De Mestre Place. In addition to the George Street properties, Prosper applied for his first land grant, and on 7 September 1821 was granted at West Bargo, near Camden. The grant was on condition that he maintain and employed 7 convicts on the property. In 1831-32 he bought a section of land (the Helsarmel Estate) at Leichhardt from a Captain Piper. In 1824 (prior to his 1825 naturalisation) Prosper De Mestre was first promised a land grant by Governor Thomas Brisbane. were authorised on the southern shore of the Shoalhaven River near present-day Nowra in 1829. However he did not receive the grant until 1836 from Governor Sir Richard Bourke, and he named the property \\"Terara\\".Nowra Culture & History The homestead Mill Bank House which still stands in Millbank Road, was probably erected at this time, and a village named Terara soon began to develop.The development of this village was furthered by Prosper's widow and their three sons, Prosper John, Andre and Etienne, after Prosper's death in 1844. They added three wharves in 1854, in 1856 a Church of England on land Prosper‚Äôs widow Mary Ann donated and with capital she largely provided, and established a steam-driven flour mill in 1856. By 1866 Terara was a bigger and more important centre than Nowra. When the Shoalhaven River flooded in 1870 settlement began to shift from Terara to the Nowra site 3 km west. Australian heritage ‚Äì Nowra He eventually owned several houses in Sydney, including his main house, at Petersham, and many farm allotments. To consolidate some of his business investments, on 31 May 1837, at \\"the Premises lately occupied by Prosper De Mestre\\" at George Street he sold at auction a number of properties, being: at Brisbane Water; in the parish of Holdsworth; building allotments in Kent St, Sydney; four farms at Lane Cove; at Camden; and at Ellulang. He no longer needed to live in the George Street property as he had moved his residence to the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth Streets, Sydney as he had purchased an \\"excellent mansion\\" overlooking and situated at the south end of Hyde Park. Finally he also received another land grant of called Yerrigong on the Calymea Creek about six miles (10 km) west of Terara granted by Governor George Gipps on 17 February 1841. On 31 May 1837 he also sold 50 shares in the Australian Marine Assurance Company, the Hoffan's Cordials business, and a lithographic press. Then, due to the depression of the early 1840s, and failing health, Prosper become insolvent in 1844. Most of his land and property needed to be auctioned to pay his debts. As the George Street property had been her dower, his wife Mary Ann questioned whether it should be included in the sale. Her solution was that the more valuable George Street property could be included in the sale, if the Shoalhaven properties were not. In exchange she also asked for \\"the whole of the plate, horses etc., etc., on the establishment in Liverpool Street, the six cows, horse and cart at Helsarmel\\", and to be \\"permitted to occupy the thirty-two acres at Petersham until the house at Shoal Haven can be rendered fit for the residence of my family.\\" His house in Liverpool St, and its \\"elegant Household Furniture\\", was sold by auction on 16 May 1844, and the family was moved to briefly to Petersham and then onto Terara, which Prosper had initially developed as a hobby farm.

Biography Smith was born and raised on a farm near Bold Springs, Tennessee. He learned to play the fiddle at an early age, his first influence being the fiddlers Grady Stringer and Walter Warden. He married in 1914 at the age of sixteen. Initially he began performing at local dances and fiddlers' conventions. He teamed up with his wife Nettie, his cousin Homer Smith and fiddler Floyd Ethredge. In 1921, Smith began working as a logger and a linesman for a railroad company in Dickson, Tennessee. In his work he had to make extensive travels and that enabled him to meet other musicians along the way. He attended several fiddle contests across Tennessee winning the bulk of them. Smith made his solo debut as a fiddler on the Grand Ole Opry on December 23, 1927. He was made a member of The Opry in the 1920s. Within weeks he was accompanied by his cousin Homer Smith. In the meantime, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith continued to work on the railroad. In the 1930s, Smith formed \\"The Dixieliners\\" together with the McGee Brothers and his daughter Lavonne who played the piano. They became a regular act on the Opry in May 1932 performing popular songs such as Walking In My Sleep, Pig In the Pen and Blackberry Blossom. The Dixieliners toured the countryside featuring Uncle Dave Macon and the Delmore Brothers on some of these tours. In January 1935, Smith made his first recordings with the Delmore Brothers on the Bluebird label.Russell, Tony. Country music records: a discography, 1921-1942. Oxford University Press US, 2004. pp. 840-842. In 1936, Smith began to sing on his recordings on songs such as, Chittlin' Cookin' Time in Cheatham County, There's More Pretty Girls Than One and his signature song Beautiful Brown Eyes. That particular song, recorded in August 1937, led Smith to take action in court against some cover artists who had recorded the song as if it was in the public domain. He ended up winning the suit. Because of the hard work it took to maintain two full- time jobs, on the railroad and as a professional musician, Smith fell into hard drinking. In February 1938, it led to a temporary three-month suspension from the Opry. With assistance from Roy Acuff, Smith returned to the music circuit. In 1938, Smith's first recordings as \\"Arthur Smith & His Dixieliners\\" appeared on Bluebird, a band name he would again and again revisit, into the 1960s. In 1939, Smith joined the \\"Tennessee Valley Boys\\", consisting of Howdy Forrester and Georgia Slim Rutland. The following year, he left to join the \\"Shelton Brothers\\" in Shreveport, Louisiana. Once again, he left and instead formed a new group, \\"The Band of Arthurs\\", in Decatur, Alabama with his daughter Lavonne and some other musicians all named Arthur. In the early 1940s, Smith joined the \\"Bailes Brothers,\\" and published two songbooks, Songs From the Hills of Tennessee and Arthur Smith's Original Song Folio no.1. In the following years, he performed with artists like Rex Griffin and Jimmy Wakely. This led to an invitation from Hollywood in 1944 to appear in some low budget westerns. His film career ended in 1948. Smith signed with Capitol Records, but to avoid confusion with the newcomer Arthur \\"Guitar Boogie\\" Smith, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith's recordings were released under the name of \\"The Original Arthur Smith and His Dixieliners\\". After a brief stint with Billy Walker, Smith retired, and briefly worked as a carpenter in Nashville. Roy Acuff performed and recorded Smith's song, Beautiful, Brown Eyes. This led to several cover artists recording the song believing it was in the public domain, and Smith had to sue them in court. He eventually won the suit and received a lump sum. Smith made a comeback and joined up with Merle Travis. In 1957, Mike Seeger arranged a recording session with Smith and the McGee Brothers held in Kirk McGee's living room. Eight years later, the recordings were released on an album, resulting in great approval from old time music fans. In 1965, Smith and the McGee Brothers appeared at the Newport Folk Festival. He made his last appearance in 1969 with Sleepy Marlin and Tommy Riggs. Smith died in 1971 and was buried near McEwen, Tennessee. Discography 78s: In various prewar lineups Smith recorded singles on Bluebird, Victor, Regal Zonophone (Australia), The Twin (India), and Montgomery Ward labels, and in the postwar years on Black & White, Capitol, and Urban.

Doublethink is related to, but differs from, hypocrisy. George Orwell invented the word doublethink (as part of Newspeak) in his 1949 dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the novel, its origins within the citizenry is unclear; while it could be partly a product of Big Brother's formal brainwashing programs,Such as for example, the seemingly formal brainwashing program that broke Winston Smith. the novel explicitly shows people learning doublethink and Newspeak due to peer pressure and a desire to \\"fit in\\", or gain status within the Party‚Äîto be seen as a loyal Party Member. In the novel, for someone to even recognize‚Äîlet alone mention‚Äîany contradiction within the context of the Party line is akin to blasphemy, and could subject that person to disciplinary action and the instant social disapproval of fellow Party Members. Like many aspects of the dystopian societies reflected in Orwell's writings, Orwell considered doublethink to be a feature of Soviet-style totalitarianism, as reflected in this statement from a speech by Joseph Stalin: Origin and concepts According to Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, doublethink is: Orwell explains that the Party could not protect its near-absolute power without degrading its people with constant propaganda. Yet knowledge of this brutal deception, even within the Inner Party itself, could lead to the implosion of the State. Although Nineteen Eighty-Four is most famous for the Party's pervasive surveillance of everyday life, this control means that the population of Oceania‚Äîall of it and including the ruling elite, but in practice largely excluding the proles‚Äîcould be controlled and manipulated merely through the alteration of everyday thought and language. Newspeak is the method for controlling thought through language; doublethink is the method of directly controlling thought. Earlier in the book, doublethink is explained as being able to control your memories, to be able to manually forget something, then to forget about forgetting. This is demonstrated by O'Brien, during the time when Winston Smith is being tortured toward the end of the book. Newspeak incorporates doublethink, as it contains many words that create assumed associations between contradictory meanings, especially true of fundamentally important words such as good and evil, right and wrong, truth and falsehood, and justice and injustice. The demand for doublethink was especially difficult on employees of the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth. The department's responsibility was to falsify historic records, even recent ones, by means of rewrite and deletion, all so that the Party could maintain the illusion that everything it had ever said and done was perfect and consistent. Yet, despite their direct role in this systematic deception, these same workers were still expected to believe the most recently created version of history, or face severe penalty if they failed. As revealed in Goldstein's Book, the Ministry's name is itself an example of doublethink: the Ministry of Truth is really concerned with lies. The other ministries of Airstrip One are similarly named: the Ministry of Peace is concerned with war, the Ministry of Love is concerned with torture, and the Ministry of Plenty is concerned with starvation. The three slogans of the Party‚ÄîWar is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength‚Äîare also examples. Moreover, doublethink's self-deception allows the Party to maintain huge goals and realistic expectations: Thus each Party member could be a credulous pawn but would never lack relevant information, the Party being both fanatical and well informed and thus unlikely either to \\"ossify\\" or \\"grow soft\\" and collapse. Doublethink would avoid a \\"killing the messenger\\" attitude that could disturb the Command structure. Thus doublethink is the key tool of self-discipline for the Party, complementing the state-imposed discipline of propaganda and the police state. These tools together hide the government's evil not just from the people but from the government itself‚Äîbut without the confusion and misinformation associated with primitive totalitarian regimes. Doublethink is critical in allowing the Party to know what its true goals are without recoiling from them, avoiding the conflation of a regime's egalitarian propaganda with its true purpose. Paradoxically, during the long and harrowing process in which the protagonist Winston Smith is systematically tortured and broken, he contemplates using doublethink as the ultimate recourse in his rebellion‚Äîto let himself become consciously a loyal party member while letting his hatred of the party remain an unconscious presence deep in his mind and let it surface again at the very moment of his execution so that \\"the bullet would enter a free mind\\" with which the Thought Police would not have a chance to tamper again. Since 1949 (when Nineteen Eighty-Four was published) the word doublethink has become synonymous with relieving cognitive dissonance by ignoring the contradiction between two world views‚Äîor even of deliberately seeking to relieve cognitive dissonance. Some schools of psychotherapy such as cognitive therapy encourage people to alter their own thoughts as a way of treating different psychological maladies (see cognitive distortions). Orwell's \\"doublethink\\" is also credited with having inspired the commonly used term \\"doublespeak\\", which itself does not appear in the book. Comparisons have been made between doublespeak and Orwell's descriptions on political speech from his essay \\"Politics and the English Language\\", in which \\"unscrupulous politicians, advertisers, religionists, and other doublespeakers of whatever stripe continue to abuse language for manipulative purposes\\".

Patrick James S. \\"Paddy\\" Carew (10 September 1875 ‚Äì 31 March 1942) was an Australian rugby union national and state representative and a first-class cricketer and public servant. He was born in Pine Mountain in southern Queensland. Sporting life Carew, a prop, claimed a total of four international rugby caps for Australia. All of those caps came in matches against Great Britain in 1899. His debut game was against Great Britain, at Sydney, on 24 June 1899, the inaugural rugby Test match played by an Australian national representative side. He was one of only five Queenslanders selected in that first Test. Four weeks later he played in the second Test at Brisbane. His performance in that match was noted as excellent by the press. He played in all four Tests of the series and made a Queensland state appearance against those same tourists in Brisbane on 1 July 1899. Paddy represented Queensland in rugby from 1898 to 1901, and was named to the \\"Gallery of Great Players\\" on the occasion of Queensland Rugby Union's Jubilee in 1932 for representing the State on more than 10 occasions. He played a total of 17 matches: 16 against NSW as a forward and one against Great Britain. He captained Queensland in two games against NSW in 1901. In 1903 Paddy joined Sydney's Eastern Suburbs Rugby Club and contributed to the club's first premiership that same year playing variously as a centre and forward. He was elected Easts' captain in 1904. He represented NSW against Queensland, and in 1903 against New Zealand. At cricket he played as a right arm bowler and in five first-class matches with Queensland, between the 1899/00 and 1902/03 seasons, took nine wickets at 35.77. His brother James also represented Queensland at cricket. He played for Toowong in Brisbane district cricket and in 1903 he scored 233 for the club against South Brisbane, setting the record highest individual score in Queensland district cricket. Later life Carew made a career in local government administration, serving as Shire Clerk for the Warringah Shire Council in Sydney from 1907 to 1913. He had a long commercial career as manager of the Manly Brick and Tile Company. in 1930 returned to public service as the Town Clerk of Cobar, and briefly as Shire Clerk in Dalgety for a few months in 1932. Finally he became the Town Clerk of Queanbeyan in September 1932, a post he held until his death in 1942. He was instrumental in establishing the Queanbeyan Bowling Club in 1934.

The Mote and the Beam is a parable of Jesus given in the Sermon on the MountMatthew by Charles H. Talbert 2010 page 93 view 93 in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 7, verses . The discourse is fairly brief, and begins by warning his followers of the dangers of judging others, stating that they too would be judged by the same standard.

( was translated \\"thou\\" after using \\"ye\\" in .) Interpretation The Parable of the Mote and the Beam. Drawing by Ottmar Elliger the Younger (1666‚Äì1735). The moral lesson is to avoid hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and censoriousness. The analogy used is of a small object in another's eye as compared with a large beam of wood in one's own. The original Greek word translated as \\"mote\\" ( karphos) meant \\"any small dry body\\".Henry Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon: ' . The terms mote and beam are from the King James Version; other translations use different words, e.g. the New International Version uses \\"speck (of sawdust)\\" and \\"plank\\". In 21st century English a \\"mote\\" is more normally a particle of dust ‚Äì particularly one that is floating in the air ‚Äì rather than a tiny splinter of wood. The analogy is suggestive of a carpenter's workshop, with which Jesus would have been familiar. In the analogy, the one seeking to remove the impediment in the eye of his brother has the larger impediment in his own eye, suggesting metaphorically that the one who attempts to regulate his brother often displays the greater blindness and hypocrisy.

It was derived by Aleksandr Andronov and Lev Pontryagin in 1937. Statement A dynamical system : \\\\dot{x} = v(x), where v is a C^{1}-vector field on the plane, x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}, is orbitally topologically stable if and only if the following two conditions hold: # All equilibrium points and periodic orbits are hyperbolic. # There are no saddle connections. The same statement holds if the vector field v is defined on the unit disk and is transversal to the boundary. Clarifications Orbital topological stability of a dynamical system means that for any sufficiently small perturbation (in the C1-metric), there exists a homeomorphism close to the identity map which transforms the orbits of the original dynamical system to the orbits of the perturbed system (cf structural stability). The first condition of the theorem is known as global hyperbolicity. A zero of a vector field v, i.e. a point x0 where v(x0)=0, is said to be hyperbolic if none of the eigenvalues of the linearization of v at x0 is purely imaginary. A periodic orbit of a flow is said to be hyperbolic if none of the eigenvalues of the Poincar√© return map at a point on the orbit has absolute value one. Finally, saddle connection refers to a situation where an orbit from one saddle point enters the same or another saddle point, i.e. the unstable and stable separatrices are connected (cf homoclinic orbit and heteroclinic orbit).

In , the New York Mets established a Double-A Texas League farm team, the Memphis Blues, in Antonelli's hometown and Antonelli returned to uniform as a coach. In , Antonelli succeeded Pete Pavlick as Memphis manager' and held the post until Roy McMillan arrived from Class-A Visalia to take over the helm. Then, in , Antonelli was named the permanent pilot of the Blues, and he continued as a manager in the Mets' farm system through 1976 with Memphis (1970‚Äì72), the Triple-A Tidewater Tides (1973‚Äì74), and the Double-A Jackson Mets (1975‚Äì76). His career record as a minor league manager was 745‚Äì688 (.520). Antonelli then served as a roving minor league infield instructor in the Mets' system, through 1985. He died in 1990 in Memphis at the age of 74 and is buried at Calvary Cemetery.

This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events. Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper. MeaningEtymology= The English word \\"news\\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \\"new\\". In Middle English, the equivalent word was newes, like the French nouvelles and the German Neues. Similar developments are found in the Slavic languages the Czech and Slovak noviny (from nov√Ω, \\"new\\"), the cognate Polish nowiny, the Bulgarian novini, and Russian novosti ‚Äì and in the Celtic languages: the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from nowydh).\\"News\\", Oxford English Dictionary, accessed online, 5 March 2015. \\"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French nouvelles (see novel n.), or classical Latin nova new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of novus new (compare classical Latin rƒìs nova (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events). Compare later \\" Jessica Garretson Finch is credited with coining the phrase \\"current events\\" while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s. =Newness= As its name implies, \\"news\\" typically connotes the presentation of new information.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 13.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), p. 7. \\"In the information which [the newspaper] chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness; to its readers, it offered regularity of publication. It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\\" The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes Th√©ophraste Renaudot: \\"History is the record of things accomplished. A Gazette is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true.\\"Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), p. 3. \\"Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market‚Äîand by the sixteenth century it was a real market‚Äîwas humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information.\\" Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.Park, \\"News as a Form of Knowledge\\" (1940), pp. 675‚Äì676. \\"News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences.\\" News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past‚Äîor are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \\"peg\\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.Schudson, \\"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\\"; in Reading The News (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81‚Äì82. Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.Shoemaker & Cohen, News Around the World (2006), pp. 13‚Äì14. Hence the famous dictum that \\"Dog Bites Man\\" is not news, but \\"Man Bites Dog\\" is.Park, \\"News as a Form of Knowledge\\" (1940), p. 678. Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 56. \\"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\\" =Commodity= According to some theories, \\"news\\" is whatever the news industry sells.Heyd, Reading newspapers (2012), pp. 35, 82. \\"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\\" Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 3. \\"The term journalism is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\\"Shoemaker & Cohen, News Around the World (2006), p. 7. \\"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as newsworthy entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\\" From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), p. 6. \\"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\\" A news agency supplies this resource \\"wholesale\\" and publishers enhance it for retail.Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 6. \\"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\\"Phil MacGregor, \\"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). =Tone= Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and objectivity, despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.Heyd, Reading newspapers (2012), pp. 36‚Äì37. Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized 'tabloid journalism' has risen in popularity. Michael Schudson has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of propaganda, journalists were not aware of the concept of bias in reporting, let alone actively correcting for it.Schudson, Discovering the News (1978), p. 6. \\"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [‚Ä¶] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, na√Øve empiricism could not last.\\" News is also sometimes said to portray the truth, but this relationship is elusive and qualified.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 46‚Äì47. Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is sensationalism, the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 2. \\"Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news is, in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often‚Äîwhether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder‚Äîto shock.\\" This news is also not unrelated to gossip, the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.Stephens, History of News (1988), pp. 26, 105‚Äì106. A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, \\"if it bleeds, it leads\\".Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 202. =Newsworthiness= Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage. news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 33. War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 31. HistoryFolk news= Evidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.Stephens, History of News (1988), pp. 14, 305. \\"The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing‚Äîlet alone printing presses or computers‚Äîto whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. [‚Ä¶] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange.\\" Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.Stephens, History of News (1988), p 23. Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town criers, etc.Fang, History of Mass Communication (1997), p. 19. The news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, coffeehouses served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available. The history of the coffee houses is traced from Arab countries, which was introduced in England in the 16th century.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 8. \\"A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth‚Äîthe coffeehouse‚Äîflourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television.\\" In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at mosques and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at caravanserais, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.Ayalon, The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History (1995), p. 5. In late medieval Britain, reports (\\"tidings\\") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 The House of Fame and other works.Lim, \\"Take Writing\\" (2006), pp. 1‚Äì6. =Government proclamations= Woodcut by Tommaso Garzoni depicting a town crier with a trumpet Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and edicts were circulated at times in some centralized empires. The first documented use of an organized courier service for the diffusion of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC). Julius Caesar regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming dictator of Rome began publishing government announcements called Acta Diurna. These were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 9.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), p. 390. In medieval England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to sheriffs for public display and reading at the market.Lim, \\"Take Writing\\" (2006), p. 5. Specially sanctioned messengers have been recognized in Vietnamese culture, among the Khasi people in India, and in the Fox and Winnebago cultures of the American midwest. The Zulu Kingdom used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by griots. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 27‚Äì30. Town criers were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as banditori arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322‚Äì1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.Milner, \\"Fanno bandire\\" (2013), pp. 110‚Äì112. Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.Milner, \\"Fanno bandire\\" (2013), p. 120. These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an exordium‚Äî\\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\\"‚Äîand continuing with a statement (narratio), a request made upon the listeners (petitio), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (peroratio).Milner, \\"Fanno bandire\\" (2013), p. 121. In addition to major declarations, bandi (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.Milner, \\"Fanno bandire\\" (2013), pp. 122‚Äì123. Niccol√≤ Machiavelli was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.Milner, \\"Fanno bandire\\" (2013), p. 124. Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), p. 366. \\"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988).\\" Under the Ottoman Empire, official messages were regularly distributed at mosques, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements in marketplaces, highways, and other well- traveled places, sometimes issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.Ayalon, The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History (1995), p. 4. =Early news networks= The spread of news has always been linked to the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread. Postal services have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power in a large area.Fang, History of Mass Communication (1997), pp. 14‚Äì15.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 27. \\"Whoever controlled the messengers could select which anecdotes and information would be favored by this treatment. Therefore, whoever controlled the messengers gained not only a conduit to the members of a society‚Äîthe ability to inform them of new regulations‚Äîbut gained a measure of power over the selection of news the members of a society received‚Äîthe power, for example to ensure that they received news of triumphs but not necessarily of debacles. Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent.\\" One of the imperial communication channels, called the \\"Royal Road\\" traversed the Assyrian Empire and served as a key source of its power.Kessler, \\"Royal Roads\\" (1995), p. 129. \\"The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East.\\" The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as cursus publicus, for similar purposes.Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), pp. 19‚Äì20. Visible chains of long distance signaling, known as optical telegraphy, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes.Stephens, History of News (1988), pp. 24‚Äì25. The latter form of optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), pp. 156‚Äì157. Asia Reproduction of Kaiyuan Za Bao court newspaper from the Tang dynasty The world's first written news may have originated in eighth century BCE China, where reports gathered by officials were eventually compiled as the Spring and Autumn Annals. The annals, whose compilation is attributed to Confucius, were available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news themes‚Äîthough they straddle the line between news and history.Zhang, Origins of the Modern Chinese Press (2007), p. 13. The Han dynasty is credited with developing one of the most effective imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient world.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), p. 14. \\"The Chinese civilization was one of the earliest to have found it convenient to set up a systematic news-collection network across a large land mass. During the Han dynasty (206BC‚ÄìAD219) the imperial court arranged to be supplied with information on the events of the Empire by means of a postal empire similar to the princely message systems of the European Middle Ages, when the postmasters of the Holy Roman Empire were required to write summaries of events taking place within their regions and transmit them along specified routes.\\" Government-produced news sheets, called tipao, circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the Kaiyuan Za Bao (\\"Bulletin of the Court\\") of the Chinese Tang Dynasty published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. The court created a Bureau of Official Reports (Jin Zhouyuan) to centralize news distribution for the court.Zhang, Origins of the Modern Chinese Press (2007), p. 14. \\"However, it was in the Tang dynasty that a specific bureau‚Äîthe Bureau of Official Reports (Jin Zhouyuan)‚Äîwas created to accommodate the local representatives. During this time, there were many rising powerful dukes, princes or governor- generals in charge of the large territories, equal in size to a modern province in China. These dukes or princes would naturally provide for their own news service at the capital Chang'an, which handled all official documents submitted by these representatives and transmitted imperial edicts in return. Recent archaeological research has uncovered such official reports from the Tang dynasty. Two archive documents of that period, originally found in Dunhuang have been regarded by Chinese scholars as the earliest forms of newspaper in the world (Fang 1997 53‚Äì8)\\" Newsletters called ch'ao pao continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation in the following centuries.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), p. 14. \\"At a later stage of its development, during the Sung period (960‚Äì1278), the ti pao was made to circulate among the purely intellectual groups, and during the Ming (1367‚Äì1644) was seen by a wider circle of society.\\" In 1582 there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late Ming Dynasty.Brook, Timothy. (1998). The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China. Berkeley: University of California Press. p. xxi.Stephens, History of News (1988), pp. 68‚Äì69. Japan had effective communications and postal delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with the Taika Reform and again during the Kamakura period from 1183‚Äì1333. The system depended on hikyaku, runners, and regularly spaced relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and Kamakura in 5‚Äì7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.Distelrath, \\"Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan\\" (2000), pp. 45‚Äì46 .Alice Gordenker, \\"Postal Symbol\\"; Japan Times, 21 May 2013. The Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of news circulation.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), p. 14‚Äì15. The postal system established during the Edo period was even more effective, with average speeds of 125‚Äì150 km/day and express speed of 200 km/day. This system was initially used only by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own nakama (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors by night. Europe In Europe, during the Middle Ages, elites relied on runners to transmit news over long distances. At 33 kilometres per day, a runner would take two months to bring a message across the Hanseatic League from Bruges to Riga.Distelrath, \\"Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan\\" (2000), p. 44.Lampe & Ploeckl, \\"Spanning the Globe\\" (2014), 247. In the early modern period, increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets. The driving force of this new development was the commercial advantage provided by up-to- date news.McCusker & Gravesteijn, Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism (1991), p. 21. \\"Business thrives on the most recent news. The merchants of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, no less than those of today, required the 'freshest advices' in order to conduct their affairs profitably.\\" In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly Notizie scritte, which cost one gazetta.Wan-Press.org , A Newspaper Timeline, World Association of Newspapers These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500‚Äì1700)‚Äîsharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers.Infelise, Mario. \\"Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century.\\" in Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492‚Äì1700(Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp. 212, 214, 216‚Äì217 Avvisi were sold by subscription under the auspices of military, religious, and banking authorities. Sponsorship flavored the contents of each series, which were circulated under many different names. Subscribers included clerics, diplomatic staff, and noble families. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century, long passages from avvisi were finding their way into published monthlies such as the Mercure de France and, in northern Italy, Pallade veneta.Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. Pallade Veneta: Writings on Music and Society, 1650‚Äì1750. Venice: Fondazione Ugo e Olga Levi, 1985. Chs. 1 2, 3.Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. Song and Season: Science, Culture, and Theatrical Time. (Stanford UP, 2007). Chs. 10, 11.Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), p. 5. Some European postal routes in 1563 Postal services enabled merchants and monarchs to stay abreast of important information. For the Holy Roman Empire, Emperor Maximillian I in 1490 authorized two brothers from the Italian Tasso family, Francesco and Janetto, to create a network of courier stations linked by riders. They began with a communications line between Innsbruck and Mechelen and grew from there.Lampe & Ploeckl, \\"Spanning the Globe\\" (2014), 248. In 1505 this network expanded to Spain, new governed by Maximilian's son Philip. These riders could travel 180 kilometers in a day.Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), pp. 17‚Äì18. This system became the Imperial Reichspost, administered by Tasso descendants (subsequently known as Thurn-und-Taxis), who in 1587 received exclusive operating rights from the Emperor. The French postal service and English postal service also began at this time, but did not become comprehensive until the early 1600s.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), pp. 30‚Äì31.Fang, History of Mass Communication (1997), pp. 29‚Äì30. In 1620, the English system linked with Thurn-und- Taxis.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 13. These connections underpinned an extensive system of news circulation, with handwritten items bearing dates and places of origin. Centred in Germany, the network took in news from Russia, the Balkans, Italy, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), pp. 18‚Äì19. \\"Since the late Middle Ages a formal network of correspondents and intelligence agents had come into being across the bulk of the European continent, busily sending news of military, diplomatic and ecclesiastical affairs along a series of prescribed routes. The information was handwritten and passed along carefully organized chains, each item being labeled with its place and date of origin.\\" The German lawyer Christoph von Scheurl and the Fugger house of Augsburg were prominent hubs in this network. Letters describing historically significant events could gain wide circulation as news reports. Indeed, personal correspondence sometimes acted only as a convenient channel through which news could flow across a larger network.Lim, \\"Take Writing\\" (2006), pp. 35‚Äì45. A common type of business communication was a simple listing of current prices, the circulation of which quickened the flow of international trade.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), pp. 10‚Äì11.Kallionen, \\"Information, communication technology, and business\\" (2004), p. 22. Businesspeople also wanted to know about events related to shipping, the affairs of other businesses, and political developments. Even after the advent of international newspapers, business owners still valued correspondence highly as a source of reliable news that would affect their enterprise.Kallionen, \\"Information, communication technology, and business\\" (2004), p. 21. \\"Although the businessmen obtained information from newspapers and other public sources, for instance, from the consuls stationed in foreign towns, they placed special value on the letters received directly from their foreign partners. This is precisely the key to the existence of a network relationship: the parties were dependent on the resources controlled by both parties, both goods and information, so by mutual co-operation both parties gained mutual benefits. Long-term, personal networks were particularly well suited for transmitting information that required high reliability. Handwritten newsletters, which could be produced quickly for a limited clientele, also continued into the 1600s.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), pp. 11‚Äì12. =Rise of the newspaper= Stationers' Company) on 3 December 1909 The spread of paper and the printing press from China to Europe preceded a major advance in the transmission of news.Fang, History of Mass Communication (1997), pp. 20‚Äì23. With the spread of printing presses and the creation of new markets in the 1500s, news underwent a shift from factual and precise economic reporting, to a more emotive and freewheeling format. (Private newsletters containing important intelligence therefore remained in use by people who needed to know.)Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), pp. 6‚Äì8. \\"So this sort of news reporting was very different from the discreet, dispassionate services of the manuscript news men. News pamphlets were often committed and engaged, intended to persuade as well as inform. News also became, for the first time, part of the entertainment industry. What could be more entertaining than the tale of some catastrophe in a far-off place, or a grisly murder? This was not unproblematic, particularly for the traditional leaders of society who were used to news being part of a confidential service, provided by trusted agents.\\" The first newspapers emerged in Germany in the early 1600s.Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), p. 8. Relation aller F√ºrnemmen und gedenckw√ºrdigen Historien, from 1605, is recognized as the world's first formalized 'newspaper';; World Association of Newspapers: \\"Newspapers: 400 Years Young!\\" while not a 'newspaper' in the modern sense, the Ancient Roman acta diurna served a similar purpose circa 131 BC. The new format, which mashed together numerous unrelated and perhaps dubious reports from far-flung locations, created a radically new and jarring experience for its readers.Pettegree, The Invention of News (2014), p. 9. \\"The news reporting of the newspapers was very different, and utterly unfamiliar to those who had not previously been subscribers to the manuscript service. Each report was no more than a couple sentences long. It offered no explanation, comment, or commentary. Unlike a news pamphlet the reader did not know where this fitted in the narrative‚Äîor even whether what was reported would turn out to be important.\\" A variety of styles emerged, from single-story tales, to compilations, overviews, and personal and impersonal types of news analysis.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), pp. 9‚Äì10. News for public consumption was at first tightly controlled by governments. By 1530, England had created a licensing system for the press and banned \\"seditious opinions\\".Cranfield, Press and Society (1978), p. 1. Under the Licensing Act, publication was restricted to approved presses‚Äîas exemplified by The London Gazette, which prominently bore the words: \\"Published By Authority\\".Heyd, Reading newspapers (2012), p. 11. Parliament allowed the Licensing Act to lapse in 1695, beginning a new era marked by Whig and Tory newspapers.Heyd, Reading newspapers (2012), pp. 15‚Äì16. (During this era, the Stamp Act limited newspaper distribution simply by making them expensive to sell and buy.) In France, censorship was even more constant.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), p. 29. Consequently, many Europeans read newspapers originating from beyond their national borders‚Äîespecially from the Dutch Republic, where publishers could evade state censorship.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), pp. 43‚Äì44. The new United States saw a newspaper boom beginning with the Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over the establishment of a new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 Postal Service Act, and continuing into the 1800s.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 30.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), pp. 69‚Äì73. American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering free postage to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), p. 90. \\"The 1792 law codified the right of newspapers to exchange copies for free with one another, and by the 1840s the average newspaper received an astonishing 4,300 exchange copies a year. Editors relied on other papers for the national news that filled most of their columns. In effect, the federal government was encouraging local papers to become outlets for a national news network that the government itself did not control.\\" Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the West, fueled by high literacy and a newspaper-loving culture.Cloud, Frontier Press (2008), pp. 8‚Äì9, 22‚Äì23. By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita.Cloud, Frontier Press (2008), pp. 31, 73. Boosters of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community.Cloud, Frontier Press (2008), pp. 67‚Äì69. The 1830s American, wrote Alexis de Tocqueville, was \\"a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers.\\"Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), p. 48. [\\"Tout est primitif et sauvage autour de lui, mais lui est pour ainsi dire le r√©sultat de dix-huit si√®cles de travaux et d'exp√©rience. Il porte le v√™tement des villes, en parle la langue; sait le pass√©, est curieux de l'avenir, argumente sur le pr√©sent; c'est un homme tr√®s civilis√©, qui, pour un temps, se soumet √† vivre au milieu des bois, et qui s'enfonce dans les d√©serts du Nouveau Monde avec la Bible, une hache et des journaux.\\"] In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon.Smith,The Newspaper: An International History (1979), pp. 88‚Äì89. In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the Bureau d'Esprit.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), p. 391. Some newspapers published in the 1800s and after retained the commercial orientation characteristic of the private newsletters of the Renaissance. Economically oriented newspapers published new types of data enabled the advent of statistics, especially economic statistics which could inform sophisticated investment decisions.Parsons, Power of the Financial Press (1989), p. 31 These newspapers, too, became available for larger sections of society, not just elites, keen on investing some of their savings in the stock markets. Yet, as in the case other newspapers, the incorporation of advertising into the newspaper led to justified reservations about accepting newspaper information at face value.Parsons, Power of the Financial Press (1989), p. 40 Economic newspapers also became promoters of economic ideologies, such as Keynesianism in the mid-1900s.Parsons, Power of the Financial Press (1989), pp. 81‚Äì110. Newspapers came to sub-Saharan Africa via colonization. The first English-language newspaper in the area was The Royal Gazette and Sierra Leone Advertiser, established in 1801, and followed by The Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer in 1822 and the Liberia Herald in 1826.Fosu, \\"The Press and Political Participation\\" (2014), p. 59 A number of nineteenth-century African newspapers were established by missionaries.Fosu, \\"The Press and Political Participation\\" (2014), pp. 60‚Äì61. These newspapers by and large promoted the colonial governments and served the interests of European settlers by relaying news from Europe. The first newspaper published in a native African language was the Muigwithania, published in Kikuyu by the Kenyan Central Association. Muigwithania and other newspapers published by indigenous Africans took strong opposition stances, agitating strongly for African independence.Fosu, \\"The Press and Political Participation\\" (2014), p. 62 Newspapers were censored heavily during the colonial period‚Äîas well as after formal independence. Some liberalization and diversification took place in the 1990s.Fosu, \\"The Press and Political Participation\\" (2014), pp. 64‚Äì65. Newspapers were slow to spread to the Arab world, which had a stronger tradition of oral communication, and mistrust of the European approach to news reporting. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire's leaders in Istanbul did monitor the European press, but its contents were not disseminated for mass consumption.Ayalon, The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History (1995), pp. 6‚Äì7. Some of the first written news in modern North Africa arose in Egypt under Muhammad Ali, who developed the local paper industry and initiated the limited circulation of news bulletins called jurnals.Ayalon, The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History (1995), pp. 13‚Äì16. Beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, the private press began to develop in the multi-religious country of Lebanon.Ayalon, The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History (1995), pp. 28‚Äì39. =Newswire= The development of the electrical telegraph, which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances.Wenzlhuemer, Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World (2013), pp. 31‚Äì32. (Days before Morse's Baltimore‚ÄìWashington line transmitted the famous question, \\"What hath God wrought?\\", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.) Telegraph networks enabled a new centralization of the news, in the hands of wire services concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with Charles-Louis Havas, who founded Bureau Havas (later Agence France-Presse) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical telegraph network. In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 15. One of Havas's proteges, Bernhard Wolff, founded Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau in Berlin in 1849.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), p. 180. Another Havas disciple, Paul Reuter, began collecting news from Germany and France in 1849, and in 1851 immigrated to London, where he established the Reuters news agency‚Äîspecializing in news from the continent.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), p. 118. In 1863, William Saunders and Edward Spender formed the Central Press agency, later called the Press Association, to handle domestic news.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), pp. 117‚Äì118. Just before insulated telegraph line crossed the English Channel in 1851, Reuter won the right to transmit stock exchange prices between Paris and London.Wenzlhuemer, Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World (2013), pp. 90‚Äì92. He maneuvered Reuters into a dominant global position with the motto \\"Follow the Cable\\", setting up news outposts across the British Empire in Alexandria (1865), Bombay (1866), Melbourne (1874), Sydney (1874), and Cape Town (1876).Hachten, World News Prism (1996), p. 43. In the United States, the Associated Press became a news powerhouse, gaining a lead position through an exclusive arrangement with the Western Union company. The telegraph ushered in a new global communications regime, accompanied by a restructuring of the national postal systems, and closely followed by the advent of telephone lines. With the value of international news at a premium, governments, businesses, and news agencies moved aggressively to reduce transmission times. In 1865, Reuters had the scoop on the Lincoln assassination, reporting the news in England twelve days after the event took place.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 16. In 1866, an undersea telegraph cable successfully connected Ireland to Newfoundland (and thus the Western Union network) cutting trans-Atlantic transmission time from days to hours.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 17.Graham Meikle, Interpreting News; Palgrave Macmillan, 2009; p. 152. The transatlantic cable allowed fast exchange of information about the London and New York stock exchanges, as well as the New York, Chicago, and Liverpool commodity exchanges‚Äîfor the price of $5‚Äì10, in gold, per word.Hills, Struggle for Control of Global Communication (2002), p. 32. Transmitting On 11 May 1857, a young British telegraph operator in Delhi signaled home to alert the authorities of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebels proceeded to disrupt the British telegraph network, which was rebuilt with more redundancies.Wenzlhuemer, Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World (2013), pp. 211‚Äì215. In 1902‚Äì1903, Britain and the U.S. completed the circumtelegraphy of the planet with transpacific cables from Canada to Fiji and New Zealand (British Empire), and from the US to Hawaii and the occupied Philippines.Hills, Struggle for Control of Global Communication (2002), pp. 145‚Äì146. U.S. reassertions of the Monroe Doctrine notwithstanding, Latin America was a battleground of competing telegraphic interests until World War I, after which U.S. interests finally did consolidate their power in the hemisphere.Hills, Struggle for Control of Global Communication (2002), pp. 153‚Äì178. World railway and telegraph system, 1900 By the turn of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, dividing up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies.Oliver Boyd-Barrett, \\"'Global' News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 26‚Äì27. \\"The principal feature of the world's news market in the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th, was the cartel. This was an oligopolistic and hierarchical structure of the global news market controlled by Reuters, Havas and Wolff at the top tier, in partnership with an ever-increasing number of national news agencies. Each member of the triumvirate had the right to distribute its news service, incorporating news of the cartel, to its ascribed territories: these territories were determined by periodic, formal agreements. [‚Ä¶] The triumvirate of Reuters, Havas, and Wolff supplied world news to national news agencies in return for a service of national news [‚Ä¶] (although the practice was rather more complicated) the national agencies had exclusive rights to the distribution of cartel news in their territories, and the cartel had exclusive rights to the national agency news services.\\" Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 22. Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 36. Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press.Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 23. In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into \\"soft\\" news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and \\"human interest\\".Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 28. In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with Vestnik, the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow.Michael Palmer, \\"What Makes News\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 180‚Äì181. During and after the Russian Revolution, the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency, renamed the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and eventually the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS).Michael Palmer, \\"What Makes News\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 184. The Chinese Communist Party created its news agency, the Red China News Agency, in 1931; its primary responsibilities were the Red China newspaper and the internal Reference News. In 1937, the Party renamed the agency Xinhua, New China. Xinhua became the official news agency of the People's Republic of China in 1949.Xin Xin, \\"A developing market in news: Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers\\"; Media, Culture & Society 28.1 (2006). These agencies touted their ability to distill events into \\"minute globules of news\\", 20‚Äì30 word summaries which conveyed the essence of new developments. Unlike newspapers, and contrary to the sentiments of some of their reporters, the agencies sought to keep their reports simple and factual.Michael Palmer, \\"What Makes News\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 182‚Äì183. The wire services brought forth the \\"inverted pyramid\\" model of news copy, in which key facts appear at the start of the text, and more and more details are included as it goes along. The sparse telegraphic writing style spilled over into newspapers, which often reprinted stories from the wire with little embellishment.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 18‚Äì19. In a 20 September 1918 Pravda editorial, Lenin instructed the Soviet press to cut back on their political rambling and produce many short anticapitalist news items in \\"telegraph style\\".Wolfe, Governing Soviet Journalism (2005), pp. 25‚Äì26. Translating Lenin: \\"Why instead of 200‚Äì400 lines you can't write in 20‚Äì10 lines about such simple, well-known, clear, and already mastered to a great degree, widespread phenomena like the base betrayals of the Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, like the Anglo- Japanese invasion for the restoration of the holy law of capital; like the chattering teeth of the American millionaires against Germany, and so on, and so on. It is necessary to talk about this, it is necessary to register each new fact in this regard, but in a few lines; to pound out in 'telegraph style' the new appearances of old, already known and evaluated policies.\\" As in previous eras, the news agencies provided special services to political and business clients, and these services constituted a significant portion of their operations and income. The wire services maintained close relationships with their respective national governments, which provided both press releases and payments.Boyd-Barrett, \\"'Global' News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 23‚Äì24. \\"Earnings were generally derived from the sale of news services to media, financial or economic institutions, and governments, which were important as sources of revenue and as sources of intelligence, and it is generally considered that their news services reflected their respective national interests.\\" The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and economic globalization. \\"It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself. In order to send goods to another area, merchants needed to know first whether in fact to send off the goods and to what place. Information costs and speed were essential for these decisions.\\"Bakker, \\"Trading Facts\\" (2011), p. 33. =Radio and television= The British Broadcasting Company began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 26‚Äì27. BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), p. 31. \\"It was quite normal for the average listener to be depicted as dressed immaculately in full evening dress, seated or standing elegantly with an expensive brand of cigarette in his hand, listening to his set. The BBC was happy to live up to this stereotype. Radio announces always arrived in evening dress, and announcers were chosen from the upper classes of English society. More importantly, they had to be able to speak the King's English just as the King spoke it.\\" The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 33‚Äì34. In the USA, RCA's Radio Group established its radio network, NBC, in 1926. The Paley family founded CBS soon after. These two networks, which supplied news broadcasts to subsidiaries and affiliates, dominated the airwaves throughout the period of radio's hegemony as a news source.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), pp. 177‚Äì178. Radio broadcasters in the United States negotiated a similar arrangement with the press in 1933, when they agreed to use only news from the Press‚ÄìRadio Bureau and eschew advertising; this agreement soon collapsed and radio stations began reporting their own news (with advertising).Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 33. As in Britain, American news radio avoided \\"controversial\\" topics as per norms established by the National Association of Broadcasters.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 34. By 1939, 58% of Americans surveyed by Fortune considered radio news more accurate than newspapers, and 70% chose radio as their main news source. Radio expanded rapidly across the continent, from 30 stations in 1920 to a thousand in the 1930s. This operation was financed mostly with advertising and public relations money.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), p. 27. \\"Thus WEAF planted the seeds of a new business that eventually grew to envelop the broadcasting industry: advertising, public relations, and propaganda. From about 1927 this revolution was under way. Advertising agencies, manufacturers, sponsors, promoters, and the sellers of medical and life insurance were jockeying for places in a world of propaganda disseminated by radio broadcasting.\\" The Soviet Union began a major international broadcasting operation in 1929, with stations in German, English and French. The Nazi Party made use of the radio in its rise to power in Germany, with much of its propaganda focused on attacking the Soviet Bolsheviks. The British and Italian foreign radio services competed for influence in North Africa. All four of these broadcast services grew increasingly vitriolic as the European nations prepared for war.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 38‚Äì42. The war provided an opportunity to expand radio and take advantage of its new potential. The BBC reported on Allied invasion of Normandy on 8:00 a.m. of the morning it took place, and including a clip from German radio coverage of the same event. Listeners followed along with developments throughout the day.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 29. The U.S. set up its Office of War Information which by 1942 sent programming across South America, the Middle East, and East Asia.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), p. 51. Radio Luxembourg, a centrally located high-power station on the continent, was seized by Germany, and then by the United States‚Äîwhich created fake news programs appearing as though they were created by Germany.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 45. Targeting American troops in the Pacific, the Japanese government broadcast the \\"Zero Hour\\" program, which included news from the U.S. to make the soldiers homesick.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 87‚Äì91. But by the end of the war, Britain had the largest radio network in the world, broadcasting internationally in 43 different languages.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 39, 105. Its scope would eventually be surpassed (by 1955) by the worldwide Voice of America programs, produced by the United States Information Agency.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 108‚Äì114, 132. In Britain and the United States, television news watching rose dramatically in the 1950s and by the 1960s supplanted radio as the public's primary source of news.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 42‚Äì44. In the U.S., television was run by the same networks which owned radio: CBS, NBC, and an NBC spin-off called ABC.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), p. 209. Edward R. Murrow, who first entered the public ear as a war reporter in London, made the big leap to television to become an iconic newsman on CBS (and later the director of the United States Information Agency).Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), pp. 179, 210. Ted Turner's creation of the Cable News Network (CNN) in 1980 inaugurated a new era of 24-hour satellite news broadcasting. In 1991, the BBC introduced a competitor, BBC World Service Television. Rupert Murdoch's Australian News Corporation entered the picture with Fox News Channel in the US, Sky News in Britain, and STAR TV in Asia. Combining this new apparatus with the use of embedded reporters, the United States waged the 1991‚Äì1992 Gulf War with the assistance of nonstop media coverage.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), p. 34. CNN's specialty is the crisis, to which the network is prepared to shift its total attention if so chosen.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 45‚Äì48. \\"When a major crisis breaks out overseas, ABC, CBS, and NBC will issue news bulletins and then go back to scheduled programming and perhaps do a late-evening wrap-up, but CNN stays on the air for long stretches of time continually updating the story. The networks' version of the story will be seen in the United States; CNN's version will be seen all over the world.\\" CNN news was transmitted via INTELSAT communications satellites.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 54‚Äì55. CNN, said an executive, would bring a \\"town crier to the global village\\". In 1996, the Qatar-owned broadcaster Al Jazeera emerged as a powerful alternative to the Western media, capitalizing in part on anger in the Arab & Muslim world regarding biased coverage of the Gulf War. Al Jazeera hired many news workers conveniently laid off by BBC Arabic Television, which closed in April 1996. It used Arabsat to broadcast.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 108‚Äì114. =Internet= The early internet, known as ARPANET, was controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and used mostly by academics. It became available to a wider public with the release of the Netscape browser in 1994.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), p. 118. At first, news websites were mostly archives of print publications.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 173. An early online newspaper was the Electronic Telegraph, published by The Daily Telegraph.Shane Richmond, \\"Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news\\"; The Telegraph, 11 November 2009. A 1994 earthquake in California was one of the first big stories to be reported online in real time.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 175‚Äì176. The new availability of web browsing made news sites accessible to more people. On the day of the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995, people flocked to newsgroups and chatrooms to discuss the situation and share information. The Oklahoma City Daily posted news to its site within hours. Two of the only news sites capable of hosting images, the San Jose Mercury News and Time magazine, posted photographs of the scene. Quantitatively, the internet has massively expanded the sheer volume of news items available to one person. The speed of news flow to individuals has also reached a new plateau.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 1‚Äì2. This insurmountable flow of news can daunt people and cause information overload. Zbigniew Brzezinski called this period the \\"technetronic era\\", in which \\"global reality increasingly absorbs the individual, involves him, and even occasionally overwhelms him.\\"Hachten, World News Prism (1996), p. 8. In cases of government crackdowns or revolutions, the Internet has often become a major communication channel for news propagation; while it's a (relatively) simple act to shut down a newspaper, radio or television station, mobile devices such as smartphones and netbooks are much harder to detect and confiscate. The propagation of internet-capable mobile devices has also given rise to the citizen journalist, who provide an additional perspective on unfolding events. News media today News can travel through different communication media. In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a reporter, where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or edited and manually set in type along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term \\"breaking news\\" has become trite as commercial broadcasting United States cable news services that are available 24 hours a day use live communications satellite technology to bring current events into consumers' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via radio, television, mobile phone, and the internet. Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.Silverblatt & Zlobin, International Communications (2004), pp. 42‚Äì43. \\"In contrast, the Masai, a nomadic community of cattle raisers in Kenya, Africa, spend their lives on the move; consequently, their contact with the media is sporadic. As a result, members of the Masai community did not learn about the September 11 attack in New York until the following June.\\" =Newspaper= A newspaper is one of the most common ways to receive the latest news. Most large cities in the United States historically had morning and afternoon newspapers. With the addition of new communications media, afternoon newspapers have shut down and morning newspapers have lost circulation. Weekly newspapers have somewhat increased.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), pp. 158‚Äì159. In more and more cities, newspapers have established local market monopolies‚Äîi.e., a single newspaper is the only one in town. This process has accelerated since the 1980s, commensurate with a general trend of consolidation in media ownership.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), pp. 163‚Äì164. In China, too, newspapers have gained exclusive status, city-by-city, and pooled into large associations such as Chengdu Business News. These associations function like news agencies, challenging the hegemony of Xinhua as a news provider. The world's top three most circulated newspapers all publish from Japan. About one-third of newspaper revenue comes from sales; the majority comes from advertising.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 100. Newspapers have struggled to maintain revenue given declining circulation and the free flow of information over the internet; some have implemented paywalls for their websites. In the U.S., many newspapers have shifted their operations online, publishing around the clock rather than daily in order to keep pace with the internet society. Prognosticators have suggested that print newspapers will vanish from the U.S. in 5‚Äì20 years.Shelley Thompson, \\"The Future of Newspapers in a Digital Age\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). Many newspapers have started to track social media engagement for trending news stories to cover. Spain's P√∫blico has reshaped their social media strategy and grew their audience by 40 %. =Television= Internationally distributed news channels include BBC News, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, and Sky News. Televisions are densely concentrated in the United States (98% of households), and the average American watches 4 hours of television programming each day. In other parts of the world, such as Kenya‚Äîespecially rural areas without much electricity‚Äîtelevisions are rare. The largest supplier of international video news is Reuters TV, with 409 subscribers in 83 countries, 38 bureaus, and a reported audience of 1.5 billion people each day. The other major video news service is Associated Press Television News. These two major agencies have agreements to exchange video news with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and Eurovision‚Äîitself a sizeable video news exchange.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 39‚Äì41. CNN International is a notable broadcaster in times of crisis. =Internet= Online journalism is news that is reported on the internet. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called blogging, which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging. Many blogs have rather small audiences; some blogs are read by millions each month.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 124‚Äì133. Social media sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, have become an important source of breaking news information and for disseminating links to news websites. Twitter declared in 2012: \\"It's like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you'll always find interesting‚Äîyou can discover news as it's happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time.\\"Einar Thorsen, \\"Live Blogging and Social Media Curation: Challenges and Opportunities for Journalism\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). Cell phone cameras have normalized citizen photojournalism.Caitlin Patrick & Stuart Allan, \\"'The Camera as Witness: The Changing Nature of Photojournalism\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). Michael Schudson, professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has said that \\"[e]verything we thought we once knew about journalism needs to be rethought in the Digital Age.\\" Today the work of journalism can be done from anywhere and done well. It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \\"news\\" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; \\"the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying\\". Schudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed: * The line between the reader and writer has blurred. * The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred. * The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of \\"pro-am\\" relationships has emerged. * The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed. * Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred. * The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition. These alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. \\"The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices\\", Schudson puts it. It is indeed complex, but it seems to be the future. Online news has also changed the geographic reach of individual news stories, diffusing readership from city-by-city markets to a potentially global audience. The growth of social media networks have also created new opportunities for automated and efficient news gathering for journalists and newsrooms. Many newsrooms (broadcasters, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV) have started to perform news gathering on social media platforms. Social media is creating changes in the consumer behaviour and news consumption. According to a study by Pew Research, a large portion of Americans read news on digital and on mobile devices. Because internet does not have the \\"column inches\\" limitation of print media, online news stories can, but don't always, come bundled with supplementary material. The medium of the world wide web also enables hyperlinking, which allows readers to navigate to other pages related to the one they're reading. Despite these changes, some studies have concluded that internet news coverage remains fairly homogenous and dominated by news agencies.Chris Paterson, \\"News Agency Dominance in International news on the Internet\\", Papers in International and Global Communication 01/06 (Center for International Communications Research), May 2006. And journalists working with online media do not identify significantly different criteria for newsworthiness than print journalists. News agencies Reuters office in Bonn, Germany, 1988 News agencies are services which compile news and disseminate it in bulk. Because they disseminate information to a wide variety of clients, who repackage the material as news for public consumption, news agencies tend to use less controversial language in their reports. Despite their importance, news agencies are not well known by the general public. They keep low profiles and their reporters usually do not get bylines. The oldest news agency still operating is the Agence France-Presse (AFP). It was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and advertising agent, Charles-Louis Havas as Agence Havas. By the end of the twentieth century, Reuters far outpaced the other news agencies in profits, and became one of the largest companies in Europe.Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 2; Oliver Boyd-Barrett, \\"'Global' News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 28. In 2011, Thomson Reuters employed more than 55,000 people in 100 countries, and posted an annual revenue of $12.9 billion. United Press International gained prominence as a world news agency in the middle of the twentieth century, but shrank in the 1980s and was sold off at low prices. It is owned by the Unification Church company News World Communications. News agencies, especially Reuters and the newly important Bloomberg News, convey both news stories for mass audiences and financial information of interest to businesses and investors.John Bartram Ewha, \\"News Agency Wars: the battle between Reuters and Bloomberg\\"; Journalism Studies 4.3 (2003). Bloomberg LP, a private company founded by Michael Bloomberg in 1981, made rapid advances with computerized stock market reporting updated in real time. Its news service continued to exploit this electronic advantage by combining computer-generated analytics with text reporting. Bloomberg linked with Agence France Presse in the 1990s. Following the marketization of the Chinese economy and the media boom of the 1990s, Xinhua has adopted some commercial practices including subscription fees, but it remains government- subsidized. It provides newswire, news photos, economic information, and audio and video news. Xinhua has a growing number of subscribers, totaling 16,969 in 2002, including 93% of Chinese newspapers. It operates 123 foreign bureaus and produces 300 news stories each day. Other agencies with considerable reach include Deutsche Presse-Agentur (Germany), Kyodo News (Japan), the Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (Italy), the Middle East News Agency (Egypt), Tanjug (Serbia), EFE (Spain), and Anadolu Agency (Turkey).Hachten, World News Prism (1996), p. 38. On the internet, news aggregators play a role similar to that of the news agency‚Äîand, because of the sources they select, tend to transmit news stories which originate from the main agencies. Of articles displayed by Yahoo! News in the U.S., 91.7% come from news agencies: 39.4% from AP, 30.9% AFP, and 21.3% Reuters. In India, 60.1% of Yahoo! News stories come from Reuters. Google News relies somewhat less on news agencies, and has shown high volatility, in the sense of focusing heavily on the most recent handful of salient world events. In 2010, Google News redesigned its front page with automatic geotargeting, which generated a selection of local news items for every viewer.Lisa M. George & Christiaan Hogendorn, \\"Local News Online: Aggregators, Geo-Targeting and the Market for Local News\\"; 1 November 2013. Global news system In the 20th century, global news coverage was dominated by a combination of the \\"Big Four\\" news agencies‚ÄîReuters, Associated Press, Agence France Press, and United Press International‚Äîrepresenting the Western bloc, and the Communist agencies: TASS from the Soviet Union, and Xinhua from China.Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 9. Studies of major world events, and analyses of all international news coverage in various newspapers, consistently found that a large majority of news items originated from the four biggest wire services. Television news agencies include Associated Press Television News, which bought and incorporated World Television News; and Reuters Television.Oliver Boyd- Barrett, \\"'Global' News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 19. Bloomberg News created in the 1990s, expanded rapidly to become a player in the realm of international news.Oliver Boyd-Barrett, \\"'Global' News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 21. \\"Bloomberg's influence is greater than the number of its terminals may suggest, as it feeds financial data and economic news through the AP network to AP members and clients in the United States, and to many national networks through national news agencies. Indeed, it boasts having the second largest 'wholesale' news distribution in the United States, after AP. It has print, radio and television distribution in many countries: Bloomberg television is distributed via Astra satellite service in Europe.\\" The Associated Press also maintains a radio network with thousands of subscribers worldwide; it is the sole provider of international news to many small stations. By some accounts, dating back to the 1940s, the increasing interconnectedness of the news system has accelerated the pace of world history itself.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), p. 7. \\"Since World War II, an intricate and worldwide network of international news media has evolved, providing an expanded capability for information flows. This relationship between the capacity and the need to communicate rapidly has resulted from the interaction of two long-term historical processes: the evolution toward a single global society and the movement of civilization beyond four great benchmarks of human communication‚Äîspeech, writing, printing, electronic communications (telephone and radio)‚Äîinto a fifth era of long- distance instant communication based on telecommunications (mainly satellites) and computer technology. Harold Lasswell believed that the mass media revolution has accelerated the tempo and direction of world history. What would have happened later has happened sooner, and changes in timing may have modified substantive developments.\\" =New World Information and Communication Order= The global news system is dominated by agencies from Europe and the United States, and reflects their interests and priorities in its coverage.Oliver Boyd-Barrett, \\"'Global' News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 22. Euro-American control of the global news system has led to criticism; that events around the world are constantly compared to events like the Holocaust and World War II, which are considered foundational in the West.Barbie Zeiler, \\"Cannibalizing Memory in the Global Flow of News\\"; in On Media Memory (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, & Zandberg; pp. 31‚Äì34. Since the 1960s, a significant amount of news reporting from the Third World has been characterized by some form \\"development journalism\\", a paradigm which focuses on long-term development projects, social change, and nation-building.Fosu, \\"The Press and Political Participation\\" (2014), pp. 67‚Äì73. When in 1987 the U.S. media reported on a riot in the Dominican Republic‚Äîthe first major news item regarding that country in years‚Äîthe resulting decline in tourism lasted for years and had a noticeable effect on the economy.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), pp. 124‚Äì125. The English language predominates in global news exchanges.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 100‚Äì102. Critics have accused the global news system of perpetuating cultural imperialism.John Tomlinson, \\"Cultural Globalization and Cultural Imperialism\\", in Mohammadi (ed.), International Communication and Globalization (1997).McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 105‚Äì108. Critics further charge that the Western media conglomerates maintain a bias towards the status quo economic order, especially a pro-corporate bias. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has promoted a New World Information and Communication Order, which envisions an international news exchange system involving national news agencies in every country. UNESCO encouraged the new states formed from colonial territories in the 1960s to establish news agencies, to generate domestic news stories, exchange news items with international partners, and disseminate both types of news internally.Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 8. \\"The UN, through UNESCO, consistently endeavored to encourage the spread and development of national news agencies, and of news-exchange arrangements between them, especially during the great wave of independence in Africa during the 1960s. Setting up a national news agency became one of the essential things, part of the 'script', of what it meant to be a 'nation'. Through a national news agency, a state could lay down information links domestically and internationally which would facilitate the generation and exchange of news.\\" Along these lines, the 1980 MacBride report, \\"Many Voices, One World\\", called for an interdependent global news system with more participation from different governments. To this end, also, UNESCO formed the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool.Chakravartty and Sarikakis, Media Policy and Globalization (2006), p. 31. The Inter Press Service, founded in 1964, has served as an intermediary for Third World press agencies.C. Anthony Giffard, \\"Alternative News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), p. 191. Inter Press Service's editorial policy favors coverage of events, institutions, and issues which relate to inequality, economic development, economic integration, natural resources, population, health, education, and sustainable development.C. Anthony Giffard, \\"Alternative News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 192‚Äì194. It gives less coverage than other agencies to crime, disasters, and violence. Geographically, 70% of its news reporting concerns Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.C. Anthony Giffard, \\"Alternative News Agencies\\", in Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 195‚Äì196. IPS has the most subscribers in Latin America and southern Africa. IPS receives grants from organizations such as the United Nations Development Program and other United Nations agencies and ptrivate foundations to report news on chosen topics, including the environment, sustainable development, and women's issues.C. Anthony Giffard, \\"Alternative News Agencies\\", in Boyd- Barrett & Rantanen, The Globalization of News (1998), pp. 196‚Äì197. Beginning in the 1960s, the United States Agency for International Development, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and UNESCO developed the use of satellite television for international broadcasting. In India, 1975‚Äì1976, these agencies implemented an experimental satellite television system, called the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment, with assistance from the Indian Space Research Organisation, and All India Radio.Chakravartty and Sarikakis, Media Policy and Globalization (2006), p. 29. =Further transformation in global news flow= By the 1980s, much of the Third World had succumbed to a debt crisis resulting from unrepayably large loans accumulated since the 1960s. At this point, the World Bank took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of free trade institutions like the World Trade Organization, which also protected the free flow of information across borders.Chakravartty and Sarikakis, Media Policy and Globalization (2006), pp. 33‚Äì38. The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.Chakravartty and Sarikakis, Media Policy and Globalization (2006), pp. 58‚Äì72, 133‚Äì136. \\"In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3). Private telecommunications operators were drawn to emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India, among others, because technological innovation coupled with policy reforms promised access to lucrative high-density business and urban middle-class consumers. [‚Ä¶] The few comparative studies of telecommunications reform in the South show that the political environment‚Äîwhether the state is responsive to democratic public interest‚Äî\\\\and its relative power vis-√†-vis foreign capital and G8 nations have shaped the terms of reform.\\"Ali Mohammadi, \\"Communication and the Globalizing Process in the Developing World\\", in Mohammadi (ed.), International Communication and Globalization (1997). In countries with less telecommunications infrastructure, people, especially youth, tend today to get their news predominantly from mobile phones and, less so, from the internet. Older folks listen more to the radio. The government of China is a major investor in Third World telecommunications, especially in Africa.Geniets, Global News Challenge (2013), pp. 22‚Äì27. Some issues relating to global information flow were revisited in light of the internet at the 2003/2005 World Summit on the Information Society, a conference which emphasized the role of civil society and the private sector in information society governance.Chakravartty and Sarikakis, Media Policy and Globalization (2006), pp. 136‚Äì143. News values News values are the professional norms of journalism. Commonly, news content should contain all the \\"Five Ws\\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints. Journalists are often expected to aim for objectivity; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide opinion or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \\"let the reader decide\\" the truth of the matter. Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the United Kingdom, the government agency of Ofcom (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \\"impartiality\\" on news broadcasters.Sue Wallace, \\"Impartiality in the News\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views. Although newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the American Society of Newspaper Editors codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 20‚Äì23. These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.Zhong, \\"Searching for Meaning\\" (2006), pp. 15, 35. Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a socialist realism model focusing on developments in everyday life.Wolfe, Governing Soviet Journalism (2005), p. 29. Even in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to commercial or political pressure. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use news management techniques to try to make a favourable impression. Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting. Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.Sara Shipley Hiles & Amanda Hinnart, \\"Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming\\"; Science Communication 36.4, 2014. Some commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values itself represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.John Soloski, \\"News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News\\", from Media, Culture & Society 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 143‚Äì145. This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: \\"Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words.\\"Cranfield, Press and Society (1978), p. 8. Feminist critiques argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 123. In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective- seeming statements.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 129. News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 134‚Äì135. The critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: \\"The days of middle-of- the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead. [‚Ä¶] we need to consider adopting what I like to think of as a much wider 'radical impartiality'‚Äîthe need to hear the widest range of views‚Äîall sides of the story.\\" Social organization of news productionNews organizations= Viewed from a sociological perspective, news for mass consumption is produced in hierarchical organizations. Reporters, working near the bottom of the structure, are given significant autonomy in researching and preparing reports, subject to assignments and occasional intervention from higher decision-makers.James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, & Daniel B. Wackman, in Handbook of Communications Science (1987), ed. C.H. Berger & S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), p. 37. Owners at the top of the news hierarchy influence the content of news indirectly but substantially. The professional norms of journalism discourage overt censorship; however, news organizations have covert but firm norms about how to cover certain topics. These policies are conveyed to journalists through socialization on the job; without any written policy, they simply learn how things are done.Warren Breed, \\"Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis\\" (pdf), from Social Forces 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 108‚Äì110.John Soloski, \\"News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News\\", from Media, Culture & Society 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 139‚Äì140, 146‚Äì152. \\"One method management could use to control its journalists would be to establish rules and regulations. This bureaucratic form would not be very efficient [‚Ä¶] A more efficient method for controlling behavior in nonbureaucratic organizations, such as news organizations, is through professionalism. Professionalism \\"makes the use of discretion predictable. It relieves bureaucratic organizations of responsibility for devising their own mechanisms of control in the discretionary areas of work (Larson, 1977: 168) (emphasis in original).\\" Journalists comply with these rules for various reasons, including job security.Warren Breed, \\"Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis\\" (pdf), from Social Forces 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 111‚Äì114. Journalists are also systematically influenced by their education, including journalism school.John Soloski, \\"News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News\\", from Media, Culture & Society 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 141‚Äì142. News production is routinized in several ways. News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. \\"Rituals of objectivity\\", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a beat: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, & Daniel B. Wackman, in Handbook of Communications Science (1987), ed. C.H. Berger & S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), p. 38. A common scholarly frame for understanding news production is to examine the role of information gatekeepers: to ask why and how certain narratives make their way from news producers to news consumers.Pamela J. Shoemaker, \\"A New Gatekeeping Model\\", from Gatekeeping (1991); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), p. 57. \\"Simply put, gatekeeping is the process by which the billions of messages that are available in the world get cut down and transformed into hundreds of messages that reach a given person on a given day.\\" Obvious gatekeepers include journalists, news agency staff, and wire editors of newspapers.David Manning White, \\"The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News\\", from Journalism Quarterly 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), p. 63. Ideology, personal preferences, source of news, and length of a story are among the many considerations which influence gatekeepers.David Manning White, \\"The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News\\", from Journalism Quarterly 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 66‚Äì71. Although social media have changed the structure of news dissemination, gatekeeper effects may continue due to the role of a few central nodes in the social network.Thomas John Erneste, \\"Toward a Networked Gatekeeping Theory: Journalism, News Diffusion, and Democracy in a Networked Model\\"; Dissertation accepted at University of Minnesota, January 2014. New factors have emerged in internet-era newsrooms. One issue is \\"click-thinking\\", the editorial selection of news stories‚Äîand of journalists‚Äîwho can generate the most website hits and thus advertising revenue. Unlike a newspaper, a news website has detailed data collection about which stories are popular and who is reading them.An Nguyen, \\"Online News Audiences: The challenges of web metrics\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). The drive for speedy online postings, some journalists have acknowledged, has altered norms of fact-checking so that verification takes place after publication.Joanna Redden, \\"The Mediation of Poverty: The News, New Media and Politics\\"; Dissertation accepted at Goldsmiths, University of London, 2011. Journalists' sometimes unattributed echoing of other news sources can also increase the homogeneity of news feeds. The digital age can accelerate the problem of circular reporting: propagation of the same error through increasingly reliable sources. In 2009, a number of journalists were embarrassed after all reproducing a fictional quotation, originating from Wikipedia.John Timmer, \\"Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research: A sociology student placed a fake quote on Wikipedia, only to see it show up ‚Ä¶\\"; Ars Technica, 7 May 2009. News organizations have historically been male-dominated, though women have acted as journalists since at least the 1880s. The number of female journalists has increased over time, but organizational hierarchies remain controlled mostly by men.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 119‚Äì121. Studies of British news organizations estimate that more than 80% of decision-makers are men.Allan, News Culture (2004), p. 124. Similar studies have found 'old boys' networks' in control of news organizations in the United States and the Netherlands.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 127‚Äì129. Further, newsrooms tend to divide journalists by gender, assigning men to \\"hard\\" topics like military, crime, and economics, and women to \\"soft\\", \\"humanised\\" topics.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 129‚Äì130. =Relationship with institutions= For various reasons, news media usually have a close relationship with the state, and often church as well, even when they cast themselves in critical roles.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), pp. 90‚Äì91. This relationship seems to emerge because the press can develop symbiotic relationships with other powerful social institutions. In the United States, the Associated Press wire service developed a \\"bilateral monopoly\\" with the Western Union telegraph company.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), pp. 175‚Äì177.Annteresa Lubrano, The Telegraph: How Technology Innovation Caused Social Change; New York: Garland, 1997; pp. 72‚Äì74. The news agencies which rose to power in the mid-1800s all had support from their respective governments, and in turn served their political interests to some degree. News for consumption has operated under statist assumptions, even when it takes a stance adversarial to some aspect of a government.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 5. \\"Free of an extended view of the history of press- government relations, it is easy to maintain a romantic image of the journalist, when unchained by repressive regulation, as a staunch adversary of government; it is easy to overlook the basic pro-authoritarian role that has been played by those who spread news: their success in occupying the minds of the governed with a belief in the importance, if not the inevitabiltiy, of a system of government.\\" In practice, a large proportion of routine news production involves interactions between reporters and government officials.Michael Schudson, \\"The Sociology of News Production\\", from Media, Culture & Society (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), p. 14. \\"One study after another comes up with essentially the same observation, and it matters not whether the study is at the national, state, or local level‚Äîthe story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials.\\" Relatedly, journalists tend to adopt a hierarchical view of society, according to which a few people at the top of organizational pyramids are best situated to comment on the reality which serves as the basisi of news.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 62‚Äì63. \\"To clarify, H.S. Becker (1967) employs the notion of a 'hierarchy of credibility' to specify how, in a system of ranked groups, participants will take it as given that the members of the highest group are best placed to define 'the way things really are' due to their 'knowledge of truth'. Implicit in this assumption is the view that 'those at the top' will have access to a more complete picture of the bureaucratic organization's workings than members of lower groups whose definition of reality, because of this subordinate status, can only be partial and distorted.\\" Broadly speaking, therefore, news tends to normalize and reflect the interests of the power structure dominant in its social context.James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, & Daniel B. Wackman, in Handbook of Communications Science (1987), ed. C.H. Berger & S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, Social Meanings of News (1997), pp. 34‚Äì37. \\"In sum, a considerable body of research supports the argument that inter-organizational- and institutional-level forces, realized in a journalistic culture of 'objectivity,' fostered by, and in the service of, progressive liberal capitalism, constrain what journalists report. News thus exhibits an identifiable and widely shared form and a content broadly consonant with the social structures and values of its political-economic context.\\" Today, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rival and may surpass governments in their influence on the content of news. =State control= Governments use international news transmissions to promote the national interest and conduct political warfare, alternatively known as public diplomacy and, in the modern era, international broadcasting. International radio broadcasting came into wide-ranging use by world powers seeking cultural integration of their empires.Geniets, Global News Challenge (2013), pp. 4‚Äì6, 15. The British government used BBC radio as a diplomatic tool, setting up Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese services in 1937.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), p. 39. American propaganda broadcasters include Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, set up during the Cold War and still operating today.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 177‚Äì182. The United States remains the world's top broadcaster, although by some accounts it was surpassed for a time circa 1980 by the Soviet Union. Other major international broadcasters include the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, North Korea, India, Cuba, and Australia.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 129‚Äì133, 132, 206‚Äì207. Around the world (and especially, formerly, in the Soviet bloc), international news sources such as the BBC World Service are often welcomed as alternatives to domestic state-run media.Geniets, Global News Challenge (2013), p. 47.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 66‚Äì67. Governments have also funneled programming through private news organizations, as when the British government arranged to insert news into the Reuters feed during and after World War Two.Wood, History of International Broadcasting (1992), pp. 21, 55. \\"The Reuters news service would be broadcast from Rugby with an insertion written by the Foreign Office. The secret agreement provided that both Leafield and Rugby Radio would carry 720 000 words per year, at a cost of three and a half pence per word. During and after the Second World War, these two radio stations transmitted news whose content had been falsified with the intention of deceiving the enemy.\\" Past revelations have suggested that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies create news stories which they disseminate secretly into the foreign and domestic media. Investigation into the Central Intelligence Agency pursued in the 1970s found that it owned hundreds of news organizations (wire services, newspapers, magazines) outright.Parenti, Inventing Reality (1993), pp. 66‚Äì68.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 116‚Äì118. Soviet news warfare also involved the creation of front groups, like the International Organization of Journalists. The Russian KGB heavily pursued a strategy of disinformation, planting false stories which made their way to news outlets worldwide.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 113‚Äì116. Broadcasts into Iraq before the Second Gulf War mimicked the style of local programming.Silverblatt & Zlobin, International Communications (2004), p. 49; also see The US also launched Middle East Broadcasting Networks, featuring the satellite TV station Alhurra and radio station Radio Sawa to beam 24-hour programming to Iraq and environs.Silverblatt & Zlobin, International Communications (2004), p. 49; also see: Josh Getlin and Johanna Neuman, \\"Vying for Eyes, Ears of Iraq\\"; Los Angeles Times, 10 May 2003. Today, Al Jazeera, a TV and internet news network owned by the government of Qatar, has become one of the foremost news sources in the world, appreciated by millions as an alternative to the Western media.Geniets, Global News Challenge (2013), p. 8 State-owned China Central Television operates 18 channels and reaches more than a billion viewers worldwide.Geniets, Global News Challenge (2013), p. 66. Iran's Press TV and Russia's Russia Today, branded as RT, also have multiplatform presences and large audiences. =Public relations= As distinct from advertising, which deals with marketing distinct from news, public relations involves the techniques of influencing news in order to give a certain impression to the public. A standard public relations tactic, the \\"third-party technique\\", is the creation of seemingly independent organizations, which can deliver objective-sounding statements to news organizations without revealing their corporate connections.Rampton & Stauber, Trust Us, We're Experts (2001), pp. 13‚Äì20. Public relations agencies can create complete content packages, such as Video News Releases, which are rebroadcast as news without commentary or detail about their origin.Rampton & Stauber, Trust Us, We're Experts (2001), pp. 22‚Äì24. Video news releases seem like normal news programming, but use subtle product placement and other techniques to influence viewers.Straubhaar and LaRose, Communications Media in the Information Society (1997), pp. 395‚Äì396. Public relations releases offer valuable newsworthy information to increasingly overworked journalists on deadline.Jamie Matthews, \\"Journalists and their sources: The twin challenges of diversity and verification\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). (This pre-organized news content has been called an information subsidy.) The journalist relies on appearances of autonomy and even opposition to established interests‚Äîbut the public relations agent seek to conceal their client's influence on the news,. Thus, public relations works its magic in secret. Public relations can dovetail with state objectives, as in the case of the 1990 news story about Iraqi soldiers taking \\"babies out of incubators\\" in Kuwaiti hospitals.Parenti, Inventing Reality (1993), p. 169. During the Nigerian Civil War, both the federal government and the secessionist Republic of Biafra hired public relations firms, which competed to influence public opinion in the West, and between them established some of the key narratives employed in news reports about the war.Karen Rothmyer, \\"What really happened in Biafra? Why did themes such as mass starvation and genocide alternately surface and fade? A study of media susceptibility to public relations manipulation.\\" Columbia Journalism Review 9.3, Fall 1970. Overall, the position of the public relations industry has grown stronger, while the position of news producers has grown weaker. Public relations agents mediate the production of news about all sectors of society.Kevin Moloney, Daniel Jackson, & David McQueen, \\"News journalism and public relations: a dangerous relationship\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). News consumption Over the centuries, commentators on newspapers and society have repeatedly observed widespread human interest in news.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), pp. 1‚Äì2, 31. Elite members of a society's political and economic institutions might rely on news as one limited source of information, for the masses, news represents a relatively exclusive window onto the operations by which a society is managed.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), pp. 93‚Äì94. \\"Because political events and issues in modern societies typically take place in specialized locations, most citizens experience politics vicariously. [‚Ä¶] For elites, information from the media becomes just one of many sources of data. Because of their political involvement and interest and their vast base of prior knowledge, elites treat media coverage as foreground, or sources of new and/or specific information. [‚Ä¶] Nonelites, on the other hand, are not so interested in politics, and they have relatively little prior knowledge about political issues. For nonelites, media coverage is not only a source of new data, but their only source of information.\\" Regular people in societies with news media often spend a lot of time reading or watching news reports.Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 5. Newspapers became significant aspects of national and literary culture‚Äîas exemplified by James Joyce's Ulysses, which derives from the newspapers of 16 June (and thereabouts), 1904, and represents the newspaper office itself as a vital part of life in Dublin.R. Brandon Kershner, The Culture of Joyce's Ulysses; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010; see Chapter Five, \\"Newspapers and Periodicals: Endless Dialogue\\". Also see: James Broderick, \\"'Give Us This Day Our Daily Press': Journalism in the Life and Art of James Joyce\\", Dissertation accepted at City University of New York, 1999. A 1945 study by sociologist Bernard Berelson found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike, New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news, describing themselves as \\"lost\\", \\"nervous\\", \\"isolated\\", and \\"suffering\\" due to the withdrawal.Bernard Berelson, \\"What 'missing the newspaper' means\\", in Communications Research 1948‚Äì1949, ed. Lazarsfeld & Stanton; New York: Harper & Brothers, 1949; quoted in Stephens, History of News (1988), p. 17. Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life, with specific programming anticipated at different times of day.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 47‚Äì48. Children tend to find the news boring, too serious, or emotionally disturbing. They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 113‚Äì115. People exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of tabloid readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories‚Äîand get their \\"real news\\" from television.Allan, News Culture (2004), pp. 110‚Äì112. =Social and cultural cohesion= An important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.Starr, Creation of the Media (2004), p. 24. \\"Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it.\\" In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), p. 17. \\"The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group.\\" News thus plays a role in nation-building, the construction of a national identity.Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, \\"Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory\\"; in On Media Memory (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, & Zandberg; pp. 156‚Äì160. \\"In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent‚ÄîIsrael's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968‚Äîgave it much weight in setting the collective agenda.\\" Images connected with news can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as Alfred Eisenstaedt's photograph V-J Day in Times Square, Nick Ut's photograph of Phan Thi Kim Phuc and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; Kevin Carter's photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture; etc. With the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 6‚Äì7. \\"But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to these events, communally experienced at this moment, through global communications networks. [‚Ä¶] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhilaration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is really happening, right now, to real people.\\" As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.Silverblatt & Zlobin, International Communications (2004), pp. 28‚Äì31. \\"A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence‚Äîregardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 per cent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, Family Circle and McCall's' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels.\\" =Public sphere= This collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or public sphere.Park, \\"News as a Form of Knowledge\\" (1940), p. 677. In this view, the news media constitute a fourth estate which serves to check and balance the operations of government. This idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.Geniets, Global News Challenge (2013), pp. 17‚Äì18. Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 140‚Äì144. According to one interpretation of the CNN effect, instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.McNair, Cultural Chaos (2006), pp. 179‚Äì185. In 1989, local and global communications media- enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in Tiananmen Square. The news about Tiananmen Square travelled over a fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 70‚Äì72. =News events= As the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert a profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the collective memory of a society.Salmon, The Newspaper and the Historian (1923), pp. 211‚Äì213.Park, \\"News as a Form of Knowledge\\" (1940), pp. 685‚Äì686. \\"In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events‚Äîat least as listener if not as spectator‚Äîas they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world.\\" One type of news event, the media event, is a scripted pageant organized for a mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.Dayan & Katz, Media Events (1992), pp. 1‚Äì14. These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.Dayan & Katz, Media Events (1992), pp. 25‚Äì53. Usually, they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.Dayan & Katz, Media Events (1992), p. 196. Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well. The perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), 57‚Äì61. Crises can also increase the effect of the news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to \\"rally\\" behind its current leadership.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), 73‚Äì76. The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of terrorism and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the capture of American hostages in Iran dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a \\"crisis\\", and influenced a presidential election.Hachten, World News Prism (1996), pp. 73‚Äì77. South Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.Danie Du Plessis, \\"What's News in South Africa?\\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, News Around the World (2006), p. 303. \\"Virtually all references to the political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response.\\" In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy), the 1969 moon landing, the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the intervention of the Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential election and the 2001 September 11 attacks.Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, \\"What's News in the United States?\\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, News Around the World (2006), p. 329. In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of King Hussein, Princess Diana, and Yitzhak Rabin. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families‚Äîsuch as the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, and the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty.Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, \\"What's News in Jordan?\\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, News Around the World (2006), p. 252. News coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, \\"Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory\\"; in On Media Memory (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, & Zandberg; pp. 233‚Äì234. Also see: Neta Kliger- Vilenchik, \\"Setting the collective memory agenda: Examining mainstream media influence on individuals' perceptions of the past\\"; Memory Studies 7.4, October 2014. =News making= News making is the act of making the news or doing something that is considered to be newsworthy. When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model. The Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers. The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model. It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion. The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society. Models of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely. News Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story. Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society. =Psychological effects= Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.Perse, Media Effects And Society 2001; 55. Television coverage of the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, which repeated the same footage over and over, led to symptoms of trauma experienced across the United States.Mark A. Schuster, et al., \\"A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks\\", New England Journal of Medicine, 345.20, 15 November 2001. Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster. Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.Gavin Rees, \\"The Trauma Factor\\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), Journalism (2013). Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations. =Influence= The content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), 1‚Äì10. In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), 12. \\"Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'. News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.Zhong, \\"Searching for Meaning\\" (2006), pp. 17‚Äì18. According to agenda-setting theory, the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news. The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), 98‚Äì99. The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.Perse, Media Effects And Society (2001), 100. \\"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\\" The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels. Influence of sponsorship It has been acknowledged that sponsorship has historically influenced various news stories. This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film Anchorman 2. One example in recent time is the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets. Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \\"stole the news business\\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \\"ghostwriters.\\" In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.

The station is situated in the eastern part of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, at the boundary with Capelle aan den IJssel municipality. At Capelsebrug station, lines A and B turn north towards Schenkel station, while line C continues east towards Slotlaan station.. The westbound trains stop at either side of an island platform between two running tracks, while all eastbound trains share one platform. Near the station there's a Cafetaria, and a supermarket. This station was opened in 1982, and was the eastern terminus of the line (then called the Caland line), until it was extended towards Binnenhof station one year later.

After some success with a girl group punk trio TKO, which supported Steps and Atomic Kitten, her father David K. White brought in Jules De Martino to write songs for TKO. Katie White and De Martino subsequently formed the Ting Tings in 2007. Early life White was raised on a farm in Lowton with her father David K. White, mother Lynne C. (Sharples) and sister Helena. White went to Lowton High School in Lowton, which has a large performing arts department. When White was 12 years old, her grandfather Ken White won ¬£6.6million on the National Lottery and gave each of his three sons, David, Stephen and Richard, ¬£1million. As well as buying ponies for White and her sister Helena, White's father used his share of the money to start a music management company. CareerTKO= White started her music career aged 14 in 1997 in a girl group punk trio TKO ‚Äì short for Technical Knock Out ‚Äì with two friends from Lowton school, Joanne Leeson and Emma Lally. TKO was managed by White's father's music management company. They had some success, and supported Steps and Atomic Kitten. TKO also appeared on ITV's CD:UK. In March 2001 David White brought in songwriter Jules De Martino who wrote four songs for TKO. TKO were not able to secure a record deal but released a single on the internet. =Dear Eskiimo= White got back in touch with Jules De Martino when she was at Leeds University and he moved to Manchester. They formed a band called Dear Eskiimo (often misreported as Dead Eskimo) with a DJ friend Simon Templeman. The name was intended to be as nomadic, tribal and independent as possible. There were already several bands called \\"Eskimo\\" but Jules, who wrote the lyrics, wanted his songs to tell good stories as if in a letter, hence \\"Dear Eskiimo\\" with the odd spelling of 'Eskimo\\" with two 'I\\"s to make it stand out. Their first performance was as a support between two rock bands but it went well and they were signed up by Mercury Records at the end of 2004.

Bear-baiting is a blood sport involving the worrying or tormenting (baiting) of bears with dogs. It may also involve pitting a bear against another animal. HistoryEurope=Great Britain Bear-baiting was popular from the 12th until the 19th century. From the sixteenth century, many bears were maintained for baiting. In its best-known form, arenas for this purpose were called bear-gardens, consisting of a circular high fenced area, the \\"pit\\", and raised seating for spectators. A post would be set in the ground towards the edge of the pit and the bear chained to it, either by the leg or neck. Several well-trained fighting or baiting dogs, usually Old English Bulldogs, would then be set on it, being replaced as they got tired or were wounded or killed. In some cases the bear was let loose, allowing it to chase after animals or people. For a long time, the main bear-garden in London was the Paris Garden, that section of the Bankside lying to the west of The Clink, at Southwark. Henry VIII was a fan and had a bear pit constructed at his Palace of Whitehall. Elizabeth I was also fond of the entertainment; it featured regularly in her tours. When an attempt was made to ban bear-baiting on Sundays, she overruled Parliament. Robert Laneham's letter describes the spectacle presented by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester at Kenilworth Castle in 1575: A painting of about 1650 by Abraham Hondius of a bear-baiting Variations involved other animals being baited, especially bulls. Bull-baiting was a contest which was similar to bear baiting in which the bull was chained to a stake by one hind leg or by the neck and worried by dogs. The whipping of a blinded bear was another variation of bear-baiting. Also, on one curious occasion, a pony with an ape tied to its back was baited; a spectator described that \\"... with the screaming of the ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very laughable\\". Attempts to end the entertainment were first made in the Kingdom of England by the Puritans, with little effect. The deaths of several spectators, when a stand collapsed at the Paris Gardens on 12 January 1583, was viewed by early Puritans as a sign of God's anger, though not primarily because of the cruelty but because the bear-baiting was taking place on a Sunday. One bear named Sackerson was written into in a Shakespearean comedy The Merry Wives of Windsor. Baiting was banned by the Puritans during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the resultant Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which ended in 1660. By the late 17th century \\"the conscience of cultivated people seems to have been touched\\". By the 18th century bear- baiting had largely died out in Britain, with the cost of importing bears for blood sports prohibitively high. It was not until 1835 that baiting was prohibited by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, introduced as a bill by the member of parliament for South Durham, Joseph Pease, who was a Quaker and a member of the committee of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. At that time, the \\"bull stone\\" of Leslie, Fife was first recorded in the New Statistical Account of Scotland as an item which had already fallen out of use. It is a large stone to which bulls and occasionally bears were tied before being baited. The Act, which also banned (but failed to eradicate) dog fighting and cockfighting, was soon extended across the Empire. Sweden In the 18th century, King Frederick I of Sweden was said to have been presented with a \\"very large lion\\" from the Barbary people, which then killed a bear after the king pitted them together in a fight. =Asia=India In India, towards the end of the 19th century, Gaekwad Sayajirao III of Baroda arranged a fight between a Barbary lion and Bengal tiger, to determine whether the lion or tiger should be called the \\"King of the Cat Family.\\" The victor then had to face a Sierran Grizzly bear weighing over , after the Gaekwad was told that the cat was not the \\"King of Carnivorae.\\" Pakistan Bear baiting has been occurring in the Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan, since 2004.See Fakhar -i- Abbas (2007) Baiting and Sanctuary Maintenance of Bears in Pakistan: a status Report in BIERZ 2007: Bear Information Exchange for Rehabilitators, Zoos & Sanctuaries.

In a case of the bear winning, the bear would use its teeth to catch a bull between its horns, on its nose, which would allow the bear to move its head enough to twist its neck, or bite a part of the bull's body, like the tongue, or use its paws to catch or harm the bull, like in squeezing its neck, or catching its tongue: * According to Cahuilla people, who claimed to be able to communicate with bears, one of their men attended a fight at a pueblo in Los Angeles. During the first part of the fight, the bull kept knocking down the bear, before the man whispered to the bear that it had to defend itself, or else it would be killed. Upon that, the bear fought back, and broke the bull's neck. Mexico Storer and Trevis (1955) mentioned the account of Albert Evans, who said that he saw an uncommon incident at a Plaza de Toros in Veracruz, Mexico, in January 1870. A bear called 'Samson' dug a hole so large that it could hold an elephant, before using its large paws to carry and throw an opposing bull headfirst into the hole, paw-swipe its side till its breath appeared to have been half-knocked out of its body, and then use one paw to hold the bull, and the other to bury it alive. Other uses The term \\"bear baiting\\" may be also used for the hunting practice of luring a bear with bait to an arranged killing spot. The hunter places an amount of food, such as raw meat or sweets, every day at a given spot until the hunter notices the food is being taken each day, accompanied by bear tracks. He then chooses a day to await the bear, killing it when it arrives to feed. In 2007, such bear baiting was legal in many states in the United States, with the Humane Society reporting that: > Bear baiting is banned in 18 of the 28 states that allow bear hunting. It > persists... in Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, > Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. For instance, in Wisconsin in 2002, hunters > killed 2,415 bears; those using bait accounted for 1,720 of the kills. In > Maine, hunters killed 3,903 bears in 2001, and baiters took 3,173 of the > animals. In literature Author Washington Irving described vaqueros setting a bear against a bull, in his 1837 book The Adventures of Captain Bonneville. In this \\"favorite, though barbarous sport\\" in Monterey, a bear and a bull would be caught from the wild and put together in an arena in a fight to the death. Dog-bating was featured in Episode 7 of Black Butler.

This second act was developed with the aim of making the transition from circus to music hall stages, which were more lucrative. While not initially successful, Antonet and Grock did manage to secure a London engagement in 1911. Refining their performances according to audience response, Grock came to dominate the act, and they eventually split up. = Career and later life= Signature of Grock Grock with wife, Berlin 1930 Villa Grock in 2007 By 1913, Grock's fame had spread, his act having developed into the mixture of pantomime and musical blunders for which he is now remembered. With the outbreak of World War I, he made Britain his base, remaining there until 1924, when he returned to continental Europe. He performed throughout Europe and in the United States, commanding ever higher fees, and his continuing success enabled him to establish his own circus in 1951, with which he toured until his final performance in Hamburg on October 30, 1954.

According to data presented by minister Amara in Madrid in 2015, the country‚Äôs onshore potential is estimated at 25 GW, of which 6 GW could be installed by 2030. The average wind speed is 5.3 metres per second (m/s) at more than 90% of the country‚Äôs territory, according to the wind atlas, developed by the Moroccan Renewable Energy Development Center (CDER). The Tanger and Tetouan region (North of Morocco) measured particularly high at 8 to 11 m/s, and 7 to 8.5 m/s were recorded for Dakhla, Tarfaya, Taza and Essaouira. The installed capacity 2014 was 750 MW. According to data from Morocco's energy ministry, a total of 220 MW of private wind energy projects have been built until the end of 2016. Another 120 MW are to go online soon at the Khalladi wind farm in the vicinity of Tangiers, northern Morocco. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE) have announced they will provide a financing package of EUR 126 million (USD 133.3m) for the development of the project. The objective is to generate 2,000 MW by 2020.Ouverture √† Casablanca des offres techniques de l'ONEE  Tarfaya wind farm  For example, the 300-MW Tarfaya wind farm, developed by Tarec (Trarfaya Energy Company), a 50/50 joint venture of Nareva Holding and International Power Ltd of Engie Group, enjoys a load factor of 45%, one of the best in the world for onshore wind.  Morocco Renewable Energy projects now-2030  In 2010, the kingdom launched the development of 1,000 MW of wind power in two phases. The first phase‚Äîa 150 MW wind farm in Taza was awarded to a consortium of French EDF Energies Nouvelle and Japanese Mitsui in 2012. It is slated for completion this year. Last year, Morocco awarded the second, 850-MW phase via a tender to Italy‚Äôs Enel Green Power SpA (BIT:EGPW), in consortium with Moroccan Nareva Holding and Siemens Wind Power AS. The consortium will build five projects‚Äîthe 150 MW Tanger 2 in the northern part of the country, 300 MW at Tiskrad, Laayoune, 200 MW at Jbel Lahdid, Essaouira, 100 MW near Boujdour, and 100 MW at Midelt, some 400 km east of Casablanca. The tender has attracted bids of about MAD 300 (USD 30/EUR 28) per MWh on average. All wind farms will be developed under public private partnership and structured under the build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) scheme. Commissioning of the tender projects is expected between 2017 and 2020.

Since the establishment of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Turkey's predecessor state, the Ottoman Empire, and in Turkey, the legal standing of the religion has been contested as progressively wider scales of organization of the religion have been attempted by the community. In the 21st century, many of the obstacles to the religion remain in place, as Bah√° º√≠s cannot register with the government officially. Despite this, members do not face significant persecution due to the separation of religion and state in Turkey, and there are estimated to be 10,000 to 20,000 Bah√° º√≠s and around one hundred Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in Turkey. Early phase Many of the important geographic areas of the early period of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith were historically controlled by the Ottoman Empire, from which Turkey came about after the Empire's dissolution in the 1920s. The first interaction between the history of the religion and what is present-day Turkey occurred when Mull√° 'Al√≠y-i-Bast√°m√≠, who was a B√°bi--the immediate predecessor religion associated with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith--was arrested in Ottoman-controlled Baghdad for teaching the religion and sent as a prisoner to Istanbul in 1846. The house where Bah√° ºu'll√°h stayed in Edirne In 1863, when Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the religion, was in Baghdad due to his banishment from Persia, he was further exiled by the Ottoman government from Baghdad to Istanbul. He was later exiled to Edirne in the western part of Turkey, and ultimately to Acre in current-day Israel. While in Istanbul and Edirne the followers of the religion started to become known as Bah√° º√≠s, and a significant portion of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's writings were written while he was in current-day Turkey. While much of the writings were written in Arabic or Persian, the central figures of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith have written in Turkish, though most of the early Bah√° º√≠ literature in Turkish was printed by the large Bah√° º√≠ communities in Baku Azerbaijan and Ashkhabad. GrowthDevelopments along Western Turkey= Bah√° º√≠s have lived in the territory of modern Turkey since Bah√° ºu'll√°h's time. Other Bah√° º√≠s have come from other places to be in Constantinople in this period around 1910. After joining the religion in 1906 in the United States Stanwood CobbThe Bah√° º√≠ World, Vol 18, Part 5, \\"In Memoriam: Stanwood Cobb, 1881-1982\\" taught history and Latin at Robert College in Constantinople in the period 1907‚Äì1910 and undertook travels to see  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°.Oates, John F. 1975?. Biographical Dictionary of American Educators, Vol. 1, pp. 275McLean, J.A.,Pilgrim's Notes (blog), \\"Corrections to Blog on Stanwood Cobb...,\\" Sunday, August 12, 2007 In succeeding years, Cobb wrote several works dealing with Turkey - The Real Turk, ISBN B000NUP6SI, 1914,(Summarized in The Bookman: A Review of Books and Life\\" p. 429) Ayesha of the Bosphorus, 1915, and Islamic Contributions to Civilization in 1963. Wellesley Tudor Pole had been pursuing investigations in the Middle East and visited Constantinople where he heard of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in 1908 and soon became a Bah√° º√≠. The woman known as Isabella Grinevskaya moved from Odessa Ukraine after gaining some notability as a playwright to Constantinople and after meeting  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° on a trip to Egypt became a member of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. In 1913,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's son and successor, commented that the religion was spreading into the interior of Turkey. S√ºleyman Nazif is a prominent poet and thinker from Turkey at the turn of the 20th century who was challenged to learn more of the religion while in Paris, by the poet Catulle Mend√®s. Investigating the religion, including meeting with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° a number of times and becoming an admirer of Tahirih, Nazif wrote about various facets of these encounters and history in several books - though they contain errors they can be considered an important alternative source on early views of Bah√° º√≠ history. Martha Root, a Bah√° º√≠ teacher, visited Turkey in 1927, 1929, and 1932. Following the rise of Secularism in Turkey, the Turkish government, around 1928, decided to order the police in the town of Smyrna to conduct a close investigation into the purpose, the character and the effects of Bah√° º√≠ activity in that town. Mentioned in the morning papers the next day, the chairman of the Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Constantinople travelled to offer the necessary explanations to the authorities concerned but he and the rest of the assembly were all arrested, and Bah√° º√≠ literature in their homes was seized. However their books were returned and there was widespread publicity in leading newspapers of Turkey leading to the government lifting the ban on the Bah√° º√≠s. =Developments spread east= Sometime before 1930, Sami Doktoroglu came in contact with the religion, and became a Bah√° º√≠. He would later become an important member of the religion in Turkey, and as part of the community of Birecik. Despite the earlier situation where the ban on the religion was removed, further waves of arrests of Bah√° º√≠s spread through Urfa, Adana and Gaziantep. In the winter of 1951, the visit to Istanbul of Amelia Collins, a Bah√° º√≠ teacher, was facilitated by Doktoroglu. He made hotel reservations and greeted her at the airport with a large group of Bah√° º√≠s. Several meetings were arranged at which she could meet groups of Bah√° º√≠s and a large banquet was given in her honour. Doktoroglu then went on Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage and on his return a letter dated 14 December 1951 written on behalf of the head of the religion reached the believers in Istanbul encouraging the friends to establish a Local Spiritual Assembly and to pursue other tasks concerning which he had given instructions to Doktoroglu. In April 1952 the Local Spiritual Assembly of (now renamed) Istanbul was formed with Doktoroglu as one of its members. Years later Doktoroglu was successful in obtaining permission to search the government archives. Among his findings was an indication that Mulla  ªAl√°y-i-Bast√°m√≠ had in his travels reached the city of Bolu, east of Istanbul. =Further developments and problems= By the late 1950s Bah√° º√≠ communities existed across many of the cities and towns Bah√° ºu'll√°h passed through on his passage in Turkey. In 1959 the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of Turkey was formed with the help of  ªAl√≠-Akbar Fur√∫tan, a Hand of the Cause -- an individual considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion. Among the members of the National Spiritual Assembly was Mas√≠h Farhang√≠ who had previously served on the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of Iran; he had his family had pioneered from Iran to Turkey around 1959 and both he and his wife were registered as graduate students in a medical college. Even though Farhang√≠ was elected secretary of the body, he was ejected from Turkey at the end of that year. Repeating the pattern of arrests in the 1920s and 30s, in 1959 during Naw Ruz mass arrests of the Bah√° º√≠ local assembly of Ankara resulted in the religion being accused of being a forbidden Tariqah, or sect of Islam. The court requested three experts in comparative religion to give their opinion: two of the three experts supported viewing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as an independent religion, and one claimed that it was a sect of Islam. After this report, the court appointed three respected religious scholars to review all aspects of the question and advise the court of their views. All three of these scholars agreed that the religion was independent on January 17, 1961. However the judges chose to disregard these findings and on July 15, 1961 declared that the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was a forbidden sect but this decision was appealed to the Turkish Supreme Court. Starting in 1960 until 1990, however, Bah√° º√≠s could register with the government when the Interior Ministry issued instructions introducing a new standardized code system that did not include the religion, a situation similar to the current Egyptian identification card controversy. =Re-establishment of the National Assembly and further issues= By 1963, there were 12 Bah√° º√≠ local assemblies in the country, and the number grew to 22 assemblies by the end of 1973. The National Assembly was able to be reestablished in 1974, and by 1986 there were 50 local assemblies. But turmoil continued when on August 6, 1996, 21 Iranians (8 men, 4 women and 9 children, the youngest of whom is 4 years old), approached the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Ankara to request asylum from Iran. UNHCR officials registered their names and informed them of new regulations which require asylum seekers to apply within five days to the police in the city where they entered the country. The asylum seekers were issued documents by the UNHCR indicating their intention for requesting asylum from the local Turkish police. They boarded a chartered bus and arrived in Agri, the city of their entrance, the next morning. However the group disappeared -- with various reports suggesting they were returned to Iranian authorities. Modern community Gardens of the House of Baha'u'llah in Edirne Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However, in Turkey things are complicated. Bah√° º√≠s still arrive in Turkey as refugees from the Persecution of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran. But matters in Turkey are hardly supportive. Despite a 2006 regulation allowing persons to leave the religion section of their identity cards blank or change the religious designation by written application, the government continued to restrict applicants' choice of religion. Despite the regulation, applicants must choose Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist, Religionless, Other, or Unknown as their religious affiliation so individuals can't be registered as Bah√° º√≠s. Additionally there are still instances of harassment and property has been confiscated. In February 2001 the Bah√° º√≠ community lost a legal appeal against government expropriation of a sacred site near Edirne; the Ministry of Culture had previously granted heritage status to the site in 1993. In January 2001 two Bah√° º√≠s were detained for proselytizing in Sivas while a local imam commenting on the arrest made a public rebuke alluding to those \\"whose killing is necessary.\\" Still in 2001, two Bah√° º√≠ university professors at Sivas' Cumhuriyet University faced expulsion. in 2008, a Bah√° º√≠ was appointed dean of the Science and Letters Faculty of the Middle East Technical University. The Turkish government supported the declaration of the Presidency of the European Union when he \\"denounced\\" the trial of Iranian Bah√° º√≠s announced in February 2009. =Demographics= Because the religion is proscribed there can be no official counts of membership. Estimates by others range from 10,000 to 20,000. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 21,000 Bah√° º√≠s in Turkey - and some 880 in Cyprus. The US State Department estimated the Turkish Cypriot Bah√° º√≠ community of approximately 200 in 2008. There are about a hundred local spiritual assemblies in modern Turkey.

Esau rose through the Mineworkers Union of Namibia to become secretary general of the umbrella National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) in 1991. In 1992, during a time of debate concerning the role of Namibia's trade unions, Esau favored maintaining an alliance with SWAPO. However, Esau later in 1994 suggested that the trade unions could form their own political party if workers' rights continued to be ignored by the SWAPO government. In the same year he was placed on the National Assembly list for SWAPO and was voted into the National Assembly in the parliamentary election. Esau was a member of the politburo of SWAPO from 1991 to 1997, and of the Central Committee of the party since 1991.

Hydrogen reactor car Dingel said he began working on his hydrogen reactor in 1969, and claimed to have used the device to power his 1996 Toyota Corolla. Dingel explained that his invention splits producing hydrogen from water in an onboard water tank and does not produce any carbon emissions. However, he never revealed the secret to his invention. In an interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Dingel said that he would willing to reveal the secret of his invention if the buyer would hire 200 Filipinos and their families. Dingel was known as a vocal critic of Filipino government officials and scientists who refused to support his invention. The Philippines Department of Science and Technology, in turn, has declared his invention a hoax. Investment by Formosa Plastics Group and Estafa case In November 2000, John Ding Young of Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) sought Dingel out and, convinced that the invention was genuine, signed a ‚Äúpreliminary understanding‚Äù with him for several projects. He aims to have business partners to get an international patent and to commercialize his technology. In December 2008, Dingel became even more controversial when he was found guilty and sentenced to a maximum of 20 years imprisonment in an Estafa (swindling) case filed against him by Young and FPG. In a decision dated Dec. 9, 2008 Judge Rolando How of the Para√±aque City Regional Trial Court‚Äôs Branch 257 found him guilty of taking $410,000 from FPG, saying that Dingel \\"defrauded Young when the inventor failed to fulfill his obligation of developing his 'hydrogen reactor' and creating experimental cars in 2000.\\" Young claimed that Dingel signed a joint venture agreement with FPG, and initially received $30,000 in goodwill money and $20,000 for research and development. Young said that Dingel then visited the FPG headquarters in Taipei and asked for $300,000 so he could purchase three cars which he would use as prototypes when he returned to the Philippines. Young added that in September 2001 he sent another $60,000 in additional funds, as agreed upon in the joint venture agreement. Former Solicitor-General of the Philippines Frank Chavez, whom Dingel asked to serve as his counsel, said that he would appeal the court decision before it became final on the Christmas Eve of 2008. Daniel Dingel died on October 18, 2010 in Las Pinas City, Metro Manila in the Philippines.

The first halt was installed in 1881 for the Bavarian King Ludwig II, who wanted to visit the construction site for his next palace, Schloss Herrenchiemsee. The present-day station building was erected in 1911. In 1981 the station was closed to passenger services; a siding is still in use for the delivery of liquid gas. Since 2006 a cultural meeting place has been housed in the station building.  Location  Rimsting station: the King's lime tree The station was built at kilometre marker 85.5 on the Munich‚ÄìSalzburg line, which passes Rimsting to the east and whose trackway splits the village from the west bank of the Chiemsee. The perimeter location was planned by the town and opened up the neighbouring communities of Breitbrunn, Gstadt, Eggst√§tt and Hemhof via linking roads, which for a long time were the only means of public transport. From the station, tracks lead to the peninsula of Urfahrn and the so-called Rimstiger √úberfahrt (Rimsting crossing) to the islands of Fraueninsel and Herreninsel.

Founded in 2007 through the amalgamation of Bathurst High School and Kelso High School, the college enrolled approximately 1,830 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 13 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and six percent were from a language background other than English. The college is operated by the NSW Department of Education; and the College Principal is Cathleen Compton.  History  In August 2005 a fire completely destroyed Kelso High School. In the wake of the destruction the NSW Education Department sought community consultation as they began to look at new ways to provide enhanced public education to the Bathurst community. These community collaborations, which involved more than 200 people resulted in consensus around a model that called for the establishment of a collegiate, with two-year 7‚Äì12 campuses at Kelso and Bathurst High. A feature of this collegiate model was that each campus would maintain its own identity, but the establishment of shared curriculum and resources would increase opportunities for all students. Denison College was formed to share curriculum, facilities and staff between Bathurst's two public secondary schools, Bathurst High and Kelso High in order to enhance student choice.  Naming  In 2006 the College Reference and Management Committees, which had been created to form the new college, sought to provide the college with a name. Community consultation and deliberations by the committees lead to the name for the college: \\"Denison College of Secondary Education.\\" The name for the College came from a prominent Bathurst icon, the Denison Bridge; named in honour of Sir William Denison. After the naming of the College, the two high school's forming the collegiate were renamed from Bathurst High School and Kelso High School to Bathurst High Campus and Kelso High Campus respectively.  Structure  The college consists of two year 7‚Äì12 campuses with a shared senior curriculum. This blend allows the two campuses to maintain their own unique identities but with increased opportunities for students using the resources of the college. The college structure is supported by a College Principal and extra staff who work closely with Campus Principals to further develop and enhance the educational experiences for all students. College provided transport further supports the educational needs of senior students by allowing easy movement between campuses to meet course and co-curricula requirements. Denison College has partnerships with Charles Sturt University, Western Institute of TAFE and local industry.  Campuses  Bathurst High Campus has been a centre for education in Bathurst for over 125 years and one of the oldest schools in Australia. The campus is a comprehensive school. The school itself combines heritage buildings with new modern architecture. Kelso High Campus was established in 1976. A new facility has been built following the fire that damaged the original building.

In the Democratic primary, he faced minister Terry Dilligard, Sr. and investigator Jake C. Ross, and he campaigned on both diversifying state revenue sources and on increasing funding for public education. and was re-elected without opposition in 2007. During the last few years of his service on the Commission, he also served as Vice-Mayor of the city.

Biography  A former boulangiste and Freemason, Copin-Albancelli used his experience to become one of the most vehement detractors of Freemasonry, which he, along with many anti-Dreyfusards of the time, associated with Jewish conspiracies. At the turn of the 20th century he founded the anti-Masonic and antisemitic newspapers √Ä bas les tyrans (Down with tyrants) (with Andr√© Baron (Louis Dast√©), and La Bastille. He led the league in defense against Freemasonry, which merged in 1906 with two leagues created by √âmile Driant. The new entity was named Ligue fran√ßaise anti-ma√ßonniqueCatholic secret societies (French anti-Masonic League), and it also lived up to its name by invigorating the anti-Masonic movement. He was also occupied with publishing the society's publication La Renaissance fran√ßaise. Copin-Albancelli was also one of the principal militant nationalists and royalists of Action Fran√ßaise. He collaborated on the Revue d'Action Fran√ßaise which became L'Action fran√ßaise edited by Charles Maurras. In parallel with these activities, Copin-Albancelli was also working with the Revue Internationale des Soci√©t√©s Secr√®tes (International Review of Secret Societies) of bishop Ernest Jouin, the famous detractor of freemasonry and whistleblower against alleged conspiracies linked to secret powers, he was also a member of the Movement for the Defense of national traditions (or Entente nationale), regrouping several royalists of the Action Fran√ßaise or independents. Fearing the ruin of the Christian West to a \\"New World Order\\" (whose strings were pulled by Jews and Freemasons), Copin-Albancelli up until his death denounced various Judeo-Masonic conspiracies which, according to him, infiltrated the political world. In his belief that various secret organizations were trying to establish a \\"globalist power\\", Copin-Albancelli exploited a myth found in the same period in the Protocol of the Elders of Zion. The scheme was widely used to try to prove the type of conspiracy of which Copin-Albancelli became the tireless exposer.

King Jr. Professor Thomas J. King Jr. (July 25, 1925 ‚Äì 1994) was an educator, and an early user of word processing and sequence analysis to compare available early versions of William Shakespeare's plays for identification of variant texts and their analysis. Dr. King's historical work also researched original prompt copies of Elizabethan Era and Jacobean Era plays contemporary to Shakespeare, along with their marginalia, in order to identify stage directions and infer physical staging of Shakespeare's plays at the Globe and other London venues, as well as at provincial halls and inns where Elizabethan troupes performed on tour. In his extensive studies, Prof. King created databases of every Shakespeare play and other extant Elizabethan contemporary playhouse documents, by scene and character, to determine number of lines, and therefore the roles that could be doubled with sufficient time between for costume change, thus enabling him to determine the size of a working Elizabethan theater company. Based, in part, on his extensive experience in professional stage production, his academic studies combined textual analysis with analysis of original correspondence, illustrations, playhouse documents and financial records to identify principal actors and journeymen involved in performance of Shakespeare's plays and the plays of other Renaissance dramatists in England. During his career, King contributed as writer and reviewer to a number of leading scholarly journals, including Theatre Notebook, Renaissance Drama, Shakespeare Quarterly, Elizabethan Theatre, and presented his work at World Shakespeare conferences. He also served as consultant to Sam Wanamaker on the construction of the modern Shakespeare's Globe Theatre located near the original site in the London Borough of Southwark, on the south bank of the Thames.

He was born in Sheffield and grew up in the village of Dungworth in the Stannington area of the city. The formative years of his football career were spent in the Manchester United youth teams, playing in the same sides as players like Duncan Edwards and Bobby Charlton. With Manchester United's youth team, he became one of five players to win three consecutive FA Youth Cup winner's medals, in 1954, 1955 and 1956. He also played international football for England at schoolboy and youth level. After playing just three matches for the club's reserve team, Hawksworth was called up to the Manchester United first team for a First Division match away to Blackpool on 27 October 1956, after regular goalkeeper Ray Wood had pulled out due to injury. United drew the match 2‚Äì2, but it was to be Hawksworth's only appearance for the Manchester United first team. He was doing his National Service at Catterick in North Yorkshire at the time, and only able to go on leave to play for United on weekends, so after Wood recovered from his injury, Hawksworth had no complaints about dropping back down to the reserve team. However, a couple of weeks after the Blackpool game, Hawksworth was approached by an army captain who wanted him to play for the regimental team the following weekend. Hawksworth was intent on playing for Manchester United, but the captain ‚Äì who was also the posting officer for the regiment ‚Äì threatened him with redeployment to Benghazi by the following Monday. It is unknown whether the captain's threat was serious or not, but Hawksworth was in no position to argue; nevertheless, he took the matter to United manager Matt Busby, but Busby recommended that Hawksworth play for the regiment. By 1958, Hawksworth had been posted to the Royal Tank Regiment in Germany. That February, a plane carrying the Manchester United team home from a European Cup match in Belgrade made a stopover in snowy conditions in Munich. In an incident that later became known as the Munich air disaster, the plane crashed on a failed take-off attempt, and eight players were killed. As he was already in Germany, Hawksworth requested leave, and two weeks after the incident, he was able to visit his friends and former teammates; he arrived at Munich on the night that Duncan Edwards died. In December 1958, Hawksworth was allowed to leave Manchester United to join Bedford Town, who were considered to be the best non-League side at the time. That season, Bedford Town won the Southern League title, beating Hereford United 2‚Äì1 in a play-off between the winners of the North-Western and South-Eastern sections of the league. Hawksworth remained at Bedford for seven years, a contribution for which he was given a testimonial by the club. He then moved to Rushden Town, the forerunners of Rushden & Diamonds, and remained there until his retirement. After retiring from football, Hawksworth worked for a sweet company, before working for British Gas until 1995, when he retired. He and his wife, Brenda, married in 1959, and they live in Dronfield Woodhouse, Derbyshire. They have four children (three sons and a daughter) and five grandchildren.

Development The Mark 1 Atlas was launched as the 750SS in the early 1960s, but by the time it appeared c. 1962 it was being called a 750cc Atlas, with Norton's famous Featherbed frame. Designer Bert Hopwood‚Äôs 1949 497cc Dominator engine had been bored and stroked over the years to 745cc, via 600cc and then 650cc versions, to appeal to the American market and initially was only produced for export.Motorcycle Mechanics, May 1962, p.13 Looking Ahead - Mighty Atlas. \\"...this exciting 750 cc twin from Norton's. [sic] Unfortunately, as yet, it is only for the American market, to compete against their hefty capacity bikes.\\". Accessed and added 2014-09-20 The styling was aimed at the US market with high-rise handlebars, small 2.5-gallon petrol tank and valanced chrome mudguards and chain guard. The look was completed with a heavy-duty WM3-18 rear wheel, and a Lucas Competition magneto was supplied as standard. The engine had lower compression than the Dominator (at 7.6:1) and was fitted with a single 376 Amal monobloc carburettor giving at 6500 rpm. However the design produced excessive vibration at high revs, so the compression ratio was reduced. The Atlas shared many cycle parts with the last of the Dominator twins and had Norton‚Äôs four-speed gearbox and heavy-duty clutch. Electrics were 6-volt and it had Roadholder forks, adjustable Girling rear shocks and a slimline Featherbed frame. In 1964 the Atlas was upgraded to 12-volt electrics, and gained a second carburettor and wider fork yokes. A UK version was launched with flat bars and twin instruments. The Atlas continued to be built until 1968 but by then the Norton Commando had taken over. Specials and hybrids Specialist tuners such as Dunstall produced Atlas-based racers (Domiracer 750) and offered race-styled roadsters (Dominator 750) although later on Dunstall also designated his roadsters as 'Domiracer'. A few Rickman Metisse frames were either made or later modified by owners to accept Norton power plants, and the factory-built Atlas-powered AMC-Norton hybrids (Norton Matchless) included an Atlas-powered, Matchless-framed, off-road trailster designated P11.http://www.jamiewaters.com/motorcycles.html Jamie's Nortons. Retrieved 2013-02-24 Over seven thousand Atlas hybrids were produced at Plumstead between late 1963 and late 1968 using Atlas engines and various Matchless frames.

It is part of the Ma'an Network, a non-governmental organization media network created in 2002 in the Palestinian territories among independent journalists throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It has partnerships with eight local television stations and twelve local radio stations. Ma'an News Agency publishes news 24 hours a day in Arabic, Hebrew and English, and claims to be one of the largest wire services in the Palestinian territories, with over three million visits per month. Ma'an News Agency also publishes feature stories, analysis and opinion articles. The agency's headquarters are based in Bethlehem and it has an office in Gaza.  History  The Ma'an Network was launched in 2002 as a partnership between Bethlehem TV and local Palestinian media organizations. The name Ma'an is the Arabic word for \\"together\\". The group is run by Raed Othman, the former manager of Bethlehem TV. Ma'an has produced three soap operas (one of which, Mazih fi Jad (Joking Seriously), was described as the first television drama series produced in the Palestinian territories), numerous news and public affairs programs and the television film Kafah. Ma'an's programs are broadcast by ten independent terrestrial television stations in the West Bank and occasionally by the Fatah-run Palestine TV satellite broadcaster. The Ma'an News Agency was launched in 2005 with funding from the Danish and Dutch Representative Offices to the Palestinian National Authority. The news agency is the most visible component of the Ma'an Network. On 15 May, the Ma'an network launched an eCommerce website called Maan Souq.  Independence  Ma'an News Agency says that it \\"scrupulously maintains its editorial independence and aims to promote access to information, freedom of expression, press freedom, and media pluralism in Palestine.\\" The Ma'an Network was founded with the goal of creating a media source that was free of factional control, unlike the major existing broadcasters such as Hamas' Al- Aqsa TV and Fatah's Palestine TV. In an interview with media scholar Matt Sienkiewicz, former Ma'an Chief financial officer Wisam Kutom stated that he told potential Ma'an funders that: \\"Palestinian television is factional television right now we [Palestinians] cannot tell the stories we want to, only the stories the factions will let us. There is no independent television\\".  Funding  Funding for Ma'an Network comes from advertising revenue and from foreign donors.  2007 Threat from Hamas  In July 2007, at the time the de facto Gaza Strip government, MNA alleged that MNA's chief editor had received \\"direct threats\\" from Hamas to carry out a \\"defamation campaign\\" against MNA, and to cease its criticism of \\"the Hamas movement\\".  Reach  Ma'an News Agency describes itself as \\"the main source of independent news from Palestine\\" and \\"the premier source of independent Palestinian news on the internet\\". According to a 2007 survey, 95.6% of Palestinians with internet access \\"frequently visit\\" the site. As of December 2013, Ma'an News receives the fourth most site visitors in the Palestinian territories.  Reality TV  In 2013, Ma'an TV (Ma'an Network's satellite channel) broadcast the hit reality show The President in collaboration with Search for Common Ground. Described as \\"a cross between American Idol and The Apprentice\\", audience members would vote through SMS to elect the show's young contestants who competed in mock press conferences, political campaigns, and debates.  Reliability  An Israeli NGO, NGO Monitor, criticizes Ma'an for regularly re- publishing \\"non-verifiable or inaccurate claims\\" from partisan NGOs and for, \\"subjective, biased reporting.\\" Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) criticized Ma'an for \\"sanitizing\\" its English-language reporting while publishing in Arabic reports that ‚Äúinclude the hate ideology espoused by the terror organizations that deny Israel's right to exist [and] express reverence for suicide terrorists.\\" In further reports, PMW criticized Ma'an for \\"demonization of Jews,\\" for publishing news stories in materially different Arabic and English versions, and for Holocaust denial. According to The New York Times during the spate of Palestinian stabbing attacks against Israelis in 2015, Ma'an inaccurately reported that a young knife attacker had been \\"murdered\\" by Israeli police, (he was wounded and taken for treatment at Hadassah Hospital), \\"In a video report accusing Israel of faking evidence of other knife attacks, a reporter for the Palestinian news agency Maan described the clip as evidence of ‚Äúmurder‚Äù and claimed in her narration that the video showed the boy lying on the ground when ‚Äúan Israeli occupation soldier shoots him in the head,‚Äù which it does not.\\"  See also  * Wafa * Palestinian Information Center  References  External links  * Ma'an News Agency * Ma'an News Agency Category:News agencies based in Palestine Category:Mass media in Bethlehem Category:Arabic-language websites Category:English-language websites Category:Multilingual websites Category:Palestinian news websites Category:2005 establishments in the Palestinian territories Category:Internet properties established in 2005 ","title":"Ma'an News Agency"},{"id":"20782420","text":"Thomas Hay (July 1858 ‚Äì 10 January 1940) was an English footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

It is distinguished from other Swiss breads by a very soft, porous dough and a mealy, crunchy crust. The age of the recipe is uncertain. The Basler Brot was first described in a bakers' journal in 1944. After a marketing campaign by the Swiss Bakers Association in the 1950s, it was made available in all Swiss bakeries. Production A traditionally made Basler Brot without cracks in the crust. Production of the Basler Brot begins the day before baking with the production of the Hebel, a mother dough that is left to ripen overnight, producing the bread's characteristic aroma. It is then mixed with plain flour, salt, yeast and water to produce a dough with a very high water content (over 80%), making the bread very soft. After a light kneading, the dough is formed into rough pieces, which are weighed and laid on flour- dusted wooden bards for half an hour. They are only lightly rolled into an oval shape, which allows for the dough's large pores to form, and then baked for at least half an hour at up to Usually, two loaves are baked attached point to point, and steam is used to prevent a premature hardening of the crust, which should ‚Äì unlike the loaf pictured above ‚Äì not crack during baking.

The corridor begins at Chennai Port Gate No. 10 and travels along the bank of the Cooum River till it reaches Koyambedu and along the median of NH4 thereon till it reaches Maduravoyal. History An long, wide elevated road project connecting the port with Maduravoyal is under construction at a cost of 16,550 million. Upon completion, this will be the country's longest six-way elevated expressway. The project was sanctioned in June 2007 when the Tamil Nadu Government gave its 'in principle' approval to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for the elevated expressway. The project cost then was put at 14,680 million. In January 2009, the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, laid the foundation stone for the project but the project was put on hold for want of environment clearance. The project has got the environment clearance in February 2011, and during the same month, the port handed over a cheque for 500 million to the NHAI as part of its contribution to the project. The expressway starts from Gate No. 10 of the Chennai Port near the War Memorial and ends before Maduravoyal Interchange. It would run along the banks of the Cooum up to Koyambedu and would end along the Cooum near the Koyambedu grade separator. From there for a distance of three km up to Maduravoyal the elevated expressway would come up on Poonamallee High Road. There would be a total of four entry and exit ramps as part of the project. While the entry ramps would come up on Sivananda Salai and College Road, the exit points would be provided on Spurtank Road and Kamaraj Salai. The work at the Maduravoyal end began in December 2010. The project is being implemented on a build, own and transfer mode. Of the total project cost of 16,550 million, 3,100 million has been set aside for land acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement of nearly 7,400 people living along the project area. About 1,300 people have been rehabilitated at Okkiam Thoraipakkam. Of 30 hectares to be acquired for the project, only 2 hectares belong to private owners. The project was initially expected to be completed by end of 2013. However, the project has been put on hold.

EAH exists on a spectrum of cutaneous tumors that include eccrine nevus, mucinous eccrine nevus and EAH. Each diagnostic subtype is characterized by an increase in the number as well as size of mature eccrine glands or ducts, with EAH being distinguished by the added vascular component. Patients with EAH may present with complaints of pain or increased sweating (hyperhidrosis) associated with stress or exercise, or without any associated symptoms. It usually appears as a solitary nodular lesion on the acral areas of the extremities, particularly the palms and soles.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 581. . Onset of EAH most commonly arises in children prior to puberty as a solitary, unilateral, large, red to violaceous nodule or plaque located on the extremities. Although rare, there have been reports of multiple EAH lesions occurring within a single patient in a linear, grouped, agminated or blaschkoid distribution.  Signs and Symptoms  EAH most commonly presents as a solitary papule or plaque on the extremities of children and are frequently congenital, although they can appear in adulthood as well. Rarely, multiple EAH lesions have been reported in a single patient, most often in an agminated pattern located on the extremities. A predisposition of EAH for facial and truncal involvement is not commonly seen. Some reports have demonstrated lesion predominance on the distal extremities. Fewer accounts detail distribution on the head, neck and lower back. Cases reporting lesions in uncommon locations, such as the trunk or abdomen, typically involved only a solitary lesion. Whereas EAH occurring as multiple lesions was more often reported in classic sites of involvement such as the arm or leg. Although EAH is often asymptomatic, it is known to cause variable levels of pain. This is thought to occur as a result of small nerves that are seen on electron microscopy in close proximity to the eccrine and vascular structures. Hypertrichosis of the tumor is encountered in most cases. Hyperhidrosis is an additional diagnostic feature that is seen in under half of reported cases. There is also significant cosmetic concern in some instances.  Causes  The pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the hamartoma is thought to involve a biochemical fault in the interactions between differentiating epithelium and subjacent mesenchyme giving rise to an abnormal proliferation of adnexal and vascular structures.  Diagnosis  A skin biopsy is typically performed for definitive diagnosis. The histopathologic hallmarks of EAH include the presence of an increased number of eccrine glands in the mid- and lower dermis along with ectatic or collapsed vessels that are seen in close approximation to the hyperplastic eccrine units. The overlying epidermis may be normal or may show acanthosis or papillomatosis. A recent report of EAH located on the neck described dermatoscopic features of multiple yellow, confluent nodules in a popcorn-like shape over a background of erythema and linear, arborizing vessels. Dermoscopy is minimally invasive, inexpensive and may provide another diagnostic modality in the differentiation of EAH from other diagnoses, but has yet to be validated. = Differential Diagnosis = Vascular malformations: * Eccrine nevus ‚Äì Characterized histopathologically by an increase in eccrine structures but not capillaries. Clinical hallmark is hyperhidrosis in most cases. * Tufted angioma * Smooth muscle hamartoma ‚Äì These flesh-colored plaques may have associated hypertrichosis. A \\"chicken- skin\\" appearance (pseudo-Darier sign) may be seen with piloerection. * Glomus tumor ‚Äì Painful bluish papules, single or multiple, are encountered, mainly on acral areas of the body. * Blue rubber bleb nevus * Sudoriparous angioma ‚Äì Another rare, benign tumor where eccrine glands of normal number are seen lying close to vascular structures in the dermis; these have a larger caliber than those seen in EAH. Macules: * Nevus flammeus * Angioma serpiginosum * Telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans  Treatment  EAH is a benign hamartoma and if there is no associated pain or cosmetic concern or disfiguration, EAH may be observed only. Treatment is often unnecessary. Most cases of symptomatic EAH have been treated with surgical resection, with a few efficacious alternative treatments available.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 582. . The paler area is due to the blood vessels within the area which are more sensitive to the body‚Äôs normal vasoconstricting chemicals. Signs and symptoms This benign patch appears on the skin at birth or in early childhood. In most people these are under 10cm in size. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, rubbing the area causes the skin around the lesion to become red while the lesion itself does not change in color. Often the patches are difficult to see against the background color of the patient‚Äôs skin, but if sunburn develops, then the white area stands out prominently. The involved area is lighter than the normal skin, not because of a loss of pigment occurs, but because blood vessels are constricted, producing a permanent blanching of the area. This blanching is a functional rather than a structural abnormality, presumed to be caused by local increased sensitivity to catecholamines.McMillan, Julia A; DeAngelis, Catherine D.; Feigin, Ralph D.; Warshaw, Joseph B. (2006). Oski's Pediatrics, Principles & Practice. (4th ed.). Page 458. . Although the cutaneous vasculature appears normal histologically, the blood vessels within the nevus do not respond to injection of vasodilators. It has been postulated that the persistent pallor may represent a sustained localized adrenergic vasoconstriction.Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 19th. (10th ed.). W.B. Saunders Company. Page 640. . Results of a skin biopsy would be interpreted as normal and only physiological testing can reveal the nevus in contrast to normal skin. Stroking the patch elicits no red flare. Only the normal skin would react with a characteristic erythematous response. Examination under a Wood lamp can also reveal the nevus anemicus patch will not emphasize as a patch of vitiligo would.Barber Kirk (2010). Consultant For Pediatricians '. Page 9:233, 237. DiagnosisTreatment Since the histopathology of nevus anemicus is normal, nevus anemicus is a pharmacologic nevus and not an anatomic one.Mountcastle EA, Diestelmeier MR, Lupton GP. Nevus anemicus.

It is a common type of birthmark in a newborn.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 169. . Signs and symptoms Stork bites occur in a significant number of newborns, with estimates ranging from to ; they are reported more frequently for white babies than for infants of other races. They result from a dilation of capillaries in the skin, and may become darker when the child cries or strains. The birthmarks, which are pinkish and irregularly shaped, occur most frequently on the nape of the neck; however, they are also common on the forehead, eyelids and upper lip. A baby may be born with a stork bite, or the birthmark may appear in the first months of life. They may also be found occasionally on other parts of the body. The skin is not thickened and feels no different from anywhere else on the body; the only difference is in appearance. Diagnosis A doctor can diagnose a stork bite with a simple visual inspection. No tests are needed. Treatment No treatment is needed. If a stork bite lasts longer than 3 years, it may be removed using laser surgery. Outlook Most stork bites on the face go away completely in about 18 months. Stork bites on the back of the neck usually do not go away.

Symons, founding President of Trent University, and Dr. Alan Earp, former President of Brock University. 1960s FROS existed to give attention to international students in Canadian university communities, numbered at around 8,000-10,000. 1964 Canadian Service for Overseas Students and Trainees (CSOST) evolved out of FROS to promote more systematic services on a national basis, thus the inception of CBIE. 1966 August 1966- CBIE Incorporation- Signatories to our letters patent: James A.

Laurence Elvin. 1995 Background The business was established by Charles Brindley in 1854. He was joined by Albert Healey Foster in 1871 and the company acquired the name Brindley & Foster. Charles Brindley was born in Baslow, Derbyshire, in the early 1830s. He retired in 1887 and died in 1893.The Star, Guernsey. Tuesday 5 December 1893 Brindley was a follower of Edmund Schulze. He built solid instruments with powerful choruses using Vogler‚Äôs Simplification system. Pipes placed in chromatic order on the soundboards allowed for a simple and reliable key action and permitted similar stops to share the same bass, keeping both space and cost to a minimum. The Swell organ was often mounted above the Great in the German manner. After the partnership with Foster they began to manufacture more complex pneumatic mechanisms for stop combinations; he also concentrated on the production of orchestral effects. The business of Brindley and Foster was bought by Henry Willis & Sons in 1939. List of new organs *Mechanics' Institute, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia 1859. Moved to Albert Hall, Launceston 1891.

It was the first private English- language periodical to be licensed in Syria, since all private media was nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1958, during the short-lived Syrian- Egyptian union. The magazine started in January 2007, with the motto \\"The Only Way is Forward.\\" In December 2009, Forward Launched its digital edition in collaboration with Pressmart Media. History Forward was founded by media and technology entrepreneur Abdulsalam Haykal. The first edition appeared on 5 January 2007. According to a statement on the magazine's website, Forward was built \\"on the firm conviction that the only way is forward in Syria and other options do not exist.\\" While the magazine claims to be \\"the only balanced, local, and reliable source of information on Syria in the English language,\\" some observers have dubbed it as \\"pro-regime.\\" The magazine has been able to attract several leading media figures as contributors including David Ignatius of The Washington Post, Hala Gorani of CNN, and Riz Khan of al-Jazeera. It has featured exclusive interviews with international figures, including former US President Jimmy Carter, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, and Syria's First Lady Asma al-Assad. The magazine has established its own blog recently, Untold Damascene Stories, with its own writers as the blog's contributors. The funding for this magazine is dubious. Its editorial line is parallel to those of the US Foreign policy in almost every aspect. Its entry in the news dissemination market coincides with attempts by the US to penetrate into Syria once independent news publications were permitted in 2007. In order to achieve a measure of credibility, it assumed at times a mildly critical evaluation of US policies, particularly that towards Israel, but once that established, it began to gnaw at the foundation of Syfria's political culture, by citing and rewriting the bloody history and lamenting the demise of important CIA operatives, like Husni Al-Zaim who led a coup d'√©tat which toppled the democratically elected government and replaced it for some six years with an array of CIA-controlled colonels.  American focus  Forward Magazine has an American focus in its coverage of international affairs, and was supportive of Barack Obama's election. Although since it has been critical of the American President's dealings with Israel, warning that US policy towards nuclear nations may allow Israel to have a hand in future terror attacks against the United States. It also stated that Israel was behind the murder of Rafic Hariri but Obama, not wanting to not alienate Jewish voters, refused to allow special tribunals to consider Israel as a suspect but instead maintain focus on only Hizbollah and Syria. One of Forward's regular contributors is Imad Moustapha, Syria's Ambassador to the United States. In April 2007, Forward ran an article by US Institute of Peace specialist Scott Lasensky on \\"How to move the Syria-American relations forward?\\" In June 2007, another piece by Hind Kabawat stressed a similar notion of how cultural exchange can be a tool for better relations between Syria and the US. In August 2007, Imad Moustapha gave an interview for Forward Magazine in which he stated about the American government: \\"I don‚Äôt spare them and they don‚Äôt spare me. It is a fair game.\\" In November 2008, Forward ran the headline: \\"To our American readers\\" on its front cover. The 14-page series of articles and photographs denounced the American strike on Abu Kamal, a city in North-eastern Syria, and depicted blood-stained concrete from the attack site.http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JL11Ak02.html Earlier in July 2008, Forward ran a story by the American writer Scott C. Davis on \\"What Michelle Obama can learn from Asma al-Assad.\\" In December 2008, Forward ran a series of articles to mark the election of Barack Obama as next president of the United States. The front-cover headline was: \\"Obamania sweeps away Bushism.\\" The edition included a section titled \\"10 Syrian Christmas wishes to Obama.\\" Forward featured an interview also with Ambassador Edward Djerejian, head of the James Baker Institute at Rice University. In March 2008, Forward published an editorial by one of its contributors, T. Hariri, that addresses Obama and what he refers to as \\"the Bush era:\\" > The politics of 9-11 would continue to ripple the American fabric through > the duration of the near decade of the markedly reactionary Bush era. It was > an episode in the theater of American politics whose deliberate policies > revealed a reckless abandon: a political-cum-cultural movement retrograde to > the American ideals that have always been embedded in potential, and > bolstered by historical beginnings, not ends.  Editorial board, publisher, and contributors Forward Magazine is edited by Syrian historian and writer Sami Moubayed, an author of books, who reports on Syrian affairs with regular contributions to Asia Times, Gulf News, and PostGlobal. In July 2008, he was part of the unofficial Syrian delegation to the United States whose request to meet officials at the State Department was turned down. Together with the other two members of the group, Moubayed was described as a \\"regime-sanctioned mouthpiece.\\" The magazine is published by Haykal Media, which also produces Syria's business bi-weekly Aliqtisadi, and the lifestyle monthly Happynings.

The club was founded in 1922 but disbanded in 1944 because of a lack of members during World War II. The club was reformed in 1978 and in 2006 the club moved into its new grounds on Estuary Road. The club colours are black and amber, the same colours as Malahide Cricket Club and Malahide Yacht Club. History Malahide RFC was founded in 1922. Its patron was Lord Talbot of Malahide. In those years Malahide RFC fielded two senior teams, playing in Leinster Branch IRFU, League and Cup competitions. Matches were played in Malahide Castle grounds, on the site where Malahide Cricket Club now reside. Many players lived outside the village and travelled from Rush, Skerries and Dublin to play for Malahide RFC At the end of each season an Honour Cap was awarded to the outstanding players for that season. The award took the form of a velvet cap, black in colour and rimmed with gold tassels with the relevant year embroidered on the front of the cap. On 27 September 1944, an Extraordinary General Meeting was held in the pavilion. It was presided over by Dr. H. Micheal and in attendance were eleven members. Shortage of members, local support was waning and World War II was taking its toll on membership. The decision was taken to disband the club. Many of the people associated with the early club still had connections with Malahide. So it was that some of these men held a re-union in the Grove Hotel, Malahide, Some younger people also attended. As a result of a meeting, Malahide RFC was reformed in 1978. Two pitches were rented in Malahide Castle grounds, now under the control of Fingal County Council as Lord Talbot had bequeathed the Castle and demesne to the Irish Government. In 1989 the club purchased their own land on the Back Road, opposite Malahide Castle. In March 1992 the clubhouse and pitch were officially opened. The mid-1990s were a very successful period in the club's history. In 1996 Malahide won the Leinster League Division Four and were promoted into Division Three which they won the next season. Malahide stayed in Division Two for two seasons but were relegated in 2000. On 16 September 2006 the club's new grounds at Estuary Road were officially opened. The opening was marked by former Malahide resident and Irish rugby legend Ollie Campbell and with a one-off blitz tournament between Malahide and Clontarf, Suttonians, Skerries, Coolmine, Swords, Balbriggan and Old Belvedere. In 2009 the club unveiled the new players strip. The kit retained old traditional black & gold colours but with a new modern variation. In 2010 the club appointed Rick Evans as the first team head coach. The club won the league by winning all their games bar one, ending the season with a 57-3 win over Railway Union away. The first team were promoted to Leinster Division 2 for the 2011/12 season. Facilities The clubhouse has state of the art facilities including two rugby pitches (one floodlit) and use of the adjacent Seabury pitch plus, four changing rooms, a referees changing room, a plunge pool, a high quality weights room and a physio room. The clubhouse also has a Rugby Bar and a function room suitable for seating over 120 people, kitchen facilities and a conference room capable of holding up to 200 people.

After four years in England, he returned to Ireland with Waterford before briefly retiring due to illness, only to return to England to play non- league football with Altrincham. Career McFarlane was born in Bray, County Wicklow, and played junior football in the area, earning a call-up to the Republic of Ireland Schoolboys national team.

Diplomates of the ABNM are called nuclear medicine physicians. The ABNM is one of the 24 member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Nuclear medicine procedures use the tracer principle, most often radioactive tracers called radiopharmaceuticals, to evaluate molecular, metabolic, physiologic, and pathologic conditions for diagnosis, therapy, and research. Nuclear medicine procedures are the major clinical applications of molecular imaging and molecular therapy. Mission statement The American Board of Nuclear Medicine is the primary certifying organization for nuclear medicine in the United States. The Board serves the public through assurance of high quality patient care by establishing standards of training, initial certification, and continuing competence of physicians providing nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic services. History * The American Board of Nuclear Medicine ** In 1971, the ABNM was foundedRoss JF: A history of the American Board of Nuclear Medicine. Semin Nucl Med. 1996 Jul;26(3):191-193. . as a conjoint board, sponsored by *** the American Board of Internal Medicine, *** the American Board of Pathology, *** the American Board of Radiology, and *** the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, formerly the Society of Nuclear Medicine. ** In 1985, it became a primary board, and ** in 1990, it became an independent board. * Certification ** In 1972, the ABNM issued its first certificates. ** In 1992, recertification every 10 years was introduced. ** In 2007, recertification was replaced by the ongoing process called maintenance of certification ** In 2017, a pilot of CertLink‚Ñ¢ will be provided as an alternate to the MOC exam. Certification A physician certified by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine has # a valid license to practice medicine, # successfully completed training in an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) approved residency program, # been evaluated by the director of the training program and found competent in clinical nuclear medicine, and # passed a secure computer-based examination encompassing the medical uses of radioactive materials and related sciences. The American Board of Medical Specialties has a free website where certification of physicians can be confirmed, and where certified physicians can be found by geographic location. Maintenance of certification Maintenance of Certification (MOC) is a program of continuing education and evaluation for the diplomates of all member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties.ABMS Maintenance of Certification program Initial certification documents a physicians initial competence; Maintenance of Certification documents a commitment to remaining up-to-date. The American Board of Nuclear Medicine's MOC program has four parts. # Professional standing. Evidence of professional standing is provided by maintain unrestricted license(s) to practice medicine. # Lifelong learning and self- assessment. Diplomates must document participation in continuing medical education and must take part in self-assessment activities that are qualified by the ABNM. # Cognitive expertise. Either a secure, reliable, and valid exam must be successfully passed each 10 years, or diplomates must participate in CertLink. # Performance in practice evaluation. A continuing process of evaluation, improvement, and reevaluation must be applied by each diplomates to his/her own practice. CertLink‚Ñ¢ The CertLink pilotMOC Assessment will provide ABNM diplomates with questions to answer on a regular basis. After answering the question, the diplomates will receive feedback ‚Äì the correct answer, a brief explanation, and literature references. The pilot has been designed using cognitive physiology principles to provide continuing medical education at the same time as the diplomate demonstrates continuing expertise. Components of professional competence Nuclear medicine is a technology embedded medical specialty depending upon * physics (Medical physics) to understand radioisotopes and radiation, * engineering to design instruments that can image and measure gamma rays and X-rays, * radiation biology and health physics to understand therapy and radiation protection, * chemistry and pharmacy to produce radiopharmaceuticals, and * biochemistry and physiology to understand the biodistribution of tracers. The components of professional competence for nuclear medicine physicians include a basic understanding of all of these underlying sciences as well as a thorough understanding of their medical application.Alavi A, Blahd WH, DeNardo SJ, et al. J Nucl Med 2003; 44:988-990. The program requirements for nuclear medicine residencies also include all of these elements.

Although outnumbered, the guerrilla tactics of a detachment from the Welsh forces aided them in inflicting an unknown number of casualties on the Anglo-Norman army. Henry subsequently abandoned the campaign after an attempt to cross the Berwyn Mountains was thwarted by severe weather. It is unclear whether events in the Ceiriog Valley represented a pitched battle, a series of smaller engagements or a minor skirmish: all three have been argued, as well as the possibility no fighting took place during the 1165 campaign. It has been suggested that the idea of a \\"battle\\" should be considered as folklore rather than as a genuine historical event.Pratt, D. \\"Crogen: Myth and Reality\\", The Clwyd Historian, 8 (1981), 18 There are few contemporary accounts: 19th century and later accounts of the \\"battle\\" rely heavily on David Powel's 1584 Historie of Cambria, an unreliable historical source. Background Anglo-Norman involvement in Wales was centred on a number of Marcher Lordships set up by William I. These had considerable legal independence: Marcher barons could hold their own courts and had a licence to crenellate. The Crown sought to strengthen the position of the Marcher Lords against the native Welsh princes, and in July 1163 several of the princes were compelled to do homage to Henry II at Woodstock, giving guarantees for their peaceful conduct. Henry II began planning a punitive campaign into Wales in 1164, ostensibly to take action against several Welsh princes, particularly Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth, who had been responsible for disturbances along the border in breach of the 1163 settlement.Latimer, P. \\"Henry II's Campaign Against the Welsh in 1165\\" in The Welsh Historical Review, 14:4 (1989), 523-552 Welsh chronicles of the time argued that Henry's Marcher Lords, particularly Roger de Clare, 2nd Earl of Hertford, had themselves failed to keep to the terms of the agreement. Rhys had used Roger's actions as a pretext to continue his conflict with the Normans, attacking the castles of Mabwynion and Aberrheidol and overrunning much of Ceredigion. Owain ap Gruffydd of Gwynedd was in open rebellion by autumn 1164 and sent several letters to Henry's main rival, Louis VII of France, asking to be considered amongst Louis' \\"faithful and devoted friends\\".Duffy, S. (2007) \\"Henry II and England's Insular Neighbours\\" in Harper-Bill (ed.) Henry II: New Interpretations, Woodbridge, p.135 The Welsh annals spoke of a concerted effort by the Welsh princedoms, which were more usually in competition with each other, to \\"throw off the rule of the French [i.e. the Angevins]\\". In early 1165 Owain Gwynedd's son Dafydd ravaged the cantref of Tegeingl, threatening the Norman castles at Rhuddlan, Basingwerk and Prestatyn. Henry returned from Normandy in May. During the summer of 1165 he assembled a substantial force at Shrewsbury, including troops from England and mercenaries from the Continent: several contemporary chronicles emphasised the large size of the Angevin army. Henry's overall objectives in the campaign are uncertain; Welsh annals alleged that he planned a complete conquest of the Welsh princedoms, but a more likely interpretation is that he sought the submission of Rhys and Owain and a settlement with more effective guarantees than in 1163. The reason for Henry's choice of route into Wales is similarly unclear, as it led initially into the minor princedoms of northern Powys, which had not been in conflict with him. Shrewsbury was not the most convenient base for a campaign against either Rhys or Owain: it may have been selected in order to be able to advance northward or southward as the campaign required. Henry's subsequent advance towards Oswestry and the Ceiriog Valley may indicate that a decision had been made to attack Owain Gwynedd first. In response Owain raised an army at Corwen in the cantref of Penllyn, comprising forces from several princedoms. Including his own forces, led by himself and his brother Cadwaladr, the alliance was made up of men from Deheubarth under the leadership of Rhys ap Gruffydd, troops from Mochnant in northern Powys under Iowerth Goch ap Maredudd and from southern Powys under Owain Cyfeiliog, although the latter had been on good terms with Henry until that point. Powysian involvement in the alliance may have been less than enthusiastic, particularly as Gwynedd had recently overrun Powysian lands in Penllyn, and it is possible that Henry hoped a show of Angevin strength would encourage the lords of Powys back under his protection.Stevenson (2016) Medieval Powys: Kingdom, Principality and Lordships, 1132-1293, Boydell and Brewer, pp.64-65 The battle Contemporary sources are patchy and conflicting, and there has been a great deal of disagreement over events during the campaign. Some scholars, such as Austin Lane Poole, have concluded that no fighting actually took place at all in 1165.Hosler (2004), \\"Henry II's Military Campaigns in Wales\\" in Bacharach et al. (eds), Journal of Medieval Military History, p.69 Red plaque of the Battle of Crogen, unveiled in 2009; it has been suggested that the engagement might be better regarded as a \\"series of minor harassments\\"Malaws, 2010. BATTLE OF CROGEN COMMEMORATIVE PLAQUE, CASTLE MILL BRIDGE, BRONYGARTH, NEAR CHIRK, Royal Commission for the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales] than a single battle. The main reasonably contemporary source for events in the Ceiriog Valley is the Brut y Tywysogion, which was based on now-lost materials contemporary with the battle. After describing Henry's arrival at Oswestry and Owain's at Corwen, it states: Henry II had ordered woodsmen to clear trees from the area, allowing his forces to move more freely through the pass, or perhaps in an attempt to force the Welsh into open battle. The Welsh chronicles suggest Henry's army was ambushed, possibly close to a gap in Offa's Dyke, by Welsh skirmishers, who inflicted a number of casualties. The more detailed account given by Powel in 1584 claimed that the skirmish happened while Henry and his main army \\"laie at Oswestry\\" and involved only a group \\"sent to trie the passages\\".Mahler (1912) A History of Chirk Castle and Chirkland, p.23 It is unknown what sources Powel used for his information; he may have had access to oral traditions or manuscripts now lost. The Gwynedd chronicle O Oes Gwrtheyrn Gwrtheneu located this engagement at a place called \\"Coed Ceiriog\\"; Powel, writing several centuries later, was the first to identify it taking place at a narrow gap in \\"Offa's ditch, at the castle of Crogen\\". The name \\"Battle of Crogen\\" first appeared in 1778 in an account by Thomas Pennant: \\"This conflict is sometimes called the battle of Corwen; but with more propriety that of Crogen: for it happened beneath Castell Crogen, the present Chirk Castle\\". More recent scholarship has confirmed that the medieval \\"Castell Crogen\\" was in fact near Llandderfel: Pennant may have confused the name with the townships of Crogen Iddon and Crogen Wladys in the Ceiriog Valley. Some modern sources repeat a story that Hubert de St Clare, the Constable of Colchester Castle, sacrificed his own life when he threw himself in front of an arrow meant for Henry. This event in fact happened at the siege of Bridgnorth in 1155, the source of the confusion again being Powel, who inserted a passage from Holinshed's Chronicles into his account. Ffordd y Saeson, the ancient trackway above Tregeiriog along which Henry II's army was said to have attempted to reach Corwen in August 1165. Undeterred by their losses in the Ceiriog Valley, Henry's army continued into the Berwyns, possibly making for Corwen via a pass still known as the \\"English Road\\" (Ffordd y Saeson). While the mountains appeared easily passable in summer a spell of high winds and torrential rain, which made resupply impossible and caused men to start dying of exposure, forced Henry to retreat within a matter of days without bringing the main Welsh force to battle. The Brut y Tywysogion said that the army retreated after being \\"oppressed by a mighty tempest of wind and exceeding great torrents of rain\\":Jones (1955), p.147 Henry's supporter Gerald of Wales, in his Itinerarium Cambriae, gave the same story but added that Henry had also made the mistake of failing to listen to his local advisors. Aftermath Estimates of the losses suffered at Crogen vary; most modern historians consider them to have been relatively light. The place where the skirmishes occurred is called Adwy'r Beddau, \\"the Gap of the Graves\\": the dead were said to have been buried in the fosse of Offa's Dyke, at a spot where an account of 1697 claimed that graves were still visible.Simpson, T. (1837) Some Account of Llangollen and its Vicinity, etc London: Whittaker and Company, p.20An Inventory of Ancient Monuments in the County of Denbighshire (1914), Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, p.192 His attempt to deal with Owain and Rhys a failure, Henry returned to Shrewsbury and there ordered the blinding of twenty-two hostages held since the 1163 treaty, two of whom were Owain's sons. He then moved his army to Chester: the Welsh annals claimed that this was in order to wait for a fleet from Dublin, with whose rulers Henry had recently entered into a treaty,Duffy, p.136 but rather than continuing his campaign he abandoned the plan completely and returned to his court at Anjou. The collapse of such a well-financed and planned campaign was a considerable humiliation to Henry and an encouragement to his political opponents. Despite this, he was back on good terms with the princes of Powys within a year; both Owain Cyfeiliog and Iorwerth Goch were in friendly contact with Henry's court within months. By the following year, both Rhys ap Gruffydd and Owain Gwynedd had resumed attacks on the lands of the Norman marcher barons; Henry withdrew much of his support from the latter by the end of the decade, turning to diplomacy to deal with Gwynedd and Deheubarth. Rhys later met personally with Henry, and was within a few years confirmed in his possession of lands previously occupied by the Normans: he even later sent troops to aid Henry in Normandy, in effect becoming \\"one of the great feudatories of the Angevin empire\\".Carr, A. D. (1995) Medieval Wales Macmillan, p.45 It has been suggested that Henry's lack of support for the marcher barons after 1165 ultimately encouraged them to seek lands and opportunities elsewhere, contributing substantially to the subsequent Norman invasion of Ireland.Duffy, p.137 NotesExternal links * History of Chirk Category:Battles involving England Category:Battles involving Wales Category:Conflicts in 1165 Category:Henry II of England Category:1165 in Wales Category:England‚ÄìWales relations ","title":"Battle of Crogen"},{"id":"20782729","text":"David McFetteridge was a Scottish footballer.

Opsis () is the Greek word for spectacle in the theatre and performance. Its first use has been traced back to Aristotle's Poetics. It is now taken up by theatre critics, historians, and theorists to describe the mise en sc√®ne of a performance or theatrical event. Origins Opsis comes from the ancient Greek for \\"appearance, sight, view.\\"Oxford English Dictionary·ΩÑœàŒπœÇ entry in Liddell-Scott disctionary at the Perseus project The English word optic is derived from this word. Aristotle and the Greeks Aristotle's use of the term opsis, as Marvin Carlson points out, is the \\"final element of tragedy,\\" but the term \\"receive[d] no further consideration\\". Aristotle discusses opsis in book 6 of the poetics,Aristotle - Poetics, Translated by S. H. Butcher, with original Greek text but only goes as far as to suggest that \\"spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet\\". Contemporary theatre theory In Theories of the Theatre by Marvin Carlson, the word opsis is replaced with the English equivalent \\"spectacle,\\" but gives opsis/spectacle as much focus as Aristotle does in the Poetics; however, in Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis Opsis is listed in the \\"terms\\" section, and defined as: > that which is visible, offered to the [gaze], hence its connections with the > notions of spectacle and performance. In Aristotle's Poetics, spectacle is > one of the six constituent parts of tragedy, but ranks below others > considered to be more essential ... The place in theatre history assigned > subsequently to the opsis, to what we would now call the [mise-en-scene], > determined the mode of transmission and the overall meaning of the > performance. Opsis is a spectific feature of the performing arts. J. Michael Walton, in The Greek Sense of Theatre: Tragedy Reviewed, challenges the traditional assumptions about Ancient Greek theatre. He states that ‚Äúthe visual aspect of the Greek theatre has for so long taken second place to the spoken word...it is still the common belief that what was said in the Greek tragedies was more important than what was seen.‚Äù Walton's thesis suggests that Ancient theatre lacks evidence of original productions, but that the written text, in comparison, is more accessible, and as a result, has caused Ancient theatre critics to relegate spectacle/mise-en-sene/opsis to less important aspects of theatre than the spoken word. Ronald W. Vince, suggests that while it may > seem logical simply to recognize opsis as stage spectacle or the mise-en- > scene and so include it ‚Äî if anywhere ‚Äî in the vocabulary of performance > theory. But there is implied even in Aristotle's use of the term a possible > interpretation which would link opsis with the art of writing plays as well > as with the art of staging them.

Laurence Elvin. 1995 Life John Compton was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and then studied as an apprentice with Halmshaw & Sons in Birmingham. In 1898 he joined Brindley and Foster in Sheffield.Douglas Earl Bush, Richard Kassel, The organ: an encyclopedia. Routledge, 2006, p.122. Then he joined Charles Lloyd in Nottingham. He set up the business Musson & Compton in 1902 in Nottingham with James Frederick Musson. The partnership dissolved in 1904. In 1919, the business moved to workshops at Turnham Green Terrace, Chiswick, London, which had been vacated by August Gern. He occupied a new factory at Chase Road, Park Royal, North Acton, London in 1930. Compton worked primarily on electric- action pipe organs and electronic organs. Compton's first electronic instrument was the Melotone (a solo voice added to theatre organs); next came the Theatrone. The Electrone, an electrostatic tonewheel instrument introduced in 1938, evolved out of research by Leslie Bourn, an association begun in the 1920s. Throughout his organ-building career, John Compton was assisted by the very capable and inventive James Isaac Taylor, who spent his entire working life with the Compton firm prior to his death in 1958. John Compton also befriended a wealthy industrialist by the name of Albert Henry Midgley; one of the founders of C A Vanderwell, which was later to become CAV-Lucas Ltd; a major supplier of electrical equipment to the motor industry. Midgley was one of the most prolific inventors of his age, with over 900 inventions to his name and following a rift with C A V-Lucas,he was appointed Technical Director of the Compton firm soon after, in 1925. Midgley's genius in electrical engineering and mass-production techniques, helped the Compton firm to achieve an extraordinary level of productivity. The company were awarded many original patents in things ranging from simple organ mechanisms to the most complex, state of the art electronic and electrical inventions. Many of those patents show that Midgley was cited as the inventor. On 13 June 1940, during World War II, Compton was arrested while holidaying on the island of Capri, in Italy. He was interned as an enemy alien but spent much of his time restoring pipe organs, before being permitted to return to England. Compton died in 1957, and the business continued under the direction of his right-hand man, James I Taylor. Taylor died the year after in 1958, and the business was wound up around 1965. The pipe organ department was sold to Rushworth and Dreaper; the electronic department became Makin Organs. Compton organs Compton cinema organs, built by the John Compton Organ Company of Acton, were the most prevalent of theatre organs in the UK; 261 were installed in cinemas and theatres in the British Isles.

Biography Early life and education = A native of Markham, Illinois, McPherrin graduated from Hillcrest High School in Country Club Hills, Illinois. He then earned a bachelor's degree in radio and television from Butler University in Indianapolis, where he was president of Butler's chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity and where he participated on the school's swim team and worked on Butler's radio station, WAJC. = Professional career = McPherrin began his broadcasting career in 1977 at a television station in Davenport, Iowa, and then worked for TV stations in Quincy, Illinois, New Orleans, Denver and Atlanta.  WABC-TV  In 1984, McPherrin joined WABC-TV in New York City and became WABC's top sports anchor in 1986. McPherrin was on hand for the epic 16 inning long sixth game of the 1986 National League Championship Series between the New York Mets and Houston Astros (which was broadcast on ABC). Although the Astros wound up being eliminated following their 7-6 loss to the Mets in Game 6, Astros' ace pitcher Mike Scott was still named the NLCS' Most Valuable Player. McPherrin interviewed Scott following the trophy presentation. During the late 1980s, McPherrin delivered in-game updates during ABC's Monday Night Baseball and Thursday Night Baseball broadcasts. During the first season of ESPN Sunday Night Football (1987), the very first game of the package, between the New York Giants and New England Patriots, had WABCTV Sports; Marathon Mystery Unseen Willer (the American Broadcasting Company's flagship station out of New York City) produce a completely separate telecast from ESPN's (rather than an over-the-air station simply simulcasting ESPN's broadcast in the competing teams' home markets). The reason behind this was that WABC's union contract at the time, prohibited non-union workers, such as those at ESPN, from producing live events for WABC. As such, McPherrin would provide play-by-play while Monday Night Football's Frank Gifford and Lynn Swann would serve as his color commentators.  WBBM-TV and WFLD-TV (Chicago)  In 1991, McPherrin joined WBBM-TV in Chicago as the station's main sports anchor. He remained in that role until 1995, when he was bumped from being WBBM's lead sports anchor by the arrival of Tim Weigel. McPherrin then chose to leave WBBM-TV and join WFLD-TV in Chicago as its lead sports anchor.

(January 12, 1926 ‚Äì October 7, 2011) was a Hungarian- American cinematographer best known for his work on the cult film classic The Warriors. He earned Emmy nominations for The Man Without a Country in 1973 and TV miniseries Sh≈çgun in 1980. Early life (1926‚Äì1941) > I never believed I was anybody special. I still don't think so, nor did I > ever believe that anyone would give a hoot hearing about who I was, where I > came from, what I did at various stages of my life, and why. I am convinced > the world would function equally well, or equally badly, with or without me. > - Andrew Laszlo, Footnote to History, 2002 So begins a section of Andrew Laszlo's recount of his early years and speaks of the man who survived atrocities during that time and accomplished much in his later life. He was born L√°szl√≥ Andr√°s in 1926 in the vicinity of P√°pa, Hungary, the town where his family finally settled about the time that Andrew was three years old. Until World War II began to affect life in Hungary, his life was relatively carefree and was spent in relative comfort although the family had to move several times into smaller or bigger quarters depending on the financial circumstances of his father. He was close to his older brother, Alex, with whom he often dreamed up exciting adventures sometimes leading to catastrophe. Of his many early experiences, one that served as a prelude to later tragedies, was seeing the Graf Zeppelin fly over Papa. Inquiring about the symbol painted on the tail of the airship, Andrew's father said that it was a swastika. That is all he wanted to tell his young son at the time. Andrew Laszlo was an avid swimmer and skater during his early school years and became accomplished at fencing in high school. It was also during this time that his interest in photography began and led later to a small business printing photos for his classmates. In the late 1930s, Laszlo's father, Leslie (Hungarian: Laci), was called up to serve in the Hungarian Army. This effectively ruined his business, forcing Laszlo to learn the fine art of lampshade manufacture to help support the family. This was a successful undertaking even though Laszlo was still a full-time high school student. Then, as for everyone else, World War II turned everything up-side-down. The War Years (1941-1947) In June 1941, the Hungarian city of Kassa (today Ko≈°ice in Slovakia) was bombed by air. Although several theories are still debated about the real perpetrators, the Hungarian government used the incident as the reason for declaring war on the Soviet Union. From then on, Hungary was irreversibly tied to the Axis Powers and Germany/Hitler in particular. Anti-semitism that had been simmering for years now came to the fore in Hungary. In 1944, a part of Papa was turned into a Ghetto and all Jews were forced to move there, including the Laszlo family. In early June, Andrew was forced to join a Labor Camp and was taken there in a railroad cattle car. On June 29, his family (excepting his brother, Alex) was taken from Papa and sent to Auschwitz. Andrew was then taken to another labor camp in what is now Romania and put to work laying railroad track. After one more move to another camp, Andrew received a final postcard from his brother, Alex. Following an air raid on the labor camp, Andrew deserted and found his way to Budapest. After a short stay in City Park (Hungarian: Varosliget) he and hundreds of others were herded onto boxcars and sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. This was the winter of 1944. Here, he survived for months in an atmosphere of cold, starvation, beatings, outright murder, lice infestation and constant reminders of death. Near his 19th birthday, he spotted his Aunt Alice in the camp. She perished there not much later. In March 1945, with the pressure on the Germans in Norway increasing, Andrew was shipped to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt. Here, like thousands of others, he came down with typhoid fever. It was here that he was reunited with his father, someone he thought of as long dead. Finally, on May 8, 1945, Theresienstadt was liberated by the Soviet army. As part of returning to humanity, Andrew found a piano at the camp and asked his fellow Hungarian, pianist George Feyer, to play for the liberators and the liberated. On his return to Papa, he found the town to be a much different place, including it being run by the Soviet Army. Being entrepreneurial, he restarted his photography business with the Russian soldiers being great customers. After taking the final exam, Andrew got his high school diploma and then moved to Budapest where a job at the Hungarian Film Bureau was waiting for him. Unfortunately, this job was not very exciting and paid little. Andrew realized that it would take years for the Hungarian movie business to return to its former self and did not want to wait that long. So, he went back to Papa and began to plan for his immigration to the United States at the urging of his uncle, George Laszlo, who was already living in New York and was willing to sponsor him. He found his way to New York by way of Ulm, Germany, where he survived by selling American cigarettes (sent to him by Uncle George) to the locals. After a brief but obligatory stop in Frankfurt, Andrew was given the right to enter the United States. He did so on January 17, 1947, by walking down the gangplank of the SS Ernie Pyle after it had docked on the west side of Manhattan. He had turned 21 just five days earlier. Life and Career in the United States (1947-1996) On arrival, Andrew was taken under the wings of his Uncle, George Laszlo, who was a painter, inventor and lithographer already living in New York City. Andrew quickly adjusted to life in Manhattan. As he stated in his own words for the documentary Cinematographer Style: > My main objective was to keep my head above water, work and have enough > money to live, learn the language, the faster the better, because that was > the most essential element in getting work. Most importantly, I was trying > to get work that was in some ways connected with photography. For some time > I worked in the laboratory of a company that printed textiles and wallpaper > with a photographic process. I worked in the darkroom, as I put it, to keep > my fingers in the developer. At one time, I worked as a door-to-door baby > photographer. I had a camera and a few lights I could do the work with.

As I said earlier, the important thing is to stick with it. Shortly before his discharge from the US Army Signal Corps, Andrew married his New York-born sweetheart, Ann Granger. Soon, the family grew to three with the arrival of his first son, also named Andrew. With perseverance, he landed a job as a camera operator on The Phil Silvers Show. This was followed by a number of other TV shows, including Naked City where he served as the Director of Photography. With greater opportunities came the necessity to work on locations around the world. Resisting the temptation to move to Hollywood, Andrew settled with his family in the suburbs of New York where three more children (Jim, Jeffrey and Elizabeth) arrived in quick succession. Andrew started to work with TV personality Ed Sullivan in 1953 and filmed programs in Portugal, Alaska, and Ireland. In 1959, Ed 'kidnapped' Andrew to Havana, Cuba under the pretense that they would be filming a segment in the Dominican Republic. Ed's real goal was to do an interview with Fidel Castro who had just overthrown Fulgencio Batista's government. Ed, unfortunately, did not realize that the electrical system in Cuba would not support the camera equipment and lighting normally used in the United States. This created enormous technical issues for the crew with the possibility that the equipment could cause a blackout in the entire neighborhood. Somehow, the footage turned out OK if only passably so. In 1962, Andrew was offered his first feature film, One Potato, Two Potato, a controversial film about the interracial marriage of a black man and white divorcee. In 1966, he filmed Francis Ford Coppola's You're A Big Boy Now, with Geraldine Page receiving an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress. This was followed in 1968 by The Night They Raided Minsky's, a big-budget musical marred by the mid-production death of Bert Lahr. On August 15, 1965, The Beatles were scheduled to give a concert at Shea Stadium in New York City. Andrew took on this Ed Sullivan production with trepidation and excitement since it would be the first extremely large rock concert to be filmed for television. Even with careful preparation, the film crew was not prepared for the piercing screams of an audience made up of 56,000 teenagers. The sound system was completely overwhelmed, making it necessary to dub much of the song tracks in post-production. Nevertheless, and using 14 cameras scattered through the place, the crew managed to film not just the Beatles but much of the audience in the stands and the security detail that was hoping that a major stampede would not break out. When all was said and done, the crew had recorded over 200,000 feet of film of which only 10,800 made it into the finished documentary. As a long-lasting effect, Andrew's hearing was never to be normal again. In 1979, he filmed Walter Hill's cult film The Warriors. This movie gave Andrew the opportunity to devise several cinematic techniques, including the innovative lighting used for subway car interior shots. Musing in his 2000 book \\"Every Frame a Rembrandt,\\" he says: > If made today, The Warriors would probably be an altogether different movie. > The availability of fast and more sensitive, more forgiving negative and > positive film stocks, faster lenses in all focal ranges, smaller, more > powerful lights, electronic postproduction - all would add up to different > photographic techniques, which would negate the need for the same ingenuity > in dealing with the difficulties of cinematography in 1978. Returning to television, Andrew was the cinematographer on the 1980 five-part NBC miniseries Sh≈çgun starring Richard Chamberlain. Filmed entirely on location in Japan, the production had many difficulties including the challenge of conversation with and direction to actors and extras who spoke no English. An unfortunate but funny anecdote often retold by Andrew was the premature kickoff of a fierce action sequence in Osaka harbor including guns blazing, extras jumping into the water, bombs exploding and boats sinking everywhere. Unfortunately, the cameras were not rolling. The whole scene had to be reshot at great cost of time and money. The details of this incident are recalled in Adrew's book \\"It's a Wrap.\\" His last feature film Newsies, filmed in 1991, was about a newspaper delivery-boy's strike that took place in 1899. The film starred Christian Bale and Robert Duvall. Although the movie was a box-office flop, it gained a cult following and was turned into a stage musical at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. It will move to Broadway for a limited run from March to June, 2012. With Newsies in the can, Andrew decide that it was time to change his focus from TV and film production to teaching, fly-fishing, and woodworking. The Later Years (1996-2011) With the movie business behind him, Andrew spent his time giving lectures to film students throughout the United States. This gave him the opportunity to write two books about the art and science of cinematography. With a knack for storytelling and a great imagination, Andrew wrote and published several works of fiction. The Rat Catcher was published in 2004. A Fight of No Consequence appeared in 2006 and concerns an ex-fighter trying for a comeback. His experiences in Japan while filming Shogun, let to the writing of the fictional book Banjin\\". When not lecturing or writing, Andrew used his time on various wood- and metal-working projects. When visiting his ranch in Montana, he often took advantage of the first-class fly-fishing streams and rivers in the area. Above all else, he enjoyed spending time with his wife, children and grandchildren. After a sudden illness diagnosed mid-year, he died at his home on October 7, 2011, in Bozeman, Montana, age 85.

She sank on 4 June 1943, in the Mediterranean. Although the cause was speculated as a naval mine at the time of her sinking, it was later revealed that PC-496 had been sunk by an Italian submarine.  Construction  PC-496 was built by Leathem D. Smith Coal and Shipbuilding Co. in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, being laid down on 24 April 1941. She was launched on 22 November 1941 and commissioned on 26 February 1942 at New Orleans, Louisiana. She was assigned to the European Theater of Operations where she was destroyed by an Italian torpedo off the coast of Bizerte, Tunisia, on 4 June 1943.  Service history  After PC-496 was built in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, she traversed the Mississippi River to New Orleans where she received her commission and captain, Lieutenant James S. Dowdell, USNR. PC-496 underwent a brief training period at the Subchaser Training Center in Miami, Florida, before she was reassigned to convoy duties running out of Norfolk, Virginia. Her area of operation expanded to include escorting oil tankers between New York City and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba where British Royal Navy frigates would escort them the rest of the way to Recife, Brazil. PC-496 continued escorting convoys until she was tasked with escorting a convoy of LCIs to North Africa in April 1943. Upon arriving in North Africa she first made port in Beni Saf, Algeria, before moving east to Mers-el-Kebir and then to Arzew. PC-496 set out from Arzew towards Bizerte, but she never made it. On 4 June 1943, eight miles from Bizerte, a massive explosion ripped through the hull of PC-496 and she foundered in under a minute. Five members of the crew were killed in the explosion and subsequent foundering of the ship. The surviving crew members were rescued by allied ships in the area and transported to the American- occupied French naval base at La Pecherie, at Lake Bizerte, Tunisia.  Aftermath  The Navy reported that the cause of PC-496s foundering was due to underwater explosions or a single blast. The surviving crewmen remember it as a single explosion and believed it to most likely have been caused by an underwater mine. However, several years later, Second Class Yeoman Carter Barber, who had been on board PC-496 at the time, heard that the explosion was caused by a torpedo fired from an Italian submarine, the commander of which had mistaken PC-496 for a destroyer, and being later court-martialed for wasting a torpedo on such a small ship. Per naval documents in service records, one of the rescuing ships was U.S.S. SC-639 at Bizerte, Tunisia. The crew rescued 53 of the survivors of PC-496 per R.A.R. Pinkham, Lieut., USNR, Commanding.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 585. . Lymphangioma circumscriptum is the most common congenital lymphatic malformation. It is a benign condition and treatment is not required if the person who has it does not have symptoms from it. Signs and symptoms Lymphangioma circumscriptum is characterized by a rash on the skin featuring clear vesicles. The rash may be painful and is sometimes itchy. The vesicles often leak lymph and may bleed. The rash may appear similar to warts if the vesicles frequently break open. Diagnosis A biopsy of the affected skin and histological examination under the microscope is necessary to diagnose lymphangioma circumscriptum. =Differential diagnosis= Several other conditions may mimic lymphangioma circumscriptum. These conditions include infections such as an outbreak of herpes simplex, herpes simplex vegetans, molluscum contagiosum, verruca vulgaris, and condyloma acuminatum. Similarly, benign and cancerous non-infectious conditions may also present in a similar manner and include conditions such as angiokeratoma, dermatitis herpetiformis, hemangioma, epidermal nevus, lymphangiectasia, melanoma, angiosarcoma, and metastatic carcinomas. Treatment The condition is benign and does not require treatment if the affected person does not have symptoms. Lymphangioma circumscriptum is often treated when it causes troubling symptoms to the affected person (itching, pain) or due to concerns about its cosmetic appearance. Surgical removal (excision) of the affected layers of skin is the most common and effective treatment. Treatment with ablative carbon dioxide lasers is a less invasive method that can be used to improve the appearance of lymphangioma circumscriptum. These laser treatments require local anesthesia and may cause significant wounds.

Thomas played club rugby for Pontypool and county rugby for Monmouthshire. He won eight caps for Wales and played between 1909 and 1913, representing Wales during two Triple Crown winning seasons. Rugby career Thomas was first selected to play for Wales in a friendly game against France in 1909 as a prop forward. He was reselected for the next game which was against Ireland in the final match of the 1909 Home Nations Championship. The win over Ireland sealed a perfect tournament for Wales and made Thomas a Triple Crown tournament winner in his first competitive game. Thomas was not called upon for the 1910 Championship, but was back in the Wales team for the 1911 tournament. It was during the 1911 competition that Thomas scored his only points for Wales when he scored a try in the game against Scotland. A record eight tries were scored against Scotland by Wales, and Thomas was the only person not playing for Cardiff to score for the Welsh team in that game.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:15. Wales won all four of the games of the 1911 Championship giving Thomas his second Triple Crown win. Thomas played in two games of the 1912 Championship, both under the captaincy of Dicky Owen. The first was a loss to England at Twickenham, followed by a more convincing display and a win at St Helen's over Scotland. At the end of 1912, Thomas was selected to represent Monmouthshire against the touring South African team. Thomas was one of three capped players in the Monmouthshire team, the others were Newport's Reg Plummer and Abertillery's Jim Webb.Billot (1974), pg 77.

It was held in Coolum, Queensland, between 2 and 5 March 2002, and hosted by Prime Minister John Howard. Planned to have been hosted in Brisbane on 6 October 2001, the CHOGM was postponed only nine days before it was due to be held, on account of the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States. When the meeting was finally held, three issues loomed large on the agenda: security, the future of the Commonwealth, and (most prominently) Zimbabwe's upcoming presidential election. The meeting was attended by representatives of 51 countries out of the Commonwealth's 54 members (suspended member Pakistan was not invited, whilst Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada sent no representatives). Of those, 35 were represented by their head of state or head of government. Security Originally slated to be hosted in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory the plan was changed so it would be held in Brisbane on 6 October 2001, making it two years since the previous meeting. However, on 28 September, in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks, it was postponed, to allow for improved security. Instead of the October summit, the Heads of Government issued a statement on terrorism and established the Commonwealth Committee on Terrorism, which met on 29 January 2002, reported in March, and recommended annual reviews of the Commonwealth's counter-terrorism strategy. The postponement dealt a big blow to the Commonwealth, both in piling up costs on an already over-stretched budget and undermining the celebration and promotion of Commonwealth culture and values to Australia that the Heads of Government had hoped the CHOGM would be. The postponement ultimately raised questions of how credible and practical the CHOGM, and thus the present Commonwealth, could be. However, the civil society celebration went on as planned, except without the Heads of Government and media presence, and were deemed to be a great success, despite the surreal circumstances. The CHOGM itself was highly security-conscious, due to the concerns raised by the attacks. The hotel compound was ringed by an electric fence, whilst the media representatives were transported by coach between venues. Security, originally budgeted at A$11.4m, was ramped up to include 4,000 Queensland Police, 2,000 Australian Defence Force, and over 100 Federal Police personnel. This, combined with the presence of only 30 accredited NGO representatives, gave the entire CHOGM the feel of a 'retreat without a retreat', rather than accessible conference. Zimbabwe At the CHOGM, the Commonwealth made final arrangements for its election observer mission to Zimbabwe, which would consist of 42 observers and 19 staff from 26 countries. With the earlier withdrawal of the European Union's observers, the Commonwealth's delegation was to be the only fully international group judging the election's fairness. The CHOGM gave the 'troika' of Chairperson-in-Office John Howard, Thabo Mbeki, and Olusegun Obasanjo a mandate to assess whether the report of the observers met the Harare Declaration, and (if it didn't) the punishment under the Millbrook Programme. The observers' initial report was received by the troika on 14 March, and explicitly stated that 'conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow for free expression of will by the electors'. In response, the troika, announced on 19 March 2002 that Zimbabwe was to be suspended from the Commonwealth immediately. Two other countries that had been suspended were deemed to have shown progress. Fiji's suspension had been lifted by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) on 20 December 2001, allowing Fiji to take part in the CHOGM. Nevertheless, it would stay on the CMAG's agenda until Laisenia Qarase's government had been ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court. Even though Pakistan's suspension was not lifted in time for the CHOGM, the CMAG meeting on 30 January accepted Pervez Musharraf's plans for the elections in October, and recommended that the Commonwealth should send observers, with a view to lifting the suspension if the election was free of fraud or intimidation.

Copyright 1988 Santa Barbara Botanic Garden. . pp 43The Plant List (syn. C. pulchellus var. amabilis) is a species of the genus Calochortus in the family Liliaceae. It is also known by the common names Diogenes' lantern, yellow globe-tulip, golden globe-tulip, yellow globe lily, golden fairy lantern, golden lily-bell, Chinese lantern, and short lily. Distribution and habitat The plant is endemic to northern California, from the east bay [notably in Mount Diablo State Park ] and north of the San Francisco Bay Area.Flora of North America It grows in the Northern California Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains, from ‚Äì‚Äì in altitude. It is a common member of the scrub and woodland flora, found on dry slopes in California oak woodland and chaparral habitats. Soil types vary, from the nearly solid serpentine rock to yellow clay. Natural habitat is quite wet, with 75 cm or more of rain per year, followed by a dry, hot summer. Winters are cool but not frigid (USDA zones 8-9). The growing season is from midwinter to the April‚ÄìMay-June flowering and seed set. The plant is dormant from mid-June to November. Common understory plant associates are Calochortus luteus, Clarkia unguiculata and Delphinium variegatum. Description Calochortus amabilis is a bulbous perennial herb producing an upright, somewhat waxy branching stem to heights between 10 and 50 centimeters. The leaf at the base of the stem is flat, waxy, and narrow in shape, reaching up to 50 centimeters long and not withering away at flowering.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. GlobalTwitcher.com: Gold Nuggets: Calochortus luteus , ed. N. Stromberg. The inflorescence bears two or more heavily nodding flowers, each with spreading pointed yellow sepals and brown- speckled yellow petals. The inside of the petals is waxy and coated in small hairs. The fruit is a winged capsule up to three centimeters long containing dark brown seeds. *Height: 10- 20- 30- 50 cm (4‚Äì20 in) high at maturity. *Spread: 5 cm (2 in) spread. *Stems: Stems are glaucous, stout, flexuous, and generally branching, reaching 10- 20-30-50 cm. *Leaves: Leaves come in two types: cauline or basal (radical). **Basal/radical leaves: Basal leaves are shiny, lanceolate-acuminate, narrow, measure 20- 25- 50 cm in length, and are persistent through the bloom and early fruiting stage. **Cauline leaves: 2-4 laceolate to linear leaves, measuring 2‚Äì20 cm in length. *Inflorescences: Nodding, pendent flowers are borne in groups of 2-many, hanging in open branched clusters. Bracts are lanceolate, and measure 2‚Äì10 cm in length. **Flowers: Flowers measure about 2.5- 4 cm in length and are borne from April‚ÄìJune. **Perianth: Perianth is spheric and is either neatly closed at the tip or has petals that overlap slightly at the tip. ***Sepals: Three conspicuous ovate to lanceolate, spreading sepals, are deeply appressed at the base to the petals. Sepals are often tinged green or red, and measure 1.5- 2 cm long. Sepals are held horizontally to slightly descending. ***Petals: Three ovate or widely lanceolate petals with a short claw and obtuse apex are deeply to brightly yellow, sometimes tinged green with abaxial brown spots and are glabrous, except for the margins, which are densely ciliate (having a fringe of hairs), Petals are slightly longer than sepals and measure 1.6- 2 cm long. **Nectary: Crescent-shaped to almost rectangular, depressed, (forming a knoblike structure on the outside of each petal) with several transverse, fringed membranes with white or yellow glandular hairs measuring 1/3-2/3 of the width of the petals. **Stamens: ***Filaments: 5mm in length, dilated at the base. ***Anthers: 3-4mm in length, white to pale yellow. *Fruit: Nodding, oblong, winged capsule, measuring 2‚Äì3 cm in length. *Seeds: Dark brown and irregularly shaped. UsesFood= The bulbs of Calochortus amabilis are a traditional food of the Kashaya Pomo of California, who bake or boil the bulbs, which are then eaten like baked or boiled potatoes.University of Michigan at Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of Calochortus amabilis They are a beloved food of the Pomo, locally referred to as \\"bo\\". =Cultivation= Calochortus amabilis is cultivated as an ornamental plant by specialty native plant and bulb nurseries, for use in traditional and wildlife gardens, and natural landscaping projects. *Hardiness: Hardy, particularly if well mulched. In cold areas, it can be grown in an alpine house or an unheated glasshouse. *Light : Prefers sun to partial or full shade. *Soil: Adaptable, but prefers well-drained soil. Prefers a humus-rich, water-retentive medium with up to two thirds organic matter and one third sand, gravel, or grit. *Water: Drought tolerant to moderate. In the wild, the plant grows in areas with more than 2.5 cm of rain per week during the growing season. If grown in pots, plants should get 2.2-3.8 cm of water per week, since containers typically dry out more quickly. Complete dryness is needed for the dormant season; some growers dig the bulbs up for the summer to prevent premature autumn growth or bulb rot. *Propagation: Sow seed as soon as ripe. Seeds require no treatment to aid germination. *Pests and diseases: Trouble free. In the wild, C. amabilis naturally hybridizes with Calochortus tolmiei. Etymology Amabilis means 'pleasing', 'likeable', or 'lovely'. Calochortus is derived from Greek meaning 'beautiful grass', a reference to the characteristic grass-like foliage of the genus.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 44, 86 The full name translates literally to 'lovable, beautiful grass'.

History Georgia had gained its independence following the 1917 Russian Revolution; Poland, a year later, following World War I. Both countries had a history of problematic relations with their Russian neighbor.Wojciech Materski, \\"Polsko- Gruzi≈Ñski sojusz wojskowy\\" (\\"The Polish-Georgian Military Alliance\\"), Polityka: Wydanie Specjalne (Politics: Special Edition), 2/2008, ISSN 1730-0525, p. 69. Polish leader J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski wanted to create a large East- European Miƒôdzymorze federation for common defense. He saw Georgia as a possible candidate for such an alliance. Plans for a Polish diplomatic mission to the Caucasus, to the new countries of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, had been laid as early as April 1918 but began to be realized only in March 1920. By that time, a Polish brigade (Polska Oddzielna Brygada) had been formed of the Polish soldiers of the Russian army serving in the Caucasus. This brigade played an important role in keeping order at Tiflis, capital of the nascent Georgian republic. The brigade was disbanded under the German pressure in June 1918. Most of its personnel joined the Polish 4th Rifle Division of General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski in Odessa and then returned to Poland.WF Reddaway, JH Penson, O. Halecki, R. Dyboski (1980), The Cambridge History of Poland, p. 475. Cambridge University Press In 1920, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Stanis≈Çaw Patek sent a message to Georgia, proposing an exchange of diplomatic representatives and improved relations. The Georgians, threatened by Russian revolutionary factions and by Turkey, enthusiastically accepted the proposal. Soon after, Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tytus Filipowicz visited Tbilisi with a diplomatic mission. Plans for a Polish-Georgian military alliance were drafted to have included Polish aid (equipment and munitions) for the Georgian military. Before the treaty was ratified, the Red Army invaded Georgia. Deputy Minister Filipowicz (who had been named to be Polish ambassador to Georgia) was arrested in Baku, Azerbaijan, when the Red Army invaded that country about the same time. Polish personnel in Georgia, led by Wiktor Bia≈Çobrzeski, managed to create a provisional consular office before Georgia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1921. Aftermath After the Soviet invasion of Georgia, the good Polish-Georgian relations resulted in large-scale Georgian emigration to Poland. Among the Georgians who moved to Poland, were parents of general John Shalikashvili (the general himself was born in Warsaw). Poland aided Georgian pro-independence activists for many years. Several Georgian officers were enlisted in the Polish Army in the interbellum, with such names as Zakaria Bakradze, Alexandre Chkheidze, Ivane Kazbegi, Viktor Lomidze and Valerian Tevzadze. All Georgian officers were sharing the privileges of the military and enjoyed a good relationship with their Polish fellow officers.The Soldiers of Georgia in Polish Service (1923 - 1939), by Dmitri Shalikashvili See also *Miƒôdzymorze (Intermarum) *Prometheism *Polish-Romanian alliance *Polish-Ukrainian alliance *Georgian emigration in Poland NotesReferences * Wojciech Materski, \\"Polsko- gruzi≈Ñski sojusz wojskowy 1920\\" (\\"The 1920 Polish-Georgian Military Alliance\\"), in Andrzej Koryn, ed., Wojna polsko-sowiecka 1920 roku: przebieg walk i t≈Ço miƒôdzynarodowe: materia≈Çy sesji naukowej w Instytucie Historii PAN, 1-2 pa≈∫dziernika 1990 (The 1920 Polish-Soviet War: Course and International Backdrop: Materials of a Conference at the Polish Academy of Sciences Institute of History, October 1‚Äì2, 1990), Wydawnictwo Instytutu Historii PAN (Publications of the Polish Academy of Sciences Institute of History), 1991, , pp. 203‚Äì209. *Rukkas, Andriy (2001), \\"Georgian Servicemen in the Polish Armed Forces (1922‚Äì39)\\".

It is not long before the children realise they are part of an experiment initiated by the school. The objective is to show how damaged children can be saved and converted into fine citizens.

He is a borderline case, along with Katarina, whose parents both died in the past year, and August, who is severely disturbed after killing his abusive parents.

It is now part of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. It should not to be confused with Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, which is also based in Greater Manchester. Management In 2014, Dr. Fairfield, the Chief Executive of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust moved to the trust on the retirement of John Saxby. In April 2016, Sir David Dalton was appointed to take over the leadership of the trust and the functions of the board were taken over by directors from Salford Royal Foundation Trust, although Pennine Acute still had a legal existence. In 2020, it became necessary to re-establish the board because of complexities involved in formally transferring its assets to other trusts. It was intended to disband it by April 2020. The hospitals in Oldham, Bury and Rochdale would continue to be run by Salford, while North Manchester hospital would be run by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust under a management agreement. The other trusts are resisting taking over the liabilities associated with these hospitals, and North Manchester is said to require rebuilding at a cost of around ¬£500 million. The re-established board will not be involved in the management of the hospitals. =Northern Care Alliance= In December 2017, it was announced that the trust was to form a new healthcare organisation by combining with Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. The new organisation, the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group would have 17,000 staff, and a combined operating budget of ¬£1.3bn covering Oldham, Bury and Rochdale, and Salford. North Manchester General Hospital would be taken over by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. In April 2019, Raj Jain became chief executive of Northern Care Alliance NHS Group and of Pennine Acute Trust. The Alliance is Greater Manchester‚Äôs first Global Digital Exemplar Fast Follower organisation, investing ¬£10 million in digital technology for patient care systems across its hospitals in Bury, Oldham, Rochdale and North Manchester which will replicate projects already deployed at the Salford trust, including an online appointment management system for patients. In 2019 the trust had 650 physical and virtual servers and more than 30 clinical systems, some of which had proved increasingly unreliable. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust was highly commended in the progressive research culture category at the Health Service Journal Awards 2012 and has seen a large increase in recruitment to clinical trials. The trust did poorly in the Friends and Family Test in March 2013, with 48% of staff saying they would not recommend their workplace to relatives and friends, placing it in the bottom 20 in England. The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/2015 winter. In December 2015, it was reported that the trust envisaged moving all non-elective surgery away from North Manchester General Hospital as a result of the decision to centralise emergency surgery on 4 sites in the conurbation. In the last quarter of 2015 it had one of the worst performances of any hospital in England against the four hour waiting target. In March 2016, at least 70 emergency patients at the trust waited more than 12 hours to be allocated a bed. This was the highest figure for any trust in England. In 2016/2017, it had 786 cases where patients waited more than 12 hours to be admitted to a ward, about a quarter of the total for England, mostly at North Manchester General Hospital. There were 200 cases the previous year.

History The organization was founded in 1891 by Flora McFarlane. Charter members included women from the pioneering families of Coconut Grove, and included Mrs. Kirk Munroe, Mrs. Joseph Frow, Mrs. Charles Peacock, Mrs. Charles John Peacock and Mrs. Benjamin Newbold. The first meeting of the Woman's Club of Coconut Grove was called to order on February 19, 1891, with the primary purpose of improving life for members of the community. An integral part of the group's mission was to expand education though an emphasis on literacy. The Woman's Club of Coconut Grove was the first federated woman's club established in the State of Florida. In 1957, Housekeeper's Club of Coconut Grove members officially changed the name of the organization to the Woman's Club of Coconut Grove. =The First Coconut Grove Schoolhouse= The first public school building in Miami-Dade county, built in 1889, was the site of the group's first meeting. Members of the Housekeepers Club of Coconut Grove raised the funds necessary to build the schoolhouse, which also served as the community's Sunday School site. The building was the area's only public school until 1894, until a larger school was constructed, and the one-room building was abandoned. =Pine Needles Club= An offshoot of the original Housekeepers Club of Coconut Grove, the Pine Needles Club offered young girls an opportunity to congregate, and discuss literature of present and past. The club was founded in 1895, in an effort to foster a spirit of community in the South Florida area. Mary Barr Munroe, wife of pioneer and author Kirk Munroe, gathered area girls for weekly outdoors readings of adventure novels, often those on the subjects of Seminole Indians and the Florida Everglades. =Coconut Grove Library= Founder Mary Barr Munroe, alongside Pine Needles Club members, worked to establish the first lending library in the City of Miami, operating out of donated space above an area general store. An 1895 donation of reading materials by frequent South Florida visitor, Louise Carnegie, and wife of Steel tycoon, Andrew Carnegie, enabled the Club to establish what became known as the Coconut Grove Reading Room. The Coconut Grove Reading Room collection grew exponentially. Housekeepers Club and Pine Needles Club members were eventually able to raise the funds required to erect the very first branch of the Miami-Dade Public Library System, known as the Coconut Grove Library. The branch, completed and open for business in 1901, was built upon land donated by fellow Coconut Grove pioneer, Ralph Munroe. Club Activities Numerous environmental, social, and educational endeavors have been carried out by Housekeepers Club of Coconut Grove members. =Environmental= In 1905, as part of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs, Housekeeper Club members embarked on an endeavor to establish protective status for nearly 2,000 acres of land in Paradise Key, a valuable ecosystem, part of the Florida Everglades. By 1915, their efforts were rewarded by the State of Florida, with the creation of the Royal Palm State Park. Housekeepers Club members also spoke out against the slaughter of egrets, which was commonplace at the time. =Social= Social advocacy was a central focus of the Housekeepers Club of Coconut Grove. Group members acted in support of Seminole Indian tribes, who remained exploited to a great extent. The group participated in the delivery of humanitarian aid, working in conjunction with the American Red Cross in times of disaster or crisis. In June 1923, in an effort to continue the support of positive female role models in a rapidly changing United States, the organization sponsored the first Girl Scout of America troop in southeast Florida. Troop I nicknamed themselves \\"The Alligators.\\" =Educational= In 1921, in an effort to promote community unity, the Housekeepers Club of Coconut Grove founded a community fine arts board. The board's intent also included promoting an appreciation for theatre and pageantry. The outdoor performances allowed amateur actors from the community a creative outlet, and created a steady flow of funds with which outreach activities may be carried out. Architecture The group eventually moved into a building designed expressly for members by renowned architect Walter de Garmo. Construction was completed in 1921. The building was constructed with materials such as oolitic limestone, concrete, stone, and stucco. The rectangular building features a curvilinear gable roof, and wrap-around porch, with a series of recessed, semicircular arches. On March 26, 1975, the site was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places. Present Day The oldest civic group in Miami-Dade County, the Woman's Club of Coconut Grove, though its collection of active, associate, and lifetime dues, performs regular outreach projects, and awards annual scholarships to females exhibiting outstanding community leadership skills. In the spirit of the group's original motto, \\"Lend a Hand,\\" the Women's Club has supported numerous organization over the last decades, including Casa Valentina, Cancer Survivors, Hacienda Girls‚Äô Ranch, Canine Companions, Heifer International, Miami-Dade Public Library System, as well as Miami-Dade County Public Schools.

Australia was a landmark human rights complaint brought before the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) by Tasmanian resident Nicholas Toonen in 1994. The case resulted in the repeal of Australia's last sodomy laws when the Committee held that sexual orientation was included in the antidiscrimination provisions as a protected status under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In 1991, Toonen complained to the Human Rights Committee that Tasmanian laws criminalising consensual sex between adult males in private were a violation of his right to privacy under Article 17 of ICCPR; distinguished between people on the basis of sexual activity, sexual orientation and identity in violation of Article 26; and meant that gay men in Tasmania were unequal before the law. As a result of his complaint, Toonen lost his job as General Manager of the Tasmanian AIDS Council, because the Tasmanian Government threatened to withdraw the council's funding unless Toonen was fired. On 31 March 1994, the Committee agreed that, because of Tasmania's law, Australia was in breach of the obligations under the treaty. In response, the Commonwealth Government passed a law overriding Tasmania's criminalization of gay sex, Australia's last sodomy laws. The Toonen decision has subsequently been referenced by the committee and by other treaty bodies in making rulings. Sodomy laws in Australia Australia inherited the United Kingdom's sodomy laws on white colonisation after 1788. These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial parliaments during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after Federation. Following the Wolfenden report, the Dunstan Labor government in South Australia introduced a \\"consenting adults in private\\" defence in 1972. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former Defence Minister Robert Hill, and repealed the state's sodomy law in 1975. The Campaign Against Moral Persecution during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990. The exceptions were Tasmania and Queensland. Male homosexuality (i.e., sodomy) was decriminalised in South Australia in 1975, and in the Australian Capital Territory in 1976, followed by Victoria in 1980, and New South Wales and the Northern Territory in 1984. Western Australia did the same in 1989.Law Reform (Decriminalization of Sodomy) Act 1989 The states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws later began to repeal them: Western Australia did so in 2002, and New South Wales and the Northern Territory did so in 2003. Tasmania decriminalised sodomy in 1997Criminal Code Amendment Act 1997, AustLII following the High Court case Croome v Tasmania. Background to the case In 1991, Nicholas Toonen, a gay activist, challenged two provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code: Sections 122(a) and (c), and 123, which criminalized all forms of sexual contact between consenting adult men in private, arguing that their continued existence in the Criminal Code of Tasmania had a profound and harmful impact on many Tasmanian people by fueling discrimination, harassment, and violence against gay and lesbian Tasmanians. According to Toonen's submission to the committee, the laws > empower Tasmanian police officers to investigate intimate aspects of his > private life and to detain him, if they have reason to believe that he is > involved in sexual activities which contravene the above sections. He adds > that the Director of Public Prosecutions announced, in August 1988, that > proceedings pursuant to Sections 122(a), (c) and 123 would be initiated if > there was sufficient evidence of the commission of a crime. Although in practice the Tasmanian police had not charged anyone under Section 122 with \\"unnatural sexual intercourse\\" or \\"intercourse against nature,\\" or under Section 123 with \\"indecent practice between male persons\\" for several years, Toonen argued that because of his high-profile activism, his activities as an HIV/AIDS worker, and his long-term relationship with another man, his private life and liberty were threatened by the continued existence of these laws. He additionally argued that the laws restricted him from \\"openly exposing his sexuality\\" and publicizing his views on law reform as this would have been \\"prejudicial to his employment,\\" contending that the Sections \\"created the conditions for discrimination in employment, constant stigmatization, vilification, threats of physical violence and the violation of basic democratic rights.\\" Toonen further complained that Tasmanian \\"figures of authority\\" (such as members of the Lower House of Parliament; municipal councillors; clergy and the general public) were known to openly make derogatory remarks about gays and lesbians, including statements such as \\"representatives of the gay community are no better than Saddam Hussein\\"; \\"the act of homosexuality is unacceptable in any society, let alone a civilized society\\"; and \\"you are 15 times more likely to be murdered by a homosexual than a heterosexual\\". Some had further suggested that all Tasmanian homosexuals should be exiled to an uninhabited island or be subjected to compulsory sterilization. This, claimed Toonen, constituted a \\"campaign of official and unofficial hatred\\" against gays and lesbians, and made it difficult for the Tasmanian Gay Law Reform Group to disseminate information about its activities and advocate the decriminalization of homosexuality. Complaint Toonen alleged that Sections 122 (a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code violated articles 2(1), 17 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because: > (a) they do not distinguish between sexual activity in private and sexual > activity in public and bring private activity into the public domain. In > their enforcement, these provisions result in a violation of the right to > privacy, since they enable the police to enter a household on the mere > suspicion that two consenting adult homosexual men may be committing a > criminal offence. Given the stigma attached to homosexuality in Australian > society (and especially in Tasmania), the violation of the right to privacy > may lead to unlawful attacks on the honour and the reputation of the > individuals concerned. > (b) they distinguish between individuals in the exercise of their right to > privacy on the basis of sexual activity, sexual orientation and sexual > identity, and > (c) the Tasmanian Criminal Code does not outlaw any form of homosexual > activity between consenting homosexual women in private and only some forms > of consenting heterosexual activity between adult men and women in private. > That the laws in question are not currently enforced by the judicial > authorities of Tasmania should not be taken to mean that homosexual men in > Tasmania enjoy effective equality under the law. The remedy requested by Toonen was the repeal of these provisions. Decision regarding admissibility of the complaint In considering the admissibility of the complaint, the Committee determined that the author (Toonen) could be deemed a \\"victim\\" within the meaning of article 1 of the Optional Protocol, and that his claims were admissible ratione temporis (within the temporal jurisdiction of the committee). The communication was declared admissible on 5 November 1992. Australian federal and state response In its response, the federal government of Australia conceded that Toonen had been a victim of arbitrary interference with his privacy, that he was personally and actually affected by the laws challenged by him, and that the laws could not be justified on public health or moral grounds, but noted that the government of Tasmania denied that he had been the victim of a violation of the Covenant. The federal government noted that, while the state pointed out that no prosecutions or investigations had been made under the relevant Sections since 1984, the risk of prosecution or investigation remained. The government of Tasmania argued that the retention of the Sections in question was justified and partly motivated by an effort to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS in the state, and that the laws were further justified on moral grounds; the federal government did not accept either claim, noting that laws against homosexuality in all other parts of Australia had been repealed, and that discrimination on the basis of sexuality was unlawful in three of six Australian states and the two self-governing internal Australian territories. The federal government requested the committee's guidance in interpreting whether sexual orientation could be subsumed under the term \\"... or other status\\" in article 26, requiring examination of the issues of: * whether Tasmanian laws drew a distinction on the basis of sex or sexual orientation; * whether Toonen was a victim of discrimination; * whether there were reasonable and objective criteria for the distinction; and * whether Tasmanian laws were a proportional means to achieve a legitimate aim under the Covenant. Decision The Committee found that adult consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of \\"privacy\\", and that Toonen was affected by the continued existence of the Tasmanian laws, which continuously and directly interfered with his privacy, despite their lack of recent enforcement. The Committee noted that \\"the criminalization of homosexual practices cannot be considered a reasonable means or proportionate measure to achieve the aim of preventing the spread of AIDS/HIV\\", further noting that \\"The Australian Government observes that statutes criminalizing homosexual activity tend to impede public health programmes by driving underground many of the people at the risk of infection.\\" The Committee found that the Sections did not meet the \\"reasonableness\\" test in the circumstances of the case, and that they arbitrarily interfered with Toonen's right under article 17, paragraph 1. As regards the guidance sought by the Australian government as to whether sexual orientation may be considered an \\"other status\\" for the purposes of article 26, the Committee found the reference to \\"sex\\" in article 26 is to be taken as including sexual orientation. The Human Rights Committee therefore found that the facts before it revealed a violation of articles 17, paragraph 1, juncto 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. The author was entitled to a remedy under article 2(3)(a) of the Covenant, and the opinion of the committee was that an effective remedy would be the repeal of Sections 122(a), (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code, and requested a response from the Federal government in 90 days. =Appendix to the decision= Committee member Bertil Wennergren submitted an appendix to the decision, in which he disagreed with the committee's view that it was unnecessary to consider whether there had also been a violation of article 26 of the Covenant. In his opinion, a finding of a violation of article 17, paragraph 1, should rather have been deduced from a finding of violation of article 26. Wennergren argued that the criminalization of certain behaviours under Sections 122(a), (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code must be considered incompatible with article 26 of the Covenant (a) made a distinction between heterosexuals and homosexuals, and (b) criminalized sexual contacts between consenting men without at the same time criminalizing such contacts between consenting women, thereby setting aside the principle of equality before the law, in violation of article 26: > The discriminatory criminal legislation at issue here is not strictly > speaking \\"unlawful\\" but it is incompatible with the Covenant, as it limits > the right to equality before the law. In my view, the criminalization > operating under Sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code > interferes with privacy to an unjustifiable extent and, therefore, also > constitutes a violation of article 17, paragraph 1 . . . I share the > Committee's opinion that an effective remedy would be the repeal of Sections > 122(a), (c) and 123, of the Tasmanian Criminal Code. Result In response to the Tasmanian Parliament's refusal to repeal the offending laws, the Federal government passed the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994 - Section 4, legalising sexual activity between consenting adults throughout Australia and prohibiting the making of laws that arbitrarily interfere with the sexual conduct of adults in private. In 1997 in the case of Croome v Tasmania, Croome applied to the High Court of Australia for a ruling as to whether the Tasmanian laws were inconsistent with the Federal Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act. The Tasmanian Government repealed the relevant Criminal Code provisions after failing in its attempts to have the matter struck out. According to Nick Poynder in a public lecture presented at Monash University's Castan Centre for Human Rights Law in Melbourne on 28 April 2003, the committee's views are \\"widely published and carry significant moral and persuasive authority\\": > There is no doubt . . . that the UNHRC's views in Toonen v Australia, that > Tasmania's anti-homosexual laws were in breach of Article 17 of the ICCPR . > . . led directly to the enactment by the Australian Parliament of > legislation rendering those laws ineffective. According to Justice Michael Kirby, in a speech given on the 2004 bicentenary of Tasmania, the changes in law resulted in Tasmania becoming \\"one of the most enlightened\\" Australian states: > Early leadership was given by the Tasmania Police. It was followed by the > Health Department, concerned to respond strongly to HIV/AIDS. An education > reference group was established to turn around earlier policy and to combat > homophobia in Tasmanian schools. Soon a programme was instituted to remove > sexuality discrimination entirely from Tasmanian law and official practice. > Tourism Tasmania even dedicated resources to promoting the State as a place > friendly to gay visitors. For those who knew the whole history, this was > truly a story of amazing Tasmania. Whereas in 1988, support for > decriminalisation of homosexuality in this State had been 15% below the > national average, by the time decriminalisation occurred in 1997, it was 15% > above the average. Indeed, it was reportedly higher in Hobart than in > Melbourne or Sydney. This case law Toonen v.

Flaminio Scala, the leader of the troupe, begins the story, transporting us back to a beautiful spring day in Venice. Suddenly, we are on a piazza, as the Glorious Ones, set up a stage and introduce us to their bawdy style of comedy. (\\"The Glorious Ones\\"). They tell us that much of their comic routines were improvised, and Flaminio Scala illustrates with a slapstick version of his early life, in which he demonstrates how he was raised by monks and later thrown onto the street. There, the endless parade of humanity inspires him to create a new kind of theater--masked the Commedia dell'arte. We meet Armanda Ragusa, a dwarf, who is madly in love with the dashing Flaminio. She steals little mementos of her idol--his lost buttons, one of his old stockings, posters, etc.--and keeps them in a sack under her bed. She and Flaminio rehearse a comic sketch about a little dog. They are interrupted by the leading lady, Columbina, who is Flaminio's mistress. She is sick of waiting for him and sick of his antics. (\\"Making Love.\\") By the time the number is over, he has seduced her once again. We next meet Pantalone, who was once a tailor but now plays the roles of the old misers in the troupe's plays. (\\"Pantalone Alone.\\") He and Armanda commiserate about their lovelorn states (\\"The Comedy of Love\\"). Dottore Graziano, the \\"quack doctor\\" in their skits, has sold Pantalone a love elixir, but it hasn't worked--Columbina still doesn't love him. Their backstage dilemmas are mirrored onstage in a comic show-within-the show, \\"The Comedy of Love,\\" in which Flaminio Scala always gets the girl, after almost committing comic suicide with a rubber sword. The next day, Flaminio Scala discovers Francesco Andreini, a talented young comic, who is performing on the street. Flaminio takes him under his wing, (\\"The Glorious Ones - Reprise\\") and before long they are like father and son. Flaminio teaches Francesco what it means to be an actor (\\"Madness to Act\\") but Francesco lets us know that he's more ambitious than he may appear. (\\"Absalom.\\") During the course of this song, Flaminio gets an idea from the many patches on Francesco's clothes--he creates a patchwork costume for a new character--Arlecchino, the clown--and gives his young protege this featured role. The quack Dottore tries frantically to get onto the stage but is prevented by an invisible wall. In mime, he manages to find a way to get through, and then happily insults the audience in Latin. At last he introduces the next adventure for The Glorious Ones--\\"The Invitation to France,\\" and they embark on a whirlwind trip, filled with travails, to perform for the French Court (\\"Flaminio Scala's Historical Journey to France\\"). Flaminio is convinced that their lowbrow humor will enchant the King, make their fortunes, and cement his reputation as a theatrical genius for all time. Once in France, their performance for the King begins with three vulgar \\"lazzi\\" or comic routines, which lead up to the most bawdy piece of all, \\"Armanda's Tarantella,\\" featuring the little dwarf, all the men, and a series of double- entendres!. But instead of glory and fame, the response of the religious court is to throw them out of France. Flaminio is angry and humiliated before his troupe, but rallies them to his side once again with his artistic vision. (\\"Improvisation.\\") The only one not convinced is Francesco. Lights come up on a beautiful young noblewoman named Isabella. We learn that she writes stories against her parent's wishes. (\\"The World She Writes.\\") Francesco notices her and gets her to come down from her balcony. She shows him a play she has written, \\"The Moon Woman,\\" and soon they have discovered they are kindred spirits, born to play \\"Opposite You.\\" They elope, and Isabella joins the troupe. All the men are enamored of her. Armanda is jealous, but Columbina understands how men are. In \\"My Body Wasn't Why,\\" she sings about her passionate love affair with Flaminio, which led her to be his leading lady. But during the course of the song, Flaminio tells her she is now too old to play that role, that he is giving it to the fresh-faced Isabella. Columbina must settle for the role of the comic maid. The Glorious Ones perform the second play-within-a play. It is still \\"The Comedy of Love,\\" Flaminio is still the leading man who nearly kills himself, but now Isabella is the leading lady. During the performance, Isabella and her husband Francesco play a trick on Flaminio, and suddenly the clownish Arlechino becomes the leading man. After the show, Flaminio is furious at the trick, but Columbina tells him to deal with the fact that he's too old to play the role of the lover. She had to. Flaminio has \\"Flaminio Scala's Ominous Dream\\" in which he fantasizes that Isabella and Francesco are leading him astray and trying to destroy him. The actors tease each other backstage. Francesco presents Isabella's play to them, and suggests they try it, implying that their roles will be fuller than the stereotypes they play every night. Flaminio is drunk and enraged by this challenge to his authority. But the troupe votes to try the new play. In his drunken state Flaminio sees the troupe mocking him and deriding his \\"Rise and Fall.\\" But in the end, he goes along with it, agreeing to play the grotesque, comic character of Captain Spavento. Before the performance of \\"The Moon Woman,\\" Columbina and Flaminio prepare to go onstage. Flaminio is depressed, but Columbina suggests maybe they should finally retire and settle down together. \\"There's more to life than theater,\\" she tells him, and he seems to agree. The Glorious Ones present \\"The Moon Woman,\\" now dressed in more elegant masks and costumes. The play is stilted and poetic, nothing like their old, freewheeling slapstick. Flaminio tries to play his part, but can't. He throws off his mask and begins to improvise. The cast can't help themselves--they join him. At last, he pretends to kill himself for love as he always did, staggers around and falls. Columbina falls to her knees, praying comically for him, but suddenly realizes that the blood is real and that Flaminio is indeed dead. As the actors grieve, mystified by his terrible act, Flaminio rises and looks back on his life, and the beauty of doing something of worth. (\\"I Was Here\\"). Armanda arrives at the monastery where Flaminio was raised, bringing with her \\"Armanda's Sack.\\" One by one, all the Glorious Ones light up, remembering their glory days in the theater with Flaminio Scala. At last, they arrive in Heaven, where Flaminio awaits them, and we are back to our opening image--stars, clouds, a little stage. They look down through a window in the sky, and see Armanda's sack being disposed of. But they are not forgotten. Instead, a \\"film projector\\" begins to flicker, and they see a parade of comic icons--Lucille Ball, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, etc--they realize their comedy has survived the centuries and exists today. The curtain closes as the Glorious Ones explode into joyous peals of laughter.

It was presented by Dave Fanning, with Bianca Luykx, although Ray D'Arcy (who was known at the time for working weekdays on the children's television programme The Den) was once said to have done a summer show to allow Fanning to spend more time with his family, being referred to as \\"Dave\\" \\"about a dozen times\\". The programme was essentially a continuation of Ian Dempsey's The Beatbox, which (also as a TV and radio \\"simulcast\\") had occupied 2TV's Sunday morning time-slot for the previous number of years. In 2000, Fanning admitted that he did no work on the show and that he did not like most of the music he played on it. This was not however the reason for its cancellation as he also said he would continue presenting it. Fanning described it as \\"not rocket science, it's moron television\\", saying he \\"hardly even knew where the 2TV office was, and that's God's honest truth\\". originally published in the Sunday Mirror Promotions for the show were created by a Swede, Jorgen Andreason, who had ten years experience at Swedish Television before moving to Ireland.

He was also a noted linguist and pacifist. He was born in Pyongyang, North Korea, on November 13, 1908. His life had been tough during Japanese colonial era from 1910 to 1945 and a sudden attack took away his life on October 6, 1950. He graduated from Kagoshima college and Keijo Imperial University in Japan in 1929 and became a high school biology teacher. From that time, he dedicated his life to butterflies, Esperanto, and Jeju research. Korean people call him Korean Fabre, lightening his brilliant achievements in the dark period. Main scientific work Japanese scientists said that there were 844 species of Korean butterflies but he made a great effort to collect 167,847 of cabbage butterflies throughout the Korean peninsular and compared their patterns and measured the length of front wings with a ruler by himself. He drew a conclusion that even though the wing patterns are different, they might not be different species and got rid of many wrong scientific names posted by Japanese prematurely and proved that they are individually changed adapting to surroundings and classified Chosun butterflies into 244 species. He longed for Chosun independence so he set the first stone for the classification of Chosun butterflies through his enormous samples he labeled butterflies Korean name and add seok. Especially he named an undiscovered butterfly Mt Jiri Palang butterfly for the first time in the world. In 1940 A Synonymic list of butterflies of Korea was published by The Korea Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. It was the first time for a Korean to be sponsored by the British Royal academy. After that, he was selected as a regular member of world entomology. Throughout his entire life, he had collected 750,000 butterflies samples and sorted and marked the locations on the Korean maps and world maps each way. When the Korean War broke out, he tried hard to keep his samples and maps so he couldn't escape Seoul. Unfortunately, his collections were totally burnt. With his sister's brave efforts of carrying the maps on her back, the distribution maps of Korean butterflies by Sok, Chumyong, in 1973 was safely released in the world after his death. The book is made of 500 maps with red mark with accuracy. Due to his research of Korean butterflies, modern entomology on butterfly has been being studied by a great number of scholars in the field. Later activities and death He wrote a small dictionary Lernolibro de Esperato Kun Vortaeto 1947 because he was deeply involved in international peace movement to resist Japanese imperialism. He didn't change his Korean name into Japanese name until liberation. He voluntarily transferred to the Jeju natural medicine laboratory in Seogwipo, Jeju Island in 1943. While he had been working here for two years, he was fascinated by particularity of Jeju culture and absorbed in Jeju exploration. Six general books: Jeju dialect, Jeju population, Jeju document, Jeju essay, history of Jeju insect, and Jeju data, were published. These are valuable resources for Jeju study. After liberation, he was in charge of zoology of the national museum. During the Korean War, he was mistaken as one of North Korea's People's Army and got shot by a drunken man, in front of a theater in Seoul while he was going to the national museum which was burnt by a bombing attack. It was said that just right before his death, he shouted \\"I know butterflies only!\\" Jeju Studies1. Relationship between Seok Jumyeong and Jeju Island= :According to the historical records, Seok Jumyeong has visited Jeju-island three times. On his first visit, he went to catch butterflies for specimens from July 21st, 1936, for a month. This is recorded in his own book, Zephyrus, vol 7, page 150 to 174. Next Visit was for working 2 years at a Research Institute of Herbal Medicine attached to Keij≈ç Imperial University( Hangul : Í≤ΩÏÑ±Ï†úÍµ≠ÎåÄÌïôÍµê Î∂ÄÏÜç ÏÉùÏïΩ Ïó∞Íµ¨ÏÜå Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑÏãúÌóòÏû• ). This is called as the Research Institute for Subtropical Agriculture and Biotechnology Jeju National University in these days. He started working since April 24th, 1943 and left Jeju-island in May, 1945. The last visit in February, 1948, he went a travel of entire Jeju-island. This period of time gets a lot of meaning in his Jeju studies. Because this visit was right before 4‚Ä§3 (April 3rd, 1948) Uprising in Jeju-island(Jeju uprising), so there were many traditional things of Jeju in nature and culture of Jeju Island at that period. Also, it was the prime peak of study in his life, it was the best time to collect data on the nature and humanities of Jeju-island. :By visiting Jeju-island three times, he had collected a lot of data about Jeju. Based on these data, he had left 17 books, more than 120 scholarly papers, and 180 articles (essays and articles). Among these, 6 books, and 27 scholarly papers, reports, essays are related to Jeju-island. He was both a globalist and a localist, and furthermore, he was a glocalist, naturally crossing over provinces and the world. =2. Jeju studies by Seok Jumyeong= :He has stayed in Jeju Island from July 21, 1936 to August 22, 1936, collecting butterflies for a month. Zephyrus, vol.7, 1937 is the typical record of it. According to the records of that period, we could confirm that his interest wasn‚Äôt just the collection of butterflies, also the Jeju Island's urban and rural areas such as Gappa Island and Seop Island, and the nature of Jeju Island like 500 Generals, Halla Garden and Sanjung River. :On his second visit, Seok Jumyeong left Jeju Island in May 1945 and analyzed the data in Gaeseong and Seoul and organized it into six volumes of the Jeju Island series(Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑÏ¥ùÏÑú). The plan to publish the Jeju Island series is well documented in the preface of the \\"Jeju Island Data Collection,\\" which he defected in June 1950. :Seok-Jumyeong wrote six books about Jeju Island. Of these books that have been issued since 1947, Jeju Island Dialect Vol. 1, Jeju Island Life Research Vol. 2, and Jeju Island-related Literature Vol. 3 were published by Seoul Newspaper during his lifetime. The purpose of this study is to review the significance of the publication of a series of studies on Jeju Island and the relationship between the book author\\"s Jeju Island studies and local research. Seok-Jumyeong read every resource on Jeju Island and thoroughly collected it in the course of writing his Jeju Island series. =3. Significance of Jeju Island series written by Seok Jumyeong= :A look at the contents of this series indicates its consideration allowing us to get a wide knowledge of its field, as it provides collected and integrated resources pertaining to the same kind of knowledge regardless of any trace containing any resource. In addition, this series enables us to carry out comparative studies by arranging similarities or differences so that we can contrast them simultaneously. In the situation prior to 1950,when the concept of local research was not yet established in our country, a Jeju Island series by JuMyoung-Seok contributed to founding local studies into a single integrated body of knowledge now referred to as the \\"Jejudo Study.\\" References Category:1908 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Entomologists Category:Korean scientists Category:Korean Esperantists Category:20th-century zoologists Category:20th-century Korean scientists ","title":"Seok Joo-myung"},{"id":"20783443","text":"Budslau (; ; ) is a village in Belarus.

The film was Sheng's first as a director, having previously served as a line producer for Chan and Jia Zhangke on films such as Durian Durian and Platform. Though primarily a mainland production, the film was financed in part by the Hong Kong-based See Movie Ltd. and was distributed by Hong Kong's Golden Network Asia.  Cast  * He Xingquan as Lao Li, a retired police officer living in Chongqing. * Guan Jiangge as Xiu'e, Lao Li's second wife. * Xu Tao as Xiaolei, Xiu'e's grown son from a previous marriage. * Liao Zhong as Jianjun, Lao Li's cab-driving son from his first marriage. * Wang Lan as Xiaohong, Jianjun's new wife. * He Qin as Qian Xue, an out-of-towner who catches the eye of Xiaolei.  Plot  Bliss tells the story of a modern and non-traditional family living in Chongqing. Lao Li (He Xingquan) is a once-divorced retired police officer, currently living with his second wife Zhang Xiu'e (Guan Jiangge). Lao Li's first wife ran off years ago, forcing him to raise his son, Jianjun alone. Jianjun (Liao Zhong), now a grown man, has recently married Xiaohong (Wang Lan) and works long hours as a taxi driver. A passive man, Jianjun and Xiaohong's marriage is suffering from his long hours and her resentments. She eventually begins an affair and becomes pregnant, though the father remains a mystery. Jianjun announces that the baby will be born when Xiaohong discovers that her condition was actually a false pregnancy, and that she has actually been diagnosed with uterine cancer. Meanwhile, Xiu'e's son from a previous marriage, the delinquent Xiaolei (Xu Tao) has begun to run with local hoodlums, much to the consternation of his mother and stepfather. Lao Li steps in and gets Xiaolei a job on a trolley-car, where he becomes interested in the pretty coworker, Qian Xue (He Qin). Unfortunately Xiaolei seems unable to escape from his life of petty crime. Into this drama, Lao Li receives an unexpected package, his first wife's ashes. Lao Li must now try to find a suitable burial place for the ashes, all while trying to keep his crumbling family together.  Background  The story of Bliss, which spans many years, evolved from an idea Sheng Zhimin developed while searching with his father for a proper burial place for his late mother. The experience of searching various graveyards throughout Beijing inspired Sheng to make a film \\"that spans from one's youth to their old age and it would be about life, youth and humanity.\\" Filming took place in the central Chinese city of Chongqing, where the city's seemingly constant fog and mist initially caused delays and problems to the production. Despite these problems, the mist would become one of the film's overriding themes.  Reception  Relatively little seen, the few critics who did manage to see the film at a film festival were kind to Sheng's debut work, seeing its depressing and misty story as a vehicle for the characters to express something broader about Chinese society. Though depressing, these critics nevertheless saw the film as an honest portrayal of modern Chinese \\"struggling to get by, with terribly little, materially or spiritually.\\" An exception was Variety critic Derek Elley, who saw the film's downbeat atmosphere as essentially a \\"remote intellectual exercise.\\" Many of these western reviews placed Sheng Zhimin's Bliss very much along the lines of other sixth generation filmmakers. In particular, the film was seen to reflect Jia Zhangke's Still Life for its realistic portrayal of modern life in China. Bliss premiered at the 2006 Locarno International Film Festival where it won the NETPAC award, and had its North American premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. It also screened at the 2007 Shanghai International Film Festival, where it picked up a best picture prize for the New Talent side-competition.

Landing minima are usually similar to those of a Cat I instrument landing system (ILS), that is, a decision height of and visibility of 800 m. Lateral guidance is equivalent to a localizer, and uses a ground- independent electronic glide path. Thus, the Decision Altitude, DA, can be as low as 200 feet. An LPV approach is an approach with vertical guidance, APV, to distinguish it from a precision approach, PA, or a non-precision approach, NPA. WAAS criteria includes a vertical alarm limit more than 12 m, but less than 50 m, yet an LPV does not meet the ICAO Annex 10 precision approach standard. Examples of receivers providing LPV capability include (from Garmin) the GTN 7xx & 6xx, GNS 480, GNS 430W & 530W, and the post 2007 Garmin G1000 with GIA 63W. Various FMS models, GNSS receivers and FMS upgrades are available from Rockwell Collins (e.g.http://www.rockwellcollins.com/~/media/Files/Unsecure/Marketing%20Bulletins%20Rev1/BRS/MBLPV%20FMS%20Upgrade%20for%20CRJ200CL850%20BRS110403.ashx). Most new aircraft and helicopters equipped with integrated flight decks such as Rockwell Collins ProLine (TM) 21 and ProLine Fusion (TM) are LPV-capable. In 2014, Avidyne began equipping general aviation and business aircraft with the IFD540 and IFD440 Navigators incorporating a touch-screen Flight Management System with full LPV capability. LPV is designed to provide lateral and vertical accuracy 95 percent of the time. Actual performance has exceeded these levels. WAAS has never been observed to have a vertical error greater than 12 metres in its operational history. As of September 17, 2015 the Federal Aviation Administration has published 3,567 LPV approaches at 1,739 airports. This is greater than the number of published Category I ILS procedures.

Specific microbial species thrive in these high-salinity environments that are inhospitable to most lifeforms. Some of these species enter a dormant state when desiccated, and some species are thought to survive for over 250 million years. The water of hypersaline lakes has great buoyancy due to its high salt content. Hypersaline lakes are found on every continent, especially in arid or semi-arid regions. In the Arctic, the Canadian Devon Ice Cap contains two subglacial lakes that are hypersaline. In Antarctica, there are larger hypersaline water bodies, lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys such as Lake Vanda with salinity of over 35% (i.e. 10 times as salty as ocean water). The most saline water body in the world is the Gaet'ale Pond, located in the Danakil Depression in Afar, Ethiopia. The water of Gaet'ale Pond has a salinity of 43%, making it the saltiest water body on Earth; (i.e. 12 times as salty as ocean water). Previously, it was considered that the most saline lake outside of Antarctica were Lake Assal, in Djibouti, which has a salinity of 34.8% (i.e. 10 times as salty as ocean water). Probably the best-known hypersaline lakes are the Dead Sea (34.2% salinity in 2010) and the Great Salt Lake in the state of Utah, USA (5‚Äì27% variable salinity). The Dead Sea, dividing Israel and the Palestinian West Bank from Jordan, is the world's deepest hypersaline lake, and the Araruama Lagoon in Brazil is the world's largest. The Great Salt Lake, located in Utah, while having nearly three times the surface area of the Dead Sea, is shallower and experiences much greater fluctuations in salinity. At its lowest recorded water levels, it approaches 7.7 times the salinity of ocean water, but when its levels are high, its salinity drops to only slightly higher than that of the ocean.

Connell was killed when the plane he was flying crashed on December 19, 2008. Life Connell was originally from Illinois and lived in Bath Township, near Akron, Ohio. His company also maintained a website for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth 527 group during the 2004 election. Request for protection In July 2008, the lead attorney in the King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell case, Cliff Arnebeck, sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey seeking protection for Connell as a witness in the case, saying he had been threatened. Arnebeck wrote, \\"We have been confidentially informed by a source we believe to be credible that Karl Rove has threatened Michael Connell, a principal witness we have identified in our King Lincoln case in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, that if he does not agree to 'take the fall' for election fraud in Ohio, his wife Heather will be prosecuted for supposed lobby law violations.\\" Arnebeck claims that months later, his source called back and warned that Connell's life was in danger. He was served with a subpoena in Ohio on September 22, 2008, in a case alleging that vote-tampering during the 2004 presidential election resulted in civil rights violations. Connell, president of GovTech Solutions and New Media Communications, was a website designer and IT professional and created a website for Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell that presented the results of the 2004 election in real time as they were tabulated. At the time, Blackwell was also chairman of the Bush-Cheney 2004 reelection effort in Ohio. Connell refused to testify or to produce documents relating to the system used in the 2004 and 2006 elections, lawyers said. Death At about 6 p.m. on December 19, 2008, Connell was killed, at the age of 45, in the crash of a single-engine 1997 Piper Saratoga private airplane, which he was flying, which occurred in Lake Township, between 2.5 and 3 miles short of the runway at the Akron-Canton Airport near Akron, Ohio. Connell was alone in the plane and had been returning from the College Park Airport in Maryland, near Washington, D.C. The plane crashed on its final approach to the airport's main runway, between two houses, one of which was vacant. Connell had flown the plane from the Akron-Canton Airport to the College Park Airport on December 18, 2008; according to the Stark County, Ohio coroner, Connell had on his person a receipt for a breakfast he had purchased in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 2008. On December 31, 2008, it was reported that air traffic controllers had noted that Connell was off course, that they had been in communication with him regarding this, and that he had been trying to get back on course at the time of the crash. There were reported to have been no signs of mechanical problems with the plane. The National Transportation Safety Board published its final report into the accident that killed Connell on January 28, 2010. The board concluded that Connell had lost control of the aircraft as a result of disorientation while turning in cloud. During a pre-flight briefing Connell had commented that he wanted to return to Akron before the weather \\"went from bad to worse\\". Several other pilots in the vicinity had reported severe icing at the time of the crash; Connell's aircraft was not equipped or approved to fly in icing conditions.

It is a member of the International Bar Association.  Organisational structure  The Iraqi Bar Association is headquartered in Almansour, Baghdad. Under the \\"modified practicing law code Number 173 for the year 1965\\", Iraqi lawyers are not technically obliged to be members of the Iraqi Bar Association, but in practice, obtaining an obligatory lawyer's license is infeasible without membership. All members are obliged to subscribe to the Bar Association's newsletter. Members of the Kurdistan Bar Association are allowed to be members of the Iraqi Bar Association and vice versa. About 38,000 lawyers were members of the Iraqi Bar Association in August 2007, with a men to women ratio of about 70:30. New members status can pass through three \\"authorisation\\" levels, A, B and C, requiring coursework and a time delay to progress through the levels. In principle, every three years, eleven \\"Bar Association Board Council\\" members are elected in a one-day election by all members. The President of the association is elected separately from the Board Council. The Bar Association Board consists of the President, his/her Deputy, the Board Council Secretary, the Treasurer and six members of the Board Council.  Leadership and relations with the Iraqi government  In early 2005, Malik Dohan al-Hasan, aged 84 at the time, was president of the Iraqi Bar Association. In June 2005, he became Minister of Justice. He chaired a special commission dealing with compensation for victims of human rights violations during the government of Saddam Hussein and protested against human rights violations in United States prisons in Iraq. In late 2005 (October), Khamal Hamdoon Mulla Allawi was president of the association when Saadoun Sughaiyer al-Janabi, a lawyer participating in the defence of one of Saddam Hussein's co-accused, was assassinated. The association called for a boycott of the Saddam Hussein legal trials in protest. Khamal Hamdoon stated, \\"Protecting lawyers will be possible only if the killers are caught and put behind bars\\". In March 2006, the Iraqi government dismissed the association's council. The \\"chairman\\" of the Iraqi Bar Association, Dheyaa al-Saadi, criticised this, arguing that the council had been created as the result of \\"free and fair elections\\". He said that the association included members of \\"divergent political factions and groups\\" and should \\"remain a symbol of Iraq's unity\\" rather than being \\"politicized\\". He claimed that the association was one of the \\"few\\" organisations in Iraq that was defending \\"civil and political rights and [guaranteeing] the rule of law\\". In June 2006, as \\"head\\" of the Iraqi Bar Association, Khamal Hamdoon stated that Iraqi lawyers were \\"living in terror\\" and claimed that in its occupation of Iraq, the United States \\"adopted the law of power and not the power of law. The lawyer's job is that of civilization.\\" On November 16, 2006, al-Saadi was elected as president of the association with about 70% of the votes. The De-Ba'athification Commission annulled his election on the grounds that he had previously been a member of the Baath Party. Dheya al-Saadi was apparently still president of the Iraqi Bar Association when in December 2008 he led a team of lawyers to defend Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi broadcast journalist working for al-Baghdadia TV who threw his shoes at U.S. president George W. Bush, stating that he did it on behalf of \\"the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq\\".

Heritage Austin Adam's ancestors lived along the hills of the Chums River in Essex, England. Henry Adams, of this family, emigrated to Massachusetts in 1632 with his wife and children. His sons were the ancestors of Samuel Adams, the political philosopher and statesmen; John Adams, second United States president; and Austin Adams. Austin's father, Jerry Adams, was a successful farmer and clerk of the school district, and served twice in the legislature. He married Dorcas Austin in 1816. Youth Austin Adams was born to Jerry and Dorcas on May 24, 1826, in Andover, Vermont, a country village. His grandparents had secured that school and a church on a corner of their farm in 1794. He retained pleasant memories of the district school, which he attended until he was fourteen. In later years he wrote \\"[The] older pupils, the young men and women [...] not only assisted me in my studies, but their presence and example afforded me inspiration.\\"Adams 1891, p. 51 His family attended the Baptist church on their farm. Adams heard only \\"dogmatic and terrorizing theology\\" at the church and it \\"succeeded in destroying much of the happiness of his childhood.\\"Adams 1891, p. 53 He showed great interest in law as a boy: \\"The law had a perfect fascination for me before I was ten years old, and I think before I ever saw a lawyer or a court.\\"Adams 1891, p. 57 He often went to the court house in Woodstock, Vermont to listen to cases. At age thirteen, his teacher urged his father to give Austin a better education than he could receive at the country school house. At fourteen he was sent to Black River Academy in Ludlow, Vermont, to prepare for college. At age sixteen he began teaching students at the academy, some of whom were older than he was, in the winter while working on his father's farm in the summer. At nineteen he entered the sophomore class at Dartmouth College; he graduated in 1848. Lighting then was so poor that he lost some of his vision studying, and had to wear spectacles at an early age. \\"The physical inability to see distinctly increased an introspective state of mind and somewhat blunted the observing powers which he himself regretted.\\"Adams 1891, p. 51-52 For the next five years he taught at West Randolph Academy in West Randolph, Vermont, while pursuing his legal studies. Teaching at the academy \\"perfect[ed] his classical studies.\\" He attended Harvard Law School for a short time in 1853. He was admitted to the bar in Woodstock, Vermont, in January 1853 and entered practice with ex-Governor Carlos Coolidge. Dubuque, Iowa When Adams decided to move west, his friends believed that it wouldn't suit him and that he would return early. Despite this, he settled in Dubuque, Iowa in July 1854. \\"The evening he reached Dubuque [...] he felt that here was to be his life's work.\\"Adams 1891, p. 49 He resided in Dubuque for the rest of his life. Later in life, he said: \\"I wanted more liberty, a society with more variety than I had ever seen in the East.\\" After arriving in Dubuque, he began to practice law there. Like many at the time, he was drawn to seemingly-profitable real- estate investments, and he suffered when their value dropped in the Panic of 1857. He was so affected by this loss that when he was seventy and a friend offered him a share in a promising real-estate investment, he declined, saying \\"No, I have already had all the profits of real-estate transactions I can afford.\\"Iowa Reports Vol. 81, p. x Adams was instrumental in promoting education in Dubuque; he opened an academy, one of the first institutes of secondary education in Dubuque, and taught with Mary Mann, wife of Horace Mann, for six months. During the winter of 1854 he proposed building a public library; he raised funds for it with a series of lectures and solicited donations of books from private libraries. He actively supported John C. Fr√©mont's campaign for president in 1856. While he didn't naturally like politics, he was strongly committed to early Republican principles. He helped to organize a YMCA in Dubuque in 1857. For three years he had a Bible class, while a member and a trustee of the Congregational church, and for two years in the Universalist church. One year he had evenings devoted to the study of physical science at YMCA. He had the subject of geology, and \\"unrolled the gospel of the storied world to the youth gathered there.\\"Adams 1891, p. 55 In 1858, after listening to the Lincoln-Douglas debates in Galena, Illinois, he said of Lincoln: During the American Civil War in 1864, he was secretary of the Sanitary Fair for three months to raise funds for the hospital. In December 1865, he and ten other gentlemen formed a literary club called \\"The Round Table\\". They obtained a room and furnished it with a round table that could fit fifteen people around it. Wendell Phillips and Ralph Waldo Emerson visited it while they were in Dubuque. They were impressed, and later told their friends in Boston about their \\"find in the West.\\"Adams 1891, p. 59 Adams was a regent of Iowa State University (ISU) and a trustee of Humboldt College for several years. He was Law Lecturer at the University of Iowa College of Law from 1875 until his death. Iowa Supreme Court Adams had built up an excellent reputation in the 1860s, so when he was chosen to be a justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, the choice was welcomed with widespread approval. He began his term on the Iowa Supreme Court on January 1, 1876, leaving the firm of Adams, Robison & Lacy. He was Chief Justice for four years, from 1880‚Äì81 and 1886‚Äì87. He was the first Chief Justice to admit a woman to practice in the Iowa Supreme Court. He later commended her for the way she tried the case. As a justice he slowly came to conclusions but then always stood by them. He never tried to appeal to popular opinion in cases. In June 1886 he presided over the opening of the new Supreme Court Rooms. His second term ended December 31, 1887, and he decided not to accept another term. His decisions can be found in Volumes 42‚Äì73 of the Iowa Reports. In 1883, Dartmouth honored him with an LL. D. Personal life On September 8, 1857, Austin Adams married Mary K. Newbury, second daughter of Samuel Newbury and Mary Sergeant. Mary Newbury Adams supported the advancement of women and was a member of many progressive and scientific organizations. Austin also enthusiastically supported the advancement of women, particularly women's education. He enjoyed reading literature as recreation. He usually only read parts of a book‚Äîthe rest he felt was unneeded. All biographies praise his personal qualities, calling him a simple, considerate, intelligent man. Later life During the last year of his life, he became fascinated with the natural world. \\"This year, he more than once said, was the happiest of his life, sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust in the order and law of the universe.\\"Adams 1891, p. 69 He remained strong mentally until his final hours: he usually read five to six hours a day. Suffering a prolonged illness, he died at four in the morning in his home in Dubuque, Iowa, on October 17, 1890. He was buried in Linwood Cemetery in Dubuque, Iowa. His wife later wrote: \\"His happiness was in the state of his mind, not exterior conditions. [...] He had that peace, that passeth understanding.\\"Adams 1891, p. 70.

He was later taken prisoner by the Muslims after the fall of Shushtar in 642. Two years later, he was accused of the assassination of the Rashidun caliph Umar, and was killed by 'Ubaid-Allah, the deceased caliph's son. Family and early life Gold dinar of Khosrow II. Hormuzan was a wealthy aristocrat native to Mihragan-kadag, a district in Media, and belonged to one of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian Empire. He had a brother named Shahriyar, who was the governor of Susa. According to some sources, Hormuzan was the brother-in-law of Khosrow II (r. 590‚Äì628) and the maternal uncle of Kavadh II (r. 628), but this is most likely incorrect, since Kavadh's mother was not an Iranian, but a Byzantine princess named Maria. According to Pourshariati, Hormuzan may have belonged to a Persian family instead of a Parthian one. Although his origin is disputed, it is known that he was part of the Parsig (Persian) faction which is first mentioned in 628 and played a major role in Sasanian politics. Hormuzan ruled his birthplace Mihragan-kadag as a part of his family domain, and all of Khuzestan, one of the richest provinces of the Sasanian Empire. Hormuzan is first mentioned in 609 as one of the Sasanian officers who participated in the battle of Dhi Qar. The rebelling Arabs managed to defeat the Sasanians at the battle, but order was soon restored by Ruzbi, the frontier governor (marzban) of al-Hira. In 628, Khosrow II was overthrown by his son Kavadh II, who crowned himself as the new shahanshah (king of kings) of the Sasanian Empire. Three days later, Kavadh ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. In 632, after a period of coups and revolts, Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651) was crowned as king of the Sasanian Empire at Estakhr, an ancient Iranian city in Pars, where the Sasanian family had founded their empire. The Arab invasion of western Iran Map of Sasanian Mesopotamia and its surroundings. In 633, the Muslim Arabs invaded Persia, and by 636, they were camping at al-Qadisiyyah, a city close to Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire. The Sasanian army chief (spahbed), Rostam Farrokhzad, prepared to make a counter-attack, raising an army which included the Parsig faction under Piruz Khosrow, Bahman Jadhuyih and Hormuzan; the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under Rostam himself and Mihran Razi; and an Armenian contingent under Jalinus and Musel III Mamikonian. The army also included the military officer Kanadbak and his son, known in Arabic sources as Shahriyar bin Kanara. During the battle, the Sasanian army was defeated, and Shahriyar, along with Musel, Bahman, Jalinus and Rostam, were killed. The Arabs then besieged Ctesiphon. Hormuzan managed to survive, and along with Nakhiragan, Mihran Razi and Piruz Khosrow, including the rest of the survivors, regrouped at Bavel (Babylon), where they tried to repel the Arab army, but were once again defeated. Hormuzan then fled to Hormizd- Ardashir in Khuzestan, which he used as his base in his raids in Meshan against the Arabs. Yazdegerd III supported him in these raids, and believed that it was possible to regain the territories which had been taken by the Arabs. Hormuzan, along with the rest of the survivors of al-Qadisiyyah, later regrouped again and fought the Arabs at the battle of Jalula in 637. The Sasanian army was once again defeated and Mihran Razi was killed. Hormuzan then withdrew once again to Hormizd-Ardashir, where he chose to stay in case the Arabs should invade his domains. Hormuzan continued his raids into Meshan and also began raiding Iraq. He repelled the Kurds (a term then used to describe Iranian nomads) who had been making incursions into Pars and Khuzestan. Hormuzan shortly clashed with an Arab army to the west of Hormizd- Ardashir, but was easily defeated and thus retreated back to the city, where he sued for peace. The Arabs asked for tribute in exchange for peace, which he agreed to. However, he soon stopped paying tribute, and raised an army which included the Kurds he previously had fought. The caliph (ruler) of the Rashidun Arabs, responded by sending an army under a certain Hurqus ibn Zuhayr al-Sa'di, who defeated Hormuzan in 638 at Hormizd-Ardashir, and forced the city to pay jizya (poll-tax). Hormuzan fled to Ram-Hormizd, and once again sought a peace treaty, which he was granted in return for tribute. Remains of Sasanian architecture in Shushtar. However, he later stopped paying tribute, and a result clashed with the Arabs again, who inflicted a defeat on him. The cities of Khuzestan were slowly one by one seized. Sometime later in 641, after a defeat at Ram-Hormizd, Hormuzan fled to Shushtar, and was defeated near the city, which cost him the lives of 900 of his men, while 600 were captured and would later be executed. Nevertheless, he managed to reach the city. The Arabs then laid siege to the city. Fortunately for Hormuzan, Shushtar was well fortified due to the rivers and canals that surrounded it on almost all sides. There are several versions of the how the city was captured; according to al-Tabari, during the siege, an Iranian defector named Sina (or Sinah) went to al-Nu'man and pleaded for his life to be spared in return for showing him a way into the city. Al-Nu'man agreed, and Sina told him to: \\"attack via the outlet of the water, and then you will conquer the city.\\" Al- Nu'man did as he told him, and with a small portion of his army, charged into Shushtar. Hormuzan then retreated to the citadel and continued his resistance. The surviving men of Hormuzan who were in citadel along with him, killed their own family members and threw their property into the river rather than let the Arabs take them. In the end, Hormuzan was eventually forced to surrender. According to another version written in the Khuzestan Chronicle, similar to the version by al-Tabari, a defector from Qatar, along with another person, asked the Arabs for some of their plunder in exchange for how to enter the city. The Arabs agreed, and after some time, they managed to enter the city. According to al-Baladhuri, during the siege, the Arabs were reinforced with a group of professional Iranian elites under Siyah al-Uswari, known as the Asawira. The reason for their defection was in order to preserve their status and wealth. However, according to the Khuzestan Chronicle, the Asawira first defected to the Arabs after they entered Shushtar. The brother of Hormuzan, Shahriyar, is said to have been a part of the Asawira. According to Pourshariati, the story of the Asawira helping the Arabs in their conquest of Khuzestan, may have been false. Nevertheless, it is known that Hormuzan was after his surrender taken by the Arabs and brought to their capital Medina. Captivity and death What happened after is told by George Rawlinson, in summary, as follows: In contrast, the Arab tradition holds that Hormuzan, when first brought as a prisoner before the Rashidun Caliph Umar, was asked to convert. He refused, and so Umar called his executioner to kill him as he represented the last of the Persian leadership. At that point Hormuzan asked for some water, claiming that it would be cruel to kill him while thirsty. Umar had water brought, and upon Hormuzan obtaining a pledge of safety until he'd finished drinking he threw the cup to the ground. He then asked the Caliph if he would keep his word, and Umar agreed and spared his life. Immediately afterwards, Hormuzan converted to Islam, explaining that he had not wanted it said that he'd converted for fear of death. While in Medina, he advised the Rashidun Caliph Umar in making important fiscal and institutional changes. However, in 644, Hormuzan was killed by Umar's son 'Ubaid-Allah, after an involvement in a plot which killed Umar. The new Rashidun Caliph, Uthman, instead of punishing 'Ubaid-Allah for his actions, had him pardoned. This was not well received by some of Hormuzan's Arab supporters, such as Muhammad's cousin Ali, who strongly protested to Uthman and even later tried to take action against 'Ubaid-Allah, who managed to flee to the challenger of Rashidun rule, Muawiyah I.

Several issues currently define Canadian sovereignty: the Canadian monarchy, telecommunication, the autonomy of provinces, and Canada's Arctic border. Canada is a Commonwealth realm, meaning that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state. However, while several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the Queen's representative, the Governor General;Forsey, Eugene; How Canadians Govern Themselves: The Institutions of Our Federal Government; Library of Parliament; sixth edition; pg. 1 as such, the Governor General is sometimes referred to as the de facto head of state. In each of Canada's provinces the monarch is represented by a lieutenant-governor. The greater autonomy of each province and territory - Canadian federalism - is also important to Canadian sovereignty. Quebec has twice voted about seceding from Canada. Under Canada's Telecommunications Act, telecommunication carriers must be nationally owned.The Canadian Telecommunications Act (1993) - Overview. Media Awareness Network. Accessed 21 December 2008. The most recent issue affecting Canadian sovereignty has been caused by the melting of Arctic ice. As Arctic ice in Northern Canada has melted, several countries have struggled to come to an agreement on who owns certain areas in the oil-rich Arctic. Canadian monarchy Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, is the sovereign and head of state of Canada, and gives repository of executive power, judicial and legislative power; as expressed in the constitution: the Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen. However, sovereignty in Canada has never rested solely with the monarch due to the English Bill of Rights of 1689, later inherited by Canada, which established the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the monarch is still the sovereign of Canada. In Canada's federal system, the head of state is not a part of either the federal or provincial jurisdictions; the Queen reigns impartially over the country as a whole, meaning the sovereignty of each jurisdiction is passed on not by the Governor General or the Canadian parliament, but through the Crown itself. Canada is a constitutional monarchy. Thus, the Crown is \\"divided\\" into eleven legal jurisdictions, eleven \\"crowns\\" ‚Äì one federal and ten provincial.Jackson, Michael; Canadian Monarchist News: Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003 The Fathers of Confederation viewed this system of constitutional monarchy as a bulwark against any potential fracturing of the Canadian federation.Smith, David E.; The Invisible Crown; University of Toronto Press; 1995; p. 26 In practice, the sovereign rarely personally exercises her executive, judicial or legislative powers; since the monarch does not normally reside in Canada, she appoints a governor general to represent her and exercise most of her powers. The person who fills this role is selected on the advice of the prime minister. \\"Advice\\" in this sense is a choice generally without options since it would be highly unconventional for the prime minister's advice to be overlooked; a convention that protects the monarchy. As long as the monarch is following the advice of her ministers, she is not held personally responsible for the decisions of the government. The governor general has no term limit, and is said to serve \\"at Her Majesty's pleasure\\"; however, the practice is for the governor general to be replaced after about five years in the role. Just as the sovereign's choice of governor general is on the prime minister's advice, the vice-regal figure exercises the executive powers of state on the advice of the ministers of the Crown who make up the Cabinet. The term \\"the Crown\\" is used to represent the power of the monarch. Though the sovereign or viceroy rarely intervene directly in political affairs, the real powers of the position of the monarch in the Canadian Constitution should not be downplayed. The monarch does retain all power, but it must be used with discretion, lest its use cause a constitutional crisis. Placement of power in the sovereign's hands provides a final check on executive power. If, for instance, she believed a proposed law threatened the freedom or security of her citizens, the Queen could decline Royal Assent. Furthermore, armed removal of her by parliament or government would be difficult, as the monarch remains Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces,Constitution Act, 1867 who swear an oath of allegiance to her. Constitutional scholars such as Senator Eugene Forsey have maintained that the sovereign (the Queen) and Governor General do retain their right to use the Royal Prerogative in exceptional constitutional crisis situations, MacLeod, Kevin S.; A Crown of Maples: Constitutional Monarchy in Canada; The Queen in Right of Canada; 2008 though the Canadian public service has argued that such actions may be perceived by the public as lacking democratic legitimacy. Commentators, including former governor general Adrienne Clarkson, have in the late 20th and early 21st centuries stated that contemporary Canadians had and have a poor understanding of the Canadian monarchy and a wider ignorance about Canadian civics. =Monarchy in the Canadian provinces= In the Canadian federation, the provinces are each a separate jurisdiction of the Canadian Crown, wherein a hereditary monarch is the sovereign and head of state of each province, forming the core of its Westminster style parliamentary democracy.Forsey, Eugene; How Canadians Govern Themselves: Introduction; Library of Parliament; sixth edition; pg. 1 As the institution from which the power of the state flows, the terms The Crown in Right of [Province], Her Majesty in Right of [Province], and The Queen in Right of [Province] may also be used to refer to the entire executive of the government in each jurisdiction. As the pinnacle of governance, the authority of the Crown in the province is symbolised through elements included in various government institutions' insignia, as well as their names, such as Court of Queen's Bench and Queen's Printer.

The Museum of Science and Technology (Ottawa). Provincial autonomyQuebec sovereignty movement= The province of Quebec, in red. The Quebec sovereignty movement () is a political movement aimed at attaining independent statehood (sovereignty) for the Canadian province of Quebec. In practice, \\"separatism\\", \\"independence\\" and \\"sovereignty\\" are all used to describe the goal of having the province of Quebec leave Canada to become a country on its own, with future possibilities of various collaborations with Canada. However, sovereignty is the term most commonly employed. The most apparent reason for separatism is Quebec having a Francophone or predominantly (80%) French-speaking (French-Canadian or Qu√©b√©cois) majority, as compared to the rest of Canada which consists of eight overwhelmingly (greater than 90%) English-speaking provinces and New Brunswick which is officially bilingual and about one-third French-speaking. The territory of Nunavut speaks mostly Inuktitut. The origins and evolution of the movement are actually fairly complex and extend beyond simply language issues. Some scholars may point to historical events as framing the cause for ongoing support for sovereignty in Quebec, while more contemporary pundits and political actors may point to the aftermath of more recent developments like the Meech Lake Accord or the Charlottetown Accord. Quebec referendum, 1995 The 1995 Quebec referendum was the second referendum to ask voters in the Canadian province of Quebec whether Quebec should secede from Canada and become an independent state, through the question: *Do you agree that Qu√©bec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Qu√©bec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?. The 1995 referendum differed from the first referendum on Quebec's sovereignty in that the 1980 question proposed to negotiate \\"sovereignty-association\\" with the Canadian government, while the 1995 question proposed \\"sovereignty\\", along with an optional partnership offer to the rest of Canada. The referendum took place in Quebec on October 30, 1995, and the motion to decide whether Quebec should secede from Canada was defeated by a very narrow margin of 50.58% \\"No\\" to 49.42% \\"Yes\\". Arctic border Under international law, no country currently owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic states, Russia, the United States (via Alaska), Canada, Norway and Denmark (via Greenland), are limited to a economic zone around their coasts.news.yahoo.com Upon ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country has a ten-year period to make claims to extend its 200 nautical mile zone. Due to this, Norway (ratified the convention in 1996), Russia (ratified in 1997), Canada (ratified in 2003) and Denmark (ratified in 2004) launched projects to base claims that certain Arctic sectors should belong to their territories. The United States has signed, but not yet ratified this treaty, although George W. Bush asked the United States Senate to ratify it on May 15, 2007President's Statement on Advancing U.S. Interests in the World's Oceans and on October 31, 2007, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17-4 to send the ratification vote to the full US Senate. The status of the Arctic sea region is in dispute. While Canada, Denmark, Russia and Norway all regard parts of the Arctic seas as \\"national waters\\" or \\"internal waters\\", the United States and most European Union countries officially regard the whole region as international waters (see Northwest Passage).

Operation An IP reader has two features that distinguish it from other access control readers: # Unlike basic readers, IP readers do not require control panels and operate independently. A basic reader simply sends card numbers to a panel and does not control an electric lock, door contact or exit button. If the control panel fails, the basic reader stops working. An IP reader has inputs for monitoring a door contact, exit button and a relay for controlling an electric lock. It also has internal memory for storing the database of users, configuration parameters and recording events. Such readers are sometimes referred to as \\"intelligent readers\\" or \\"readers with built-in controllers\\". # IP readers have an on-board network interface (10/100BaseT Ethernet or Wi-Fi). History The first IP reader was introduced in 1999 by Isonas Security Systems Inc. HID Global, one of the major manufacturers in access control reader and card business, followed the move into network-based security systems only 8 years later, by introduction of the Edge IP reader family in 2007. Biometric reader manufacturers Sagem Securite and Suprema Inc. also added IP readers to their product line-up. Advantages and disadvantages of IP readersAdvantages= * IP readers eliminate the need for control panels and enclosures. * An existing network infrastructure is fully utilized; there is no need to install new communication lines. * There are no limitations regarding the number of IP readers (the limit of 32 readers per line is typical for systems using RS-485 communication interface). * Special knowledge of installation, termination, grounding and troubleshooting of RS-485 communication lines is not required. * Communication with IP readers may be done at the full network speed, which is important if transferring a lot of data (databases with thousands of users, possibly including biometric records). * In case of an alarm IP readers may initiate connection to the host PC. This ability is important in large systems as it allows reducing network traffic generated by frequent polling. * Simplifies installation of systems consisting of multiple locations separated by large distances. Basic Internet link is sufficient to establish connections to remote locations. * Wide selection of standard network equipment is available to provide connectivity in different situations (fiber, wireless, VPN, dual path, PoE) * Most IP readers are PoE capable. This feature makes it easy to provide battery backed power to the entire system, including the locks. * There is no wasted capacity when using IP readers (i.e. a four-door controller would have 25% unused capacity if it was controlling only three doors). * IP reader systems scale easily: there is no need to install new main or sub-controllers. * Failure of one IP reader does not affect any other readers in the system. * No special hardware is required for building fail-over systems: in case the primary host PC fails, the secondary host PC may start polling IP readers. =Disadvantages= * The system becomes susceptible to network related problems, such as delays in case of heavy traffic and network equipment failures. * IP reader and workstations may become accessible to hackers if the network of an organization is not well protected. This threat may be eliminated by physically separating the access control network from the network of the organization. Also most IP readers utilize either Linux platform or proprietary operating systems, which makes them more difficult to hack. Industry standard data encryption is also used. * Maximum distance from a hub or a switch to the reader is when using copper cabling. Some systems based on simpler reader interfaces (such as iButton) can extend that maximum distance for an additional 100 meters (between the reader contact and the system) Using optical transceivers, distance can be extended for many kilometres/miles. * With the exception of fully stand-alone systems that require a connection with a PC only when making changes to the configuration or retrieving the accumulated access log, operation of the system is dependent on the host PC. In case the host PC fails, events from IP readers are not retrieved and functions that require interaction between readers (i.e. anti- passback) stop working. Some readers, however, have peer-to-peer communication option in order to reduce dependency on the host PC. * In order to be used in high-security areas IP readers require special input/output modules to eliminate the possibility of intrusion by accessing lock and/or exit button wiring. Not all IP reader manufacturers have such modules available. * Being more sophisticated than basic readers IP readers are also more expensive and sensitive, therefore they should not be installed outdoors in areas with harsh weather conditions or high possibility of vandalism. * The variety of IP readers in terms of identification technologies and read range is much lower than that of the basic readers. Impact on the security market IP readers have a potential to make a significant impact on the security market if open communication standards existed. Currently most access control systems utilize proprietary communication protocols, which effectively eliminate the freedom of choice: once a decision to install a certain access control system is made, the end-user is locked into buying the same brand of readers, controllers, cards, software and receiving service from the dealer that has exclusive rights to represent that particular brand in the area. Hardware and software of different manufacturers is not compatible. If open communication standards were supported by access control manufacturers, the IP reader market segment could enjoy the growth similar to IP cameras. Having a standard hardware platform would increase interoperability between systems, allow end-users to take advantage of new technologies without the need to replace already installed systems and pave the way towards fully integrated security systems offering superior set of features.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The manor of Croxall was owned by the Curzon Family, who rebuilt the old manor house in the late 16th century.The Old Halls, Manors and Families of Derbyshire, Vol. IV, Joseph Tilley, Printed by Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., Ltd., London, 1902 OwnersThe Curzon Family= Croxall, then in Derbyshire, was one of 140 Derbyshire Manors granted to Henry de Ferrers following the Norman Conquest of 1066.An historical sketch of the parish of Croxall, in the county of Derby, Richard Usher, Published by Bemrose, London, 1881 Croxall, together with the Manors of Edingale, Twyford and Kedleston were granted to Richard De Curzon; Richard was son of Giraline De Courson, a Breton who had fought in the conquest. The family were originally linked with the town of Notre-Dame-de-Courson in France. The family held the manors under the Ferrers Family until 1266 when, after the 6th Earl's rebellion against the King, the Ferrers' lands came under the Duchy of Lancaster. The family held the Manors under the Duchy until the end of the 14th century, after which time they held them direct from the crown. St. John the Baptist Church, Croxall; adjacent to Croxall Hall Richard De Curzon had a son Robert, whom himself had 3 sons: Richard, Thomas and Robert. Richard was left Croxall, Edingale and Twyford, and is from whom the Curzons of Croxall are descended; Thomas was left Kedleston, and is from whom the Curzons of Kedleston are descended. The third son, known as Robert of Cour√ßon, became a celebrated Cardinal, and was a school colleague and friend of Pope Innocent III. The division of property caused dispute. Thomas had been left Kedleston by his father, but his grandmother, Alice (formerly De Somerville), claimed she had been left the Manor by her husband. The depute was solved by giving Croxall Manor to Alice for the duration of her life, after which time it passed back to Richard. The Manor of Twyford was conveyed to John Creweker in 1421, leaving the Curzons with the two adjoining manors of Croxall and Edingale. It's not known when the Curzon family took up residence at Croxall; There has been a house on the site since before they took ownership; however, the earliest known Curzon graves within the parish church date from the 14th century. The Manor was the childhood home of Joyce Curzon (later known as Lady De Appleby, and then as Mrs. Joyce Lewis), a Protestant Martyr who, in 1557, was burned at the stake in the Market Place in Lichfield. This was part of the Marian persecutions of Queen Mary (Bloody Mary). =Later owners= The property passed to the Sackville family, The Earls, and later, Dukes of Dorset, following the death of the last male Curzon, Sir George Curzon, in 1622. George's daughter, and heiress, Mary Curzon, brought the property through her marriage to Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset.Mansions and Country Seats of Staffordshire and Warwickshire, Alfred Williams, Printed and Published by Frederic Williams, Lichfield, 1899 A tradition reported in Magna Britannia by Daniel and Samuel Lysons states that author John Dryden visited Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset at Croxall Hall, and the land once known as Dryden's Walk was said to be named for the poet. The Sackvilles spent less and less time at Croxall and by the mid-18th century, there is evidence they were renting the Hall to local farmers. In about 1779 the manor was sold by John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset to John Prinsep a wealthy East India merchant and later Member of Parliament. The method of this sale is unclear, with some evidence suggesting Prinsep acquired the Hall as the result of a bet/wager. His son Thomas Prinsep, (High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1802), left the estate to his nephew Thomas Levett of Wychnor Hall who thereupon changed his name to Thomas Levett-Prinsep. By 1920, the Levett-Prinsep family had fallen on hard times; they were forced to sell the Croxall Estate and later moved to Devon. The estate was subsequently split up. In 1930 the Hall and 100 acres of land were purchased by Captain Charlton and his wife Edith who used it as a farm. On 7 November 1942, their son, Major Nicholas Charlton, and his wife, Ethel, were killed when a fire broke out at the Hall. Edith Charlton escaped by climbing from a window, down the ivy that covered the building. The fire resulted in the demolition of the west wing of the Hall. In 1953 the Hall was sold to a local businessman, Jim Rose of Tamworth; he and his family gradually restored what remained of the hall. HistoryArchitectural history= There has been a house on the site since \\"very early times\\"; at least since the Norman Conquest. Little is known of the pre-Tudor manor houses, but there was a moat. The present brick-built house dates from Elizabethan times, and was built in the traditional Tudor E shape. The Dorset (Sackville) Family had ceased residing at the Hall by the 19th century and it began to fall into disrepair; it was subsequently sold to the Levett-Prinsep Family but decline continued, and 1868 it was being used as a farm house. It was damaged by fire in 1868, and then over the following four years the Hall was restored and extended for the Levett-Prinsep family, by the architect Joseph Potter of Lichfield. The Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway passes within a mile. There was a time when the Hall was served by Croxall railway station, which closed in 1928. In 1942 the house was again damaged by fire. It killed the owner's son and daughter-in-law, and destroyed the west wing, including the Library and Long Gallery. Given the conditions of World War II, restoration was not possible, and the wing was demolished. After sale to the Rose family in 1953, what remained of the house was gradually restored. =Famous visitors= Mary Queen of Scots is supposed to have stayed at the Hall for one night during her time imprisoned in various Derbyshire houses. Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, stayed at the Hall in one of the bedrooms in the west wing.

History  Originally a student-run quarterly, Shenandoah has evolved into a triannual literary journal edited by author R. T. Smith. Shenandoah was founded in 1949 by a group of Washington and Lee University faculty members, including English professor Samuel Ashley Brown, who published the fiction and poetry of undergraduates including Tom Wolfe. In the 1950s Thomas H. Carter became one of the founding student editors. During his tenure the Shenandoah corresponded with EE Cummings, William Carlos Williams, William Faulkner, Ezra Pound and many other Southern writers and the Shenandoah grew in stature and national prominence. From the 1960s to the 1980s, W&L; faculty member James Boatwright expanded the journal and published occasional theme issues, including a 35th anniversary anthology. In 1995, R. T. Smith was selected as the first full- time editor of the journal, which is now published triannually. Shenandoah is funded and supported by Washington and Lee University through the Office of the Dean of the College and is located in Mattingly House on W&L;'s campus. The magazine maintains a board of university advisors who offer guidance and advice, and the current editor maintains an intern program in which undergraduate students work for the journal and learn the craft of editing as an academic course in the English Department. Recent contributors include Wendell Berry, Joyce Carol Oates, Jacob M. Appel, Speer Morgan, Lee Smith, Claudia Emerson and Rita Dove. This list complements a long history of literary luminaries who have been published in Shenandoah such as W. H. Auden, James Merrill, Ezra Pound, William Faulkner, E. E. Cummings, and Flannery O'Connor.

He played college baseball for Brown University from 1890 to 1893 and for the University of Michigan in 1894. He also played professional baseball from 1890 to 1897, including one season in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters. He later coached college baseball at the University of Michigan (1896, 1901‚Äì1902), Brown University (1903‚Äì1910) and Harvard University (1911‚Äì1915). He also maintained a medical practice at Brookline, Massachusetts for many years. Early years Sexton was born in Brockton, Massachusetts in either 1868 or 1872. He was the son of Irish immigrants, John and Catherine (Comvory) Sexton. He attended Brockton High School and next enrolled at Amherst College in 1888. Sexton transferred to Brown University for the 1889‚Äì1890 academic year as a member of Brown's freshman class. He was a senior at Brown during the 1893‚Äì1894 academic year. At Brown, Sexton \\"won fame both as a pitcher and fielder\\" for the school's baseball team. In 1890, he won his first seven games at Brown, striking out 98 and allowing only 17 hits in the seven games. He played at both pitcher, second base and center field at Brown. His battery-mate was Fred Tenney, who became a well-known first baseman in Major League Baseball. Sexton played on the Brown baseball team for four years (1890‚Äì1893) and was the team captain and coach in 1892 and 1893. He graduated from Brown in 1893. Professional baseball Sexton appears to have made his professional baseball debut in Canada, playing for the Shamrocks, a team sponsored by the Shamrock Athletic Association in Saint John, New Brunswick. According to one account of the early days of professional baseball in Saint John, the Shamrocks went shopping for a new pitcher in 1890: \\"They obtained the services of F.J. Sexton from Brown University. Sexton was a superb pitcher and received the princely salary of $150 a month\\" In August 1890, Sexton helped lead the Shamrocks to the 1890 pennant with a 2‚Äì0 victory over the Saint John Athletic Association. Sexton also played in the New England League for teams in Woonsocket and Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1891 and 1892, for New Bedford in 1893, and for his hometown team, the Brockton Shoemakers, in 1894. During the 1895 season, Sexton played Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters where he was re-united with his battery-mate from Brown, Fred Tenney. In his Major League debut on June 21, 1895, Sexton allowed only two earned runs, but the Beaneaters were defeated by Brooklyn by a score of 4‚Äì2. The Boston Daily Globe reported on Sexton's debut: \\"Frank J. Sexton made his first appearance with the Boston club and pitched a first-class game, while Tenney, his old catcher, handled him in fine style.\\" In his second start on June 25, 1895, Sexton got the win in a 5‚Äì2 victory over the New York Giants. The Boston Daily Globe praised Sexton's performance: > \\"Frank Sexton faced the Giants for the first time, and simply toyed with > them, that, too, without using much speed. Five singles and one double were > made by the visitors, and except for an excusable error by Long in the first > inning, the Giants would have left town last evening with a shutout. Tenney > and Sexton worked well, the latter holding his man at first in fine style > and pitching a cool, heady game. As both Tenney and Sexton can hit and run, > it made Boston by all odds the fastest nine ever put on a ball field.\\" Sexton played in his final Major League game two months later on August 17, 1895. He appeared in seven games for Boston and compiled a record of one win and five losses with a 5.69 earned run average. A history of the Boston baseball club published in 1897 noted that the club had signed several new pitchers in 1895, seeking to overcome the weak showing of the 1894 pitching staff. In the end, the author wrote of the new twirlers: \\"Stocksdale, Wilson, Yerrick and Sexton were more or less frosts, and were pitched in but few games.\\" In 1896, Sexton played for the Springfield Ponies in the Eastern League. He concluded his career as a professional baseball player with the New Bedford Whalers. During the 1896 and 1897 seasons, he was one of the stars of the New England League, \\"batting well and leading in the fielding of the league.\\" Baseball coachMichigan= Sexton attended the University of Michigan from 1894 to 1896 as a student in the Department of Medicine and Surgery. In February 1895, The Michigan Alumnus announced, \\"F.G. [sic] Sexton, Brown University's crack pitcher is a student here this year and will help with the nine.\\" He joined the Michigan Wolverines baseball team as a pitcher in 1895. He pitched an 11‚Äì0 shutout against Cornell during the 1895 season. It was at the conclusion of Michigan's 1895 baseball season that Sexton signed with the Boston Beaneaters. At the conclusion of his brief Major League Baseball career, Sexton returned to Michigan as a medical student. In January 1896, The Michigan Alumnus announced: \\"Sexton, who pitched last season and who was change pitcher on the Boston league team last summer, has been engaged as coach and will not try for his old position.\\" He reportedly agreed to coach the school's baseball team to meet the cost of his education. During the 1896 season, Sexton led the Wolverines to a 17‚Äì4‚Äì1 record. He became involved in a controversy resulting from an 1896 baseball game against Indiana at Bloomington. The Michigan Alumnus reported on the incident as follows: > \\"In the second half of the seventh inning, with the score 11‚Äì11, one man out > and another on base, the Indiana pitcher gave out and the captain noticed > this and gave his umpire the tip to call the game, which he did, giving > darkness as his reason, though the teams might easily have played a half > hour or more longer. Sexton, who was umpiring for Michigan, remonstrated at > this, but the Indiana team left the field, giving Sexton the opportunity to > declare the game forfeited to Michigan with a score of 9 to 0.\\" After the game, an angry Indiana crowd closed around Sexton, and one man drew a knife on him. When the Michigan team retreated to its hotel, the crowd followed and \\"again opened the dispute with Sexton.\\" When one of the men raised his cane to strike Sexton, Sexton \\"got him by the throat\\", another rushed to his help, and the Michigan players eventually pushed the fighters to the sidewalk. A warrant was issued for Sexton's arrest, but he had already left for the train. When the Indiana captain mistakenly identified one of Michigan's players, Holmes, as Sexton, Holmes was arrested and later sued for false imprisonment. The Michigan Alumnus summarized the incident: \\"The affair is unfortunate and greatly to be regretted, yet few who know the facts will blame the Michigan men for defending themselves.\\" Sexton transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in 1896 and received a Doctor of Medicine degree in June 1898. He then established a medical practice in Boston. While developing his practice, he played baseball in the summer of 1900 for the \\"Roses\\", a professional baseball team in Saint John, New Brunswick. In 1901, Sexton agreed to take time away from his medical practice to coach the Michigan baseball team. An article in Ann Arbor's The Weekly Bulletin in April 1902 noted the Wolverines' good fortune in securing Sexton's services: > \\"He located near Boston, where he has a good practice now. His love for > baseball, however, prompted him to respond to the urgent demands of the > Michigan management for his services as coach last year, as well as for this > year. Michigan ought to be very grateful to Dr. Sexton for thus bestowing > his time and attention to the baseball team.\\" Sexton's contract required him to serve as coach from April to the beginning of June. He led the 1901 team to a 13‚Äì8 record. He returned to Michigan again as coach of the 1902 team, which compiled a record of 8‚Äì10. In June 1902, Sexton returned to his medical practice in North Easton, Massachusetts. =Brown= Frank Sexton, c. 1915 While continuing his medical practice, Sexton served as the baseball coach at his alma mater, Brown University. He was the baseball coach at Brown for eight years from 1903 to 1910. During his years as a baseball coach at Brown, his teams \\"always ranked among the best in college baseball\\" and finished in first place among the Eastern college teams in his last three years as coach. He led the 1907 Brown baseball team to a perfect 21‚Äì0 record. In 1907, the Brown Alumni Monthly noted: > \\"Very much of this year's creditable showing is due to Frank J. Sexton, the > coach, who has a great faculty for the developing of new baseball material. > He has been in charge of the team two years, and we sincerely hope he will > continue in charge next season. He knows the men thoroughly, is intensely > interested in them, and has the advantage of being a former Brown player > himself.\\" The Evening News of Providence, Rhode Island also praised his work at Brown: \\"[T]he teams that Dr. Sexton has brought out at Brown always have been good ones, and ones having a splendid idea of how baseball should be played. Sexton has developed many good players for his teams, always has put the boys on their own initiative in the games and has been a strict disciplinarian.\\" Brown continued to practice medicine while coaching at Brown. =Harvard= Testing device used by Sexton to train Harvard's pitchers In December 1910, Sexton was hired as the baseball coach at Harvard University. He was the school's first paid, professional baseball coach. Upon his arrival, Sexton promptly instituted a new training regimen, requiring the pitchers and catchers to do daily work on the gymnasium apparatus for a month before regular practice began. Sexton told the press that the work would get their arms in shape \\"to avoid strains and other hurts when they begin throwing the ball around.\\" In early March 1911, Sexton signed a two-year contract agreeing to coach the Harvard baseball team through the 1912 season. In Sexton's first year at Harvard, the baseball team had its best record since 1901, winning 17 games and losing 6.Nowlin 2010 at 163. Sexton coached at Harvard for five years from 1911 to 1915. While coaching at Harvard, Sexton drew attention for his innovative training techniques. In addition to his requiring the battery candidates to work on the gymnasium apparatus, he instituted a rigorous program of fall practice for the baseball team. Sexton told the press \\"there will be no let-up until they are driven to shelter by the cold weather.\\" In 1915, a publication known as The World's Advance profiled a new target device used by Sexton in the training of Harvard's pitching staff. While Sexton was at Harvard, the baseball team played an annual game against the Boston Red Sox. Although the Harvard team lost the game each year during Sexton's tenure, the scores were relatively close: 4‚Äì1 in 1910, 4‚Äì2 in 1911, 2‚Äì0 in 1912 and 5‚Äì0 in 1913.Nowlin 2010 at 166. In May 1915, Sexton resigned after a disagreement with the Harvard Advisory Baseball Committee. Sexton said that he resigned because of interference from the Advisory Committee with his work as coach. The dispute followed a decision by the committee to hire two former Harvard players as assistant coaches to work with the catchers and outfielders. In a letter published by The Boston Evening Transcript, Sexton wrote that he did not agree to the many suggestions of the committee and concluded, \\"After full consideration of the matter discussed, I felt I could not retain my self-respect and esteem owing to their persistent interference and continue as coach of the Harvard University baseball team.\\" The Evening Transcript wrote that Sexton was \\"considered one of the most efficient in the country\\" and opined that he \\"has been a good coach for Harvard and has developed some excellent teams from very ordinary material.\\" The paper also reported that \\"the players and the college in general have been very much upset over the resignation of Dr. Sexton.\\" Sexton filed a lawsuit against the president and fellows of Harvard in May 1916 for breach of contract, claiming that he had not been fully paid the amounts owed under his contract. Sexton sought $2,000 in unpaid salary and claimed that the Harvard Athletic Committee had interfered with his coaching and had no right to do so. During a jury trial in March 1917, Sexton gave a demonstration of his methods, placing a handkerchief on the floor as home plate, and explaining the position from which he wanted the catcher to throw the ball. Sexton testified that the person who the Athletic Committee sought to impose as an assistant coach wanted to override his instruction to the catchers. The jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of Harvard. Later years After resigning as Harvard's coach in 1915, Sexton returned to his medical practice. He also served with the rank of captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I.(\\"Dr. Frank J. Sexton of 1032 Commonwealth av has been appointed, from Washington, captain in the Medical Corps.\\") At the time of the 1920 Census, Sexton was living at 1032 Commonwealth Avenue in Brookline, Massachusetts with his wife Louise (age 44). They had no children at that time, and Sexton's occupation was listed as a physician in general practice.Census Entry for Frank J.

The initial three-year plan will see Storm working with a number of local 6th forms and colleges including St Joseph's College in Upper Norwood, Carshalton Boys Sports College and Croydon College. The idea a behind the academy is that the inductees will gain much more than just playing rugby league. The backing of the Jack Petchey Foundation has enabled the club to introduce a programme that can help prepare the participants for a career in sport and in which they will learn about how to look after themselves through living a healthier lifestyle. The players will be encouraged to gain Level 1 coaching badges and qualify as referees, and they will then be placed with the junior clubs in the South London rugby league structure to gain experience. In addition they will be given advice on nutrition, injury prevention and sports psychology. The first Academy intake was announced in January 2009.

Hwanbyeokdang was named 'Hwanbyeokdang' by Sinjam, and a rough translation is 'a place surrounded by green trees and water.' It was also previously called \\"Byeokgandang\\" (Î≤ΩÍ∞ÑÎãπ). An anecdote The pavilion is known as a historical site related to Jeong Cheol and has an anecdote regarding him. When Kim Yun-je took a nap in the pavilion, he dreamed that a dragon flew into the sky from a fishing spot. After awakening, he felt odd, so ran to the place and found a boy swimming there. Kim was so fascinated with the boy and his remarkable appearance, that arranged for his granddaughter to marry the boy. The boy was Jeong Cheol who later became a politician and famous literary figure. Structures The pavilion was constructed on a stone embankment on the hillside facing south. It has rooms on the south, north and west sides and has a wooden verandah on both the east and west sides. When originally built it was in the traditional style of a pavilion but was modified by Sachon's descendants. When first built it was surrounded by bamboo but these have now gone and in place of the bamboo there are myrtle, zelkova, phoenix, cherry and Chinese quince trees.

The location, within the boundaries of Monocacy National Battlefield, was the site of l'Hermitage Plantation, founded about 1793 by the Vincendi√®re family. The Vincendi√®res are believed to have been former Haitian landowners who had fled the Haitian Revolution to the Catholic-leaning state of Maryland. L'Hermitage was notable during its time for its size, brutality and for the large number of slaves on the property. The site was the subject of an archaeological excavation by the National Park Service in the summer of 2010 which focused on the structures on the site, believed to have been slave cabins. The Park Service had acquired the area in 1993 as part of an expansion of the battlefield site, and conducted preliminary investigations in 2003. The location became known as the Best Farm, and many of its structures remain extant as part of the battlefield's landscape. L'Hermitage Plantation The Vincendi√®re family was initially headed by Marguerite Mangan de la Vincendi√®re, some of her children, and a relative, Jean Payan de Boisneuf. Marguerite's husband, Etienne Bellumeau de la Vincendi√®re did not come to Maryland, choosing instead to establish himself in Charleston, South Carolina. Twelve slaves accompanied the Vincendi√®res. Marguerite and Etienne's daughter Victoire, aged 17 in 1793, was responsible for assembling the lands of the plantation between 1793 and 1798 and became head of the family by 1800. By 1800 there were ninety slaves on the property, which encompassed at its peak. The plantation was notable for its size and ethnic character; more typical landholdings in the area were much smaller, with no more than a dozen slaves, and were owned by German immigrant farmers. The slave population at l'Hermitage was the second largest in Frederick County, and one of the largest in Maryland. The Vincendi√®re family may have been trying to re-create the large-scale slave labor system that they were familiar with in Haiti, possibly in order to cultivate labor-intensive crops. The Vincindi√®res built many of the structures still visible at the site. Slavery L'Hermitage was also known in its time for its harsh regime. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz traveled through the area in June 1798, recounting that he had been told of tyranny and torture at the plantation: > June 15. ... Four miles from the town [of Frederick] we forded the river > [Monocacy]. On its banks one can see a row of wooden houses and one stone > house with the upper storeys painted white [the secondary house]. ... One > can see on the home farm instruments of torture, stocks, wooden horses, > whips, etc. Two or three negroes crippled with torture have brought legal > action ... Nine court proceedings against family members for cruelty to slaves are recorded, including proceedings against Boisneuf for \\"cruelly and immercifully beating and whipping\\" six slaves and against Victoire Vincendi√®re for beating her slave Jenny. These charges were dismissed, but Boisneuf was found guilty in 1797 of beating a slave named Shadrack and of \\"not sufficiently clothing and feeding his negroes.\\" The Vincendi√®res sold L'Hermitage in 1827, after gradually dispersing most of their slaves. Victoire moved to a townhouse in Frederick. Victoire died in 1854, still the owner of three slaves. Her will stipulated their freedom. Slavery at the property continued under the new proprietors. John Brien (or O'Brien) bought the farm and continued the practice, and David Best, the farm's tenant from 1843 kept slaves. Best had six slaves in 1860, making him one of the largest slave owners in the county. Slavery ended in Maryland in 1864. The l'Hermitage site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The slave quarters were located in the un-planted field beyond the buildings. The building at left is believed to be the \\"stone house with upper storeys painted white.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Slavery at l'Hermitage, Monocacy National Battlefield *L'Hermitage at Journey through Hallowed Ground *Best Farm, Barn, 4871 Urbana Pike, Frederick vicinity, Frederick, MD at the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) *, at Maryland Historical Trust website Category:Archaeological sites in Frederick County, Maryland Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:French-American culture in Maryland Category:Haitian-American culture in Maryland Category:Haitian-American history Category:Plantations in Maryland Category:Plantation houses in Maryland Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Frederick County, Maryland Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States ","title":"L'Hermitage Slave Village Archeological Site"},{"id":"20783771","text":"Glengarra Wood is a mixed woodland in Ireland located southwest of Cahir, Co. Tipperary off the M8 motorway and R639 road. Approximately in extent, it is situated on Old Red Sandstone on the southern slopes of the Galtee Mountains. It is mainly a coniferous forest with Sitka Spruce being the main species. Other conifer species present include Scots Pine, Japanese Larch, Douglas Fir, Norway Spruce, Western Hemlock and Western Red Cedar. The area also contains approximately of native Oak, Birch and Alder. Animals present include fallow deer, foxes, badgers, hares and red squirrels. Birds include pheasants, hawks, kestrels, ravens, herons and many song birds.  History  Glengarra property was formerly part of the Shanbally Estate, between Burncourt and Clogheen, which was owned by Viscount Lismore. During the 19th century he built a lodge (which is now An √ìige youth hostel ) about up from the main road. He planted the area along the river and road leading to the lodge with many native and exotic trees. Some of those that are still present are Cedars of Lebanon, Sequoiadendron, spruces, pines, Laurel and a variety of arboreal Rhododendron. Glengarra Wood is a Millennium Forest Project site. A number of these projects were developed in the Irish countryside in the year 2000 as part of a government initiative to plant one native tree for every household in Ireland. The Glengarra project is in size and contains approximately 60,000 trees, mainly Oak with some Birch, Alder and Scots Pine as well.  Public amenity  There are two waymarked trails on the site. A loop walk starts at a car park and is waymarked in red. It goes across a river and through many different stands of trees, back over the river again, down a forest road, in through more forest before ending back at the car park. The Millennium Walk, which is about long, commences at the top of the car park and is signposted by stakes with a green arrow and Oak leaf on them. There is a small car park about up the road to the An √ìige Hostel which contains signage and information on the Millennium Forest. It stretches from about to about above sea level and there are a number of viewing points looking south to the lowland Golden Vale and the Knockmealdown Mountains.

Unlike most other breads, which are mainly composed of flour, yeast and water, the Burebrot also contains milk. The bread is made by mixing rye and wheat flour, water, salt, yeast and a leavening agent into a dough, which is formed into a round shape. After 70 to 90 minutes, the surface is cut with a knife to create a decorative lozenge pattern and the bread is baked first at a high, then at a moderate temperature until the crust is crunchy. Despite its name, the Burebrot is of relatively recent origin: it was developed in 1955 by the Ecole Professionnelle de Richemont in cooperation with the Swiss Bakers' Association as a way to make use of surplus milk. It is now available in most Swiss bakeries and supermarkets as a bread for everyday consumption. As a bread developed by professionals, it is not usually made at home.

Haugtussa (edited 1895) is an epic circle of poems, written by the Norwegian author Arne Garborg. The poems are reckoned a classical example of Norwegian Neo-romanticism or Symbolism. The themes of the poems are closely related to Garborg's rural background, and a number of supernatural beings, like the draug, the hulderpeople and other creatures, are involved. A Haugtusse is originally a female subterrestrial (a Hulder), but in this story it is an eponym of the main character, a psychic young girl, usually called Veslem√∏y. In 1900 Garborg published a sequel, I Helheim (\\"In Hel\\"). Plot Veslem√∏y (or Gislaug), is the youngest of three sisters, living alone with her elderly mother in the area of J√¶ren. Her oldest sister is dead, and her other sister went to town, possibly falling into prostitution. The family is poor, and is sometimes harassed by the local land-owner. Veslem√∏y is known to have great insight in local tradition and folklore, and the other youths often gather around her to hear her tell stories, or to conduct riddle-games. Veslem√∏y also shows skills in the art of making stories herself. One night, her dead sister visits her, telling her that she is appointed to \\"see\\" more than others, to be psychic, and to predict. This is a great burden to her, but she takes it on, rather willing to \\"see\\" than to be indifferent. From now on, visions haunt her, and the secondary world powers are after her. She is nearly abducted into the mountain. From now on, she is also called Haugtussa (Fairy maid). She has also the ability to see what animal each person around her has behind him or her, not all of them good. The owner of the greater farm is followed by a dragon (symbolizing greed). Veslem√∏y experiences the pangs of any young girl, she falls in love, and almost gets betrothed to the boy on the neighbouring farm. In the end, he marries a richer girl, and this nearly breaks her. Veslem√∏y has to fight even harder with her demons, and is once again taken into the mountains. Here, she meets the remaining Norse trolls, lamenting their fate and how light has taken the land from them. She is offered the hand of the Haugkall (mountain king). She resists, and is found witless and brought home sick. At the end of the book, her sister consoles her once again, telling her to be of good faith, and to prepare for a descent into Hel, guarded by a v√∂lva, who will teach her \\"through fear, the work which will become your honour\\". Sequel The following book, I Helheim (\\"In Hel\\"), tells of Veslem√∏y's descent through the realms of the dead. Garborg tells a story similar to the divina commedia, using the text to criticize on morals and the church at the time. The poetic structure in this book is simpler, with one metre almost all the way. Veslem√∏y also learns about the blessed realms, and eventually wakes up wiser and more consoled than ever before. The epilogue tells how she later lives alone, ending as the \\"wise woman\\" in the community. Music The poems of the main Haugtussa song cycle are catchy, and inspired to music from early on. Some of the poems are sung to folk tunes, and Edvard Grieg worked with 20 of the poems from 1895. Eight of these were selected for publication as a song cycle (Opus 67) in Copenhagen in 1898, and simultaneously a German and English version was published in Leipzig. Later, newer composers have made their own cycles on the text. The poems remain some of the best-known Nynorsk poems in Norway.

The film was based on the 1947 novel Vespers in Vienna by Bruce Marshall. Plot In Rome shortly after World War II, British Col. Michael \\"Hooky\\" Nicobar (Walter Pidgeon) is expecting a transfer home when he is instead posted to Vienna with his aides Junior Commander Audrey Quail (Angela Lansbury), Major John \\"Twingo\\" McPhimister (Peter Lawford) and Private David Moonlight (Melville Cooper). Hooky is assigned to assist Brigadier C.M.V. Catlock (Robert Coote) in monitoring possible \\"subversive activities\\" against the Allied nations and repatriating Soviet citizens living in the British zone of Vienna. He and his aides are billeted at a convent, led by the friendly Mother Superior (Ethel Barrymore). At this convent, Twingo is drawn to a ballerina calling herself Maria Buhlen (Janet Leigh). He falls for her instantly and tries to meet her, but she is reluctant to, until they are officially introduced to each other by Mother Superior. Twingo and Maria start going out, until Soviet Colonel Piniev (Louis Calhern) reports to Hooky, announcing he is searching for a Russian ballerina named Olga Alexandrova, aka Maria Buhlen. Piniev assures Hooky that he means no harm to Olga, and that it is his order to bring her back to the Soviet Union. Later that night, Maria and the Mother Superior reveal that Maria is actually Olga, a Volga German. Shortly later, the Soviets search the entire convent, looking for Maria. Hooky does not reveal that he is aware of Maria's presence, not wanting to put the Mother Superior's image in danger. However, after the Russians leave without having found Maria, Hooky announces that he will turn her over to the Soviets the next day. After he observes Twingo trying to help Maria escape, an attempt that Maria declines because she does not want to endanger Hooky and Twingo's friendship, Hooky turns her over to the Soviets that night. Hooky is reproved for his rigid obedience to duty by Twingo and the Mother Superior but angrily shifts responsibility for what happened to the nun. He and Twingo continue their repatriation duties and they announce to the Soviet Professor Serge Bruloff (Konstantin Shayne) that he is about to be deported; Bruloff reacts by shooting himself. Hooky claims that there is no connection between Maria's reluctance to be deported to the Soviet Union and Serge's suicide, until the third person on his list, Helena Nagard (Tamara Shayne), Serge's wife, responds by bursting into tears. When Piniev's aide tells Hooky that Bruloff's suicide was proof of \\"subversive activity and treasonable behavior,\\" he starts to doubt the sincerity of the Soviets. After he witnesses Maria and Helena being forcibly deported to a harsh detainment camp, Hooky sends a brief to the War Office in London protesting the forcible repatriation of political dissidents. On Christmas Eve, after the Mother Superior asks for his forgiveness for not treating him in a Christian manner, Hooky tells her that he lost his faith after the death of his son in combat. Catlock informs Hooky that the Soviets have sent into the British zone without authority a trainload of refugees. Hooky, enraged, goes to the train station to inspect them for subversive activities, where he witnesses the poor conditions the displaced persons are in. The Mother Superior, who accompanied him, notices Maria among the people in the train. Hooky upbraids the Soviets for their ploy, telling them he knows they staged the incident because they have no use for people too old or too young or too weak to work and are dumping them on the British. Hooky learns that Maria escaped from the Soviets and uses the technicality of her being on the train to bring her to safety and reunion with Twingo. When Hooky and Mother Superior receive a visit from Piniev, who is looking for Maria, they refuse to co-operate. The next day, in response to his brief, Hooky is ordered to fly to Rome as a representative to a United Nations conference to end forcible repatriation, and helps Mother Superior join him to see the Pope on the same issue. On his return, he and Catlock are informed by Piniev that unless Maria is surrendered immediately, the Soviets will cease cooperating with the British on all other matters. Catlock orders Hooky to do so but he refuses and is fired him from his job. Meanwhile, Twingo and Maria plan on moving to Scotland, when she is suddenly captured by Hooky's replacement, the pompous and rigid Colonel Omicron, who intends to turn her in to Piniev. Realizing her fate, she jumps out of a window and succumbs to her injuries. Shortly after, Hooky is assigned to an operation called \\"Humanizing the Army\\" and forcible repatriation is ended.

In January 1947, it was announced Irene Dunne, Spencer Tracy and Robert Taylor were set to star.Bluefield Daily Telegraph - January 28, 1947, Bluefield, West Virginia. p.4 In October 1947, some of the background footage was shot on location in Rome and Vienna. The film was shelved, however, and the original director Victor Saville was eventually replaced by George Sidney. Furthermore, the three principal actors withdrew and were replaced by Walter Pidgeon, Ethel Barrymore and Peter Lawford. Agnes Moorehead briefly replaced Barrymore in March 1949.Wisconsin State Journal - March 19, 1949, Madison, Wisconsin. p.11 On October 14, 1948, it was announced Audrey Totter was slated to co-star as Audrey Quail. She was replaced by Angela Lansbury in early 1949. For the scenes of the war camps, 1,500 starved- looking extras were sought. The crew admitted they were looking for real war refugees but found that most of them were already looking too healthy. One crew member called it \\"the biggest casting problem since The Good Earth (1937)\\".The Progress - March 18, 1949, Clearfield, Pennsylvania. p.17 Reception Although MGM assigned an all-star cast to The Red Danube, including a big budget, the film was a commercial failure.Eames, J., The MGM Story, p.225 According to studio records, it earned $1,177,000 in the US and Canada and $682,000 overseas, resulting in a loss of $905,000. The film was criticized for being a propaganda film, \\"designed to make you hate Russia and recognize the Vatican as the true champion of freedom\\".The Rotarion, February 1950. p.39. The Rotary at that time had long been at odds with the Vatican over its perceived anti-Rotarian stance. Film Score Monthly, on the other hand, noted that film \\"struck a chord with reviewers\\" by \\"bringing humanity to a difficult subject\\" and having a message \\"not compromised by preachiness.\\"Alexander Kaplan, One-liner notes: The Red Danube, retrieved February 5, 2016 It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons, Hans Peters, Edwin B.

Both human and machine process information where the physical position of elements in the 3D space is relevant. The 3D space used for interaction can be the real physical space, a virtual space representation simulated in the computer, or a combination of both. When the real physical space is used for data input, the human interacts with the machine performing actions using an input device that detects the 3D position of the human interaction, among other things. When it is used for data output, the simulated 3D virtual scene is projected onto the real environment through one output device. The principles of 3D interaction are applied in a variety of domains such as tourism, art, gaming, simulation, education, information visualization, or scientific visualization.  History  Research in 3D interaction and 3D display began in the 1960s, pioneered by researchers like Ivan Sutherland, Fred Brooks, Bob Sproull, Andrew Ortony and Richard Feldman. But it was not until 1962 when Morton Heilig invented the Sensorama simulator. It provided 3D video feedback, as well motion, audio, and feedbacks to produce a virtual environment. The next stage of development was Dr. Ivan Sutherland‚Äôs completion of his pioneering work in 1968, the Sword of Damocles.Sutherland, I. E. (1968). \\"A head-mounted three dimensional display \\". Proceedings of AFIPS 68, pp. 757-764 He created a head-mounted display that produced 3D virtual environment by presenting a left and right still image of that environment. Availability of technology as well as impractical costs held back the development and application of virtual environments until the 1980s. Applications were limited to military ventures in the United States. Since then, further research and technological advancements have allowed new doors to be opened to application in various other areas such as education, entertainment, and manufacturing.  Background  In 3D interaction, users carry out their tasks and perform functions by exchanging information with computer systems in 3D space. It is an intuitive type of interaction because humans interact in three dimensions in the real world. The tasks that users perform have been classified as selection and manipulation of objects in virtual space, navigation, and system control. Tasks can be performed in virtual space through interaction techniques and by utilizing interaction devices. 3D interaction techniques were classified according to the task group it supports. Techniques that support navigation tasks are classified as navigation techniques. Techniques that support object selection and manipulation are labeled selection and manipulation techniques. Lastly, system control techniques support tasks that have to do with controlling the application itself. A consistent and efficient mapping between techniques and interaction devices must be made in order for the system to be usable and effective. Interfaces associated with 3D interaction are called 3D interfaces. Like other types of user interfaces, it involves two-way communication between users and system, but allows users to perform action in 3D space. Input devices permit the users to give directions and commands to the system, while output devices allow the machine to present information back to them. 3D interfaces have been used in applications that feature virtual environments, and augmented and mixed realities. In virtual environments, users may interact directly with the environment or use tools with specific functionalities to do so. 3D interaction occurs when physical tools are controlled in 3D spatial context to control a corresponding virtual tool. Users experience a sense of presence when engaged in an immersive virtual world. Enabling the users to interact with this world in 3D allows them to make use of natural and intrinsic knowledge of how information exchange takes place with physical objects in the real world. Texture, sound, and speech can all be used to augment 3D interaction. Currently, users still have difficulty in interpreting 3D space visuals and understanding how interaction occurs. Although it‚Äôs a natural way for humans to move around in a three-dimensional world, the difficulty exists because many of the cues present in real environments are missing from virtual environments. Perception and occlusion are the primary perceptual cues used by humans. Also, even though scenes in virtual space appear three-dimensional, they are still displayed on a 2D surface so some inconsistencies in depth perception will still exist.  3D user interfaces  Scheme of 3D User Interaction phasesUser interfaces are the means for communication between users and systems. 3D interfaces include media for 3D representation of system state, and media for 3D user input or manipulation. Using 3D representations is not enough to create 3D interaction. The users must have a way of performing actions in 3D as well. To that effect, special input and output devices have been developed to support this type of interaction. Some, such as the 3D mouse, were developed based on existing devices for 2D interaction. 3D user interfaces, are user interfaces where 3D interaction takes place, this means that the user's tasks occur directly within a three-dimensional space. The user must communicate with commands, requests, questions, intent, and goals to the system, and in turn this one has to provide feedback, requests for input, information about their status, and so on. Both the user and the system do not have the same type of language, therefore to make possible the communication process, the interfaces must serve as intermediaries or translators between them. The way the user transforms perceptions into actions is called Human transfer function, and the way the system transforms signals into display information is called System transfer function. 3D user interfaces are actually physical devices that communicate the user and the system with the minimum delay, in this case there are two types: 3D User Interface Output Hardware and 3D User Interface Input Hardware. = 3D user interface output hardware = Output devices, also called display devices, allow the machine to provide information or feedback to one or more users through the human perceptual system. Most of them are focused on stimulating the visual, auditory, or haptic senses. However, in some unusual cases they also can stimulate the user's olfactory system.  3D visual displays  This type of devices are the most popular and its goal is to present the information produced by the system through the human visual system in a three-dimensional way. The main features that distinguish these devices are: field of regard and field of view, spatial resolution, screen geometry, light transfer mechanism, refresh rate and ergonomics. Another way to characterize these devices is according to the different categories of depth perception cues used to achieve that the user can understand the three- dimensional information. The main types of displays used in 3D UIs are: monitors, surround-screen displays, workbenches, hemispherical displays, head- mounted displays, arm-mounted displays and autostereoscopic displays. Virtual reality headsets and CAVEs (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) are examples of a fully immersive visual display, where the user can see only the virtual world and not the real world. Semi-immersive displays allow users to see both. Monitors and workbenches are examples of semi-immersive displays.  3D audio displays  3D Audio displays are devices that present information (in this case sound) through the human auditory system, which is especially useful when supplying location and spatial information to the users. Its objective is to generate and display a spatialized 3D sound so the user can use its psychoacoustic skills and be able to determine the location and direction of the sound. There are different localizations cues: binaural cues, spectral and dynamic cues, head-related transfer functions, reverberation, sound intensity and vision and environment familiarity. Adding background audio component to a display also adds to the sense of realism.  3D haptic displays  These devices use the sense of touch to simulate the physical interaction between the user and a virtual object. There are three different types of 3D Haptic displays: those that provide the user a sense of force, the ones that simulate the sense of touch and those that use both. The main features that distinguish these devices are: haptic presentation capability, resolution and ergonomics. The human haptic system has 2 fundamental kinds of cues, tactile and kinesthetic. Tactile cues are a type of human touch cues that have a wide variety of skin receptors located below the surface of the skin that provide information about the texture, temperature, pressure and damage. Kinesthetic cues are a type of human touch cues that have many receptors in the muscles, joints and tendons that provide information about the angle of joints and stress and length of muscles. = 3D user interface input hardware = These hardware devices are called input devices and their aim is to capture and interpret the actions performed by the user. The degrees of freedom (DOF) are one of the main features of these systems. Classical interface components (such as mouse and keyboards and arguably touchscreen) are often inappropriate for non 2D interaction needs. These systems are also differentiated according to how much physical interaction is needed to use the device, purely active need to be manipulated to produce information, purely passive do not need to. The main categories of these devices are standard (desktop) input devices, tracking devices, control devices, navigation equipment, gesture interfaces, 3D mice, and brain-computer interfaces.  Desktop Input devices  This type of devices are designed for an interaction 3D on a desktop, many of them have an initial design thought in a traditional interaction in two dimensions, but with an appropriate mapping between the system and the device, this can work perfectly in a three-dimensional way. There are different types of them: keyboards, 2D mice and trackballs, pen-based tablets and stylus, and joysticks. Nonetheless, many studies have questioned the appropriateness of desktop interface components for 3D interaction though this is still debated.  Tracking devices  3D user interaction systems are based primarily on motion tracking technologies, to obtain all the necessary information from the user through the analysis of their movements or gestures, these technologies are called, tracking technologies. Trackers detect or monitor head, hand or body movements and send that information to the computer. The computer then translates it and ensures that position and orientation are reflected accurately in the virtual world. Tracking is important in presenting the correct viewpoint, coordinating the spatial and sound information presented to users as well the tasks or functions that they could perform. 3D trackers have been identified as mechanical, magnetic, ultrasonic, optical, and hybrid inertial. Examples of trackers include motion trackers, eye trackers, and data gloves. A simple 2D mouse may be considered a navigation device if it allows the user to move to a different location in a virtual 3D space. Navigation devices such as the treadmill and bicycle make use of the natural ways that humans travel in the real world. Treadmills simulate walking or running and bicycles or similar type equipment simulate vehicular travel. In the case of navigation devices, the information passed on to the machine is the user's location and movements in virtual space. Wired gloves and bodysuits allow gestural interaction to occur. These send hand or body position and movement information to the computer using sensors. For the full development of a 3D User Interaction system, is required to have access to a few basic parameters, all this technology-based system should know, or at least partially, as the relative position of the user, the absolute position, angular velocity, rotation data, orientation or height. The collection of these data is achieved through systems of space tracking and sensors in multiple forms, as well as the use of different techniques to obtain. The ideal system for this type of interaction is a system based on the tracking of the position, using six degrees of freedom (6-DOF), these systems are characterized by the ability to obtain absolute 3D position of the user, in this way will get information on all possible three-dimensional field angles. The implementation of these systems can be achieved by using various technologies, such as electromagnetic fields, optical, or ultrasonically tracking, but all share the main limitation, they should have a fixed external reference, either a base, an array of cameras, or a set of visible markers, so this single system can be carried out in prepared areas. Inertial tracking systems do not require external reference such as those based on movement, are based on the collection of data using accelerometers, gyroscopes, or video cameras, without a fixed reference mandatory, in the majority of cases, the main problem of this system, is based on not obtaining the absolute position, since not part of any pre-set external reference point so it always gets the relative position of the user, aspect that causes cumulative errors in the process of sampling data. The goal to achieve in a 3D tracking system would be based on obtaining a system of 6-DOF able to get absolute positioning and precision of movement and orientation, with a precision and an uncut space very high, a good example of a rough situation would be a mobile phone, since it has all the motion capture sensors and also GPS tracking of latitude, but currently these systems are not so accurate to capture data with a precision of centimeters and therefore would be invalid. However, there are several systems that are closely adapted to the objectives pursued, the determining factor for them is that systems are auto content, i.e., all-in-one and does not require a fixed prior reference, these systems are as follows: see WP:NOTED, MOS:NOTED, and WP:OPED = Nintendo WII Remote (\\"Wiimote\\") = Wiimote device The Wii Remote device does not offer a technology based on 6-DOF since again, cannot provide absolute position, in contrast, is equipped with a multitude of sensors, which convert a 2D device in a great tool of interaction in 3D environments. This device has gyroscopes to detect rotation of the user, accelerometers ADXL3000, for obtaining speed and movement of the hands, optical sensors for determining orientation and electronic compasses and infra-red devices to capture the position. This type of device can be affected by external references of infra-red light bulbs or candles, causing errors in the accuracy of the position. = Google Tango Devices = Google's Project Tango tablet, 2014 The Tango Platform is an augmented reality computing platform, developed and authored by the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP), a skunkworks division of Google. It uses computer vision and internal sensors (like gyroscopes) to enable mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to detect their position relative to the world around them without using GPS or other external signals. It can therefore be used to provide 6-DOF input which can also be combined with its multi-touch screen. The Google Tango devices can be seen as more integrated solutions than the early prototypes combining spatially-tracked devices with touch-enabled- screens for 3D environments. = Microsoft KINECT = Kinect Sensor The Microsoft Kinect device offers us a different motion capture technology for tracking. Instead of basing its operation on sensors, this is based on a structured light scanner, located in a bar, which allows tracking of the entire body through the detection of about 20 spatial points, of which 3 different degrees of freedom are measured to obtain position, velocity and rotation of each point. Its main advantage is ease of use, and the no requirement of an external device attached by the user, and its main disadvantage lies in the inability to detect the orientation of the user, thus limiting certain space and guidance functions. = Leap Motion = Leap Motion ControllerThe Leap Motion is a new system of tracking of hands, designed for small spaces, allowing a new interaction in 3D environments for desktop applications, so it offers a great fluidity when browsing through three-dimensional environments in a realistic way. It is a small device that connects via USB to a computer, and used two cameras with infra-red light LED, allowing the analysis of a hemispheric area about 1 meter on its surface, thus recording responses from 300 frames per second, information is sent to the computer to be processed by the specific software company.  3D Interaction Techniques  3D Interaction Techniques are the different ways that the user can interact with the 3D virtual environment to execute different kind of tasks. The quality of these techniques has a profound effect on the quality of the entire 3D User Interfaces. They can be classified into three different groups: Navigation, Selection and manipulation and System control. = Navigation = The computer needs to provide the user with information regarding location and movement. Navigation is the most used by the user in big 3D environments and presents different challenges as supporting spatial awareness, giving efficient movements between distant places and making navigation bearable so the user can focus on more important tasks. These techniques, navigation tasks, can be divided into two components: travel and wayfinding. Travel involves moving from the current location to the desired point. Wayfinding refers to finding and setting routes to get to a travel goal within the virtual environment.  Travel  Travel is a conceptual technique that consists in the movement of the viewpoint from one location to another. This orientation is usually handled in immersive virtual environments by head tracking. Exists five types of travel interaction techniques: * Physical movement: uses the user's body motion to move through the virtual environment. Is an appropriate technique when is required an augmented perception of the feeling of being present or when is required physical effort form the user. * Manual viewpoint manipulation: the user's hands movements determine the displacement on the virtual environment. One example could be when the user moves their hands in a way that seems like is grabbing a virtual rope and pulls his self up. This technique could be easy to learn and efficient, but can cause fatigue. * Steering: the user has to constantly indicate where to move. Is a common and efficient technique. One example of this are the gaze-directed steering, where the head orientation determines the direction of travel. * Target-based travel: user specifies a destination point and the system effectuates the displacement. This travel can be executed by teleport, where the user is instantly moved to the destination point or the system can execute some transition movement to the destiny. These techniques are very simple from the user's point of view because he only has to indicate the destination. * Route planning: the user specifies the path that should be taken through the environment and the system executes the movement. The user may draw a path on a map of the virtual environment to plan a route. This technique allows users to control travel while they have the ability to do other tasks during motion.  Wayfinding  Wayfinding is the cognitive process of defining a route for the surrounding environment, using and acquiring spatial knowledge to construct a cognitive map of the environment. In virtual space it is different and more difficult to do than in the real world because synthetic environments are often missing perceptual cues and movement constraints. It can be supported using user-centered techniques such as using a larger field of view and supplying motion cues, or environment- centered techniques like structural organization and wayfinding principles. In order for a good wayfinding, users should receive wayfinding supports during the virtual environment travel to facilitate it because of the constraints from the virtual world. These supports can be user-centered supports such as a large field-of-view or even non-visual support such as audio, or environment- centered support, artificial cues and structural organization to define clearly different parts of the environment. Some of the most used artificial cues are maps, compasses and grids, or even architectural cues like lighting, color and texture. = Selection and Manipulation = Selection and Manipulation techniques for 3D environments must accomplish at least one of three basic tasks: object selection, object positioning and object rotation. Users need to be able to manipulate virtual objects. Manipulation tasks involve selecting and moving an object. Sometimes, the rotation of the object is involved as well. Direct-hand manipulation is the most natural technique because manipulating physical objects with the hand is intuitive for humans. However, this is not always possible. A virtual hand that can select and re- locate virtual objects will work as well. 3D widgets can be used to put controls on objects: these are usually called 3D Gizmos or Manipulators (a good example are the ones from Blender). Users can employ these to re-locate, re-scale or re-orient an object (Translate, Scale, Rotate). Other techniques include the Go-Go technique and ray casting, where a virtual ray is used to point to and select an object.  Selection  The task of selecting objects or 3D volumes in a 3D environments requires first being able to find the desired target and then being able to select it. Most 3D datasets/environments are severed by occlusion problems, so the first step of finding the target relies on manipulation of the viewpoint or of the 3D data itself in order to properly identify the object or volume of interest. This initial step is then of course tightly coupled with manipulations in 3D. Once the target is visually identified, users have access to a variety of techniques to select it. Usually, the system provides the user a 3D cursor represented as a human hand whose movements correspond to the motion of the hand tracker. This virtual hand technique is rather intuitive because simulates a real-world interaction with objects but with the limit of objects that we can reach inside a reach-area. To avoid this limit, there are many techniques that have been suggested, like the Go-Go technique. This technique allows the user to extend the reach-area using a non-linear mapping of the hand: when the user extends the hand beyond a fixed threshold distance, the mapping becomes non-linear and the hand grows. Another technique to select and manipulate objects in 3D virtual spaces consists in pointing at objects using a virtual-ray emanating from the virtual hand. When the ray intersects with the objects, it can be manipulated. Several variations of this technique has been made, like the aperture technique, which uses a conic pointer addressed for the user's eyes, estimated from the head location, to select distant objects. This technique also uses a hand sensor to adjust the conic pointer size. Many other techniques, relying on different input strategies, have also been developed.  Manipulation  3D Manipulations occurs before a selection task (in order to visually identify a 3D selection target) and after a selection has occurred, to manipulate the selected object. 3D Manipulations require 3 DOF for rotations (1 DOF per axis, namely x, y, z) and 3 DOF for translations (1 DOF per axis) and at least 1 additional DOF for uniform zoom (or alternatively 3 additional DOF for non-uniform zoom operations). 3D Manipulations, like navigation, is one of the essential tasks with 3D data, objects or environments. It is the basis of many 3D software (such as Blender, Autodesk, VTK) which are widely used. These software, available mostly on computers, are thus almost always combined with a mouse and keyboard. To provide enough DOFs (the mouse only offers 2), these software rely on modding with a key in order to separately control all the DOFs involved in 3D manipulations. With the recent avent of multi-touch enabled smartphones and tablets, the interaction mappings of these software have been adapted to multi-touch (which offers more simultaneous DOF manipulations than a mouse and keyboard). A survey conducted in 2017 of 36 commercial and academic mobile applications on Android and iOS however suggested that most applications did not provide a way to control the minimum 6 DOFs required, but that among those which did, most made use of a 3D version of the RST (Rotation Scale Translation) mapping: 1 finger is used for rotation around x and y, while two- finger interaction controls rotation around z, and translation along x, y, and z. = System Control = System control techniques allows the user to send commands to an application, activate some functionality, change the interaction (or system) mode, or modify a parameter. The command sender always includes the selection of an element from a set. System control techniques as techniques that support system control tasks in three-dimensions can be categorized into four groups: * Graphical menus: visual representations of commands. * Voice commands: menus accessed via voice. * Gestural interaction: command accessed via body gesture. * Tools: virtual objects with an implicit function or mode. Also exists different hybrid techniques that combine some of the types. = Symbolic input = This task allows the user to enter and/or edit, for example, text, making it possible to annotate 3D scenes or 3D objects.

In September 1939, German troops under his command occupied the Polish part of Upper Silesia and cities of Katowice, Miko≈Ç√≥w, Chorz√≥w, committing numerous war crimes on Polish civilians and resistance fighters.  Biography  In 1905 he joined the Kaiser's army as ensign in 139th Infantry Regiment. A year later he was promoted to lieutenant. He served in World War I and received the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class. After 1918, he continued service in the Reichswehr. In 1929, he was promoted to major, in 1933 to Lieutenant Colonel. In the same year, he took command of 23rd Infantry Regiment. On 1 January 1939 he became General Major and three months later took command of Landwehr in Oppeln. On the eve of World War II he was ordered to create the 239th Infantry Division, basing on Landwehr soldiers. The Division's battle value was considered very low and the unit was scheduled to be used as reserve. On 2 September 1939, his division crossed German-Polish border in Giera≈Çtowice. The troops marched towards Ornontowice, then Miko≈Ç√≥w. On 3 September, following the retreat of Polish Army from Upper Silesia, Neuling entered Miko≈Ç√≥w. A day later, he seized Katowice, where was warmly greeted by German citizen. Three days later, his soldiers burned down the synagoge in Katowice. After capturing Upper Silesia Neuling's division headed east. In October 1939 they guarded the German-Soviet border on Bug River, which was created after the fall of Poland.

In colloquial use neutral can be synonymous with unbiased. However, bias is a favoritism for some side, distinct of the tendency to act on that favoritism. Neutrality is distinct (though not exclusive) from apathy, ignorance, indifference, doublethink, equality, agreement, and objectivity. Apathy and indifference each imply a level of carelessness about a subject, though a person exhibiting neutrality may feel bias on a subject but choose not to act on it. A neutral person can also be well-informed on a subject and therefore need not be ignorant. Since they can be biased, a neutral person need not feature doublethink (i.e. accepting both sides as correct), equality (i.e. viewing both sides as equal), or agreement (a form of group decision-making; here it would require negotiating a solution on everyone's opinion, including one's own which may not be unbiased). Objectivity suggests siding with the more reasonable position (except journalistic objectivity), where reasonableness is judged by some common basis between the sides, such as logic (thereby avoiding the problem of incommensurability). Neutrality implies tolerance regardless of how disagreeable, deplorable, or unusual a perspective might be. In moderation and mediation, neutrality is often expected to make judgments or facilitate dialog independent of any bias, putting emphasis on the process rather than the outcome. For example, a neutral party is seen as a party with no (or a fully disclosed) conflict of interest in a conflict, and is expected to operate as if it has no bias. Neutral parties are often perceived as more trustworthy, reliable, and safe. Alternative to acting without a bias, the bias of neutrality itself is the expectation upon the Swiss government (in armed neutrality), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (in non-interventionism). Criticisms and views Neutrality implies not judging the validity of an opinion. Thus, a neutral position will provide a platform for all opinions, including irrational or malicious ones. In classical periods of enlightenment, neutrality has been looked down upon as a character vice, an escape from one's duty to think and to act, as opposed to the modern trend of esteeming neutrality as a virtue. Other views include: * Woodrow Wilson: \\"Neutrality is a negative word. It does not express what America ought to feel. We are not trying to keep out of trouble; we are trying to preserve the foundations on which peace may be rebuilt.\\" * In the Supreme Court decision Southworth v. The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System based on the United States Constitution's First Amendment, the court decided some funding decisions should be made through a neutral viewpoint. * The Oxford English Dictionary documents that by at least 1897 \\"neutral\\" meant applying the rules to the facts, as in football \\"Neutral linesmen shall officiate in all games.\\"\\"neutral, n. and adj.\\", B.I.3.b.

The first prototype was built in 1942 and the 7,000 built by the FNA-B (Fabbrica Nazionale d'Armi di Brescia, \\"Brescia National Arms Factory\\", hence the name) were issued to German and Italian RSI (Repubblica Sociale Italiana) units fighting in Northern Italy. The FNAB-43 was an expensive weapon to manufacture as it used extensive milling and precision engineering in its manufacture. Description The FNAB-43 uses a lever- delayed blowback system firing from the closed bolt position. The bolt is a two-piece unit with a pivoted lever interposed between bolt head and body. On firing the bolt head retracts and begins to rotate the lever, the base of which is against a lug in the body. This lever is pivoted to delay the opening movement to allow the bullet to leave the barrel. The breech pressure then drops before the lever has completed its rotation. The movement of the lever then presses the free end against the bolt body and accelerates the bolt's movement to the rear. The base of the lever then pulls clear of the lug and the whole bolt unit continues to recoil as one piece. On returning, the lever again engages the lug and pivots forward and in doing so removes a coupling which allows the firing pin to move only when the bolt is fully forward. This unusual and complicated system allows the rate of fire to be kept down to very practical 400 rpms without having to use a heavy bolt or strong spring.http://www.secondeguerre.net/Armes/fnab The FNAB-43 also uses a muzzle brake and compensator built into the barrel casing similar to some Russian weapons, and the magazine housing is hinged so that the magazine can lie beneath the barrel similarly to the French MAT-49. The single metal bar stock can be folded upwards rendering the weapon more compact. NotesReferences * Hogg, Ian (1978). The Encyclopedia of Infantry Weapons of World War II.

Blitz had songs written in three different languages, and was moderately well received by critics. Most of its songs were remixed for the band's next release, Krieg. Background The symbol used for the first track, 10px, is a variation of the astronomical symbol for the planet Uranus, Astronomical symbol of Uranus. Sascha Konietzko, the band's founder, mentions the lyrics \\"Up Uranus\\" in his blog, and at the place of the symbol in lyrics, \\"up Uranus\\" is sung. \\"Bait and Switch\\" contains lyrics from \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\". The lyrics for \\"Davai\\" are Russian, while the lyrics for \\"Potz Blitz!\\" are German. The track \\"Me & My Gun\\" is a song loosely about the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Release Blitz was released on March 24, 2009. It was on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for four weeks, and peaked at No. 9.

There were two L-shaped buildings built on the site, but one was demolished in the 1870s. It is a two- story stone structure with gallery porches and a gable roof. The barracks were reportedly built during the French and Indian War, (1754-1763) and occupied by British General Edward Braddock and his troops on their route to Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt, now modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) at the Forks of the Ohio. However, evidence suggests that they remained incomplete as late as 1781 when the structure was used as a prison. The Barracks were put to a variety of uses during the 19th century including a state armory, silkworm production site, and hospital after the nearby Battle of South Mountain and subsequent bloody Battle of Antietam in September 1862, during the American Civil War. The yard served as the Agricultural Fairgrounds from 1853 to 1860. In 1867, it was chosen as the site for the Maryland Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, (now renamed the Maryland School for the Deaf). The original western barracks building was demolished in 1871 for the construction of a new Victorian style large central building, which in turn was razed in the late 1960s, replaced by individual brick cottages.

The firm merged with Bingham McCutchen in 2006. At its height in 2005, Swidler Berlin employed some 300 attorneys with offices on D.C. K Street lobbying corridor and in New York City's iconic Chrysler Building. Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman was known for its regulatory, telecommunications, insurance coverage and lobbying capabilities, the latter of which was enhanced by its association with the Harbour Group, a lobbying and public relations firm with strong ties to the Clinton Administration. The firm engaged in lengthy but ultimately inconclusive merger talks with California-based law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in 2004.'Orrick targets Washington with Swidler Berlin talks,' The Lawyer, May 4, 2004. http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=109868 The next year, Philadelphia-based Dechert made a mass raid on Swidler Berlin's DC and NY offices, hiring 57 attorneys from both the firm's corporate and litigation departments. This included many legacy Shereff Friedman attorneys and was widely seen as a blow to the firm's long-term prospects. The firm merged with bicoastal firm Bingham McCutchen the next year and the Swidler Berlin name was retired from use. Now-defunct San Francisco firm Heller Ehrman inherited much of the insurance team at that time because of conflict of interest issues.

If the hole is large enough there can be protrusion of the abdominal contents, including omental fat and/or bowel. These defects are usually congenital and are not noticed until they slowly enlarge over an individual's life time and abdominal contents herniate through the hole creating either pain or a visible lump on the abdominal wall. If abdominal contents get incarcerated (or stuck) in the hole this can cause pain. If the abdominal contents become strangulated by losing their blood supply from pinching or twisting those tissue will die. If it is omental fat this will cause pain and could potentially lead to an infection. If the strangulated contents are bowel then in addition to pain the individual will develop a bowel obstruction. And if the dead bowel is not surgically removed in an emergent fashion the condition could be fatal. Treatment There is no medical treatment to cure a hernia. It requires surgical intervention which involves closing the hole. If the hole is very small this can sometimes be accomplished by simply reapproximating the connective tissue. However for best long term success most hernias require a permanent barrier to cover the defect much like repairing a hole in a tire. This material is commonly referred to as mesh and can be made of different substances depending on the brand. The operation is usually performed under a general anaesthetic. In most cases this is done as a day case without the need for an overnight stay.

Membership is open to all. The Forum is known for its creation of the MoReq series of records management standards.  History  The DLM Forum was established in 1994 by the European Commission. It is based on the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June 1994Resolution 94/C 235/03 concerning greater cooperation in the field of archives.  Meaning of the DLM acronym  Originally DLM was an acronym for 'Donn√©es Lisibles par Machine' (machine-readable data).French for 'machine-readable data' At its 2002 conference in Barcelona (Spain) a resolution was passed changing this, so DLM now stands for 'Document Lifecycle Management'.History of the DLM Forum and MoReq  Objectives  According to its constitutionDLM Forum Constitution (paragraph 3c), one of the DLM Forum's goals is: 'to provide technology and knowledge transfer and information services, appropriate practice guidelines, benchmark indicators and information, educational, skills development and research opportunities.' The constitution also defines (in paragraph 4) other objectives: '(a) To provide for information services (on-line information portal, list-serv, publications, discussions forum, news, dynamic document archive); (b) To provide for technology & knowledge transfer (technology watch, standards, legislation and policy monitoring, consultancy, connecting technology providers with users, partnership development); (c) To provide for education & skills development (conferences, seminars and exhibitions, workshops and training sessions, managed learning environments); (d) To provide for research (user needs analysis, economic modeling, ontology development, knowledge engineering, classification, information retrieval).'  Achievements  The most visible achievement of the DLM Forum is the creation of a series of European records management standards, collectively known as \\"MoReq\\". The abbreviation 'MoReq' is a contraction of 'Model Requirements for the management of electronic records'. The first MoReq requirements document, formally titled MoReq but today widely known (unofficially) as MoReq1, was published in 2001.MoReq, , download MoReq rapidly gained acceptance across Europe and beyond. It has been translated into at least twelve languages,MoReq project website with translations and additional documents some of which are from outside the European Union. The enhanced successor document MoReq2 was published in 2008.MoReq2 , DOI 10.2792/11981, download Both documents have achieved the status of de facto standards, without the backing of any formal standards body. MoReq2 was enhanced by a test framework, a records management software certification programme, and an XML schema. In March 2010, the DLM Forum announced DLM Forum Announces Development of MoReq2010 to Advance Archiving and Information Compliance across Europe it had signed a contract with Journal IT for a major update to MoReq, to result in a version that will be called MoReq2010.

Until 2010, the legal entity of the DLM Forum was the DLM Network EEIG. In early 2010, the DLM Forum formed the DLM Forum Foundation, a limited company registered in England and Wales, to replace the EEIG as its legal entity. The DLM Forum is governed by its Executive Committee, which consists of 7 to 9 elected members. The current chair of the DLM Forum Executive Committee is Jan Dalsten S√∏rensen from the Danish National Archives. The DLM Forum established in 2008 a MoReq Governance Board for the maintenance and control of the MoReq2 standard and certification process. The DLM Forum usually holds member meetings twice a year; generally these meetings are held in the country then holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. It also organises a major conference every three years; these conferences generally attract about 300 to 400 delegates from Europe and elsewhere.

History and name The first recorded mention of the Murren is found in a document in the Z√ºrich State Archives from 1508. Detailed descriptions of the pastry are found in late 19th-century sources and match the contemporary appearance of the Murren closely. Research by Swiss food historians indicates that the Murren were a specialty of Z√ºrich's bakers up until the 20th century, at which time they became popular in other parts of Switzerland, with the exception of Ticino where they are almost unknown. Up until late into the 20th century, Murren were a treat for feasts, as white flour was too expensive for everyday consumption by most people. While the breadroll is known as Z√ºrcher Murren (or Z√ºrimurre in the local dialect) in the canton of Z√ºrich, it is referred to as Berner Weggli or Weggen (\\"Bernese breadrolls\\") in the canton of Berne and in the Romandie, and under generic terms such as Spitzweggen (\\"pointy breadrolls\\") elsewhere in Switzerland. The etymology of the word Murren is unclear. It may be derived from Middle High German murr (\\"blunt\\"), from Spanish or Portuguese morro (\\"round\\") or from Dutch murw (\\"brittle\\"). Production Like the Weggli, another traditional Swiss breadroll, Murren are made of white flour, milk, butter, yeast, a pinch of salt and sugar, malt and a leavening agent. These ingredients yield a stringy, elastic dough that is allowed to rise for 30 minutes, before it is mechanically divided into small pieces. The pieces are again allowed to rise for half an hour in a heated closet, and are then superficially sliced with a special tool to produce five cuts that result in the Murrens characteristic points after baking. The Murren are coated with eggyolk and baked at for 20 minutes, until they are a golden brown colour. Consumption and significance Murren are best when freshly baked, as the dough is quick to dry out. They are traditionally eaten at breakfast with jam, honey or butter; or as a snack with a chocolate branche. The five spikes are the Murren's hardest part and may hurt the palate of incautious eaters. Commercially, Murren are less significant than the similar and more popular Weggli, although they are generally available in bakeries and supermarkets across northern and central Switzerland.

In 1832, Addison and Mary Owen Litton and others settled the area around where the Old San Antonio Road crossed Cedar Creek. A road from Austin to the Gulf of Mexico was laid out through Bastrop County near Cedar Creek in 1837. In 1842, the Methodist church became an important part of the community. Other churches followed, including a Presbyterian church in 1855. The first school was established in 1849. In 1852, a post office opened. In the 1883, a teacher-training school opened. By the late 1880s, the population dropped to 250. From the 1910s through the 1940s, oil played a part of the local economy and the population reached 300. In 2000, the population was 200.

Generally, species in this family have a widespread distribution, although there are some that are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions. This family includes two genera: Pilobolus, and Utharomyces.Alexopoulos C. J., C. W. Mims, & M. Blackwell. 1996. Introductory Mycology. Fourth Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Hesseltine C. W. & J. J. Ellis. 1973. Mucorales. in: The Fungi: An Advanced Treatise. Volume 5B. A Taxonomic Review with Keys: Basidiomycetes and Lower Fungi. Academic Press. New York. pg. 187-217. Morphology All species produce unusual, phototrophic sporangiophores. These sporangiophores give rise to dark-colored, columellate sporagia covered in calcium oxalate crystals. In Pilobolus and Utharomyces, inflated structures filled with yellow cartenoid pigments give rise to the sporophores; these two genera also produce subsporangiul vesicles. Zygospores are formed on apposed, entwined suspensors, usually at or below the dung. Ecology All species grow on dung but can rarely be isolated from the soil. Pilobolus are common on many types of herbivore dung, while Utharomyces grows on rodent dung. Utharomyces appears to be restricted to the tropics. Dispersal This family has spectacular means of dispersal. Many species require passage through the gut of an herbivore in order for the spores to germinate. The problem is that many animals tend to avoid eating their own dung. To compensate, remarkable mechanisms of spore dispersal are used.Kendrick, Bryce. 2000. The Fifth Kingdom. Third Edition. Focus Publishing & R. Pullins Company. Newburyport, MA. In Pilobolus, the subsporangial swelling acts as a lens to focus light on light-sensitive pigments at the base of the swelling. Turgor pressure builds inside of the swelling until it ruptures, and the sporangium is hurled for 2 meters. The calcium oxalate crystals helps it adhere to the surface it lands on, and if the surface is wet, the crystals allow the sporangium to rotate. This rotation allows the mucus surrounding the spores (under the crystals) to glue it to surface where it will await ingestion by an herbivore. Nematodes have been observed climbing the sporangiophore or swimming inside of it to catch a ride on the sporangium. While many species may do this, it seems only Dictyocaulus vivipores, cattle lungworm, are able to survive the trip. Mechanisms of dispersal are less known in these genera. In both genera, the sporangiophore, guided by light, elongates until the sporangium is brought into contact with a solid surface. In Pilobolus, contact with the surface causes a rupture at the columella, which releases the sporangium, which adheres to the new surface. In Utharomyces, contact with the surface ruptures the subsporangial swelling. This releases cytoplasm, which is used to glue the upper portion of the swelling containing the sporangium to the substrate.

This notion was discredited by Lavin in \\"William Barley, Draper and Stationer\\" (1969). He completed an apprenticeship as a draper in 1587, but was soon working in the London book trade. As a freeman of the Drapers' Company, he was embroiled in a dispute between it and the Stationers' Company over the rights of drapers to function as publishers and booksellers. He found himself in legal tangles throughout his life. Barley's role in Elizabethan music publishing has proved to be a contentious issue among scholars.Miller and Smith The assessments of him range from \\"a man of energy, determination, and ambition\\",Johnson 37 to \\"somewhat remarkable\\",McKerrow 20 to \\"surely to some extent a rather nefarious figure\\".Smith 200 His contemporaries harshly criticised the quality of two of the first works of music that he published, but he was also influential in his field. Barley became the assignee of Thomas Morley, who as well as being a composer held a printing patent (a monopoly of music publishing). He published Anthony Holborne's Pavans, Galliards, Almains (1599), the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England. His partnership with Morley enabled him to claim rights to music books, but was short-lived. Morley gave work to the printer Thomas East, and died in 1602. Some publishers ignored Barley's claims, and many music books printed during his later life gave him no recognition. Drapers' Company In a deposition of 1598, Barley refers to his age as \\"xxxiii yeeres or thereabowt\\", placing his date of birth around 1565.Lavin 218 Evidence suggests that Barley may have been born in Warwickshire.Johnson 12. Johnson refutes Lavin's assertion that Barley was born in Woburn, Bedfordshire, claiming that Lavin based his hypothesis on the erroneous assumption that Barley was apprenticed to Thomas Phipps in 1606. By that date, Barley was 41 years old and had already been publishing books for at least 15 years. Little else is known about his early life. Barley was in London by 1587, having completed an apprenticeship with the Drapers' Company in that year.Lievsay 218 He trained as a bookseller under Yarath James, a small-time publisher. James operated out of a shop in Newgate Market, near Christ Church Gate, in the 1580s. His interest in ballads was shared by Barley, who published a number of them during his lifetime. By 1592, Barley had opened his own shop in the parish of St Peter upon Cornhill, whose register recorded his marriage to a Mary Harper on 15 June 1603 and christenings and burials of people associated with his family. He conducted business out of this shop for the next twenty years.Johnson 12. Barley's publications reveal that James' Newgate Market address was also used by Barley in 1591 and 1594. Barley is probably the same William Barley who opened a branch office in Oxford. This action brought him into conflict with the authorities. Barley most likely relied on his assistant, William Davis, to run the Oxford shop while he maintained the business at St Peter upon Cornhill. Davis was arrested in 1599 because Barley had failed to register as a bookseller with Oxford University.Johnson 12 The two redeemed themselves though, and in 1603, Barley and Davis were admitted as \\"privileged persons\\" of Oxford University.Clark 399. Barley's entry in Oxford's register (\\"Barley, William; Warw., 35; bibliopola et famulus Doctoris Howson, Vice-Chancellarii\\") is evidence that he may have been from Warwickshire. Johnson believes that the age discrepancy (Barley should have been 38 in 1603) \\"is not sufficient to make the identification improbable\\" (12). Privileged status at Oxford allowed tradesmen to practice their trade free from the jurisdiction of the town's authorities.Crossley, et al. See also Clark 381‚Äì386. Barley ran afoul of London authorities as well. In September 1591, a warrant was issued for his arrest, although the charge is unknown. Barley also found himself in the midst of a longstanding feud between the Drapers' Company and the Stationers' Company. At the time, the latter held a monopoly over the publishing industry; the Drapers' Company wanted its members to be able to function as publishers and booksellers as well, insisting that it was the \\"custom of the City\\" to grant its freemen the right to engage in the book trade.Johnson 18. For an in- depth discussion on the dispute between the two companies, see Johnson, Gerald D. (March 1988). \\"The Stationers Versus the Drapers: Control of the Press in the Late Sixteenth Century\\". The Library, 6th series 10 (1): 1‚Äì17. From 1591 to 1604, Barley was associated with at least 57 works. The exact nature of his involvement is, at times, hard to identify. Some works were printed \\"for\\" him, others were \\"to be sold by\\" him, and two state that they were printed \\"by\\" him. He partnered with notable printers and publishers during this period, including Thomas Creede, Abel Jeffes, and John Danter.Johnson 18‚Äì19 With Creede, Barley was involved in the publication of A Looking Glass for London and England (1594) and The True Tragedy of Richard III (1594).Johnson 41 During this period, Barley entered none of these works in the Stationers' Register (by entering a title into the register, a publisher recorded their rights to the work). This is probably due to the Stationers' feud with the Drapers'; the Stationers' viewed the ability of non-members to enter works into the register as a special privilege. Thus, Barley relied on others, such as Creede, Jeffes, and Danter, to enter these titles. Whether Barley merely acted as a bookseller for the enterers or, in private agreements with them, actually retained the rights to some of the works remains unclear.Johnson 18‚Äì20 In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined Barley 40 shillings for illicitly publishing a number of works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing privileged books. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the Accidence, a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, Barley, along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and Thomas Pavier (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company within a few years so that they could continue their trade.Johnson 13‚Äì15 Curiously, Barley did not join them until 1606. The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars. Bibliographer J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business.Lavin 222 Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley, who held a royal patent on music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles.Johnson 15 The Stationers' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant. Music publishing In Elizabethan England, music printing was regulated by two royal patents issued by the queen: one for metrical psalters (psalms set to music) and one for all other types of music and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly‚Äîonly they or their assignees could legally print music.Smith 77 After printer John Day's death in 1584, the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees, who were members of the Stationers' Company. The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575. Despite the monopoly, Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster.Milsom After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding the patent, producing works with his assignee, Thomas East.Monson The monopoly expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley to take advantage of the resulting power vacuum. Title page of Anthony Holborne's Pavans, Galliards, Almains and other short Aeirs (1599), which Barley helped publish In 1596, despite not having access to a proper music fount, Barley (using the services of Danter and his wood blocks) published The Pathway to Music, a music theory book, and A New Booke of Tabliture, a tutor for the lute and related instruments that included compositions by John Dowland, Philip Rosseter, and Anthony Holborne. Both featured numerous errors, and for the latter, Barley seems not to have gained prior publishing approval from the composers. Dowland disowned A New Booke of Tabliture, calling his lute lessons \\"falce and unperfect\\",Johnson 28 while Holborne complained of \\"corrupt coppies\\" of his work being presented by a \\"meere stranger\\".Smith 86. Smith states that the phrase \\"meere stranger\\" is an epithet intended to emphasize Barley's lowly social status. Modern musicologists have labelled the publication \\"exasperating\\" and \\"seedy\\". Morley criticised The Pathway to Music, stating that the author should be \\"ashamed of his labour\\", and that \\"[v]ix est in toto pagina sana libro\\" (\\"there is scarcely a page that makes sense in the whole book\\").Smith 86 Despite their flaws, both works seem to have been instrumental in introducing music tutor books to the London market. Two years later, Morley was awarded the same printing monopoly that Byrd had held. Morley's pick of Barley as an assignee (rather than experienced printers such as East or Peter Short, both of whom had previously worked with Morley) is surprising. Morley may have been looking for help in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees. At that time, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly. Barley, however, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley published The Whole Booke of Psalmes and Richard Allison's Psalmes of David in Metre.Smith 92‚Äì93 The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East's 1592 publication of the same name. This work, although pirated and filled with small errors, provides some evidence of Barley's editorial skill; musicologist Robert Illing notes that if Barley \\"is to be discredited for roguery, he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination\\" for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket- sized production.Illing 223 In Allison's work, the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter. Duly provoked, Day sued. The outcome of his lawsuit is not known, but neither Barley nor Morley ever published another metrical psalter. Under Morley, Barley published eight books. The covers of each indicated that they were \\"printed by\\" Barley, but examination of the typography reveals this to be unlikely. At least two of the works contain designs that seem to belong to a device used by London printer Henry Ballard.Lavin 217 Significant among these eight works is Holborne's Pavans, Galliards, Almains (1599), the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England, and the first edition of Morley's influential The First Booke of Consort Lessons (1599). Stationers' Company Barley's relationship with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley had turned to East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years.Johnson 30 Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable to rely on the protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.Johnson 15‚Äì16 Barley evidently decided that it was futile to continue resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company.Johnson 16 On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.Johnson 32 Despite the settlement recognising his claim to Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly found it difficult to enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.Johnson 34‚Äì35 Barley himself published four books under his patent.Johnson 35 In March 1612, one of Barley's servants died, possibly from plague. After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, Barley moved, first to the parish of St Katherine Cree, and later to a house on Bishopsgate. Records from St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees of the will of Pavier. Mary Barley, who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to printer John Beale.Johnson 17‚Äì18 Some of Barley's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to the printer Thomas Snodham.

From 2013 to 2015 she was a \\"Dragon\\" on BBC Two's Dragons' Den. Family Kelly Hoppen was born on 28 July 1959 in Cape Town, South Africa. Her mother Stephanie Hoppen (n√©e Shub) is of Estonian-Jewish ancestry and her father Seymour Hoppen whose family is from Dublin, is of Irish-Jewish ancestry. When Hoppen was two, her family relocated to London. Hoppen briefly returned to South Africa when her father died. During her return to South Africa she played in a rock band and was arrested and imprisoned for violating apartheid laws by mixing with black musicians. Career Hoppen began her career at 16 when she was given the opportunity to design a family friend's kitchen. She has designed for a number of celebrities, including David and Victoria Beckham; and Martin Shaw, who was one of her early clients. She has designed the homes, yachts and jets of private clients, as well as commercial projects in several countries, including hotels, restaurants, offices and aircraft. Some of Hoppen's most recent projects include a collaboration with Disney to celebrate Mickey Mouse's 90th anniversary, the Celebrity Edge cruise ship for Celebrity Cruises, an ultra luxury residential tower block in Taiwan, One Park Taipei, and LUX* Grand Gaube hotel, the second hotel she has designed for LUX* in Mauritius. Hoppen is the author of nine design books to date, and received much critical acclaim and recognition following the publication of her first book, East Meets West, which was published in 1997. In November 2013, Hoppen published Kelly Hoppen Design Masterclass - How to Achieve the Home of your Dreams. Hoppen is known for her signature neutral palette and trademark Perfect Neutrals, and is often referred to as the 'Queen of Taupe'. She has said of her design philosophy, \\"My philosophy has always remained the same. It's about creating calm balanced environments based on Eastern cultures, i.e. order and creation of harmony. How people feel in a space is as important as the way it looks; one can't be without the other to succeed.\\" In January 2014, she launched her first e-commerce store with a self-designed interiors accessories range.

Governor Democratic Governor Jon Corzine was running for a second term and was being challenged by Republican Chris Christie, Independent Christopher Daggett, and nine others (not including write-in candidates). Christie won the election with about 49 percent of the vote, to 45 percent for Corzine and 6 percent for Daggett. Christie is expected to assume office on January 20, 2010. This was the first election to fill the newly created office of lieutenant governor. The candidates for governor and lieutenant governor were joined together as a single choice, so that voters did not have the opportunity to split the ticket. Kim Guadagno, Christie's running mate, will be New Jersey's first lieutenant governor. =General Election Candidates=Major candidates The following three candidates all qualified to appear, and did appear, in the debates. *Christopher J. Christie, Republican of Mendham Township ‚Äì former United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey (2001‚Äì2008) and former Morris County Freeholder (1995‚Äì1998) *Jon S. Corzine, Democrat of Hoboken ‚Äì incumbent Governor (serving since 2006) and former United States Senator (2001‚Äì2006) *Christopher Daggett, Independent of Basking Ridge ‚Äì former New Jersey Commissioner of Environmental Protection (1988‚Äì1989), Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator (1984‚Äì1988), and Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor (1982‚Äì1984) Other candidates Nine other candidates qualified to appear on the ballot as independents or third-party nominees but did not raise enough money to qualify for the debates. These include Libertarian Kenneth Kaplan, the Socialist Party USA's Greg Pason, and the following independents: Jason Cullen, Joshua Leinsdorf, Alvin Lindsay, David R. Meiswinkle, Kostas Petris, Gary T. Steele and Gary Stein. At least five others, including popular New Jersey comedian Uncle Floyd, announced that they would run write-in campaigns. =Primary Election Candidates= The following candidates were defeated by Jon Corzine in the Democratic primary: *Roger Bacon, Democrat of Phillipsburg ‚Äì unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in New Jersey's 5th congressional district in 2008 *Carl Bergmanson, Democrat of Glen Ridge ‚Äì former Mayor of Glen Ridge (2004‚Äì2008) *Jeff Boss, Democrat of Guttenberg ‚Äì unsuccessful candidate for United States Senate in 2008 The following candidates were defeated by Chris Christie in the Republican primary: *Steve Lonegan, Republican of Bogota ‚Äì former Mayor of Bogota (1995‚Äì2007) *Rick Merkt, Republican of Mendham Township ‚Äì New Jersey General Assemblyman (serving since 1998) The following Republican Primary candidates were removed from the ballot: *David Brown, Republican of South Brunswickhttp://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20081124/NEWS/811240315 *Christian Keller, Republican of Leesburg ‚Äì New Jersey Department of Corrections employee *Brian D. Levine, Republican of Franklin Township ‚Äì Mayor of Franklin Township (serving since 2005) =Republican primary= Former U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie had long been considered the front-runner for the Republican nomination. He was heavily favored by the party establishment and had won the endorsement and county line of all county GOP organizations.http://www.christiefornj.com/newsroom/2009/04/08/christie-wins- hunterdon-county-gop-convention-sweeps-all-county-endorsements-awarded/ Christie's chief opponent in the primary was former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, known for his very right-wing positions and vocal opposition to the Corzine administration; another staunch conservative, General Assemblyman Rick Merkt was also on the ballot. David Brown, Christian Keller, and Franklin Township mayor Brian D. Levine also filed to run in the Republican primary, but their petitions were challenged by Lonegan and they were disqualified from the ballot when administrative judges ruled that their nominating petitions failed to meet the threshold of 1,000 valid signatures. Upon leaving the race, Brown and Levine endorsed Christie.http://www.christiefornj.com/newsroom/2009/04/27/christie-weekly- update---april-27-2009/ Christie and Lonegan attacked each other relentlessly throughout the primary campaign through mailers and robocalls, with each seeking to undermine the other by drawing the public's attention to scandals involving the other. Lonegan proposed ending the state's progressive income tax system and replacing it with a 2.9% flat tax for all New Jerseyans. Christie strongly opposed this proposal, arguing that Lonegan's proposal would amount to a tax increase for most New Jerseyans. Christie instead proposed cutting taxes \\"across the board,\\" although he refused to say by how much. There were two televised debates, which excluded Merkt, and two radio debates, which included him. Ultimately, Christie was able to win the primary with 55% of the vote to Lonegan's 42% and Merkt's 3%. =Democratic primary= Although polls indicated his vulnerability in the general election, Governor Jon S. Corzine was heavily favored to win the Democratic primary over his three little-known challengers. The only one of those to have held elected office, former Glen Ridge mayor Carl Bergmanson, was running on a platform of fiscal discipline, social liberalism, and government reform; he had received the support of the Citizens Against Tolls website. In the primary, Corzine won renomination with 77% of the vote, while Bergmanson, his closest competitor, received about 9%. =General election= Since the primaries, polls have consistently showed Christie leading Corzine, sometimes by double digits. The election became a three-way race on July 7, when independent candidate Christopher Daggett announced that he had raised enough money to qualify for public funds and to qualify for participation in the debates. On July 20, Christie selected Kim Guadagno as his running mate. On July 24, Corzine announced in an e-mail to his supporters that he had selected Loretta Weinberg as his running mate. On July 27, Daggett announced that he had selected longtime Kean University professor and administrator Frank J. Esposito as his running mate. Although the economy and taxes have long been prominent issues in the campaign, the issue of ethics and anti-corruption efforts was thrust into the spotlight in July when several public officials were arrested on corruption charges in Operation Bid Rig. One of Corzine's main lines of attack has involved Christie's ties to the unpopular former President of the United States George W. Bush, who appointed Christie to the U.S. Attorney's office in 2001. In August 2009, Bush political strategist Karl Rove revealed that he had held conversations with Christie about a potential gubernatorial run during Christie's time as U.S. Attorney. U.S. Attorneys are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activities by the Hatch Act of 1939. Corzine quickly incorporated this into his advertisements targeting Christie. Lieutenant governor On November 8, 2005, voters passed a Constitutional amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution which created the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey, the first of whom is to be elected in the 2009 general election and to take office in January 2010. Until the creation of the office, governors who died in office or stepped down were succeeded by the President of the New Jersey Senate. This has happened twice in recent years, with the resignations of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 and James McGreevey in 2004. Concerns over separation of powers (Acting Governors continued to serve concurrently in the Senate) and the fact that Acting Governors were not elected by the people to succeed the Governor led to the Constitutional amendment that created the new office. All 12 candidates for governor appearing on the ballot selected their running mates by the June 27, 2009 deadline. Chris Christie, the Republican nominee for governor, selected Monmouth Beach's Kim Guadagno, the sheriff of Monmouth County, as his running mate. Others mentioned for the post had included New Jersey Senators Diane Allen and Jennifer Beck, as well as Bergen County Clerk Kathleen Donovan. Incumbent Governor Jon Corzine, the Democratic nominee, selected Teaneck's Loretta Weinberg, a New Jersey Senator and former New Jersey General Assemblywoman, as his running mate. Other mentioned for the post had included New Jersey Senator Barbara Buono, New Jersey General Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, and wealthy businessman Randal Pinkett. Chris Daggett, an independent candidate who has qualified for matching funds, selected Ocean Township's Frank J. Esposito, a longtime professor and administrator at Kean University who served as an advisor to the Commissioner of Education in the Thomas Kean, Sr. administration, as his running mate. Others mentioned for the post had included Edison Mayor Jun Choi, Atlantic County freeholder Alisa Cooper, and Passaic County freeholder James Gallagher. LegislatureSpecial elections= *6th Legislative District: Sen. John Adler (D) resigned his seat to take office in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was replaced in a special election convention in January 2009 by then-Camden County Clerk James Beach. Beach will run in a special election in November to keep the seat for the rest of Adler's four-year term. He is being challenged by Republican Joseph Adolf, former mayor of Magnolia. *23rd Legislative District: Sen. Leonard Lance resigned his seat to take office in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was replaced in a special election convention in January 2009 by then-Assemblywoman Marcia A. Karrow, who was selected over Assemblyman Michael J. Doherty. Doherty declared his candidacy in the primary; he defeated Karrow in the Republican primary by approximately 1,000 votes, with 52% of those cast going to him. Doherty will now run against Democrat Harvey Baron, an orthopaedic surgeon, for the remainder of Lance's four-year term in the November special election. =Regularly scheduled elections= All 80 seats in the lower house of the legislature, the General Assembly, were up for election. Voters in each of New Jersey's 40 legislative districts elected two General Assemblymen. Two sitting General Assemblymen, Democrat L. Harvey Smith of the 31st Legislative District and Republican Daniel Van Pelt of the 9th Legislative District, were arrested on corruption charges on July 23, 2009. Van Pelt, who was arrested for accepting a $10,000 bribe, resigned from the Assembly and withdrew from his re-election bid on July 31. Smith was under pressure from the Democratic Party to resign, but did not; he is not seeking re-election. The scandal resulting from the arrests in Operation Bid Rig did not affect the legislative elections in 2009, as Democrats lost only 1 seat despite the rising Tea Party movement that led to Democratic Party defeats at the Governor's level and in Virginia on the same day. Notable races and open seats *1st Legislative District: This district was considered a battleground in the 2009 General Assembly election. Incumbent Democrats Matthew Milam and Nelson Albano were seeking a second and third term respectively. They were being challenged by 2007 candidate Michael Donohue, an attorney, and John McCann, a real estate agent in Ocean City who chaired that city's Republican committee. Upper Township Committeeman Frank Conrad was Donohue's running mate until June 20, 2009, when he withdrew from the race to focus on his highway safety equipment business. The GOP was vigorously pursuing the seats. Republican polling released on August 19 showed Republicans winning these Assembly seats in a generic ballot test, 48% to 29%. These were the only Democratic seats forecast as \\"Leans Republican\\" by PolitickerNJ.com. *3rd Legislative District: Democratic Assemblyman Doug Fisher resigned his seat in March 2009 to be sworn in as New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture. Fisher was replaced by Celeste Riley, previously a Bridgeton Council President. Surgeon Robert Villare and commercial oven repairman Lee Lucas won the Republican nomination over former Cumberland County surrogate and freeholder Arthur Marchand and Greenwich Township mayor George Shivery. While the state GOP did not view Villare and Lucas as viable candidates, and Riley and fellow incumbent John J. Burzichelli were expected to win easily with PolitickerNJ.com forecasted these seats as \\"Safe Democratic,\\" the race for the second seat was closer than anticipated, with Riley besting Villare by a little more than 1200 votes. *4th Legislative District: Democratic Assemblywoman Sandra Love announced that she would not run for a second term, citing health issues. The other incumbent assemblyman, Democrat Paul Moriarty, was running for re-election with new running mate Bill Collins, formerly of the Gloucester Township school board. Former Gloucester Township Councilman Eugene E.T. Lawrence, who served on the council as a Democrat, was nominated in the Republican primary, having switched parties to express his disdain for Governor Corzine's budget proposals. Dominick DiCicco of Franklinville, who was endorsed by Newt Gingrich in the primary, was the other Republican nominee. DiCicco is currently the Chief Legal Officer of North American Claim Operation for Zurich Financial Services. Lawrence and DiCicco defeated Andrew Savicky in the Republican primary. Republican polling released on August 19 showed Republicans winning these Assembly seats in a generic ballot test, 41% to 33%. However, PolitickerNJ.com had classified these seats as \\"Likely Democratic.\\" Unofficial results show Moriarty being re-elected, with DiCicco defeating Collins by a little more than 1,000 votes. *5th Legislative District: Democratic Assemblywoman Nilsa Cruz-Perez is retiring after fourteen years in office. Camden City Council President Angel Fuentes was nominated in the Democratic primary to take her place on the ballot. Joe Roberts, a veteran assemblyman and the current Assembly Speaker, was also nominated in the June primary; however, on September 2, he announced that he would not be seeking re-election after all, saying at a state house press conference, \\"I think it‚Äôs, from my perspective, just time to take a break.\\" Party leaders selected Fuentes's new running mate on September 12: labor leader Donald Norcross, who is also a Camden County Democratic Party co-chair and South Jersey political boss George Norcross's brother. The Republican nominees in this heavily Democratic district were Brian Kluchnick of Haddon Heights and Stepfanie Velez-Gentry of Bellmawr. PolitickerNJ.com forecasted these seats as \\"Safe Democratic.\\". Winners: Norcross & Fuentes *9th Legislative District: Republican Assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt resigned and withdrew from his re-election bid on July 31, after being indicted on corruption charges. He was replaced on the ballot by DiAnne Gove, the former mayor and a current commissioner of Long Beach Township. Incumbent Republican Brian E. Rumpf was running for re-election. The Democratic nominees were attorneys Rich Visotcky of Stafford Township and Rob Rue of Tuckerton. PolitickerNJ.com forecasted these seats as \\"Safe Republican.\\". Winners: Rumpf & Gove *12th Legislative District: The Democratic Party was targeting freshmen Republican incumbents Declan O'Scanlon and Caroline Casagrande. Democrats have a registration edge of 10,000 voters in the district. Former Manalapan Mayor and current township committeewoman Michelle Roth was running on a Democratic ticket with John Amberg of Tinton Falls, a teacher in the Irvington Public Schools. The Council on Affordable Housing is a major issue in the district, especially in towns like Marlboro, where Mayor Jon Hornik told Governor Corzine: \\"If you don‚Äôt kill COAH, it will kill my town.\\" Casagrande and O'Scanlon both voted against the Democratic affordable housing bill in 2008; it passed anyway. Roth and Amberg did not take a stance on COAH on their website. Instead, they were campaigning on a platform of ending fiscal waste and improving government transparency. PolitickerNJ.com forecasted these seats as \\"Likely Republican.\\">. Winners: Casagrande & O'Scanlon *14th Legislative District: Democratic incumbents Linda Greenstein and Wayne DeAngelo represent a district that elected a Republican, Bill Baroni, to the New Jersey Senate that same year. Because this district is heavily populated by unionized state workers, being pro-labor is considered a tremendous asset in this district. Republican gubernatorial nominee Chris Christie has supported the reduction of state workers to cut state spending, however; thus, alignment with Christie is something of a liability in this district. On the other hand, many state workers are also dissatisfied with Governor Corzine's imposition of unpaid furloughs and wage freezes. As a result of all of this, the district was considered highly competitive. The Republican challengers were Robert Calabro, a member of the Hamilton planning board who owns food markets and cafes in Hamilton and Trenton, and attorney William Harvey, also of Hamilton. Brian Hackett, a 21-year-old student activist at The College of New Jersey, was defeated in the primary. Gene Baldassari, who was added to the ballot by petition, was the first New Jersey candidate of the Modern Whig Party ever. Republican polling released on August 19 showed Republicans winning these Assembly seats in a generic ballot test, 47% to 36%. However, PolitickerNJ.com classified these seats as \\"Safe Democratic.\\". Winners: Greenstein & DeAngelo *19th Legislative District: Upon being indicted on corruption charges, Democratic Assemblyman Joseph Vas announced that he would not seek a second term. Jack O'Leary, longtime Mayor of South Amboy, took Vas's place on a ticket with incumbent Democrat John S. Wisniewski. However, dogged by a state investigation into his insurance business and intra-party pressure to bow out of the race, O'Leary ended his campaign on August 17.

James Poesl, an environmental emergency response professional from Woodbridge, was running as an \\"Independent Conservative.\\" Polling released on August 19 showed Republicans winning these Assembly seats in a generic ballot test, 46% to 31%. However, PolitickerNJ.com classified these seats as \\"Likely Democratic.\\">>>. Winners: Wisniewski & Coughlin *20th Legislative District: Democratic Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen resigned on July 28, 2008, while under investigation by state authorities for possession of child pornography. (Cohen has since been indicted for official misconduct, possession of child pornography, and reproduction and distribution of child pornography.) Elizabeth attorney Annette Quijano was selected to complete Cohen's term in the Assembly; she ran for election to a term in her own right as the running mate of veteran Democratic Assemblyman and State Democratic Chairman Joseph Cryan of Union Township. Quijano and Cryan ran unopposed. Winners: Cryan & Quijano *21st Legislative District: Republican Assemblyman Eric Munoz died in office on March 30, 2009, at the age of 61. A special convention selected his widow, Nancy Munoz, as his successor. She then defeated Long Hill Township Mayor George Vitureira and Long Hill school board member Bruce Meringolo for the seat in the Republican primary. Former Cranford mayor Norman Albert and Springfield attorney Bruce Bergen ran on the Democratic ticket. The late Munoz's running mate, Republican Jon Bramnick, ran successfully for re-election; Nancy Munoz was elected to her first full term. PolitickerNJ.com forecast these seats as \\"Safe Republican.\\" Winners: Bramnick & Munoz *23rd Legislative District: Republican Assemblywoman Marcia A. Karrow resigned her assembly seat to succeed newly elected U.S. Representative Leonard Lance in the New Jersey Senate. Karrow was replaced in the General Assembly by then-Warren County freeholder John DiMaio. The other assemblyman from this district, Michael J. Doherty, challenged Karrow in the Republican primary for the Senate seat and won, thus giving up his seat in the Assembly to run for Senate. In the Republican primary for the assembly seats, DiMaio and Hunterdon County freeholder Erik Peterson narrowly won the nomination, edging Doherty's chief of staff, Edward Smith. The Democratic nominees in this overwhelmingly Republican district were William Courtney of Readington and Tammeisha Smith of Columbia; DiMaio and Peterson defeated them easily. PolitickerNJ.com forecast these seats as \\"Safe Republican.\\" Winners: DiMaio & Peterson *25th Legislative District: Republican Assemblyman Rick Merkt decided to run for governor rather than seeking re-election to his seat. Attorney Tony Bucco, the son of New Jersey Senator Anthony Bucco, ran against Morris County freeholder Douglas Cabana for Merkt's seat in the Republican primary. Bucco defeated Cabana by less than 800 votes; putting him on a ticket with incumbent Republican Michael Patrick Carroll. The Democratic nominees in this district were Rebekah Conroy of Morristown and Wendy Wright of Boonton Township. Carroll and Bucco won easily in this Republican stronghold. PolitickerNJ.com forecast these seats as \\"Safe Republican.\\" Winners: Bucco & Carroll *31st Legislative District: Democratic Assemblyman L. Harvey Smith did not seek re-election in 2009. Charles Mainor, a police detective from Jersey City, won the Democratic primary, defeating Ronnie Meadows and Monique Snow; putting him on a ticket with incumbent Democrat Anthony Chiappone. Since Smith's arrest on corruption charges in July, he has been under pressure from Democratic Party leaders to resign; if he does so, Mainor would probably be appointed to Smith's seat. Chiappone was indicted for theft by deception, among other charges, on August 26, but neither resigned nor withdrew from his re-election bid. The Republican nominees in this overwhelmingly Democratic district were attorney Irene Kim Asbury and health instructor Marie Day. PolitickerNJ.com forecast these seats as \\"Safe Democratic.\\" Winners: Mainor & Chiappone Mainor and the indicted Chiappone both won the election. *36th Legislative District: Democratic incumbents Gary Schaer and Frederick Scalera were considered Republican targets. Schaer and Scalera were challenged by the same ticket that came very close to unseating them in the 2007 election: Carlstadt school board member Don Diorio and real estate investment manager Carmen Pio Costa of Nutley. Diorio has said that if elected he would \\"vote independently, beholden to no political party and no special interest,\\" while Pio Costa promised to stand up for the interests of suburbs by fighting for municipal aid reform. Schaer and Scalera have supported Governor Corzine's budget, which the GOP opposes, as well as the EnCap program which nearly lost them the election in 2007. PolitickerNJ.com ranked this pair of seats the second-most-vulnerable for Democrats. Winners: Scalera & Schaer Nevertheless, Schaer and Scalera were re-elected. *39th Legislative District: Republican Assemblyman John E. Rooney announced that he will retire after fourteen terms in office. Rooney and the party establishment both endorsed Bob Schroeder, longtime Washington Township councilman and two-time council president, for the seat. Schroeder ran on a ticket with veteran assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk; they defeated John Shahdanian, a labor attorney and the municipal chairman in Old Tappan, and Michael McCarthy, the political director of a stage hands' union, were running on the Democratic ticket.

It is situated on the eastern flank of Bodmin Moor northwest of Caradon Hill approximately four miles (6 km) north of Liskeard.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 Plymouth & Launceston Minions is first recorded in 1613 and its meaning is unknown.Weatherhill, Craig (2009) A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names. Westport, Mayo: Evertype; p. 49 A stone circle known as the Hurlers is located on the west side of the village. Several other tumuli are also in the area, including Rillaton round barrow, where a Bronze Age gold beaker was discovered. The Cheesewring, a distinctive rock formation, is a mile northwest. Geography Minions is in the former Caradon administrative district and in the parish of Linkinhorne. At it is said to be the highest village in Cornwall. The village is dominated by Caradon Hill, standing at high, on which there is a TV transmission mast on the summit. As a result, there is a road leading up to the summit from Minions. On the western flank of the hill, a quarry recently started up again, cutting granite boulders. As well as this working quarry, there are many other disused quarries and mine buildings in the area due to the village's mining heritage, including the Phoenix United Mine that closed in 1914. Unlike in the west of Cornwall, there are no plans to reopen the tin and copper mines in the area. =Climate= The climate of Minions is Oceanic but, like the rest of Bodmin Moor, due to its higher altitude, it is often cooler, windier and wetter. However, there is a good balance of fair days too, which can get warm in the summer. In winter frosts are common and even though it snows most years, it is never prolonged or severe. Winter:6c/1c Spring:14c/6c Summer:20c/12c Autumn:12c/3c Rainy days:173 Snowfalls:2-4 Community facilities The village has two main car parks, located on the western and eastern edges on the village. There are two tearooms, a pub with B&B;, and a general store which also holds a post office, one of the tearooms and a B&B.; A museum dedicated to the mining history of the local area is located to the north of the village in a disused engine house. Popular culture In May 2015, a road sign was erected outside the village in tribute to the then-forthcoming Minions movie. This sign was removed later the same year for safety reasons, due to families stopping on the narrow road to take photographs. Local residents fought for the \\"tourism- boosting\\" sign to stay, stating that it had \\"put Minions on the map.\\" Calls for the colourful sign to be reinstated received strong support, with an anonymous member of the public placing stickers of the popular characters on the original sign. Filming for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children took place in 2015.

The Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) is located in international waters, adjacent to the Irish continental margin. The PAP lies beyond the Porcupine Bank's deepest point and is southwest of it. It has a muddy seabed, with scattered abyssal hills that covers an area approximately half the size of Europe's landmass. Its depth ranges from to . Characteristics The Porcupine Abyssal Plain is a vast, relatively level stretch of seabed with a depth range of . It has a muddy floor in the abyssopelagic zone and scattered rocky abyssal hills that rise into the bathypelagic zone forming seamounts and knolls. The water at this depth is relatively stable and moving slowly towards the south and southeast. There is a downward flow of organic detritus derived from primary production in the upper layers of ocean that settles on the sea floor. Fauna A large number of marine invertebrates inhabit the abyssal plain. About 90% by number and biomass of the macrobenthos are sea cucumbers and some of the commonest species are Oneirophanta mutabilis, Pseudostichopus villosus and Psychropotes longicauda. These animals are increasing in number as more phytodetritus falls to the seabed. Each species is found to feed on a slightly different portion. Another sea cucumber, Amperima rosea, saw a great leap in its abundance in the years 1995 and 1996, increasing from two or three individuals per hectare to more than six thousand. Before 1995 it took about two and a half years for the sea cucumbers to churn up the surface layers of the sediment but since 1996 this process takes only about six weeks. The ecosystem is profoundly changed by the reworking and consequent aeration of the seabed surface layers. The starfish Psilaster andromeda which feeds mainly on molluscs is present on the abyssal plain,. The detritivore starfish Hyphalaster inermis and Styracaster chuni, both of which feed by ingesting mud, are also common. There are a number of species of sea anemone present, also sea spiders, tunicates and dumbo octopuses (Grimpoteuthis spp). The ecosystem is also home to the xenophyophores Occultammina, Reticulammina, and Galeathammina. Porcupine Abyssal Plain Observatory The observatory is multidisciplinary and moored, and was deployed early on 7 October 2002 at 49¬∞ N and -16¬∞ 30' W. It is coordinated by the National Oceanography Centre and provides time-series datasets used for monitoring and analysing the effects of climate change on the deep Atlantic Ocean and its ecosystems. A full-depth mooring was established in 2012, with autonomous sensors to measure ocean temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, carbon dioxide and nitrate. A 2010 collaboration between the Natural Environment Research Council and the United Kingdom Met Office has led to simultaneous monitoring of the ocean and atmosphere. The datasets are open access and available in near real time. They are uploaded to MyOcean and other websites daily for use in modelling activities. The datasets can be combined to show short-term variations on a daily or seasonal basis and longer term trends. The consequences of storms and other events can also be monitored.

He played college football at the University of Missouri. Early years Petersen attended Lutheran High School North in St. Louis, Missouri. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Missouri. He was named a starter at \\"stand-up\\" defensive end as a sophomore. The next year, he registered 53 tackles (9 for losses). He played a key role in the season opener upset against the University of Notre Dame, when he teamed with linebacker Chris Garlich to stop running back Vagas Ferguson on fourth-down at the Tigers one-yard line. As a senior, he was moved to defensive tackle as a senior, when he was also selected as a team co-captain. He posted 63 tackles and 4 fumble recoveries (tied for the team lead). Professional career Petersen was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (105th overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft, with the intention of playing him on the offensive line. As a rookie, the offense needed help and like defensive players Blaine Nye and Pat Donovan before him, he was converted into an offensive lineman. In 1981 he was named the starting right guard, after Robert Shaw went down with a career ending knee injury in the second game, that required previous starter Tom Rafferty to play center. In 1982, he started all games during a strike shortened season, receiving second-team All-Pro honors. The next year, he missed 2 games with a back injury. In 1984, he missed 3 games with an injury. On August 19, 1986, he was placed on the injured reserve list after suffering a serious left knee injury that would eventually forced him into early retirement. On September 1, 1987, he was placed on the injured reserve list for a second year in a row with the same injury. After not being able to fully recover, he retired on February 2, 1988. Personal life Petersen currently works as a Financial Advisor.

He got was known for Hazara province movement, a protest campaign against changing the name of Sarhad Province. In 2010, the whole political leadership of Hazara Division was united under his guidance and a demand of separate Hazara Province was strengthened by a division-wide prostest. He was previously a Provincial Minister and District Nazim of Abbottabad.  Biography  Haider Zaman Khan was born in born in the Dewal Manal village of Abbottabad District in 1934 to the Karral tribe. He completed his FA in the 1950s and joined the Pakistan Air Force. After retirement, he entered politics in 1962 but failed to win a provincial seat. https://www.samaa.tv/news/2018/10/haider-zaman-khans-journey-from-sardar-to- baba/ His first political win was when he got elected to the NWFP assembly from Abbottabad in 1985. The then chief minister Arbab Jehangir Khan appointed Zaman as the labour and human resource minister in his cabinet. https://www.samaa.tv/news/2018/10/haider-zaman-khans-journey-from-sardar-to- baba/ During his tenure as nazim he shot to prominence for opposing the renaming of the NWFP to Pakhtunkhwa. He criticised the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, for referring to the province as Pakhtunkhwa - saying this was unconstitutional and done to please coalition partners. Zaman said he was in contact with the nazims of the southern districts and all five nazims of the erstwhile Hazara Division opposed the name change. If the district was renamed in line with the proposal from the Awami National Party then, according to Zaman, a creation of a Hazara Province would be justified. He was also involved in a petition against the provincial government of the NWFP claiming that they were curtailing the powers of district government. In March 2006, five months after a devastating earthquake struck the region, Zaman said repatriation of people from tent villages (set up in the aftermath of the earthquake) might be held up due to lack of resources possessed by the district governments. That year he also supported an initiative to raise awareness of the effects of the earthquake. In 2007 he criticised Pakistani tour operators for the way the organised the Hajj and Umrah arrangements for pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, he also claimed that the tour operators were fleecing pilgrims and pilgrims were unable to get rid of greedy tour managers. In 2010 following the renaming of the North-West Frontier Province, Khan has again been prominent by his opposition to the new name, he became the head of the Action Committee for Hazara province - he stated that the new name of the province is on an ethnic basis and so deprived the people of Hazara of their identity. In August 2010 Khan stated that the people of Hazara would stop payments of utility bills until their demands were met. He died on 24 October 2018.

Oron is the third largest ethnic group in the state. They are related to the Efik, Ibibio, Eket, Annang and Ibeno ethnic groups. The five local Councils in Akwa Ibom are Oron, Udung- Uko, Mbo, Urue-Offong/Oruko, and Okobo. The Oron people, popularly called 'Oron Ukpabang' or 'Akpakip Oron' or\`Oron Ukpabang Okpo\` by its indigenes, are made up of several clans. There are nine clans called Afaha. They are namely: Afaha Okpo, Afaha Ukwong, Ebughu, Afaha Ibighi, Effiat, Afaha Ubodung, Etta, Afaha Oki-uso, and Afaha Idua (Iluhe). However, the geopolitical restructuring of the state and local government creation has seen the Oron nation being fragmented politically into two states of Nigeria, namely Cross River and Akwa Ibom state. There are five Oron Local Government Areas in Akwa Ibom State and one Local Government in Cross River State. Oron town is said to be the third largest city in Akwa Ibom state after Uyo and Eket. It has a population of around 250,000 people living within the city. Lying on the Cross River, Oron has a seaport and a Maritime Academy which is soon to become a nautical university. The predominant occupation is fishing and farming.  History  Oron was in existence in the pre-colonial period in Nigeria and was formerly a part of the province called the South-Eastern state. Natives of this area speak the dialect also known as Oron. Most Oron people also speak and understand the Efik language fluently. The Oron also have some dialectical similarities with the Ibibio and Annang people, hence their communication in Ibibio and Annang languages is very proficient. History has it that by 2370 BC Oron also known as {Oron Nation} had already been settled down in the present location known as Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria on the West Coast of African Sub Region, Akwa Ibom Gulf Line to Gulf of Guinea Atlantic Ocean South, after the Great flood (Noah's deluge). The Community as at then and up until this moment still uses their dialect Language originated by them as far back as 2370 BC. The mass movements raided by Bantus the warriors, into many Communities did not mean that Oron people migrated from the Bantus, the Cameroun or Palestinians. Neither the Bantus attire nor any other cultural equivalent anywhere portrays that of Oron language or names. None of Oron Nation culture or names was derived from Bantu or any language elsewhere as immigrant. The Orons are peculiar people, strong contenders in nature wherever they are found, with the accolade \`Oron Ukpabang Okpo\`. Oron man complexion is not reflecting of other ethnic nationalities or immigrant in other settlements of the Oron Nation. Their complexion are not as fair as the Palestinians or Israelis nor are they as dark as the people of the Cameroon mountain from when the Oron Nation came into being; after the creation of the world, even before pre colonialism came to being, when Nigeria and Cameroon had not existed as a nation. Oron folklore tells of \\"Abang\\" who was a powerful warrior and the Chief wrestler of the art-form known as \`Mbok'. The wrestling known as (Mbok) was originated by Abang and later made popular to the new world by enslaved Africans. Abang the warrior and his group gallantly fought against slave traders in the region. One day, he was over powered and captured with a few of his group and they were taken to the present day Israel, which was at the time a territory of Egypt. This is perhaps why it may be more than a mere coincidence that the only two nations on earth with places named ‚ÄúOron‚Äù are Israel and Nigeria. Later, he escaped from Egypt during the Moslem celebrations period through River Nile with few of his men . He sailed down to Sudan, made his way to Lake Chad and settled within the region now known as Jigawa State, Nigeria. Abang named this area \`Oron\` which was written and pronounced as \`Oronny\` in line with Oros\` phonemes migrations. As he was not comfortable with Islam, he escaped to a place called Usahadit area in the present day Cameroon. There, Abang begot Do, Do begot Doni, Doni begot Oro and Obolo. That is why there is a prevalence of Cameroon names as Akan, Ekang, Abang, Etong, Osung, and Etang in Oron today. Among the Oronians, there is a saying that the farthest point in the world is Usahadit which is in the Cameroon. He did not know that other people were already established on that land and due to dispute over farmland, the group later returned home to their original homeland of Oron Nation.BAKASI AND PENINSULA REDRESS/APPEAL; Godwin Ekpo, Crude Formations and Survey Oil Exclusive Worldwide, 2012 It is this return of Abang that has made some historian believe that Oron Nation is one of the Palestinian and Bantu ethnic nationalities that migrated from somewhere around Israel through Egypt (North Africa) to North Eastern Africa through Ethiopia (Abyssinia) to Central Africa (around the present-day Congo Republic & Democratic Republic of Congo) and through the southern Cameroons to the present day Niger Delta region of South-Southern Nigeria. On their return, Doni moved to establish the present day Andoni in Rivers State while Obolo established the present day Eastern Obolo of Akwa Ibom State. Oron people own up to the fact that the Ibeno, who dwell among the Ekids share similar ancestral history with them. One controversy says that the relationship of Oron with Ekid is said to have gone sour when the Eket under the regime of Brigadier General U.J. Esuene declared and agreed to be called a subgroup of the Ibibio nation to gain political relevance and advantage. U.J. Esuene was also said to have denied the Oron people of the opportunity to site the Exxon Mobile's first terminal in Mbo and Effiat Oron areas of Oron. Another common controversy that describes the worsened relationship between Oron and Eket is the accusation that General Esuene was the one who ordered the bombing of Urue Oruko, a region at the heart of Oron where several hundred of Oron people (mostly traders and women) were killed during the Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s. This unfortunate event has been observed in Oron to be the most tragic in the history of the Nigerian Civil War.  Geography  Oron is found in the flood plain of South Eastern Nigeria, with the land mainly intersected by numerous streams and tributaries flowing into Cross River. The entire coastline stretches from Uya Oron to Udung Uko. Oron is in the tropical region and has a uniformly high temperature all the year round. The two main seasons are the dry which spans between October and April and wet season which starts around May and ends in September. There are also two prevailing winds ‚Äì the South-West onshore winds which brings heavy rains and the North- East trade winds blowing across the Sahara Desert, which brings in the dry season  Natural Resources  Oron is rich in oil and natural gas. Most of its oil reserves are off-shore. There are 25 corked oil wells. Oron is presently rated as having one of the highest supplies of natural gas deposits in sub-Saharan Africa with large amounts of untapped natural gas and oil at Ukpata, Udung Okung, and Edik Ekpu. The region is extremely fertile and is known for its topographical Oil Palm Belt, tropical rainforest, swamps, and beaches. The mangrove forests also provide timber and raw materials for medicinal purposes. There are also deposits of solid minerals such as iron, free silica or glass sand and gravel. Seafoods such as crayfish, snipers, oyster and periwinkle abound richly in all coastal areas.  Education  Oron people were among the earliest to encounter Western education in West Africa. This is most evident in the establishment of the Hope Waddell Training Institute, Calabar in 1895 and the Methodist Boys' High School, Oron in 1905. These schools are two of the oldest in the history of Nigeria and attracted students from all over Western and Central Africa.  Politics  With a well formidable socio- cultural group called the Oron Union founded in 1925, the Oron people became one of the most formidable and vocal groups in the South-South region of Nigeria, hence one of the three political forces in the present day Akwa Ibom State. Oron became a Division in August 1970 and in 1976, was made a local government area. However, following the local government creation exercise of the federal government in 1989, Oron was split into 3 Local Government Areas of Mbo, Oron and Okobo. Again in September 1991, Urue Offong/Oruko Local Government Area was carved out of Oron Local Government Area. Finally in December 1996, Udung Uko Local Government Area was further carved out of Oron. Currently, the Oron people are still struggling in their attempts to properly place the Oron union in a position to control their political interests in the state. In the past, the Oron Union has put up such structures as the CWC (Central Working Committee), Esumbuke Oro, and quite recently, the Oron Think- Tank, and many others to address certain issues. There has been little success with these structures, when compared to the political expectation of the average Oron person within the state and Nigeria.  Kingship  Traditionally, the Oron people have one king that rules over the land. He is known as the 'Ahta Oro'. The Ahta has all the Ofong (Ivong or Ifong) afaha and the paramount rulers as members of his traditional rulers council. Some high chiefs (for example, Ikpoto, Akpaha and Okete Okete) are also recognized by the Ahta's council. The President-General of the Oron Union worldwide is regarded as the administrative head of the Oron nation and second-in-command at the Ahta's traditional rulers council.  Culture and Tradition  The Oron people have a unique culture and tradition. The Ekpe Society, which was shared with the Efiks and the Southern Igbos as well as the Ibibios, is used throughout Oron Land as the authority. There are other traditional cults and societies which include the Ekpo, Abang, Edeme Awan √ëkwuho, Ekong, Afiakegit, Kongoma, Mbok, Ababa, Nnabo, and many others. All these societies, in addition to the unique hospitality of the Oron people, their arts, rich diet, Oil and Gas minerals, have been known to attract tourism and commerce to the area and Akwa Ibom state in general. The Oron people have a very colourful mode of traditional dressing, especially with an Iyara (which is red in colour). The red Iyara is usually worn with a white tailored traditional shirt and a wrapper (large fabric wrapped around the waist) to match. This wrapper is commonly worn by several peoples of southern Nigeria. Sometimes it can be combined with the rich Efik native piece of cloth (tie), usually a colourful silk material. Recently the Oron people have been known to tie a piece of cloth usually in form of a handkerchief on the neck. This cloth could be white or coloured depending on the user and his combination intent. A blend of the neck handkerchief and the Efik native tie is also very common among the Oron people. Generally, apart from the distinction of the red Iyara, it is not easy to distinguish an Oron man or woman from an Efik person in terms of attire and the culture. These attires are also sometimes used by the Ibibio and Annang groups of Akwa Ibom state; except that the Annang and Ibibio people will not put on the red Iyara of Oron people because of its political implications and consequence.  Language and Culture  The people have a distinct Oro language, although many speak and understand the Ibibio/Efik language. Oron has a rich culture expressed in songs, folklore and dances. The first National Museum east of the Niger and the Maritime Academy of Nigeria are located in Oron. The Ekpe initiates used a written expression known as Nsibidi  International Airport  The Ibom International Airport is situated in Oron nation (Okobo LGA). The administrative office of the airport is located in the nearby Uruan, Uyo LGA. Uruan is said to have an ancestral relationship with the Oron group, just like the Efiks, Ibono, Eastern Obolo, and Andoni groups. The city is currently witnessing massive infrastructural development such as the dualization of Oron-Eket Highway, construction of various intercity roads, health centers, schools, and housing estate projects to give the ancient city a facelift.

He serves as the General Editor of the Cambridge University Press Series on Business and Public Policy and the Associate Editor of Business & Society. In addition to serving on editorial boards of several additional journals, he has been elected as the Vice-President of the International Studies Association (2015-2016). Professor Prakash is a member of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Board on Environmental Change and Society and International Research Fellow at the Center for Corporate Reputation, University of Oxford. He was elected to the position of the Vice President of the International Studies Association for the period, 2015-2016. He is the recipient of International Studies Association, International Political Economy Section's 2019 Distinguished Scholar Award that recognizes \\"outstanding senior scholars whose influence and path-breaking intellectual work will continue to impact the field for years to come as well as the Associations' 2018 James N. Rosenau Award for \\"scholar who has made the most important contributions to globalization studies\\". The European Consortium for Political Research Standing Group on Regulatory Governance awarded him the 2018 Regulatory Studies Development Award that recognizes a senior scholar who has made notable \\"contributions to the field of regulatory governance.\\" His most prominent contribution pertains to the club approach to the study of voluntary programs in the context of business firms, and extended it to the context of the non-profit sector. Outside actors do not fully know how firms or nonprofits are functioning internally. Voluntary programs are a signaling mechanism to convey this information to outside actors in a credible way. Because participation in such programs in costly, participants need to get something in return. The club approach suggests that club membership allows members to appropriate certain benefits which are non-rival and excludable (i.e., have the characteristics of club goods). These can pertain to reputation, goodwill, access to capital, regulatory relief, etc. Given that voluntary programs tend to have varying levels of effectiveness, the club approach helps to predict ex-ante how program design affects program efficacy. In addition to his work on environmental issues, he is among the second wave scholars who suggest examining NGOs from a collective action perspective. The first ways scholars suggest that NGOs are somehow different from firms and governments because they are guided by principled concerns, not instrumental reasons. Nonprofit scholars claim that nonprofits are more reliable than firms because they are subject to the non-distributional constraint: that is, they can generate profits but cannot distribute them. The second wave scholars question these assertions on both theoretical and empirical grounds. For them, NGOs and nonprofits are guided by both instrumental reasons and principled beliefs. Further, managers have several ways of circumventing the non-distributional constraint and using organizational resources to their advantage. Indeed, the low entry barriers in establishing nonprofits has led the nonprofit/NGO pool to be contaminated with purely instrumental organizations. The collective action approach provides an analytic and systematic approach to study nonprofits and NGOs. Insights about voluntary regulation which have been developed in the context of the for-profit sector travel quite well to the study of the non-profit sector. His other prominent contribution pertains to the role of trade and FDI networks in influencing regulatory races in areas such as human rights, labor rights, environmental policies. Aseem Prakash has written and edited several books and articles on the subjects of corporate environmentalism, NGOs, and globalization. He also contributes to public scholarship via platforms such as The Conversation, Slate, The Washington Post, Huffpost, Regulatory Review, The Hill, and opendemocracy.

History The journal was established in 1921 and renamed Acta Paediatrica Scandinavica in 1964, returning to its original title in 1992. The journal was conceived as a general pediatrics journal and its original aim was to \\"give studies from the Nordic countries a worldwide audience.\\" Thus the journal was originally trilingual, publishing papers in English, German, and French, at a time when most medical journals were still published in national languages; the journal later became an English-only journal. Since Rolf Zetterstr√∂m became editor in the 1960s, the journal increasingly also published studies from outside the Nordic countries. At the end of Zetterstr√∂m's tenure as editor in the early 2000s, nearly two thirds of papers were authored by non-Nordic researchers. The journal is owned by the non-profit Foundation Acta Paediatrica, which is hosted by the Karolinska Institute, where all the editors-in-chief have been professors and the editorial office has always been based. The journal was published on behalf of the foundation by the Swedish publisher Almqvist & Wiksell from 1921 to 1992, by the Norwegian publisher Universitetsforlaget from 1992 to 2000, by Taylor & Francis from 2000 to 2007, and by Blackwell Publishing (later Wiley-Blackwell) from 2007. In addition to its ordinary issues the journal has published nearly 500 supplements, primarily doctoral dissertations authored by paediatricians from the Nordic countries in the early to mid 20th century.

It is named after the hospital's second director-general. The Institute is dedicated to the halachic (Jewish law) approach to medical ethics, and has the purpose of researching and resolving the halachic issues that emerge as medicine progresses, to consider their medical, halachic, legal and ethical ramifications, and to present practical responses. Leading rabbis, physicians and others, consider and respond to issues, with the intention of following the spirit of Torah. Principal activities The Schlesinger Institute offers religious and academic programs in Jewish medical ethics involving prominent Jewish medical ethicists to diverse audiences and student groups. Among these programs are a thirty-hour semester course at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, summer and winter seminars for medical and nursing students from abroad, lectures and tours of Shaare Zedek for yeshiva and seminary students, and one-day seminars on selected topics for Israeli high school pupils. Publications A number of books and journals on Jewish medical ethics are available through the Schlesinger Institute. =Journals= The Schlesinger Institute publishes two journals, ASSIA in Hebrew and JME in English. Both journals covermedical and ethical problems, solutions and ethical thought processes of rabbis and doctors who have dealt with these problems. Articles published in the journals deal with a variety of topics, including: scientific, legal, ethical and halachic aspects of cloning, determining time of death, heart transplantation, truth-telling to the dangerously ill patient, halachic and medical aspects of the AIDS virus, psychiatry and halacha, the selling of organs, the cessation of medical treatment and euthanasia, initial counseling for a juvenile with homosexual urges, smoking and life expectancy, coercive medical treatment, the surrogate mother, medical dilemmas of hospital nurses and halachic principles connected to the obligation to save human life. =Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics= By Avraham Steinberg, M.D. The Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethicshttp://www.medethics.org.il/website/index.php/en/research-2/encyclopedia- of-jewish-medical-ethics Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics covers topics in medical practice from the point of view of halacha and Jewish thought, covering sources from scripture through the whole of ancient, medieval, and modern rabbinic literature. Systematic surveys of related medical, scientific, philosophical, ethical, and legal material, with thousands of references. Articles in the Encyclopedia cover a wide range of topics both for the medical professional and the patient. It combines halachic principles and medical knowledge, with full references for both. It includes medical, scientific, philosophical, ethical, and legal material, from scripture and Talmud through to the most recent sources. The articles include: Paternity, Suicide, Autonomy and Free Will, Hospitals, Genetics, Religion and Science, Consent, Abortions, IVF, Organ Transplantation, Conflict of Halacha and Science, Old Age, The Patient, Embalming, Malpractice, Pain, Kashrut and Shabbat, Birth, Medical Education, Human Sexuality, Limited Resources, Medical Experimentation on Humans, Surgery, Confidentiality, Fertility, Lifesaving, Causing Pain to Animals, Triage, Defining Death, Physicians, and General and Jewish Ethics. =Nishmat Abraham= By A.S. Abraham, M.D., F.R.C.P Published as four-volume set, the Nishmat Avraham on Medical Halacha consists of new responsa and new medical halachic rulings. The Nishmat Abraham is a commentary on the four sections of the Shulchan Aruch with detailed references from the Talmud through Rishonim and Acharonim. It covers thousands of rulings from halachic literature, including up-to-date material from contemporary authorities all over the world such as Rav M. Feinstein, Rav Sh.Z. Auerbach, Rav Waldenberg, Rav Eliashiv, Rav Ovadia Yosef, Rav Wosner and Rav Neuwirth. Problems are covered as far-ranging as the doctor and patient on weekdays and Shabbat, Yom Kippur and Pesach, in the hospital or at home, hospice, end of life and brain death, pregnancy and assisted reproduction, contraception and abortion, brit milah and the medical problems of niddah, medical malpractice and claims, genetic engineering and cloning, DNA and stem cells, AIDS and herpes, the threatened doctor and the psychiatric patient, Hatzalah and preventive medicine and their attendant problems in halacha. The views of leading authorities are comprehensively summarized on each point, covering nearly every issue in medical halacha.

People all over the world send the Schlesinger Institute questions, some of a general, theoretical nature and some of a very specific, technical nature. The questions are answered by one of the rabbi-doctors at the Institute, or, in special cases, by a recognized rabbinical authority. The Chaim Kahn Library and Information Center The Library and Information Center is one of the main resource centers for Jewish medical ethics in Israel. All the standard texts of the Jewish library can be found there, as well as compendiums of halacha, medical and Jewish journals, and legal texts. Computer facilities, a database of Jewish sources, and a bibliography of the library are available to the public. The information center is named after Chaim Kahn, the first chairman of the institute. International conferences Contributions to the halachic approach to medical or ethical questions are made at the international conferences organized by the Schlesinger Institute. These conferences bring together rabbis, doctors, and others from around the world for lectures by experts on contemporary medical halachic issues. Conference proceedings and background materials have been published in both English and Hebrew.

The phrase \\"Bless You Boys\\" was the catchphrase adopted by Detroit sportscaster Al Ackerman for the 1984 Detroit Tigers team that started the year with a 35-5 start. (\\"Sportscaster Al Ackerman coined the phrase \\"Bless You Boys\\" and it stuck.\\") The book The book was published by Contemporary Books and contains Anderson's diary account of the first 151 games of the 1984 Detroit Tigers World Series championship season. The team started the year on a remarkable 35-5 pace and became the first American League team since the 1927 New York Yankees to \\"lead the race from wire-to-wire\\" and win the World Series.Bless You Boys, p. 1 The book was written with the help of Tigers' public relations director Dan Ewald. Anderson noted that he wrote the book by recording his immediate reactions after each game: \\"It was fun. Every night before I went to bed, I'd put the game on tape. This is easy -- you just sit and talk.\\" Success of the book Bless You Boys was released as an \\"insta-book\\" in October 1984 to capitalize on the publicity that followed the Tigers' World Series championship. It was an instant best- seller in the Detroit area. Anderson conducted a week-long book signing tour that opened at the Hudson's store at Northland Mall. The Detroit Free Press reported that the crowd waiting to have Sparky sign the book \\"stretched through most of Hudson's basement, snaking back through the carpet and furniture departments, all the way back to fine furniture.\\" The Detroit Free Press described the public reaction to the book this way: > Hundreds of fans -- some wearing three-piece business suits, some wearing > diapers and seated in strollers, many sporting Detroit Tigers caps -- lined > up in Hudson's Northland basement to have Sparky autograph his new book. ... > It's going faster than World Series tickets, which could make Sparky > something of a threat to Norman Mailer in this writing business. Near the end of the book-signing tour, Anderson noted that his hand was \\"very sore.\\" He added: \\"We're over 100,000 printed now. They say it's the greatest thing they've ever had. They said in New York it was even outselling Iacocca.\\" When U.S. Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro visited Detroit on a campaign stop in late October, she opened her remarks by saying, \\"I just want to start off by saying, bless you, boys -- and girls.\\" One bookstore owner noted there was a mob scene at his store when Anderson showed up to sign his book: \\"There never was anything like it.\\" Critical reception The book also drew attention for Sparky's colorful manner of speech. The Los Angeles Times noted that Sparky needed to read a bit more about the Websters (Noah and Daniel) based on Sparky's statement in the book: \\"I've heard or read all of the adjectives old Daniel Webster put in his dictionary, and none of them does my bullpen justice.\\"  References  Category:Major League Baseball books 1984 Category:1984 non-fiction books Category:1984 Major League Baseball season Category:Detroit Tigers ","title":"Bless You Boys"},{"id":"20785054","text":"Michael Baker (16 February 1957 - 22 September 2012)Sue Littlemore \\"Mike Baker obituary\\", The Guardian, 22 September 2012 was a British journalist best known for his work with the BBC.

It is also known by some other names such as Che√®vre bariol√©e, Fulani, Gorane, Nioro, Niafounk√©, Sah√©lienne, Sahel, and West African Longlegged Goat (WALL-G). Distribution The Sahelian goat belongs to the Savanna group of goats with many types and subtypes raised in the Saharan and sub-Saharan region. Sahelian type of goat is distributed in north and northwest of Mali. The Sahelian goat is most suited to desert or semidesert environments and is intolerant of areas with high humidity. The breed is widely distributed in the arid and semiarid zones of the Sahel, north of 12¬∞N from central Chad in the east to the Atlantic coast in the west and well into the southern Sahara. This is the most suitable place, where most of the world's Sahelian goats are found, although some numbers of this goat breed can also be found elsewhere in the world, especially in such areas where suitable environments or conditions are available, such as Australia. The Sahelian goat is not a trypano-tolerant goat breed, and they usually do not survive for long in forest and dense savanna. They are very strong animals which are found and survive well only in desert environments. They are especially well-adapted to a nomadic life and can fed on a variety of vegetation found within their native regions. Characteristics Sahelian goat is a small sized animal. They are thin in appearance with narrow body, shallow chest and sloping short croup. They have stiff short hair with variety of colors. Their color vary from pure white, cream to red, black or gray sprinkled or pied, gray, brown or black. They have long legs, and pendent or semipendulous ears. Both bucks and does have horns. Most of them (about 70%) have wattles. Udders in females and scrotums in males split into two halves. Average height of the adult Sahelian buck is about 70‚Äì85 cm, and 65‚Äì75 cm for does. The bucks on average weight about 38.5 to 56.7 kg, and average weight of the does is about 25 to 34 kg. Uses The Sahelian goat is a multipurpose goat breed. It is a good meat goat breed, good for skin production, and also very rarely raised for milk. Special considerations Sahelian goats are very strong and hardy animals. First kidding occurs usually about 18 months of age. Does can produce two kids per kidding, but most produce one kid (almost 70%), and their lactation period is usually 5‚Äì6 months.

Males weigh 39 kg on average, and females weigh 24.5 kg on average. Both males and females grow spiral horns. The fur color is white, and occasionally black.  Uses  Pelts = Kids are killed when they are 35 days old for their white, curly pelts. Zhongwei reach sexual maturity at 5‚Äì6 months of age, and are typically mated at 18 months of age with a kidding percentage of 104-106%. = Cashmere = Although they are mainly used for kid pelts, Zhongwei can be used for cashmere production.

It is the first of the fable in the poem to be based on Reynardian and beast epic sources rather than on any strictly Aesopian original, although the closest match from Aesop might be The Dog, the Cock and the Fox. One of its most direct known sources is Geoffrey Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale from the Canterbury Tales written perhaps around ninety years earlier. It might also be argued that Henryson was acquainted with the earlier extended telling of the story in the Reynard cycle. Chanticleir, for example, has three wives, as in the earlier French romance, where Chaucer gives seven to his Chauntecleer. Henryson's version was probably composed sometime around the 1480s. Fable Schir Lowrence, a fox \\"full sair hungrie,\\" creeps one morning early into the farmyard which neighbours the \\"thornie schaw of grit defence\\" which is \\"his residence.\\" He stalks Chanticleir, a cockerel owned by a poor widow highly dependent on her small flock of hens. Pretending he has come to serve Chanticleir, Lowrence uses flattery to praise the bird's voice and trick him into singing on tiptoe with his eyes closed in the manner, supposedly, of his father who he claims also to have served. So close a friend he was to the bird's father that the tod was present at his death to hald his heid and gif him drinkis warme ... syne [say] the dirigie quhen that he wes deid. This complex web of flattery and highly ambiguous assurance persuades Chanticleir to perform the foolish act, allowing Lowrence swiftly to hint him be the throte and hy with him to the wood. Hearing the resultant commotion of the flock, the widow discovers the theft and faints. There is then a brief excursus as the three hens in Chanticleir's harem, Pertok, Sprutok and Toppok, deliver rhetorical responses on the loss of their husband. Pertok eulogises the cock and laments his death, but Sprutok counters this with a strong critical condemnation of the cock, advising Pertok simply to forget him now that he is gone; counsel which persuades Pertok to alter her memory of Chanticleir and resolve, before the week is out, to get ane berne (man) suld better claw oure breik (line 529). Finally Toppok, lyke ane curate, preaches a sermon full crous which pronounces the cockerel's destruction as no more than his just and inevitable reward due to his failure to repent his sexual venality. But Chanticleir is not dead yet. The widow, recovering from her swoon, calls on her troupe of dogs to reskew my nobill cok or he be slane. Chanticleir takes the opportunity of the pursuit of the widow's kennetis (hounds) and Lowrence's physical exhaustion to persuade the fox in mynd (line 556) to turn briefly and assure the dogs that he and the cock are friends. Taken in by this, he opens his mouth to call back enabling Chanticleir to escape into a tree. Lowrence tries a second time to persuade Chanticleir to come to him, but the cock is not fooled twice. Thus Lowrence still goes hungry, while Chanticleir :...over the feildis tuke his flicht :And in at the wedowis lewer couth he licht. (lines 584-5) What Chanticleir's three wives make of his return is left to the reader's imagination. Moralitas wame in froist and snaw... (lines 457-8) The moralitas opens with an observation that the taill is overheillit wyth typis figurall (replete with symbolic meanings). It focusses, however, on one basic message, the sin of pride and the dangers of flattery, expressed in forceful alliterative verse: :Fy, puft- up pryde ! Thow is full poysonabill ! :Quha favoris the on force man haif ane fall: :Thy strenth is nocht, thy stule standis unstabill; :Tak witnes of the feyndis infernall, :Quhilk houndit doun wes fra that hevinlie hall :To hellis hole, and to that hiddeous hous, :Because in pryde thay wer presumpteous... (lines 593-99) while the foxe, we are told, may weill represent flatterers :With fals mening and mynd maist toxicate... (line 602). Despite the forceful rhethoric, the simplicity of the message is qualified and undercut by the writer's admissions that the full range of readings is more complex. In contrast to the relatively plain statement of the moral to the previous fabill (The Twa Mice) Henryson is starting to complicate his inferences. We are not to take the narrator's moralitates as a complete picture. Structure and sources The poem makes a human and existential drama out of a simple act of animal predation and ultimately can only be comic or absurd. The first known example of this narrative idea, exploited for full ironic effect in the genre, is Chaucer's mock heroic Nun's Priest's Tale which Henryson almost certainly used as a source. Chaucer also featured in his poem a long and profoundly comic set of excursuses on dream prediction delivered by the (well-read) victim of the farmyard crime. Henryson's version, which is shorter and more concise, sticks chiefly to the main action but still maintains the complexity of effect which Chaucer demonstrated was possible. The Talking of the Tod opens with a short general prologue (two stanzas) which highlights the instinct-led nature of creatures in the animal kingdom while acknowledging their enormous diversity. A similar set of three verse Romulus stories can be identified in the second half of the poem occupying a position that strongly mirrors the first trio in terms of organisation, though the latter three are not manifestly linked in terms of narrative. Numbers The fable is 27 stanzas; the moralitas is 4 stanzas: * 27 + 4 = 31 The action of the fable itself can be further broken down thus: * Part 1 (stalking Chanticleir) ‚Äî 14 stanzas (of which Lowrence and Chanticleir's dialogue = 7 stanzas) * Part 2 (disputation between the hens) ‚Äî 7 stanzas * Part 3 (denouement; Chanticleir's escape) ‚Äî 6 stanzas See also *The Parson's Tale Category:Aesop's Fables Category:Scottish literature Category:Works by Robert Henryson Category:Scottish poems Category:15th-century poems Category:Narrative poems Category:Reynard cycle ","title":"The Taill of Schir Chanticleir and the Foxe"},{"id":"20785419","text":"The Zhiwulin Black goat breed from the northern Shaanxi Province of China is used for the production of cashmere fiber and meat.

It is a multidisciplinary, not-for-profit, professional association with a membership of approximately 5,500 researchers, practitioners, and human development professionals from over 50 countries. The purposes of the society are to promote multidisciplinary research in the field of human development, to foster the exchange of information among scientists and other professionals of various disciplines, and to encourage applications of research findings. History The field of child development received formal recognition in 1922-23 through the appointment of a subcommittee on Child Development of the National Research Council. In 1925, under the direction of Robert S. Woodworth, an eminent experimental psychologist, this group became the Committee in Child Development with offices and staff in the National Academy of Sciences. The purpose of the committee was to integrate research activities and to stimulate research in child development. The committee awarded fellowships, initiated conferences, and began publications. In 1927, 425 scientists were listed in the Directory of Research in Child Development, and that same year the first volume of Child Development Abstracts and Bibliography (CDAB) was published. In 1933, the Committee on Child Development disbanded and passed the torch to the newly organized Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD). A collection of the organization's records is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. ActivitiesInternational activities= Nearly 20% of SRCD's members are from nations outside the United States, representing over 50 countries around the world. Special efforts are made by the society, through its Committee on International Relations, to increase interaction and communication between members of the society and all researchers in human development throughout the world. =Ethics= Of great importance to the society is the establishment and maintenance of ethical standards for research with children. The Committee on Ethical Conduct in Child Development Research promulgates such standards. =Diversity= The society fosters a commitment to research and training in diversity. The Committees on Ethnic and Racial Issues have made progress in improving, increasing, and disseminating research to members. =Social policy= Under the guidance of the Policy and Communications Committee, the Society helps to bring the results of research to bear on the formulation of policy affecting children and families. One way in which this is done is through the Policy Fellowship Program in Child Development. Begun in 1978, this program is part of a larger fellowship program administered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The goals of this program are to contribute to the effective use of scientific knowledge, to educate the scientific community about the development of public policy, and to establish a more effective liaison between scientists and federal offices. Fellows spend a year as aides or associates in various offices in federal agencies, working with staff in the translation of research to applied issues. Conference In the spring of odd numbered years, the society sponsors a biennial SRCD Conference, a meeting in which members can present individual research reports, symposia, invited lectures, and discussion sessions, among other timely and historical programs. Attendance typically exceeds 5,000 and includes faculty, students, and other individuals who conduct research on child development.

It got its name \\"The Judge\\" in 2006 when Bob Morrison, Executive Vice President, learned that judges in high-crime areas of Miami, Florida, were purchasing the revolver for personal defense in their courtrooms, and after Morrison investigated further, the model designation was changed from 4410 to 4510 to more accurately reflect the revolver's versatility (.45 Colt + 410 shot ‚Üí \\"4510\\"). Taurus International reports that the Judge is their top-selling firearm. The rifling is shallower than normal, giving single-projectile loads less stabilization than they would receive in other handguns while reducing the rapid dispersion of the shot from shotshells. Taurus developed the shallow rifling after numerous experiments to find rifling that worked well with both types of ammunition. Though Taurus deliberately designed the Judge to fire shotshells, the Judge does not qualify as a \\"short-barreled shotgun\\" under the National Firearms Act of 1934 as its rifled barrel makes it a regular handgun. However, the Judge is considered a short-barreled shotgun under California state law, which has a broader definition of \\"short-barreled shotgun,\\" and the Judge is thus illegal to possess in that state.  Models  Taurus Public Defender revolver, detailing the shortened hammer and snub-nose barrel The Judge, a derivative of the Taurus Tracker, comes in three barrel lengths (3\\", 4\\" and 6.5\\" - Tracker), two cylinder lengths (2.5\\" and 3\\"), and two finishes (blued and stainless steel). The 3\\" barrel model also comes in two weight classes, the standard steel construction (29 oz currently, 36 oz previously) and alloy-based \\"Ultra-Lite\\" (22 oz currently, 24 oz previously). Felt recoil can be significant with the Ultra-Lite series, due to its light weight, especially with .45 Colt rounds. As of December 2008, spur-less hammers remain available with all short-barrel lengths of The Judge. Crimson Trace laser grips are available for standard models of this firearm. At the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show in January 2009, Taurus introduced several new models of the Judge. These have been labeled the Public Defender series and are based on the Taurus Model 85 frame. As with the original Judge, these shoot five rounds of either .45 Colt or .410 shot. Taurus is positioning the Public Defender series as a concealed carry piece. Taurus also introduced the tactical R Ported. The Taurus 4510TKR-3SSR (stainless steel) and 4510TKR-3BR (blued) offer a 3‚Ä≥ ported barrel with a Picatinny rail. In 2010 Taurus introduced the Raging Judge which is chambered for .454 Casull as well .45 Colt and 3\\" .410 shot shells. In 2011 at SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nevada Taurus introduced the Raging Judge XXVIII chambered for 28 gauge shot shells. The 67 ounce revolver held five shells in the cylinder and had a 6.5\\" barrel. The cylinder used a double lock-up similar to the Raging Judge chambered in .454 Casull. However, rumors began to quickly circulate during the show that the US' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) seized the prototype guns due to an initial finding that the guns were actually short-barreled shotguns, and therefore illegal.Big gun, Short lived. Taurus 28 Gauge Revolver However, American Rifleman reported that Taurus invited the ATF to a meeting to discuss the revolver, and no ATF determination was made at that time.The Judge Goes Even Bigger Bore On March 27, 2011, Taurus International President and CEO Bob Morrison stated on the Gun Talk radio show that the Taurus Raging Judge XXVIII was still under development.March 27, 2011 Gun Talk radio program Ultimately, the firearm never made it into production and no official statement was made by Taurus about it again. =Carbine= Circuit Judge carbine. Taurus makes an 18.5in barrelled carbine variant of the Taurus Judge revolver along with its partner company, Rossi. The carbine is known as the Taurus/Rossi Circuit Judge. It comes in the original combination chambering of .410 bore and .45 Colt. The Taurus/Rossi Circuit Judge has small blast shields attached to the cylinder to protect the shooter from hot gases escaping between the cylinder and barrel. The carbine has a butt stock and forend made of either Brazilian hardwood or plastic and uses a fiber optic front sight. An optional Picatinny scope mount base allows the user to mount a sight on the top of the frame and a choke is included for turkey hunting. Efficacy Shotshells for use in handguns have long been made by loading handgun cartridges with shot rather than single bullets; they are commonly called \\"snake shot\\" or \\"rat shot\\" indicating their main use for pest control. Standard rifling designed to stabilize bullets scatters shot limiting its effectiveness to very short range.Maj. George C. Nonte, Jr., Handloading for Handgunners, Follet Publishing, 1978, Chapter 14 Shot and Multi-Ball Loads, p.184ff. . To meet this market, Taurus designed the .45 Colt/.410 Judge to use both bulleted cartridges and .410 shotshells. The rifling of the Judge barrel is designed to stabilize bullets but not unduly scatter shot. Taurus also paid attention to effectiveness with buckshot, positioning the Judge as a personal defense weapon. Buckshot shells in .410 bore are not considered especially effective in personal defense, however there are some specific loadings which give excellent performance in gel, at short ranges. One example would be 2 1/2\\" 4 pellet 000 buckshot, such as those offered by Federal and Remington, among others. These loadings give excellent performance in numerous gel tests which can be seen on YouTube. In the original Judge chambering for standard 2\\" .410 shells, each shell contains three 000 buckshot, compared to nine 00 (.33\\") or eight 000 (.36\\") buckshot in the standard 12 gauge shell commonly used for personal defense or big game hunting. In 2008 Taurus introduced the Judge Magnum which can fire either standard 2\\" or 3\\" .410 shotshells which contain five 000 buckshot and are more effective as personal defense rounds. Several ammunition companies offer .410 ammo specifically designed for the Judge with propellant optimized for shorter barrels. The Federal 2\\" 000 buckshot shell contains 4 pellets. The Remington Home Defense 2.5\\" / 64mm 000 buckshot shell also contains 4 pellets. A cylinder full (6 shells) of 3\\" .410 shot shells is the approximate equivalent of three blasts (30; 000 buck pellets) from a 12 gauge shotgun loaded with 000 buck (9; 000 buck pellets each for a total of 27 pellets). The Taurus Judge is based on the Taurus .45 Colt revolver and is adequate for its designed rounds. It was not designed for higher pressures generated by cartridges such as .44 Magnum or .454 Casull; to prevent use of such rounds, the firing chambers of the Judge cylinder are choked to prevent chambering rounds larger in diameter than .410 shotshells and longer than .45 Colt cartridges. Later Taurus introduced the Raging Judge Magnum based on their Raging Bull model designed for magnum cartridges; the Raging Judge Magnum safely chambers .454 Casull as well as .45 Colt cartridges.

In 2008 Bott was the highest rated professor in the United States on the website Ratemyprofessors.com. It was announced in March 2012 that Bott would be leaving his teaching post at BYU to serve as a senior missionary with his wife. Washington Post article In February 2012 Bott was quoted in a Washington Post article about the LDS Church's stand on race. In the article Bott referred to former church teachings and practices, speculating on possible underlying reasons for a ban on ordaining people of black African descent to the LDS priesthood. Whether Bott's reasons for denying ordination to black men prior to 1978 were ever official LDS doctrine or merely folk belief, as some LDS maintain, is disputed. Bott said that one possible reason for the ban was the belief that black people descended from Cain through Egyptus, who married Ham, Noah's son. Bott pointed to a passage in Mormon scripture that suggested to him that Cain's descendants were marked with dark skin and were prohibited from holding the priesthood. Before the priesthood ban was lifted in 1978, some Latter-day Saint leaders had made similar statements. However, the 1978 revelation which lifted the ban said nothing about the reasons for the ban.https://archive.today/20190726012456/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the- genesis-of-a-churchs-stand-on- race/2012/02/22/gIQAQZXyfR_story.html?noredirect=on&utm;_term=.3e74e2ca4d84 On February 29, 2012, the LDS Church issued a press release in response to the Post article, saying that the reasons for the ban are not precisely known, and condemning racism in any form. Then, in December 2013, the LDS Church posted a page on \\"Race and the Priesthood\\" on its official website that described the ban on blacks receiving the priesthood as a product of an \\"American racial culture,\\" not \\"divine disfavor.\\" The statement formally disavowed the past teachings that sought to create doctrinal justifications for the ban: > Today, the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin > is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects actions in a > premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or > people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone > else.

The earliest school for African Americans west of the Mississippi River, it was the only one to operate in the state of Kansas. In the first three decades of the 20th century, its music school was recognized nationally as one of the best. The Jackson Jubilee Singers toured from 1907-1940, and appeared on the Chautauqua circuit. Among the university's most notable alumni were several women who were influential music pioneers in the early 20th century, including Eva Jessye, who created her own choir and collaborated with major artists such as Virgil Thomson and George Gershwin in New York City. Nora Douglas Holt was a composer, music critic and performer who toured in Europe as well as the United States. Etta Moten Barnett became known for singing the lead in Porgy and Bess in revival and on tour. Expanded around the start of the 20th century with an industrial department modeled after Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute, the university served African Americans for several generations. It struggled financially during the Great Depression, as did many colleges, and finally closed in 1943. None of its buildings are still standing. History The first classes of what became Western University were started by Eben Blachley in his home in 1862, who taught the children of freedmen. Most of the homesites of Quindaro were on the bluff; the port's commercial district was in the bottomland near the level of the Missouri River below the bluffs. The area of the Quindaro settlement was annexed by Kansas City in the early 20th century. The town had been started in 1856 by abolitionists, Wyandot, free blacks, and settlers from the New England Emigrant Aid Company. The latter had come from Massachusetts and other northeast states to help Kansas become a free rather than slave state ‚Äî a question to be settled by its voters. They started construction of buildings in January 1857 and a hundred were built in the first year. As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Quindaro absorbed or assisted fugitive slaves before the Civil War and many contrabands (fugitive slaves behind Union lines), especially from Missouri, during the war. After the war, a committee of white men in the community, former abolitionists, organized a school to educate freedmen who had resettled in Quindaro and the Kansas City area. In 1865 the committee registered their county charter for what they called Quindaro Freedman's School. In 1867 the state legislature approved funds for the school. In 1872 the state increased funding to establish a four-year normal school curriculum for the training of teachers. Charles Henry Langston, a prominent activist and politician (and the future grandfather of poet Langston Hughes), was named principal of the normal school.Richard B. Sheridan, \\"Charles Henry Langston and the African American Struggle in Kansas\\", Kansas State History, Winter 1999, p. 282, accessed 21 Dec 2008 Freedmen and blacks free before the war believed that education was key for advancement of their race. State financial difficulties caused it to reduce support following the Panic of 1873, and the school had to reduce its enrollment. Blachley continued to support it, bequeathing of land in the 1870s to help support the college that had developed from his first classes. In the 1880s, Exodusters and other migrants added significantly to the African- American population in Kansas. The college began to be active again. In the late 19th century, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Conference began to help provide financial support for the school. Quindaro added a theological course and constructed Ward Hall in 1891 to accommodate it; the hall was named after a bishop of the AME Church. In 1890 the expanded college's first African-American president was appointed. Programs In 1896 William Tecumseh Vernon, a young AME minister, was appointed as president. He worked to increase state funding. In 1899 he gained legislative approval and financial support to add industrial education to the college, which prompted building numerous structures for the new classes, as well as dormitories. Industrial courses were on the model of Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute: commercial business courses, drafting, printing, carpentry, and tailoring; later, blacksmithing and wheelwrighting were added to prepare students with desired skills for making a living. The campus was expanded with training buildings to house livestock, and another for a laundry. Later a building was added for teaching auto mechanics and repair. A central steam plant was added, as were additional dormitories. From 1916-1918, Inman E. Page was president. The music school was developed after 1903 by Robert G. Jackson, who created the Jackson Jubilee Singers. Fannie De Grasse Black was instructor of pipe organ. From 1907 to 1940, the group was extremely popular. It toured the United States and Canada, performing on the Chautaqua circuit, where it helped create goodwill and raise money for the college through fundraising. In addition, the group's studies and performances helped preserve the spirituals of African-American tradition.Paul Wenske, \\"Western University at Quindaro championed the music of freedom\\", Kansas City Star, 23 Feb 2008, accessed 12 Jan 2009 The late historian and Western alumnus Orrin McKinley Murray, Sr. wrote about the Jackson Jubilee Singers in his 1960 book The Rise and Fall of Western University: > So great was their success in rendering spirituals and the advertising of > the music department of Western University, that all young people who had > any type of musical ambition decided to go to Western University at > Quindaro. The music school's most famous alumni were women who became influential pioneers of the 20th century in composition and music performance, including choral conducting. They included Nora Douglas Holt, Eva Jessye, and Etta Moten Barnett. Nora Holt was a composer, music critic and performer in the US and Europe. Eva Jessye went to New York and founded her own choir, which was featured in her collaboration with composer Virgil Thomson and writer Gertrude Stein on Four Saints in Three Acts. She was selected by George Gershwin as his choral director for his opera Porgy and Bess. .

The series, produced by Norman Lear, was a starring vehicle for Nancy Walker after she gained a new- found television following as both the McMillans' housekeeper Mildred on McMillan & Wife and as Rhoda Morgenstern's mother Ida Morgenstern on Rhoda. The series was a ratings flop and was cancelled after only 12 aired episodes. Synopsis Walker portrayed Nancy Kitteridge, owner of the Nancy Kitteridge Talent Agency in Los Angeles, who led a life that many would find enviable. Nancy operated her agency from her fancy apartment suite, which housed a stream of actors, models, and other showbiz hopefuls who came to Nancy to get advice and their big break; that is, if they weren't famous already. She was happily married, but her husband of 29 years, Lt. Commander Kenneth Kitteridge (William Daniels) was stationed out with the U.S. Navy ten months out of the year, leaving Nancy even more time to devote to her career and all the exciting perks and adventures of a high society Los Angeles life. During the two months that Ken was home, he and Nancy found themselves as newlyweds madly in love. Nancy and Ken had a grown daughter, slow-witted hypochondriac Lorraine (Beverly Archer), who lived nearby with her new husband, Glen (James Cromwell). Although Nancy was hardly lonely when Ken was away, she did have regular male company at home and work (which were practically the same) in unemployed actor and client Terry Folson (Ken Olfson), who was living with his agent while paying room and board as Nancy's secretary. Nancy never had to worry about anything more developing between them, since Terry was gay. However, all this happiness was soon marred when unexpectedly, Ken decided to come home full-time and work locally, primarily to make up for nearly three decades of lost time and devotion to Nancy. Nancy would have been delighted, if it weren't for the fact that Ken insisted on bringing Navy-style order and discipline into her life, while suggesting that other changes be made that would better accommodate him. Needless to say, Nancy was aghast, and their fast repartee and squabbles were a centerpiece of the comedy. While the two often sparred over Ken's prim conduct, Ken also went as far as trying to throw Terry out of their home (he was \\"deadwood\\" in Ken's eyes), and at one point suggested to Nancy that she close down the talent agency so that they could have enough time to spend together. Lorraine and Glen often dropped by to help them sort their disagreements out. Also seen were hot-shot network TV executive Teddy Futterman (William Schallert), who met with Nancy whenever one of her clients had a shot at further stardom, and Futterman's precocious young son, Michael (Sparky Marcus). Cast *Nancy Walker as Nancy Kitteridge *Sparky Marcus as Michael Futterman *William Daniels as Kenneth Kitteridge *Beverly Archer as Lorraine *William Schallert as Teddy Futterman *James Cromwell as Glen *Ken Olfson as .Terry Folson EpisodesNotability The Nancy Walker Show featured one of TV's earliest portrayals of homosexuality, with the character of Terry Folson. The public was not surprised that innovative producer Norman Lear would for once provide the viewing landscape with a gay character, regularly, in a TV series (since it was still rare and uncharted at the time), considering that Lear had been the first to introduce virginal topics such as racism, class structure, menopause, abortion, and the like within a traditional sitcom format. However, at least one American TV series had preceded The Nancy Walker Show with a regular character who was gay; the 1972-73 ABC sitcom The Corner Bar was the first in TV history to have one, with Vincent Schiavelli's bar patron Peter Panama. When Nancy Walker signed on to star in this series, her new contract with ABC permitted her to quickly join another existing project before the 1976-77 season ended if The Nancy Walker Show was cancelled after a very short run. ABC did, indeed, drop the series after 10 episodes, and Walker was quickly hired by Garry Marshall to star in his upcoming sitcom Blansky's Beauties, a spin-off from his top- rated Happy Days. Production on the new series started so soon that Blansky's Beauties premiered on February 12, 1977, less than two months after the cancellation and last broadcast of The Nancy Walker Show. Walker also had time to film a guest appearance as her new character, Nancy Blansky (who, like Nancy Kitteridge in her previous series, also worked in showbiz) on an episode of Happy Days in order to validate Blansky's as a spin-off of the former. Blansky's Beauties also failed in the ratings, and was cancelled in the spring of 1977. Thus, Walker is one of the few actors in television to have starred in two failed vehicles in the same season (Walker's Blansky's Beauties co- star, Pat Morita, also earned this distinction in the 1976-77 season, having headlined his own short-lived ABC sitcom, Mr. T and Tina, in the fall of 1976, before the launch of Blansky's). After her infamous season at ABC, Walker returned to her popular role as Ida Morgenstern on Rhoda in the fall of 1977. Connections to other Norman Lear series Two cast members of The Nancy Walker Show worked with Norman Lear more than once in their careers. James Cromwell was previously seen as Stretch Cunningham, a poker buddy of Archie Bunker, in a number of episodes of All in the Family during 1974 (Cromwell's character had only been referred to in the scripts during the show's first few seasons before he finally appeared on-screen). Child actor Sparky Marcus would be cast in Lear's controversial soap opera parody Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman soon after the cancellation of The Nancy Walker Show. Mary Hartman mentions the show in episode 178, saying she wishes it was still on the air when she learned about her gay neighbors.

It is characterised by achondroplasia or dwarfism, a trait that may have evolved in response to conditions in the humid forests of the area, and also by some degree of resistance to tsetse-borne trypanosomiasis or \\"sleeping-sickness\\". There are many regional strains or breeds within the group; other names for the group as a whole include African Dwarf, Djallonk√© or Fouta Jallon, Grassland Dwarf or Ch√®vre Naine des Savanes, Guinean or Guinean Dwarf, Forest Goat and Pygmy.  History  The West African Dwarf is a traditional breed of West and Central Africa. Its dwarf characteristics may have evolved as a response to conditions in the humid forests of the area. The goats have at various times been exported to European countries and to the United States, initially as zoo animals or for laboratory research. Several breeds derive from these imports, among them the American Pygmy and Nigerian Dwarf in the United States, the Pygmy in the United Kingdom, the Dutch Dwarf or Nederlandse Dwerggeit in the Netherlands, and the Tibetana in Italy.  Characteristics  The West African Dwarf goat is achondroplastic, with a typical height of . Adult males weigh and females . Both sexes have horns, which curve outwards and backwards in males. Males also have beards and sometimes manes. Characteristics include a relatively long neck, broad chest, and straight back. Legs are short and the udder is small but generally well-shaped. Most have short stiff hair, and colour varies; dark brown with black points is probably the most common, but black, red, white, pied, and multi-coloured goats also occur. There are numerous regional breeds or strains within the overall West African Dwarf grouping. These include the Cameroon Dwarf in Cameroon, the Casamance in Senegal, the C√¥te d'Ivoire Dwarf in C√¥te d'Ivoire, the Djougry or Ch√®vre Nain de l'Est in Mauritania, the Ghan Forest in Ghana, the Kirdi in the north of Cameroon and in the south of Chad, the Kosi in Cameroon and the Nigerian Dwarf in Nigeria. In Burkina Faso and Togo, the Fouta Djallon or Djallonk√© sub-group includes traditional strains including the Bath, the Kanem, the Kebbi, the Lac, the Massakori, the Mayo and the Mossi.  Use  West African Dwarf goats are important in the rural village economy of West Africa. Nigerian West African Dwarf goats are trypanotolerant (they resist to infections by Trypanosoma) and haemonchotolerant (they resist infections with the gastrointestinal parasite nematode Haemonchus contortus more effectively than other breeds of domestic goat). West African Dwarf goats are capable of breeding at twelve to eighteen months. Multiple births are very common, with twins being normal and triplets frequent. The kidding interval averages about 220 days. These goats are typically kept as livestock by families who harvest or sell the milk and meat.

It is a dual- purpose breed, reared both for its meat and for its milk. It is named for, and is thought to originate in, the comarca of La Vera, in the province of C√°ceres, in the northern part of the autonomous community of Extremadura in western central Spain. It is one of two traditional goat breeds in Extremadura, the other being the Retinta Extreme√±a.  History  The Verata is a traditional and heterogeneous goat breed from the Tagus depression in western central Spain, bounded to the south by the Montes de Toledo and to the north by the western Sistema Central. It was traditionally reared in the Sierra de Gredos, in the area where the provinces of √Åvila, C√°ceres and Toledo meet. Towards the end of the twentieth century there was some displacement of the breed from its area of origin, the comarca of La Vera, into the comarca of Navalmoral de la Mata to the south.  Characteristics  The Verata has been known to be fairly easy to handle; they are popular in the dairy and meat industries because of that and they can adapt well to the different management systems. They have been known to be very hardy, and can survive in many climates. They are adapted to the mountain pastures because they have strong, long legs, and they can also survive on poor and scarce feed. The Verata Goat is smaller than the average goat, and found in their homes in the Vera in the Caceres region of Spain. They are especially valued for their milk there. Their milk is used in cheese production. Currently, about 17000 Verata Goats inhabit Spain. Generally, these goats are found in herds of 100 to 150 goats. When grazing is scarce, these goats do well on concentrated feed in confinement, as well. When they are mature, these goats generally reach a height around 70 cm, and weigh an average of 70 kg; the does are a bit shorter and lighter than the males. These goats have glossy, short hair in either black or brown. They usually have a black facial fringe, a black underbelly, and a black dorsal ridge. They have horns that go outward, and spiral forward, and well-sprung ribs. They have an erect tail; beards are prominent on the males, and about 40% of the females also have prominent beards. They also have dark, hard hooves. The legs of these goats look rather small; thus, the joints look significantly larger.  Use  Verata Goats are able to breed year round, but breeders and farmers usually breed them in October and November and again in the spring, sometime around March. They have a high fertility rate, and under good conditions, they can have an average of three births every two years. Lactation periods usually last around 175 days, and they yield around 150 l of milk. Kids that have reached around 45 days old can be slaughtered for their meat.

Black Sunday refers to a particularly severe dust storm that occurred on April 14, 1935 as part of the Dust Bowl. It was one of the worst dust storms in American history and it caused immense economic and agricultural damage. It is estimated to have displaced 300 million tons of topsoil from the prairie area.Black Blizzard, History Channel documentary. On the afternoon of April 14, residents of several plains states were forced to take cover as a dust storm or \\"black blizzard\\" blew through the region. The storm hit the Oklahoma panhandle and northwestern Oklahoma first, and moved south for the remainder of the day. It hit Beaver, Oklahoma around 4 p.m., Boise City around 5:15, and Amarillo, Texas at 7:20. The conditions were the most severe in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, but the storm's effects were also felt in other surrounding areas. The combination of drought, erosion, bare soil, and winds caused the dust to fly freely and at high speeds.  The Dust Bowl  The term \\"Dust Bowl\\" initially described a series of dust storms that hit the prairies of Canada and the United States during the 1930s. It now describes the area in the United States most affected by the storms, including western Kansas, eastern Colorado, northeastern New Mexico, and the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles. The \\"black blizzards\\" started in the eastern states in 1930, affecting agriculture from Maine to Arkansas. By 1934, they had reached the Great Plains, stretching from North Dakota to Texas and from the Mississippi River Valley to the Rocky Mountains. The Dust Bowl as an area received its name following the disastrous Black Sunday storm in April 1935 when reporter Robert E. Geiger referred to the region as \\"the Dust Bowl\\" in his account of the storm.  Causes  Cattle farming and sheep ranching had left much of the west devoid of natural grass and shrubs to anchor the soil, and over-farming and poor soil stewardship left the soil dehydrated and lacking in organic matter. A drought hit the United States in the 1930s, and the lack of rainfall, snowfall, and moisture in the air dried out the top soil in most of the country's farming regions.  Effects  The destruction caused by the dust storms, and especially by the storm on Black Sunday, killed multiple people and caused hundreds of thousands of people to relocate. Poor migrants from the American Southwest (known as \\"Okies\\" - though only about 20 percent were from Oklahoma) flooded California, overtaxing the state's health and employment infrastructure. In 1935, after the massive damage caused by these storms, Congress passed the Soil Conservation Act, which established the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) as a permanent agency of the USDA. The SCS was created in an attempt to provide guidance for land owners and land users to reduce soil erosion, improve forest and field land and conserve and develop natural resources. This led to the Great Plains Shelterbelt project.  Personal accounts of Black Sunday and other dust storms  During the 1930s, many residents of the Dust Bowl kept accounts and journals of their lives and of the storms that hit their areas. Collections of accounts of the dust storms during the 1930s have been compiled over the years and are now available in book collections and online. Lawrence Svobida was a wheat farmer in Kansas during the 1930s. He experienced the period of dust storms, and the effect that they had on the surrounding environment and the society. His observations and feelings are available in his memoirs, Farming the Dust Bowl. Here he describes an approaching dust storm: The Black Sunday storm is detailed in the 2012 Ken Burns PBS documentary The Dust Bowl.  In popular culture  Musicians and songwriters began to reflect the Dust Bowl and the events of the 1930s in their music. Woody Guthrie, a singer-songwriter from Oklahoma, wrote a variety of songs documenting his experiences living during the era of dust storms. Several were collected in his first album Dust Bowl Ballads. One of them, Great Dust Storm, describes the events of Black Sunday. An excerpt of the lyrics follows: On the 14th day of April of 1935, There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky. You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black, And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track. From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line, Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande, It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down, We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom. Musician Kat Eggleston wrote a play, The Cyclone Line, about her father Al Eggleston's experiences growing up in 1930s Oklahoma, Black Sunday, and the Dust Bowl in general. Its first public performances were on Vashon (Island), Washington, where he lived most of his life. Americana recording artist Grant Maloy Smith released an album in 2017 called Dust Bowl ‚Äì American Stories that featured two songs which directly referenced Black Sunday. The song \\"Old Black Roller\\" is written from a first person perspective during the Black Sunday storm, and another song \\"Never Seen The Rain\\" has these chorus lyrics: \\"We worked the land to death, me and my brother  'Til April 14, 1935  Oklahoma, you were like our mother - oh, my\\" American recording artist Gillian Welch refers to the storm and other historical events in a two-part song on her 2001 album Time (The Revelator): \\"April the 14th Part I\\" and \\"Ruination Day Part II\\".

Based on an actual incident in 1964, its protagonist is Hallie, a Pittsburgh seventh-grader coping with the mental depression of her laid off father, an iron worker, and the separation she undergoes. An incomplete bridge across the Allegheny River serves as constant reminder that his vocation is gone and this fact prompts a spectacular dramatic act. Plot summary After losing his job as a bridge-builder, Hallie's father begins suffering from depression and fits of anger, which lead Hallie into bouts of isolation. At the onset of the novel, she accompanies her mother to follow her father in order to see where he is going. as he doesn't have a job. They see him standing on top of the \\"Bridge to Nowhere,\\" a bridge project that he was never able to finish. They return, and a tense evening follows. Hallie tries to communicate with her mother and father, but they are too much blinded by their own fears, doubts, and regrets, that she simply retreats to her room instead. She talks with her friend Jude from school, who is more receptive to Hallie's family issues, but isn't what Hallie needs. Hallie then develops a friendship with Crane Henderson, a high school freshman. She is intimidated at first by his age and popularity, but, after Crane and her go for a walk through the woods, he becomes more comforting and easy to talk to around her. As their relationship grows, Hallie's family life becomes more dreary. Her sister Shelley returns from college, but her jaded attitude towards her family does little to easy Hallie's troubles. In addition, Shelley doesn't want to spend time with Hallie, furthering her younger sister's alienation at home. Crane continues to act as an outlet for Hallie, as someone to talk to. They both go to the bridge one day, where Hallie spots her father standing dangerously high up. As Crane attempts to get his attention, Hallie runs from the scene, afraid he'll find out the man on the bridge is her father. Having alienated Crane, Hallie has no one left to talk to, and finally yells at her father for never talking to her anymore. The next day, she finds that he has driven his car over the edge of the bridge, and was taken to the hospital. She rushes to see him, against her mother's will, and finds that he suffers from amnesia as a result of the accident. Her father returns home after a short stay in the hospital, and is seemingly cured of his bitterness, to the family's relief.http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=14197533673&searchurl;=isbn%3D0531054780 Characters ¬∑ Hallie: Daughter of Jim, and protagonist of the story. She suffers from lack of communication with her mother and father, and struggles with growing up in an atmosphere where she cannot discuss her distress. ¬∑ Crane Henderson: Crane is a high school freshman, interested in Hallie. He talks to her frequently, and serves as one of the only characters who can communicate with her. He develops a relationship with Hallie over the course of the novel. ¬∑ Louise: Hallie's mother. Similar to her father, she is somewhat distant as well. She attempts to keep the household together despite the lack of income and the issues presented by Jim's out-of-work status. ¬∑ Jude: Hallie's best friend from school. ¬∑ Shelley: Hallie's sister, an older college student. She is also a distant figure in Hallie's life. Shelley is bitter towards her father, and chooses not to spend time with her younger sister. ¬∑ Jim: Hallie's father, who lost his job building the bridge and suffers from depression as a result. He is distant and uncommunicative, and spends his time submerging himself within television, radio, and other diversions. He is prone to bursts of anger, and is a volatile source of anxiety within the family. Themes ¬∑ Communication: Communication is central to the text. The majority of the characters are stilted, or lacking, in their conversation, which denies Hallie an outlet for her issues. ¬∑ Detachment: The characters exhibit distance in their communications with Hallie. They are possessed by issues that cloud the importance of the other people in their lives. ¬∑ Relationships: Relationships are important to Hallie, but they aren't fulfilling. The novel illustrates a young child's need for relationships in his or her life. ¬∑ Nature: The processes of nature serve as a backdrop to the unnatural constriction of Hallie's home life. Animals are displayed in their natural settings, seen communicating with each other, and using their instincts to live their lives. Symbolism ¬∑ Bridges: The unfinished bridge is a source of frustration for Hallie's father. It causes him to become distant and uncommunicative. The symbol of the unfinished bridge not only causes the domestic stress and disconnect, but it represents the disconnect between Hallie and the people in her life. ¬∑ Animals: The communications and nests of birds are antithetical to Hallie's home life, which is void of meaningful communication, as well as a nourishing domestic space, which the nest is representative of. Also, the mice Hallie purchases from the pet store represent family, as they give birth. One of the characters states that mice sometimes eat their young, again, representing the antagonism that Hallie faces from her father. ¬∑ Telephones: Telephone use is somewhat heavy throughout the text, furthering the theme of communication. Characters talk on the phone superficially, which demonstrates the further decay of communication that takes place within the text. Reception The novel has received mixed reviews, mostly negative, the main complaints residing in the area of poor narrative structure. A small article in \\"Publisher's Weekly\\" notes that that novel's \\"grasp on time, narrative structure and characterization remains rather shaky ... McDonald does practically nothing to anchor the story in [its time] period.\\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-531-05478-9 Critics see the ending as particularly weak, noting that McDonald's employment of amnesia to tie up the story is too convenient. Kirkus Reviews describes \\"the book's greatest strength\\" are \\"the fully-realized characters ... The writing, too, is unusually well-crafted: accessible, lyrical, with wonderfully natural dialogue.\\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/megan-mcdonald/the- bridge-to-nowhere/ References Category:1993 American novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh ","title":"The Bridge to Nowhere (novel)"},{"id":"20785798","text":"Lea Manor High School Performing Arts College is a secondary school in Luton, Bedfordshire which opened in 1974.

Since January 8, 2020, he has served as the 29th district attorney of San Francisco.  Early life and education  Boudin was born in New York City to Jewish parents. His parents, Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, were Weather Underground members. When Boudin was 14 months old, his parents were arrested for murder in their role as getaway car drivers in the Brink's robbery of 1981 in Rockland County, New York. His mother was sentenced to 20 years to life and his father to 75 years to life for the felony murders of two police officers and a security guard. After his parents were incarcerated, Boudin was raised in Chicago by adoptive parents Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who, like his parents, had been members of the Weather Underground. Boudin reports that he did not learn to read until age 9. Kathy Boudin was released under parole supervision in 2003. Boudin descends from a long left-wing lineage. His great-great-uncle, Louis B. Boudin, was a Marxist theoretician and author of a two-volume history of the Supreme Court's influence on American government, and his grandfather Leonard Boudin was an attorney who represented controversial clients such as Fidel Castro and Paul Robeson. Boudin is also related to Michael Boudin, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and Isidor Feinstein Stone, an independent journalist. Boudin entered St Antony's College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship in 2003. At Oxford, he earned two master's degrees, one in forced migration and the other in public policy in Latin America. He earned his Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 2011 and began work for the San Francisco Public Defender's Office as a post-doctoral fellow in 2012.  Career  Before law school, Boudin traveled to Venezuela and served as a translator in the administration of then-president Hugo Ch√°vez. After law school, from 2011 to 2012, Boudin served as a law clerk to M. Margaret McKeown on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He was a 2012‚Äì2013 Liman Fellow at the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, and in 2013 and 2014, he served as a clerk to Charles Breyer on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In 2015, Boudin began working full time at the San Francisco Public Defender's Office as a deputy public defender. While there, he argued on behalf of the office's clients that California's bail system is unconstitutional, leading to the landmark decision In re Kenneth Humphrey, in which the state's First District Court of Appeals held that judges must give consideration to a defendant's ability to pay before setting bail. Boudin also serves on the board of the Civil Rights Corps, a national non-profit organization, and is on the board of Restore Justice, a non-profit based in California. Boudin translated Understanding the Bolivarian Revolution: Hugo Ch√°vez Speaks with Marta Harnecker into English, co-edited Letters from Young Activists: Today's Young Rebels Speak Out, and co-wrote The Venezuelan Revolution: 100 Questions ‚Äì 100 Answers. His latest book, Gringo: A Coming of Age in Latin America, was released in April 2009 by Charles Scribner's Sons. The book received mixed reviews. = District Attorney of San Francisco = 2019 election  In the 2019 election, Boudin was elected San Francisco District Attorney, defeating interim district attorney Suzy Loftus. Boudin campaigned for the office on a decarceration platform of eliminating cash bail, establishing a unit to re-evaluate wrongful convictions and refusing to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with raids and arrests. The San Francisco Police Officers Association and other law enforcement groups spent $650,000 in an unsuccessful effort to defeat Boudin. Attorney General William Barr criticized Boudin and like-minded DA's, accusing them of undermining the police, letting criminals off the hook and endangering public safety. In an interview during the COVID-19 pandemic, Boudin questioned whether the nation \\"can safely continue the national system of mass incarceration. Why do we need to take people to jail for non-violent offenses if what they really need is drug treatment or mental health services?\\"  Tenure  On January 8, 2020, Boudin was sworn in as San Francisco district attorney by San Francisco mayor London Breed.https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/San-Francisco-leaders-and-a- Supreme-Court-14960985.php On January 10, two days after being sworn in, Boudin fired six prosecutors. On January 14, Boudin announced the first implementation of a primary caregiver diversion program authorized by SB394. On January 22, he fulfilled a key campaign promise by eliminating cash bail and replacing it with a \\"risk-based system,\\" in which prosecutors evaluate whether or not a defendant poses a threat to public safety as a condition for their pretrial release. John Raphling, a senior researcher at the Human Rights Watch, praised the decision, stating that bail and pretrial incarceration has been used \\"as leverage to pressure people to plead guilty regardless of actual guilt.\\" Conversely, Tony Montoya, president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, condemned the decision by claiming that the risk-based system is an \\"arbitrary math equation\\" and that the change would create a \\"criminal justice revolving door\\". On January 26, Boudin suspended the process of prosecuting Jamaica Hampton, a man who was shot and seriously injured in an altercation with police, during which he was captured in body camera footage striking an officer with a liquor bottle, in San Francisco's Mission District. This was characterized in some press reports as \\"dropping charges\\", however Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the DA's office, stated that charges had not yet been filed. The DA's office would therefore retain the right to resume the prosecution at a later time. The decision to suspend the process in January was made in order to avoid a conflict between the prosecution of Hampton, and the investigation and potential prosecution of the officer, who may potentially be charged for the shooting. The police union, which opposed Boudin's election, criticized the decision as \\"giving criminals a green light\\" to attack police officers. On February 28, Boudin announced his office would no longer seek charges for contraband found during ‚Äúpretextual‚Äù traffic stops and would not charge status enhancements that increase jail sentences, such as those imposed for gang membership or for having three strikes. He explained that extensive, empirical evidence demonstrated the ineffectiveness of those policies and discrimination against marginalized communities. On April 9, Boudin announced that his office secured temporary housing units for survivors of domestic violence. On April 21, Boudin established an Economic Crimes Unit to protect worker's rights. On July 16, that unit filed an employee protection action against DoorDash alleging the company has and continues to illegally classify its delivery workers as independent contractors. On June 1, Boudin called on the State Bar to create a new ethics rule to end the conflict of interest between prosecutors and police unions. On June 2, Boudin partnered with Supervisor Shamann Walton to announce a resolution prohibiting the hiring of law enforcement officers with prior findings of misconduct. The resolution was adopted by the Board of Supervisors on June 23. On June 5, as part of a series of reforms targeted at holding police accountable, Boudin announced a new policy requiring prosecutors to review all available evidence before charging any cases involving allegations of resisting or obstructing police officers or committing an assault on officers. On June 15, Boudin announced a policy directive to prevent the charging and prosecution of cases relying upon the word of officers who have previously been found to have committed serious misconduct. On June 18, Boudin and three other district attorneys called on the California Victims' Compensation Board to provide victim compensation to victims and witnesses of police violence. On July 1, Boudin joined a grassroots law project to announce the formation of a local \\"Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission.\\"  Personal life  Boudin lives in the Outer Sunset neighborhood of San Francisco with his wife Valerie Block, a post- doctoral researcher at University of California, San Francisco.

It was a specialist Science College with 767 pupils aged 4‚Äì16.\\"Al-Hijrah School\\" It closed 31 August 2019. History The school was established by the Al-Hijrah Trust, a charitable organisation that was formed in Birmingham by a group of Muslims led by Mohammad Abdul Karim Saqib, on 17 July 1988. The school started in Birmingham Central Mosque, operating in three rented rooms. In 1990, the school moved to new premises at Midland House in Small Heath and, throughout the 1990s, the school continued to grow. In 1997, the Trust acquired the former Cherrywood Grammar School in Bordesley Green premises from the Birmingham Local Education Authority. The purpose-built school building was constructed in 1912 and housed the grammar school, which eventually became a comprehensive school until the buildings were closed in 1994. The building remained empty until it was purchased and an extensive renovation programme funded by the Trust commenced. The new school buildings were opened to pupils on 1 September 1999. In autumn 2001, the school ceased being a private school and received voluntary-aided school status. The school continued to grow and exceeding its sponsorship target of ¬£30,000 in 2008 for small schools, receiving ¬£58,000. Due to the success of the school, new premises were considered to allow the school to expand. In December 2013 Al-Hijrah School was rated \\"inadequate\\" and placed in special measures by Ofsted.Police 'could be sent' into failing Birmingham school, 26 May 2014\\"Muslim extremists, and a worrying lesson for us all\\", 16 Mar 2014 Amid what Ofsted called ‚Äútoo heavy involvement‚Äù by governors in the day-to-day running of the school, it had gone through three head teachers in the 18 months to March 2014. Soon after this Birmingham City Council replaced the governors of the school with an interim executive board. The council has stated that the governing body had created a considerable budget deficit.\\"Al-Hijrah School: Council 'blew budget on mobile classrooms' claim\\", 5 Jun 2014 In December 2014 Birmingham City Council announced that it was investigating claims that state-funding for Al-Hijrah School was diverted to set up a school in Pakistan.\\"Birmingham trust 'set up Pakistan school with public cash'\\", 1 Dec 2014 In September 2016, the school was at the centre of a legal battle over alleged sex discrimination and sought to prevent publication of an Ofsted report that criticised the school for its policy of separating boys and girls at the school. In July 2017, the High Court ruled that Ofsted could name the school, but that Ofsted had been \\"erroneous\\" to claim that such separation was illegal. In July 2017, the Department of Education ordered the leadership of the school to be taken over by an independent trust after books were found in the library which said that a man can beat his wife and that a wife must submit to her husband even if she doesn't want to have sex. In 2019, Ofsted reported that gender segregation in the school was significant and ongoing, including requiring girls to wait to eat until \\"all the boys had finished.\\" The school closed on 31 August 2019. It has been succeeded by the Olive School, Small Heath, an Islamic school serving children ages 4 through 11 years. Pupils The 285 pupils were split into separate male and female classes. 75% of pupils were of the Pakistani ethnic minority group. The school received over 1,000 applications for 60 places, making it the most over-subscribed school in the United Kingdom.

He grew up on Birchensale Farm in Brockhill Lane on the outskirts of Redditch, Worcestershire. On finishing his schooling at Redditch County High School, aged 16, he was given a scholarship at the Birmingham College of Art where, from 1931, he worked under Bernard Fleetwood-Walker, Harold Holden, Henry Sands, Michael Fletcher and William Colley. During World War II, his work on the family farm was a reserved occupation, though he did undertake St John's Ambulance and Civil Defence duties. He also briefly worked in London, for journals such as Punch. After World War II he took up lecturing at the Birmingham College of Art. He also taught at the Bournville Art College and at Aston, and later in 1953 moved to Redditch School of Art. On the death of the then principal the School became part of Redditch College with Neasom becoming Head of Department. In 1979 he retired in order to devote all his time to painting, and became a member of the Royal Watercolour Society. Neasom exhibited at the Royal Academy, The Royal Watercolour Society, Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA), Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, The Mall Gallery, Chris Beetles Gallery and the Stratford Art Society.

A proposition is considered to have objective truth when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a sentient subject. Scientific objectivity refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence. Objectivity in the moral framework calls for moral codes to be assessed based on the well-being of the people in the society that follow it. Moral objectivity also calls for moral codes to be compared to one another through a set of universal facts and not through Subjectivity. Objectivity of knowledge Plato considered geometry a condition of idealism concerned with universal truth. His contrasting between objectivity and opinion became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of reality, truth, and existence. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of sensibilities, as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable incorporeality. Where Plato distinguished between how we know things and their ontological status, subjectivism such as George Berkeley's depends on perception. In Platonic terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and subjective knowledge. Platonic idealism is a form of metaphysical objectivism, holding that the ideas exist independently from the individual. Berkeley's empirical idealism, on the other hand, holds that things only exist as they are perceived. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in his epistemology, which is based on mathematics, and his metaphysics, where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change. In opposition to philosopher Ren√© Descartes' method of personal deduction, natural philosopher Isaac Newton applied the relatively objective scientific method to look for evidence before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to Kant's rationalism, logician Gottlob Frege applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of consciousness, then it would logically include a plurality of indescribable forms. Objectivity requires a definition of truth formed by propositions with truth value. An attempt of forming an objective construct incorporates ontological commitments to the reality of objects. The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the observer effect of quantum mechanics. Direct or na√Øve realists rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while instrumentalists hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the philosophy of science. Philosophies of mind explore whether objectivity relies on perceptual constancy.Tyler Burge, Origins of Objectivity, Oxford University Press, 2010. Objectivity in ethicsEthical subjectivism= The term \\"ethical subjectivism\\" covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's ideal observer theory held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also ethical egoism). According to non- cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on A. J. Ayer's emotivism, the statement, \\"Murder is wrong\\" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, \\"Murder, Boo!\\" =Ethical objectivism= According to the ethical objectivist, the truth or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false‚Äîno matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, Kantianism, utilitarianism, and certain forms of ethical egoism and contractualism. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference‚Äîand, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements. Moral objectivism and relativism Moral objectivism is the view that what is right or wrong doesn't depend on what anyone thinks is right or wrong. Moral objectivism depends on how the moral code affects the well-being of the people of the society. Moral objectivism allows for moral codes to be compared to each other through a set of universal facts than mores of a society. Nicholas Reschar defines mores as customs within every society (i.e. what women can wear) and states that moral codes cannot be compared to one's personal moral compass. An example is the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant which says: \\"Act only according to that maxim [i.e., rule] whereby you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\\" John Stuart Mill was a consequential thinker and therefore proposed utilitarianism which asserts that in any situation, the right thing to do is whatever is likely to produce the most happiness overall. Moral relativism is the view where a moral code is relative to an agent in their specific moral context.Wreen, Michael. ‚ÄúWhat Is Moral Relativism?‚Äù Philosophy: The Journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy, vol. 93, no. 365, July 2018, pp. 337‚Äì354. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=pif&AN;=PHL2371955&site;=ehost- live The rules within moral codes are equal to each other and are only deemed \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" within their specific moral codes. Relativism is opposite to Universalism because there is not a single moral code for every agent to follow. Relativism differs from Nihilism because it validates every moral code that exists whereas nihilism does not. When it comes to relativism, Russian philosopher and writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky, coined the phrase \\"If God doesn't exist, everything is permissible\\". That phrase was his view of the consequences for rejecting theism as a basis of ethics. American anthropologist Ruth Benedict argued that there is no single objective morality and that morality varies with culture.  Critique of Moral Objectivity  Morals are created when the social norms in a society will influence an agent to perform an action. Over time, agents will become attached to the approved behavior and will be rewarded in society for upholding the desired actions. These norms force agents to think about what it takes to satisfy these norms. From the reinforcement of the social norms, an agent can have the reasons for the norms ingrained in their decision-making process. All of this can mean nothing to an agent if they do not consider what their future version of themselves will become. Once that inconsideration of the future takes place, an agent might only care about the present and make decisions based on the advancement of themselves rather than being considerate of social norms.

City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City. . A dystopia (from Ancient Greek Œ¥œÖœÉ- \\"bad\\" and œÑœåœÄŒøœÇ \\"place\\"; alternatively cacotopiaCacotopia (from Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œåœÇ kakos \\"bad\\") was the term used by Jeremy Bentham in his 1818 Plan of Parliamentary Reform ( ) or simply anti- utopia) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening. It is an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work, published in 1516, which created a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty. Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization, tyrannical governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations, particularly in stories set in the future. Some of the most famous examples are Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932), George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1953). Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Some scholars, such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent, make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes, whereas anti-utopias function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia. In Dystopia: A Natural History, Claeys offers a historical approach to these definitions. Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution. Its commonly anti-collectivist character is stressed, and the addition of other themes‚Äîthe dangers of science and technology, of social inequality, of corporate dictatorship, of nuclear war‚Äîare also traced. In conclusion, a dystopia is an imagined society that is the exact opposite of a utopia. Etymology Though several earlier usages are known, dystopia was used as an antonym for utopia by John Stuart Mill in one of his 1868 Parliamentary Speeches (Hansard Commons) by adding the prefix \\"dys\\" ( \\"bad\\") to \\"topia\\", reinterpreting the initial \\"u\\" as the prefix \\"eu\\" ( \\"good\\") instead of \\"ou\\" ( \\"not\\"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: \\"It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable\\".Cf. \\"Dystopia Timeline\\" , in Exploring Dystopia, \\"edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')\\" (hem.passagen.se), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., Web, 22 May 2009. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a \\"dystopia\\" is: \\"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics.\\" The example of first usage given in the OED (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the OED include: See also Michael S. Roth, \\"A Dystopia of the Spirit\\" 230ff., Chap. 15 in J√∂rn R√ºsen, Michael Fehr, and Thomas Rieger, eds., Thinking Utopia, Google Books Preview, n.d., Web, 22 May 2009. Decades before the first documented use of the word \\"dystopia\\" was \\"cacotopia\\"/\\"kakotopia\\" (using , \\"bad, wicked\\") originally proposed in 1818 by Jeremy Bentham, \\"As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described\\".Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œås, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, on PerseusBentham, Jeremy. (1818). Plan of Parliamentary Reform, in the form of a catechism. Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use; Anthony Burgess, author of A Clockwork Orange, said it was a better fit for Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four because \\"it sounds worse than dystopia\\".Beaumont, Matthew. (2006). Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England's Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870‚Äì1900. ELH, 73(2): 465‚Äì487.  Society  People Leaving the Cities, photo art by Zbigniew Libera, imagines a dystopian future in which people have to leave dying metropolises Dystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst-case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution. Dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of their creators' contemporaneous culture. Due to this, they can be considered a subject of social studies. In a 1967 study, Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that, while the world goes to waste for future generations, people distract themselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment. In the 2010s, there was a surge of popular dystopian young adult literature and blockbuster films. Some have commented on this trend, saying that \\"it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism\\". Cultural theorist and critic Mark Fisher identified the phrase as encompassing the theory of capitalist realism ‚Äê the perceived \\"widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\\" - and used the above quote as the title to the opening chapter of his book, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?. In the book, he also refers to dystopian film such as Children of Men (originally a novel by P. D. James) to illustrate what he describes as the \\"slow cancellation of the future\\". Theo James, an actor in Divergent, explains that \\"young people in particular have such a fascination with this kind of story [...] It's becoming part of the consciousness. You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time ‚Äì the statistics of our planet warming up. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably ‚Äì consciously or not ‚Äì are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in.\\" Common themesPolitics= In When the Sleeper Wakes, H. G. Wells depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow.William Steinhoff, \\"Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on 1984\\" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . George Orwell contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's The Iron Heel, where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.William Steinhoff, \\"Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on 1984\\" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . The political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or \\"perfect worlds\\") are idealistic in principle and result in positive consequences for the inhabitants; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one fatal flaw.\\"Utopia\\", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed., 2004, Dictionary.com, Web, 11 February 2007.Mary Ellen Snodgrass, Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature, ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii. Dystopias are often filled with pessimistic views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an \\"iron fist\\". Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a \\"resistance\\" to enact change within their society, as is seen in Alan Moore's V for Vendetta.Jane Donawerth, \\"Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia\\", in Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination, ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003). Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as We, Parable of the Sower, Darkness at Noon, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, The Hunger Games, Divergent and Fahrenheit 451 and such films as Metropolis, Brazil, Battle Royale, FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions, Soylent Green, Logan's Run, and The Running Man. =Economics= The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. There are several archetypes that such societies tend to follow. A theme is the dichotomy of planned economies versus free market economies, a conflict which is found in such works as Ayn Rand's Anthem and Henry Kuttner's short story \\"The Iron Standard\\". Another example of this is reflected in Norman Jewison's 1975 film Rollerball. Some dystopias, such as that of Nineteen Eighty-Four, feature black markets with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain or the characters may be at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial, unsatisfying and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.Howard P. Segal, \\"Vonnegut's Player Piano: An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia,\\" 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . In Tanith Lee's Don't Bite the Sun, there is no want of any kind - only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.Lee, Tanith. Don't Bite the Sun. Bantam Books:1999. Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in Brave New World, the state often controls the economy; a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.William Matter, \\"On Brave New World\\" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . Other works feature extensive privatization and corporatism; both consequences of capitalism, where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by and function as government. This is seen in the novels Jennifer Government and Oryx and Crake and the movies Alien, Avatar, RoboCop, Visioneers, Idiocracy, Soylent Green, THX 1138, WALL-E and Rollerball. Corporate republics are common in the cyberpunk genre, as in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (as well as the film Blade Runner, influenced by and based upon Dick's novel). Class Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working class. In the novel Brave New World, written in 1931 by Aldous Huxley, a class system is prenatally determined with Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.William Matter, \\"On Brave New World\\" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that exist in the conventional way but which the class system describe as \\"savages\\". In Ypsilon Minus by Herbert W. Franke, people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups. =Family= Some fictional dystopias, such as Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451, have eradicated the family and keep it from re- establishing itself as a social institution. In Brave New World, where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts of \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" are considered obscene. In some novels, such as We, the state is hostile to motherhood, as a pregnant woman from One State is in revolt.Gorman Beauchamp, \\"Zamiatin's We\\" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . =Religion= Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In Brave New World the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them \\"T\\"s, (as symbols of Henry Ford's Model T).William Matter, \\"On Brave New World\\" 94, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction. . Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale takes place in a future United States under a Christian- based theocratic regime.Margaret Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale, McClelland and Stewart, 1985. . One of the earliest examples of this theme is Robert Hugh Benson's Lord of the World, about a futuristic world where the Freemasons have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a Roman Catholic minority. =Identity= In the Russian novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names. In some dystopian works, such as Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality. =Violence= Violence is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of war, but also in urban crimes led by (predominately teenage) gangs (e.g. A Clockwork Orange), or rampant crime met by blood sports (e.g. Battle Royale, The Running Man, The Hunger Games and Divergent). It's also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay \\"Ground Zero\\", where she explains her experience of the aftermath of September 11, 2001. =Nature= Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.\\"Avatism and Utopia\\" 4, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction.. Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously anti-social in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, as well as within Bradbury's short story \\"The Pedestrian\\". In C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength, science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts. In Brave New World, the lower class is conditioned to be afraid of nature but also to visit the countryside and consume transport and games to promote economic activity. Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against human instincts. E. M. Forster's \\"The Machine Stops\\" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination. As Angel Galdon-Rodriguez points out, this sort of isolation caused by external toxic hazard is later used by Hugh Howey in his series of dystopias of the Silo Series. Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as The Matrix, RoboCop, WALL-E, April and the Extraordinary World and Soylent Green. A few \\"green\\" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in Michael Carson's short story \\"The Punishment of Luxury\\", and Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, \\"a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the Iron Age\\". Self, W. (2002) p. V of introduction to Hoban, R. (2002)[1980] Riddley Walker. Bloomsbury, London. =Science and technology= Contrary to the technologically utopian claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.Rushkoff, D. (2002). \\"Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative.\\" Explorations in Media Ecology, 1(1), 21‚Äì32. Typical dystopian claims 1\\\\. Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature. Jaron Lanier, a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. \\"I think it‚Äôs a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility\\", he says. ‚Äú'Oh, it‚Äôs the computer that did it, not me.' 'There‚Äôs no more middle class? Oh, it‚Äôs not me. The computer did it'‚Äù (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.Chandler, D. (3 July 2013). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved 2 March 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html 2\\\\. Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.Rosenbaum, R. (1 January 2013). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved 2 March 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the- web-165260940/?all&no-ist; * decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use * virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays 3\\\\. Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). Douglas Rushkoff, a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers \\"re-mystified\\" the computer so it wasn't so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users. 4\\\\. New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies). 5\\\\. The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative. ‚Äú 'The most common way is that there‚Äôs some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there‚Äôs another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs huge but very much like Facebook, it‚Äôs selling people back to themselves‚Ä¶ [With translation] you‚Äôre producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren‚Äôt paid for their work‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre actually shrinking the economy.'‚Äù 6\\\\. More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).Heitman, B. (13 April 2011). \\"The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood\\". (Books) (Book review). The Christian Science Monitor, 146‚Äì150. In his article \\"Prest-o! Change-o!,‚Äù technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem \\"it is meant to solve\\". Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching. 7\\\\. New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems. The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine's example of Indonesians ‚Äú'whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,‚Äô and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied\\". Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems. 8\\\\. Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). The need for business replaced community and the \\"story online\\" replaced people as the \\"soul of the Net\\". Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.

It was originally formed from artillery elements of the 5th Armored Division, and its lineage is today perpetuated by the 75th Cavalry Regiment. The battalion operated in northern France with Third Army in 1944, where it fought in Brittany at the capture of Brest, and then along the Moselle River, reaching Germany at the end of the year. During the Battle of the Bulge, it was engaged at the Siege of Bastogne along with the 101st Airborne Division, where it received the Presidential Unit Citation, and in the spring of 1945 it advanced through southern Germany with the 11th Armored Division, reaching Austria by the end of the war. Early service The battalion was formed in December 1941, around a cadre taken from the 58th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, part of the 5th Armored Division. It trained in California and Texas, equipped with M3 GMCs, before moving to Oregon in early 1943 and receiving the new M10 tank destroyer. Whilst at the Tank Destroyer Center in Texas, they were described by General A. D. Bruce as \\"the finest\\" tank destroyer battalion yet trained.11th Armored Division (1992), p. 55 The battalion transferred to New York, and then boarded the liner Queen Elizabeth on 18 April for the voyage to the United Kingdom. It arrived in Scotland on the 27th, and set up camp in southern England on 1 June. France The battalion sailed for Normandy in July, and was landed at Utah Beach on the 18th, equipped with M18 Hellcat tank destroyers.TD Battalion Histories After two weeks of being held in reserve, they were moved to the front line on the 31st and attached to a task force of Third Army which was assigned to capture the ports along the north coast of Brittany;Zaloga, p. 16 it pushed through Avranches and turned westwards towards Brest; from 6 to 16 August B Company was attached to the 83rd Infantry Division. On 17 August, the battalion liberated the town of Paimpol, on the north coast of Brittany. M18 of the battalion fighting inside Brest On 23 August, one company (B) was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, fighting in the Battle for Brest; it was released on 19 September. Meanwhile, the remainder of the battalion was employed fighting on the Crozon Peninsula to the south of the port through September. A shortage of the M18 Hellcat in the supply chain ‚Äì most battalions in France were equipped with M10s at the time ‚Äì led to the battalion being assigned a number of M4A3 Shermans, which carried the same 76mm gun, as temporary replacements.Zaloga, p. 17 The battalion regrouped in late September, and trained replacements, before moving to the Moselle River. The battalion was attached to the 95th Infantry Division on 15 October, and deployed to relieve the 818th Tank Destroyer Battalion in the Pagny bridgehead on the 20th. It withdrew from the bridgehead in early November, after providing indirect fire support,After Action Report, 419th Field Artillery Battalion, 1 December 1944 and was released by the 95th Division on 2 November. It crossed the Moselle again and moved northeast, crossing the border into Germany near Merschweiler on 18 November. Ardennes On 16 December, the Germans launched a major offensive throughout the Ardennes region of the Western Front, which would later become known as the Battle of the Bulge. The 705th, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Clifford D. Templeton, was ordered by Ninth Army to move south in the evening of 18 December, and join VIII Corps at Bastogne, a town on a critical road junction in the southern Ardennes.Marshall, p. 9 After delays to secure the town of La Roche, and a short engagement in which the command group was attacked, the command and combat elements of the battalion had fully arrived in Bastogne late on the night of 19 December.Marshall, p. 21 Templeton detached two platoons to hold a bridge at Ortheuville and a platoon to La Roche,Cole, p. 308; Marshall, p. xii and the supply and support elements were sent west, escorted by a single M18 and instructed to \\"hook up with some big friends\\". Tank Destroyer Battalion (SP) Structure - March 1944 A platoon was sent north from Bastogne on the early morning of the 20th to help relieve Task Force Desobry, defending the northeast approaches to the town. The platoon, accompanying a battalion of paratroopers, blunted the attack of the 2nd Panzer Division, destroying a number of German tanks.Eisenhower, p. 315\\\\. It is interesting to note that Eisenhower specifically singles out the 705th as having \\"90-mm tank destroyers ... worth their weight in gold\\", whilst the battalion was mainly equipped with 76mm M18 Hellcats. The battalion was formally attached to the 101st Airborne Division, the formation holding Bastogne, on 20 December, and was engaged throughout the siege, fighting a number of small actions. It provided a major part of the 101st's combat capabilities; on the 21st, the total armoured reserve available other than the 705th amounted to about forty operable medium tanks.Eisenhower, p. 321 On the 24th, it was distributed between the 101st's regiments; a platoon to the 501st Parachute Infantry, two to the 506th Parachute Infantry, two to the 502nd Parachute Infantry and four to the 327th Glider Infantry,Cole, p. 472; Eisenhower, p. 327 with one platoon deployed as a reserve in the town itself.Cole, p. 474 On the 25th, Christmas Day, it was engaged in the thick of the fighting; an attack by eighteen Panzer IVs of 15th Panzergrenadier Division was broken up by M18s of the battalion. One half of the attack was caught in a close-range action by units of the 502nd PIR and a platoon of B Company; two M18s were knocked out at the start of the engagement, but the other pair quickly accounted for three Panzer IVs. The other half, meanwhile, was caught in a crossfire between four M18s, a group of M4 Shermans, a group of 105mm howitzers and infantry bazookas and destroyed.Cole, pp. 478‚Äì9; Eisenhower, p. 329 Throughout the siege, the battalion destroyed around 40 German tanks, and lost only six M18s.11th Armored Division (1992), p. 55, gives 39 tanks destroyed; a figure of 43 is quoted in Zaloga (2004) The battalion remained stationed in Bastogne for the remainder of the Battle of the Bulge, being released by the 101st on 18 January, and withdrawn to rest and refit. The battalion would later be awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its role in the defence of Bastogne.11th Armored Division (1992), p. 56 Germany The battalion was attached to Combat Command B of the 11th Armored Division, part of Third Army, on 24 February, and committed to action on 1 March, when the commanding officer was killed in action. He was succeeded by Major John Dibble. The battalion crossed the Kyll River on 6 March, and pushed towards the Rhine with the 11th Armored, fighting all through March. The 705th crossed the Rhine at Oppenheim on 29 March, and continued to advance across southern Germany in April, seeing action in a number of small engagements. The battalion liberated two prisoner-of-war hospitals and a large forced-labour camp, and late in the month arrived at the Flossenb√ºrg and Buchenwald concentration camps. The battalion crossed the border into Austria on 1 May, and linked up with Soviet Army troops on 8 May, the day that the German surrender was announced. Postwar service The battalion began occupation duties near Linz in June, and was inactivated in July. During its year in Europe, it lost 48 men, of whom 30 were killed at Bastogne, and received the Presidential Unit Citation.

Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as \\"the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine\\". Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop‚Äîoriginally referred to as a \\"circular causal\\" relationship‚Äîthat is, where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner (feedback) that triggers a system change. Cybernetics is relevant to, for example, mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and social systems. The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular, causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal, and again to action. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks. Cybernetics includes the study of feedback, black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms, machines and organizations including self-organization. Concepts studied by cyberneticists include, but are not limited to: learning, cognition, adaptation, social control, emergence, convergence, communication, efficiency, efficacy, and connectivity. In cybernetics these concepts (otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering) are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device. The word cybernetics comes from Greek Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (kybernƒìtik·∏ó), meaning \\"governance\\", i.e., all that are pertinent to Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ¨œâ (kybern√°≈ç), the latter meaning \\"to steer, navigate or govern\\", hence Œ∫œÖŒ≤Œ≠œÅŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ (kyb√©rnƒìsis), meaning \\"government\\", is the government while Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ (kybern·∏ótƒìs) is the governor or \\"helmsperson\\" of the \\"ship\\". Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology in the 1940s, often attributed to the Macy Conferences. During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved in ways that distinguish first-order cybernetics (about observed systems) from second-order cybernetics (about observing systems).Heinz von Foerster (1981), 'Observing Systems\\", Intersystems Publications, Seaside, CA. More recently there is talk about a third-order cybernetics (doing in ways that embraces first and second-order). Studies in cybernetics provide a means for examining the design and function of any system, including social systems such as business management and organizational learning, including for the purpose of making them more efficient and effective. Fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include game theory, system theory (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics), perceptual control theory, sociology, psychology (especially neuropsychology, behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology), philosophy, architecture, and organizational theory.Tange, Kenzo (1966) \\"Function, Structure and Symbol\\". System dynamics, originated with applications of electrical engineering control theory to other kinds of simulation models (especially business systems) by Jay Forrester at MIT in the 1950s, is a related field.  Definitions  Cybernetics has been defined in a variety of ways, by a variety of people, from a variety of disciplines. Cybernetician Stuart Umpleby reports some notable definitions: * \\"Science concerned with the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving, storing and processing information so as to use it for control.\\"‚ÄîA. N. Kolmogorov * \\"'The art of steersmanship': deals with all forms of behavior in so far as they are regular, or determinate, or reproducible: stands to the real machine -- electronic, mechanical, neural, or economic -- much as geometry stands to real object in our terrestrial space; offers a method for the scientific treatment of the system in which complexity is outstanding and too important to be ignored.\\"‚ÄîW.

AB < 0 for negative feedback. The term cybernetics stems from Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ (kybern·∏ótƒìs) \\"steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder\\". As with the ancient Greek pilot, independence of thought is important in cybernetics.Leary, Timothy. \\"The Cyberpunk: the individual as reality pilot\\" in Storming the Reality Studio. Duke University Press: 1991. French physicist and mathematician Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re first coined the word \\"cybernetique\\" in his 1834 essay Essai sur la philosophie des sciences to describe the science of civil government.H.S. Tsien. Engineering Cybernetics, Preface vii. McGraw Hill, 1954. The term was used by Norbert Wiener, in his book Cybernetics, to define the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine. In the book, he states: \\"Although the term cybernetics does not date further back than the summer of 1947, we shall find it convenient to use in referring to earlier epochs of the development of the field.\\"  History  Roots of cybernetic theory = The word cybernetics was first used in the context of \\"the study of self-governance\\" by Plato in Alcibiades to signify the governance of people. The word 'cybern√©tique' was also used in 1834 by the physicist Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re (1775‚Äì1836) to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge. James Watt The first artificial automatic regulatory system was a water clock, invented by the mechanician Ktesibios; based on a tank which poured water into a reservoir before using it to run the mechanism, it used a cone-shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir. This was the first artificial truly automatic self-regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism. Although they considered this part of engineering (the use of the term cybernetics is much posterior), Ktesibios and others such as Heron and Su Song are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles. The study of teleological mechanisms (from the Greek œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ or t√©los for end, goal, or purpose) in machines with corrective feedback dates from as far back as the late 18th century when James Watt's steam engine was equipped with a governor (1775‚Äì1800), a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine. Alfred Russel Wallace identified this as the principle of evolution in his famous 1858 paper. In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices. Jakob von Uexk√ºll applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle (Funktionskreis) in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general. =Early 20th century= Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology and neuroscience in the 1940s; the ideas are also related to the biological work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in General Systems Theory. Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer Harold S. Black on using negative feedback to control amplifiers. Early applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during World War II. The founder of System Dynamics, Jay Forrester, worked with Gordon S. Brown during WWII as a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT to develop electronic control systems for the U.S. Navy. Forrester later applied these ideas to social organizations, such as corporations and cities and became an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. W. Edwards Deming, the Total Quality Management guru for whom Japan named its top post-WWII industrial prize, was an intern at Bell Telephone Labs in 1927 and may have been influenced by network theory; Deming made \\"Understanding Systems\\" one of the four pillars of what he described as \\"Profound Knowledge\\" in his book The New Economics. Numerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field. In 1935 Russian physiologist P. K. Anokhin published a book in which the concept of feedback (\\"back afferentation\\") was studied. The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943: \\"Behavior, Purpose and Teleology\\" by Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow; and the paper \\"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\\" by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. In 1936, »òtefan Odobleja published \\"Phonoscopy and the clinical semiotics\\". In 1937, he participated in the IX International Congress of Military Medicine with \\"Demonstration de phonoscopie\\"; in the paper he disseminated a prospectus announcing his future work, \\"Psychologie consonantiste\\", the most important of his writings, where he lays the theoretical foundations of generalized cybernetics. The book, published in Paris by Librairie Maloine (vol. I in 1938 and vol. II in 1939), contains almost 900 pages and includes 300 figures in the text. The author wrote at the time that \\"this book is ... a table of contents, an index or a dictionary of psychology, [for] a ... great Treatise of Psychology that should contain 20‚Äì30 volumes\\". Due to the beginning of World War II, the publication went unnoticed (the first Romanian edition of this work did not appear until 1982). Norbert Wiener Cybernetics as a discipline was firmly established by Norbert Wiener, McCulloch, Arturo Rosenblueth and others, such as W. Ross Ashby, mathematician Alan Turing, and W. Grey Walter (one of the first to build autonomous robots as an aid to the study of animal behaviour). In the spring of 1947, Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis, held in Nancy (France was an important geographical locus of early cybernetics together with the US and UK); the event was organized by the Bourbaki, a French scientific society, and mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt (1899‚Äì1983), uncle of the world-famous mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot. During this stay in France, Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics, which is found in the study of Brownian motion and in telecommunication engineering. The following summer, back in the United States, Wiener decided to introduce the neologism cybernetics, coined to denote the study of \\"teleological mechanisms\\", into his scientific theory: it was popularized through his book Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (MIT Press/John Wiley and Sons, NY, 1948). In the UK this became the focus for the Ratio Club. John von Neumann In the early 1940s John von Neumann contributed a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics: von Neumann cellular automata, and their logical follow up, the von Neumann Universal Constructor. The result of these deceptively simple thought-experiments was the concept of self replication, which cybernetics adopted as a core concept. The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social memes, living cells, and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study. In 1950, Wiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics, drawing analogies between automatic systems (such as a regulated steam engine) and human institutions in his best-selling The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society (Houghton-Mifflin). Cybernetics in the Soviet Union was initially considered a \\"pseudoscience\\" and \\"ideological weapon\\" of \\"imperialist reactionaries\\" (Soviet Philosophical Dictionary, 1954) and later criticised as a narrow form of cybernetics.–§–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å (Philosophical dictionary), 1954; \\"Cybernetics\\", The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979) In the mid to late 1950s Viktor Glushkov and others salvaged the reputation of the field. Soviet cybernetics incorporated much of what became known as computer science in the West. While not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics, the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, under the direction of Heinz von Foerster, was a major center of cybernetic research for almost 20 years, beginning in 1958. =Split from artificial intelligence= Artificial intelligence (AI) was founded as a distinct discipline at the Dartmouth workshop. After some uneasy coexistence, AI gained funding and prominence. Consequently, cybernetic sciences such as the study of artificial neural networks were downplayed; the discipline shifted into the world of social sciences and therapy. Prominent cyberneticians during this period include Gregory Bateson and Aksel Berg. = New cybernetics = In the 1970s, new cyberneticians emerged in multiple fields, but especially in biology. The ideas of Maturana, Varela and Atlan, according to Jean-Pierre Dupuy (1986) \\"realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organizations which mankind discovers in nature - organizations he has not himself invented\\".Jean-Pierre Dupuy, \\"The autonomy of social reality: on the contribution of systems theory to the theory of society\\" in: Elias L. Khalil & Kenneth E. Boulding eds., Evolution, Order and Complexity, 1986. However, during the 1980s the question of whether the features of this new cybernetics could be applied to social forms of organization remained open to debate. In political science, Project Cybersyn attempted to introduce a cybernetically controlled economy during the early 1970s. In the 1980s, according to Harries-Jones (1988) \\"unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political actors and subgroups, and the practical and reflexive consciousness of the subjects who produce and reproduce the structure of a political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regards to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves\\".Peter Harries-Jones (1988), \\"The Self-Organizing Polity: An Epistemological Analysis of Political Life by Laurent Dobuzinskis\\" in: Canadian Journal of Political Science (Revue canadienne de science politique), Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1988), pp. 431-433. One characteristic of the emerging new cybernetics considered in that time by Felix Geyer and Hans van der Zouwen, according to Bailey (1994),Kenneth D. Bailey (1994), Sociology and the New Systems Theory: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis, p.163. was \\"that it views information as constructed and reconstructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides an epistemological foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the micro-macro gap. That is, it links the individual with the society\\". Another characteristic noted was the \\"transition from classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics [that] involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. These shifts in thinking involve, among others, (a) a change from emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factor which guides the steering decisions; and (b) new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other\\". Recent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics, systems of control and emergent behavior, by such related fields as game theory (the analysis of group interaction), systems of feedback in evolution, and metamaterials (the study of materials with properties beyond the Newtonian properties of their constituent atoms), have led to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field. =Cybernetics and economic systems= The design of self-regulating control systems for a real-time planned economy was explored by economist Oskar Lange, cyberneticist Viktor Glushkov, and others Soviet cyberneticists during the 1960s. By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible economic planning based on computers, the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning and eventually collapsed. More recent proposals for socialism involve \\"New Socialism\\", outlined by the computer scientists Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell, where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially owned enterprises.Allin Cottrell & W.Paul Cockshott, Towards a new socialism (Nottingham, England: Spokesman, 1993). Retrieved: 17 March 2012. On the other hand, Friedrich Hayek also mentions cybernetics as a discipline that could help economists understand the \\"self-organizing or self-generating systems\\" called markets. Being \\"complex phenomena\\", the best way to examine market functions is by using the feedback mechanism, explained by cybernetic theorists. That way, economists could make \\"pattern predictions\\". Therefore, the market for Hayek is a \\"communication system\\", an \\"efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information\\". The economist and a cyberneticist are like garderners who are \\"providing the appropriate environment\\". Hayek's definition of information is idiosyncratic and precedes the information theory used in cybernetics and the natural sciences. Finally, Hayek also considers Adam Smith's idea of the invisible hand as an anticipation of the operation of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics. In the same book, Law, Legislation and Liberty, Hayek mentions, along with cybernetics, that economists should rely on the scientific findings of Ludwig von Bertalanffy general systems theory, along with information and communication theory and semiotics. Subdivisions of the field Cybernetics is sometimes used as a generic term, which serves as an umbrella for many systems-related scientific fields. = Basic cybernetics = ASIMO uses sensors and sophisticated algorithms to avoid obstacles and navigate stairs. Cybernetics studies systems of control as a concept, attempting to discover the basic principles underlying such things as * Artificial intelligence * Computer vision * Control systems * Conversation theory * Emergence * Interactions of actors theory * Learning organization * Robotics * Second- order cybernetics * Self-organization in cybernetics = In biology = Cybernetics in biology is the study of cybernetic systems present in biological organisms, primarily focusing on how animals adapt to their environment, and how information in the form of genes is passed from generation to generation. There is also a secondary focus on combining artificial systems with biological systems. A notable application to the biology world would be that, in 1955, the physicist George Gamow published a prescient article in Scientific American called \\"Information transfer in the living cell\\", and cybernetics gave biologists Jacques Monod and Fran√ßois Jacob a language for formulating their early theory of gene regulatory networks in the 1960s. * Autopoiesis * Biocybernetics * Bioengineering * Bionics * Ecology * Heterostasis * Homeostasis * Medical cybernetics * Neuroprosthetics * Neuroscience * Synthetic biology * Systems biology * Practopoiesis = In computer science = Computer science directly applies the concepts of cybernetics to the control of devices and the analysis of information. * Cellular automaton * Decision support systems * Design patterns * Robotics * Simulation * Formal languages * Modal logic = In engineering = Cybernetics in engineering is used to analyze cascading failures and system accidents, in which the small errors and imperfections in a system can generate disasters. Other topics studied include:An artificial heart, a product of biomedical engineering. * Adaptive systems * Biomedical engineering * Engineering cybernetics * Ergonomics * Systems engineering = In management = * Autonomous agency theory * Entrepreneurial cybernetics * Management cybernetics * Operations research * Organizational cybernetics * Systems engineering * Viable system theory = In mathematics = Mathematical Cybernetics focuses on the factors of information, interaction of parts in systems, and the structure of systems. * Control theory * Dynamical system * Information theory * Systems theory * Category theory * Chaos theory = In psychology = * Agent-based model * Attachment theory * Behavioral cybernetics * Cognitive psychology * Cognitive sciences * Connectionism * Consciousness * Embodied cognition * Human-robot interaction * Mind-body problem * Perceptual control theory * Psychovector analysis * Systems psychology = In sociology = By examining group behavior through the lens of cybernetics, sociologists can seek the reasons for such spontaneous events as smart mobs and riots, as well as how communities develop rules such as etiquette by consensus without formal discussion. Affect Control Theory explains role behavior, emotions, and labeling theory in terms of homeostatic maintenance of sentiments associated with cultural categories. The most comprehensive attempt ever made in the social sciences to increase cybernetics in a generalized theory of society was made by Talcott Parsons. In this way, cybernetics establishes the basic hierarchy in Parsons' AGIL paradigm, which is the ordering system-dimension of his action theory. These and other cybernetic models in sociology are reviewed in a book edited by McClelland and Fararo.McClelland, Kent A., and Thomas J. Fararo (Eds.). 2006. Purpose, Meaning, and Action: Control Systems Theories in Sociology. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. * Affect control theory * Memetics * Sociocybernetics * Niklas Luhmann =In art= Nicolas Sch√∂ffer's CYSP I (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words \\"CYbernetic\\" and \\"SPatiodynamic\\"). The prominent and influential Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968 curated by Jasia Reichardt, including Sch√∂ffer's CYSP I and Gordon Pask's Colloquy of Mobiles installation. Pask's reflections on Colloquy connected it to his earlier Musicolour installation and to what he termed \\"aesthetically potent environments\\", a concept that connected this artistic work to his concerns with teaching and learning.Pask, G.

The artist Roy Ascott elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in \\"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\\" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in \\"The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose\\" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian Edward A. Shanken has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including \\"Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s\\" and From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott (2003), which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to telematic art (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to net.art.) * Telematic art * Interactive art * Systems art =In architecture and design= Cybernetics was an influence on thinking in architecture and design in the decades after the Second World War.

It provides a theoretical framework for studying the implications of following different sustainability paradigms on co-evolutionary trajectories of the planetary socio-ecological system to reveal attractors in this system, their stability, resilience and reachability. Concepts such as tipping points in the climate system, planetary boundaries, the safe operating space for humanity and proposals for manipulating Earth system dynamics on a global scale such as geoengineering have been framed in the language of geocybernetic Earth system analysis. = In sport = A model of cybernetics in Sport was introduced by Yuri Verkhoshansky and Mel C.

History Eutelsat W2M, as it was then named, was originally launched on 20 December 2008 aboard an Ariane 5ECA carrier rocket along with the Hot Bird 9 spacecraft. It was built by EADS Astrium, based on the I-3K satellite bus provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation.\\"EADS Astrium-ISRO Team To Build Eutelsat W2M Satellite,\\" Satellite News, February 06, 2006 It was to have been placed in geosynchronous orbit at 16¬∞E, from where it was to provide communications services to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, with 32 NATO J-band (IEEE Ku band) transponders. The satellite has a mass of 3,460 kg, and a planned service life of 15 years. On 28 January 2009, Eutelsat announced that it would not accept delivery of the satellite due to what was described as a \\"major anomaly affecting the satellite's power subsystem\\".Peter B. De Selding Newly Launched Satellite Fails in Space, Space News 28 January 2009 Commenting on these decisions, Eutelsat Communications Chairman and CEO Giuliano Berretta said: \\"The situation affecting W2M is a serious disappointment for Eutelsat. However, for many years we have pursued a strategy based on securing and expanding our in- orbit resources in order to mitigate this type of risk. Our current investment programme consequently combines early renewal of operating satellites, together with securing the fleet through readily available back-up resources, and expansion of services with larger satellites. This policy puts us in a position to absorb the unavailability of W2M without impact on the continuity of service we provide our customers.\\" On the same day Eutelsat also confirmed that the unavailability of W2M does not impact on the Group's guidance for revenues in excess of 900 million euros for the 2008‚Äì2009 financial year since the W2M satellite programme is fully insured. Although Eutelsat had originally declared that, due to the power system partial failure, W2M would not be integrated into Eutelsat's satellite fleet; after the in-orbit failure of Eutelsat W2 in January 2010, Eutelsat decided to redeploy W2M at 16¬∞E to provide limited back-up services for the failed W2 satellite.Gunter's Space Page, Eutelsat W2M, retrieved 27 April 2010. The satellite was redeployed from 28.5¬∞ East where it has delivered 100% availability since August 2012. Its estimated end of operational use in stable orbit is 2020.http://www.eutelsat.com/en/satellites/the-fleet/EUTELSAT-48D.html In January 2014 the Afghan Ministry of Communications and Information Technology signed an agreement with Eutelsat for the use of satellite resources to enhance deployment of Afghanistan's national broadcasting and telecommunications infrastructure as well as its international connectivity. Eutelsat 48D supports a wide range of services including broadcasting, mobile telephony backhaul and IP connectivity. Commenting on the agreement, Minister Amirzai Sangin said: ‚ÄúAFGHANSAT 1 is a new milestone in the development of the ICT sector in Afghanistan, which in the last 12 years has already seen mobile telephony coverage of 88% and penetration grow from zero to 75% through the licensing of six operators, ICT sector employment provided for more than 138,000 people and more than $2.1 billion invested in the national economy.‚Äù AFGHANSAT 1 was officially launched on 10 May 2014, with expected service for at least seven years in Afghanistan.

While PZL.50 JastrzƒÖb's prototype proved to be an excellent fighter, it was seriously underpowered as modern engines of sufficient power were still unavailable at the time of its construction.

Such engines would be sufficient to power the PZL.50, or any other similar fighter design considered by the Polish construction bureaus at the time. To prepare for the arrival of new engines, the PZL works organised an internal competition for a redesign of PZL.50 from a large radial engine to a smaller, more streamlined in-line engine. Poland also wanted to buy a license for even stronger engines of the new Hispano- Suiza 12Z line that would ultimately replace the 12Y series. The contest was won in August 1939 by Wsiewo≈Çod Jakimiuk. The resulting design was an all- metal, low-wing fighter aircraft, with retractable landing gear and tail wheel.

The 70-minute film was created at the request of the British Admiralty, as a training aid for new navigators joining the Royal Navy. Although never formally released to cinemas because of its small target audience, Handling Ships was an \\"Official Selection\\" at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, and is recognised as the first feature-length work, and the first work in Technicolor, in British animation history. Background After independent careers in animation, John Halas and Joy Batchelor began working together in 1938, and founded Halas and Batchelor in 1940 to create war information and propaganda films. Approximately 70 films were created for the Ministry of Information, the War Office, and the Admiralty over the course of World War II; most of these were shorts intended to improve morale or spur on increased contributions to the war effort, such as Dustbin Parade, about recycling, and Filling the Gap, about gardening. Halas and Batchelor also created a series of anti-fascist cartoons intended for viewing in the Middle East; starring an Arab boy named Abu, who was \\"enticed and misguided by the forces of Hitler and Mussolini.\\" The heavy workload (at one point the studios were creating a minute-long short every three weeks) and minimal budgets meant that simple animations with economically driven stories were the norm. Description Halas and Batchelor were approached by the Admiralty to create an instructional film for Royal Navy navigation trainees; according to Halas, the intent was to \\"stop young people from driving a ship like it was a car.\\" The film was not intended as a propaganda work, instead serving as a precise guide to manoeuvring and navigating ships, along with aspects of general ship handling and control. For Handling Ships, Halas and Batchelor used stop motion animation of three-dimensional ship models, along with schematic designs, to simplify the intricacies and vagaries of ship movement and educate the viewer. The film was shot in 35 mm and Technicolor. Unlike previous animations by the company, Handling Ships was feature-length, running at 70 minutes: at the time, the longest stop motion production made in the UK. The film was never released to cinema chains, as Halas and Batchelor felt it was too specialised for and of limited appeal to general audiences, and it had no propaganda value. Significance After the war, Handling Ships was entered in the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, where it was a short film \\"Official Selection\\". The work proved the value of stop motion animation for instructional films, and the ability of the studio of Halas and Batchelor at making them, as they were said to have \\"extended the medium to explain complex ideas with clarity and humour\\". In 1948, the Home Office commissioned a feature-length training film, Waterford Fire Fighting. This was followed in 1949 by another film for the Admiralty, Submarine Control, for submariner training. Halas and Batchelor were responsible for the animated feature film, Animal Farm. first released in the UK in 1954,Michael Brooke \\"Animal Farm (1954)\\", BFI screenonline ReferencesExternal links * Category:1945 films Category:1945 animated films Category:1945 documentary films Category:Animated documentary films Category:British animated films Category:British documentary films Category:British films Category:Documentary films about water transport Category:1940s stop-motion animated films Category:Films directed by John Halas Category:American films ","title":"Handling Ships"},{"id":"20786214","text":"Pittsburgh held a mayoral election on November 3, 2009.

Primary The primary election was held on May 19, 2009. In the Democratic primary, incumbent Mayor Ravenstahl defeated challengers Patrick Dowd, a Pittsburgh city councilman, and Carmen Robinson, an attorney and former police officer. The Republican primary had no names on the ballot for the office of mayor. Ravenstahl, a Democrat, won the Republican mayoral nomination with 607 write-in votes; no other candidate had the 250 write-in votes required to become the Republican nominee. General Ravenstahl, having been nominated by both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, appeared on the general-election ballot with both affiliations. He was joined by two other candidates: businessman Franco 'Dok' Harris (the son of Pittsburgh Steelers legend Franco Harris), who ran under the Franco Dok Harris Party, and attorney Kevin Acklin, who ran as an independent. Ravenstahl's relationship with lobbyist John Verbanac became a campaign issue. Ravenstahl defeated both Harris and Acklin by a wide margin, winning over 55 percent of the vote.

The album was inspired by an Anne Briggs EP titled The Hazards of Love. According to the band, frontman Colin Meloy had set out to write a song with the album's title, which eventually developed into an entire album. Becky Stark (of Lavender Diamond), Shara Nova (of My Brightest Diamond), and Jim James (of My Morning Jacket) provide guest vocals throughout the album, while Robyn Hitchcock makes a cameo guitar appearance on \\"An Interlude\\". The Hazards of Love is a rock opera, with all songs contributing to a unified narrative, similar to the use of recurring stories on the band's previous album, The Crane Wife. The plot is a love story: a woman named Margaret (voiced by Stark) falls in love with a shape-shifting boreal forest dweller named William (voiced by Meloy). William's mother, the jealous Forest Queen (voiced by Nova), and the villainous Rake (also voiced by Meloy) bring conflict to the album's story arc. Plot While riding through the taiga, Margaret finds an injured fawn. When she stops to help it, the fawn changes into a young man named William, and the two make love (\\"The Hazards of Love 1 (The Prettiest Whistles Won't Wrestle the Thistles Undone)\\"). Margaret soon learns she is pregnant (\\"A Bower Scene\\") and flees to the forest to find William (\\"Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)\\"). William comes to Margaret and proclaims his love for her (\\"The Hazards of Love 2 (Wager All)\\"), but a short, mysterious instrumental announces the threat of William's mother, the Forest Queen (\\"The Queen's Approach\\") and the end of the first act. William and Margaret reminisce about their first meeting and anticipate the birth of their child (\\"Isn't It a Lovely Night?\\") when they are discovered by the Forest Queen. William begs the Queen to allow him to be with Margaret, but the Queen accuses him of being ungrateful, pointing out that she rescued him from the human world when he was a baby and bestowed on him immortality. Their exchange continues until the Queen resolves to allow William one night as a mortal man with Margaret, but afterwards reclaim him forever (\\"The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid\\"). Another short instrumental (\\"An Interlude\\") marks the end of the second act. Elsewhere, we meet the Rake, a widower and philanderer who feels no remorse at having murdered his three children in order to be rid of the responsibility of raising them (\\"The Rake's Song\\"). He kidnaps Margaret (\\"The Abduction of Margaret\\"), and then the Forest Queen ruthlessly breaks her promise by inviting the Rake to violate Margaret and assists his escape from William by parting a raging river (\\"The Queen's Rebuke/The Crossing\\"). William arrives at the river but is unable to cross until he offers his own life in exchange for safe passage (\\"Annan Water\\"). The Rake gloats over Margaret, while she calls for William to rescue her (\\"Margaret in Captivity\\"). But before the Rake can strike, the ghosts of his three murdered children appear and thwart him (\\"The Hazards of Love 3 (Revenge!)\\"). William arrives and escapes with Margaret (\\"The Wanting Comes in Waves (Reprise)\\"), but, as they approach the river, the lovers vow to marry each other by drowning themselves in the river while William is still a mortal man. As they sink into the water, William and Margaret proclaim their love a final time, reflecting that, in death, \\"the hazards of love\\" can no longer trouble them (\\"The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)\\"). Release history On January 15, 2009, \\"The Rake's Song\\" became available as a free download on the band's MySpace page. This was followed on February 16, 2009, by \\"The Hazards of Love 1\\", again on MySpace. The Hazards of Love was released on iTunes Australia on March 14, 2009. On March 20, 2009, Entertainment Weekly began streaming the full album on imeem. The album entered the US charts at #14, selling 19,000 copies in its first week. After the album's release, four filmmakers (Peter Sluszka, Julia Pott, Guilherme Marcondes, and Santa Maria) made an animated visual accompaniment to the music, Here Come the Waves: The Hazards of Love Visualized. It does not include narrative elements, but is related through the shape of the music. It has been shown publicly in a few locations. In February 2012, Player's Theatre - in Montreal, Canada - staged the album under the name \\"The Hazards of Love: A Folk Opera\\" with dialogue written to accompany the Decemberists' original music. The script was written and directed by James Hugh Keenan Campbell and Charles Harries, and starred Montreal actors Emily Skahan, John Pleasants, and Katie Scharf among others. Robin Warner, a Montreal jazz bassist, directed the six person pit band. Reception The Hazards of Love drew mixed to favorable reviews from music critics, with most reviewers commending the album's ambition and musical craft, but criticizing its story and characters as vague and underdeveloped. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone wrote that \\"The Hazards of Love brings the glorious excess... The Decemberists approach this kind of pretentiousness somewhat ironically, but they also clearly love their models, Led Zeppelin and Fairport Convention among them\\", while James Christopher Monger of AllMusic summarized the album as \\"ambitious, pretentious, obtuse, often impenetrable, and altogether pretty great\\". Robert Christgau was a detractor, writing that \\"The Hazards of Love looked to be where Colin Meloy's obvious bad points permanently swallowed his subtle good points...He has the conceit to elevate melodies that are the musical equivalent of doggerel into mini-motives\\". Marc Hogan of Pitchfork criticized the album's plot and lamented the absence of the band's \\"catchy choruses\\" and \\"verisimilar emotions\\", but praised its heavier songs and Shara Nova's contribution to them.

The show featured two teams of four competing each week. History Production company Frontier Films devised Brendan O'Carroll's Hot Milk and Pepper as a comedy quiz show vehicle for Brendan O'Carroll. It was devised as a replacement quiz show for Where in the World? which ended in 1996. O'Carroll claimed that the name referred to Margaret Thatcher's drink request when he worked as her butler for four days in 1984 at an EU summit. =Format= Hot Milk and Pepper featured two teams of four - the Pink team and the Green team. Each member of the team was linked (e.g. all four members of the team were taxi drivers from the same firm). Round One: Connections The first round featured each member of the team picking the odd-one-out from a group of three related elements (e.g. Greek Gods). The four remaining odd elements were also linked and extra points were given if a team could name the connection. Round Two: Match Up The second round featured two columns of eight. Each word in the left-hand column could match up to a related word on the right-hand column (e.g. US states and their capitals). Each contestant had to answer two questions each. If a team member got a question wrong the opposing team had a chance to steal and the question was passed over. Round Three: Risky Business In this buzzer round the teams have to guess which word could come before of after another word. As extra words are revealed to help, the points awarded diminishes. Round Four: Go For Broke The final round was for the winners of the previous three rounds. Each member could choose their own prize from the show's catalogue beforehand, but would only win the prize if the round was successfully completed. Prizes ranged from video recorders to holidays abroad. The final round featured twelve elements all linked to three different topics. There were three \\"red herrings\\". The team had to match up the different elements to the different topics and had two extra lives to do so. Production Brendan O'Carroll's Hot Milk and Pepper was broadcast on RT√â One on Sunday evenings from 8:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. For the second half of the second series the show moved to Friday evenings at 8:30 p.m. The show was pre-recorded before broadcast in Studio 4 in the RT√â Television Centre at Donnybrook, Dublin 4. Following the initial two series the show was repeated in early morning and afternoon slots for the 1998-99 season. Reception Hot Milk and Pepper received poor reviews. In 2000, O'Carroll observed that he \\"got it so wrong\\" with the game show saying that he did the show primarily because a senior RT√â figure suggested to him that he owed RT√â a show, considering all that they had done for him. With 45 minutes in studio needing to be cut to 25 minutes for TV, something had to go out and so O'Carroll's comedy had to be filleted out. When he saw the finished product, he \\"couldn't believe it.\\" RTE weather presenters John Doyle, Dr. Aidan Nulty and Joan Blackburn appeared on the programme of January 4th 1998.

She was the editor of The Agrarian History of England and Wales (for volumes 4‚Äì6) from 1964 to 1972 and in 1974 was appointed general editor of the series.Christine S. Hallas, bio entry in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing (edited by Kelly Boyd) pp. 1184-85 She sat on the editorial board of Past & Present from 1956 to 1992, being the only woman until Olwen Hufton and Judith Herrin joined in 1978. She was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1974 and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993. In 2017, she was featured in a conference, London's Women Historians, held at the Institute of Historical Research, to celebrate the contribution of women historians who had worked at the University of London and its colleges.London's Women Historians.

Contribution to history Early in her career, Thirsk focused her research on farming in Kesteven, in the south-western division of Lincolnshire. She noticed that each part of the district had its own agricultural dynamic, depending on whether its inhabitants farmed on clay, limestone, or the edge of the fen. This led her to approach agricultural history through the lens of geography, instead of relying on macroeconomic theories. This approach was consistent with a broad movement in which regional studies were increasingly welcomed in the field of history. In 1952, she joined with H. P. R. Finberg in helping to found the Agricultural History Society, where she welcomed the contributions of folklorists, geographers and farmers. In 1964, she became the editor of the Agricultural History Review. For her work in The Agrarian History of England and Wales, she used samples of probate inventories to map the local farming system in different regions of England, assisted by two researchers for two years (Alan Everitt and Margaret Midgley). She also noticed how cloth-making and hand-knitting in proto-industrialisation were more prevalent in regions where pastoralism played an important part (North Wiltshire, South Suffolk or West Yorkshire). In her Ford Lectures in 1975, published in 1978, she studied the history of important household objects which had been overlooked by her male peers, such as starch, needles, pins, cooking pots, kettles, frying pans, lace, soap, vinegar and stockings. She set out to understand how these products were manufactured and marketed, what this revealed about economic innovation, how it impacted employment and productivity, and its subsequent influence on family and national incomes. In 1978, she delivered an influential Stenton lecture on the role of horses in pre-industrial English society, which was cited by Daniel Roche as an important source for his work on the same subject in French history. Towards the end of her life, she expanded on the inequalities that women historians face in a male-dominated field, by noting that they are more likely to be assigned to tedious and scholarly tasks which benefit other researchers, but rarely their own career. She also noted that women historians have been prominent in new academic endeavours, but that once these ventures were established, men inevitably came to control these fields. Maxine Berg also noted this trend in economic history. Food history Although best known for her agrarian history, Thirsk also had a strong interest in food history, especially in her later years. In 1995 she gave a paper on preserving food to the Leeds Symposium on the History of Food which was subsequently published. She advised on the curation of an exhibition: Fooles and Fricasees: Food in Shakespeare‚Äôs England at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1999, contributing an essay: Food in Shakespeare's England to the catalogue. Her book Alternative Agriculture explores how overlooked cultures like flax, hemp, rapeseed, and woad were cultivated in Early Modern England. Her last major work Food in Early Modern England Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500‚Äì1760. surveys the history of English food chronologically, trying to explore differences in social classes. The author tries to dispel the idea that food of that era was dull and monotonous, as there was a wide range of herbs, plants, and animals eaten at that are no longer available today. The gathering and making of food was discussed and appreciated in all levels of society. Her own experience making and tasting barley bread (a staple food of in sixteenth-century Southern England), showed her how difficult it was to make and hard to eat.

He was the brother of Mark Bell and Chris Bell (director of the 2008 documentary, Bigger, Stronger, Faster), and the 2015 follow up documentary, Prescription Thugs, in which Mike Bell's life and death by prescription drugs are explored. Professional wrestling career Bell worked as a jobber for WWE (then-named, the World Wrestling Federation, or, WWF) during the early-1990s, even performing on its flagship TV show, Monday Night Raw. Like many jobbers of that era, Bell worked on a match-by-match basis for the WWF, never being under continuous contract with the promotion. Bell later worked with the original ECW, including performing at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center. Bell was well known in the wrestling community for a 2001 incident with Perry Saturn during a taped WWF match for Jakked/Metal. Bell and Saturn botched a snapmare armdrag, causing Saturn to land on the mat head first. Saturn legitimately attacked Bell in retaliation for this perceived lack of professionalism and in-ring ethic, at one point tossing Bell out of the ring and causing Bell himself to land on his head on the safety mat. Neither performer sustained serious injury, and both were able to resume their respective roles and finish the match as planned, without most spectators realizing what had actually happened. Personal life Bell, who had a history with substance abuse, was featured in the documentary Bigger, Stronger, Faster along with his two brothers. Bell can also be seen in Prescription Thugs, a documentary created by his brother about prescription drug abuse in America. Death On December 14, 2008, he was found dead at a rehabilitation facility in Costa Mesa, California. It was ruled that he died of an inhalation-induced heart attack brought on by inhalation of difluoroethane in Dust-Off. Bell was 37 years old.

Konigsburg. It is a kind of detective story and some reviews present it as mystery fiction. Amedeo Kaplan is both new boy and rich boy in the sixth grade. He longs to discover something \\"no one\\" yet knows. He volunteers to help liquidate the portable property of an elderly woman who once sang opera in Europe and finds himself learning more about degenerate art and the German occupation of the Netherlands. The Mysterious Edge is a kind of sequel to The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place (2004). Margaret Kane's two executive allies in The Outcasts are Amedeo Kaplan's godfather and mother here, about fifteen years later, and Vanderwaal family history is one aspect of The Mysterious Edge. Setting Mysterious Edge is set in the present and primarily in the private residential part of St. Malo, Florida, a fictional navy town. One secondary setting is the art center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, directed by Peter Vanderwaal. Backstory events occurred in Amsterdam, Vienna, and Epiphany, New York ‚Äîthe fictional city in Greater New York where the Bevilacquas, Roses, and Vanderwaals all lived at 17 to 21 Schuyler Place for a decade or two after World War II. The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place (2004) itself provides some backstory for The Mysterious Edge. Epiphany, New York, is the primary setting for two other novels, The View from Saturday and Silent to the Bone. Summary Amedeo Kaplan and his divorced mother Loretta Bevilacqua have moved from Epiphany, New York to St. Malo, Florida. He is a new boy at school for the first time, and does not yet have friends (September). He is happy to befriend the next-door neighbor Mrs. Zender, an opera singer on the European circuit in the fifties, who retired then retired with a European husband to her childhood mansion in St. Malo. Mrs. Zender is moving to Waldorf Court while she can still afford it and Amedeo volunteers to help liquidate most of her possessions. From his artist father Jake Kaplan, who lives back north, and many visits to the fine arts institutions of New York City, Amedeo is already a novice expert on paintings and drawings, at least. Working with classmate William Wilcox and his single mother, the professional appraiser and estate liquidator Mrs. Zender has engaged, he learns a lot more about the business, about people, and about Mrs. Zender who is in and out of every room they work. Amedeo's godfather Peter Vanderwaal, who directs an art center is preparing to host a traveling exhibition of Degenerate Art, a selection from the 1937 exhibition Entartete Kunst in Munich, the heart of Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Peter's father John has died in Epiphany and his mother Mrs. Vanderwaal has pressed upon him a box that contains his father's life story. Also in the meantime, Amedeo finds on a Zender bookshelf a small drawing signed \\"Modigliani\\" ‚Äîapparently the modern artist Modigliani. From Peter, he learns that Modigliani died young (in 1920); his paintings and drawings were commonly forged in post-war Europe. On the one hand, Amedeo finally recalls that the drawing is familiar because he has seen it many times, within a family photo displayed at the Vanderwaal home. On the other hand, Amedeo and William come to suspect that Mrs. Zender planted the drawing for him to find. Peter never looked closely at John Vanderwaal's box before his mother repossessed it at the exhibition, but Mrs. Vanderwaal follows up a phone conversation with her son by driving her Winnebago to St. Malo and delivering the \\"life\\" directly to Amedeo and William. With John Vanderwaal in hand and Mrs. Zender at hand, Amedeo and William pursue the mystery.

History √ñGEG loco of √ñBB Class 657 at Timelkam The society was founded in 1974 in Linz, with the aim of taking into its ownership one of the steam locomotives that it had cared for, as well as preserving the closed railway line, the Florianerbahn, as a heritage railway. In the following years the √ñGEG acquired several retired √ñBB locomotives. The first one to run again under its own power on √ñBB lines was locomotive √ñBB 93.1455 in 1978. In succeeding years other locomotives were refurbished in the rented √ñBB boiler house at Amstetten, and several were presented to large numbers of the public in 1987 at the 150th anniversary of the railways in Austria at vehicle parades in Strasshof an der Nordbahn and at vehicle shows. In the 1980s the √ñGEG procured a Class 142 locomotive in Romania. This class was a 214 or 12 built under licence in Romania, the largest and most powerful steam locomotive of Austrian design. It was back in service by 1993. After the collapse of the Iron Curtain, numerous well-preserved German locomotives could be bought, particularly from Romania, but also in the former German Democratic Republic. As a result the society was criticised because funding was used to buy several German locomotives without any connexion to the railway history of Austria. These engines were however used commercially for special services with great success. On the retirement of older locomotives from the √ñBB in the early 1990s the √ñGEG also obtained many electric and diesel traction units. √ñGEG's historical railway vehicles are in service today on the √ñBB railway network, on Austrian private railways and also abroad. The Florianerbahn has since been hived off from the √ñGEG and transferred into a separate company. The √ñGEG has two of its own lines today. It runs a long section of the Steyr Valley Railway (Steyrtalbahn) from the Steyr branch line station to Gr√ºnburg. The line is the oldest narrow gauge railway in Austria and has a rail gauge of . It was closed in 1982, and reopened in 1985 as a museum railway. The Steyrtalbahn has eight steam locomotives in its operating fleet. In 1995 the first specials were run on the former coal railway of the WTK (Wolfsegg Traunthaler) from Timelkam to Ampflwang. After that the Ampflwanger Bahn was taken over and is today the √ñGEG standard gauge museum line, ferrying visitors to the railway museum at Ampflwang. In 1995 the √ñGEG also acquired the last steam passenger ship of the Austrian Danube shipping fleet, the Sch√∂nbrunn. Ampflwang Railway Museum Roundhouse at Ampflwang The railway museum in Ampflwang im Hausruckwald houses the society‚Äôs extensive steam loco collection. It is located in a former WTK coal and steel works at the terminus of the former coal railway. In 2005 the Ampflwang railway museum acquired the turntable of the former Bahnbetriebswerk at Rosenheim as well as the traverser from the former SGP factory at Vienna-Simmering. In addition a new roundhouse was built around the turntable.

In a 2001 article in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Peter Norvig wrote that \\"MCL is my favorite IDE on the Macintosh platform for any language and is a serious rival to those on other platforms\\".Extreme Rapid Development History of MCL Development on MCL began in 1984.

In the present day they are usually made of plastic, but before the widespread use of plastic they tended to be made of wood or metal. Beverage crates began to be made of HDPE in the 1950s. Such crates can be long-lasting. In the 1980s in Sweden, a take- back campaign was organized, when 25-bottle crates were replaced by the more ergonomic 20-bottle crates. Some of the crates returned for recycling had been in use since the 1960s. Because manufacturers avoid lead-based and cadmium- based pigmentations, in response to legislation and public opinion, they have had to resort to other methods of colouring HDPE crates. In Japan, since the early 1970s, HDPE bottle crates have been pigmented with a variety of perylene, quinacridone, azo condensation, and Isoindoline pigments. Japanese manufacturers have modified these in order to control nucleating behaviour, and have improved weathering performance and impact-resistance properties by making the light-stabilisization systems more efficient.

The earliest known Rugby football games in Queensland were played in Brisbane from 1876 through to 1878, with the clubs reverting to 'Victorian rules' for the 1879 season. The Rugby code became popular again in the early 1880s, with inter-colonial matches against New South Wales and the formation of the Northern Rugby Union. The game then developed rapidly and became the dominant local football code by 1890. Rugby continued to develop until the early 1900s, when the advent of professional Rugby (later 'Rugby league') in 1908 and the Great War ultimately saw the disbandment of the Queensland Rugby Union (‚ÄòQRU‚Äô) after the 1919 season. The QRU was revived in the late 1920s, and continues to this day as ‚ÄòQueensland Rugby‚Äô. History of rugby union in Queensland Rugby football commenced in Queensland in 1876, when the Brisbane FC (which had played according to the ‚ÄòMelbourne Rules' (now Australian football) since its founding in 1866), and two newly formed football clubs (Bonnet Rouge FC and Rangers FC) elected to play Rugby football. Rugby continued to be played for three seasons, when the clubs reverted to ‚ÄòVictorian rules‚Äô (formerly ‚ÄòMelbourne rules‚Äô) for the 1879 season, together with periodic Rugby games. Fred Lea, an Englishman educated at Allesley College near Rugby in Warwickshire, arrived in Brisbane in 1878 and was amazed to find that Victorian rules (now called Australian Rules) was the only form of football being played. Lea took up the Victorian game, playing it in 1879-81. However, in 1880 he was able to sway two of the local clubs, Brisbane F.C. (founded 1866) and Wallaroo (1878), to try rugby. Three matches were played between the clubs. In the following seasons, Brisbane's four football clubs played matches under both codes, although the majority were overwhelmingly Victorian rules games. In the late winter of 1882 the Brisbane F.C. contacted the Sydney Wallaroo club, challenging them to a rugby match. As the NSWRU were keen to keep the inter-colony matches going, a NSW team journeyed to Brisbane in 1883. Trained in readiness by Fred Lea, the Queensland team ambushed the visitors and gained a victory over the New South Welshmen. The win gave rugby in Brisbane a huge boost, with many footballers wanting to try the code. It was thought that Brisbane's four clubs would simply increase the number of rugby matches for 1884, while still playing Victorian rules as well. However, it soon became clear that moves were afoot to form a ‚ÄòQueensland Football [Victorian rules] Association‚Äô, meaning affiliated clubs could no longer play rugby. With Fred Lea (who would be later called 'The Father of Queensland rugby') actively involved, it was decided to form the Northern Rugby Football Union now named Queensland Rugby Union (QRU). On November 2, 1883, a meeting was held at the Exchange Hotel, in Brisbane and the decision was made to form a rugby association in the Colony of Queensland. The name of the newly founded union the Northern Rugby Union, was used to distinguish it from the Southern Rugby Union, which was the governing body of rugby in New South Wales. Enough players aligned with the rugby body to form two clubs. The decisive blow to Victorian rules came after the decision to make the NSW v Queensland matches an annual fixture, and the visit of a British rugby team in 1888. Teams from New Zealand soon followed. Unable to provide comparable attractions, Victorian rules lost its grip on Brisbane and rugby union quickly spread throughout Queensland to Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Maryborough, Gympie and Charters Towers. Such was the development of Rugby throughout the colony as a result of the formation of the new union, that the three large grammar schools in the south-east region (Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba) changed their football code from Victorian Rules to Rugby. The top- level Rugby competition begun by those schools continues in the local Great Public Schools' Association of Queensland (GPS) system to this day. The year 1893 saw the Northern Rugby Union formally constituted and the name changed to the Queensland Rugby Union. The first organised Brisbane club competition had begun in 1887, but by 1899 the Boer War had reduced player numbers and, to counteract this, electorate rugby was initiated which only allowed players to join the district club in the electorate in which they lived. An annual challenge trophy competition, the Hospital's Cup was introduced in 1899. This trophy is now the Premiership trophy contested by Queensland Premier Rugby clubs. The first decade of the 20th century brought with it a drop in the fortunes of rugby union in Queensland. Electorate rugby collapsed in 1905 allowing for the return of club rugby, but the advent of the professional code, rugby league, in New South Wales saw many union players leaving for Sydney to play rugby league and get paid in the process, something which the amateur code of rugby union could not offer. In 1908, the QRU banned its players from going to Sydney to play rugby league, which resulted in disgruntled players forming the Queensland Rugby League. Of particular note was that at this time, league put down strong roots in the bush and in working class communities and these areas are still the heartland of the modern game of rugby league. In 1913 nine Christian Brothers' College Football Club (Brothers) players represented Queensland in the interstate clash in Sydney and helped the team to a 22 - 21 victory. 1913 Qld Rep Rugby: Pat Murphy, Jimmy Flynn (2nd row 2nd from right), M J McMahon, R McManus, Hugh Flynn (Back row 3rd from right), Vin Carmichael, Tom Ryan, Bill Morrissey and Joe Russell (seated front). Brothers were such a strong club in these years that they entered two teams \\"A\\" & \\"B\\" in the senior premiership in 1914 with the teams meeting each other in the Hospital Cup. Both sides were strong and contained internationals and interstate representative players. During these pre war years Brothers also won the inaugural \\"College\\" grade competition in 1911. World War I, from 1916 to 1918, was almost the final death blow to rugby union in Queensland. Many players went away to war and never returned, and the burgeoning popularity of the professional code saw some major clubs and all the GPS schools switch to rugby league. It seemed that the resultant disbandment of the QRU at the end of the 1919 season, heralded the end of rugby union in Queensland. However, all was not lost. In 1928, the QRU reformed and the major clubs and GPS schools returned to union as a result of bickering amongst league officials and the Senior Club competition restarted in 1929. World War II saw the game struggle once more, but this time it was strong enough to pull through and rugby union continued to grow. In 1950, the QRU secured the use of Normanby at a nominal rent from the Brisbane Grammar School Board of Trustees. In 1961, the Queensland Junior Rugby Union was formed and 1965 saw the formation of the Queensland Country Rugby Union. And finally, in 1966, the QRU moved to the home of Queensland rugby union, Ballymore. Having paid a secretary to perform various tasks during the 1960s and 1970s, Terry Doyle was appointed as the first chief executive officer of the QRU in 1980. He stayed with the QRU until 1996 and saw the organisation grow from one person to 32 personnel. From 1980 to 1997, the QRU offices were located underneath the McLean Stand at Ballymore. In 1997, the administration arm moved to Mallon Street, in the Brisbane suburb of Bowen Hills. The Reds staff, however, remained at Ballymore and were joined in 1998 by the staff of the Reds Rugby College. And finally, in 2004, the administration personnel were relocated to the newly built Rugby House at Ballymore, bringing the entire organisation back to one location.  Recent events  Rugby union in Queenlsand has seen extremely high growth since the 2003 Rugby World Cup. There are now more than 50,000 players throughout Queensland, including 8,600 seniors, 23,000 regular school players (more than any other state) and over 14,000 junior club players. There are 200 clubs throughout the state and more than 235 Queensland schools - with many non-traditional rugby schools adopting the code as well. Queenlsand Rugby is held together by the strong and dedicated supporters. More than 8,000 volunteers work to support their clubs around the state. Queensland state teamIntercolony/Interstate matches= The year 1882 saw the first of many intercolony and interstate matches between Queensland and New South Wales rugby union teams. New South Wales took out the inaugural match, 28-4. The following year, Brisbane hosted its first intercolony match, defeating New South Wales 12-11 at the Eagle Farm Racecourse. Today, the Queensland team in Super Rugby, the Queensland Reds, face NSW, ACT, WA and Victoria representative teams home and away each season. National championships The National Rugby Championship (NRC) was launched by the ARU in 2014, reinstating the national competition after an absence of six years. The previous competition was the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC) which was discontinued after only one season in 2007. The NRC is contested by nine professional teams from around Australia, with the season running from August through to November. Queensland is represented by two teams in the NRC: * Brisbane City, playing out of Ballymore * Queensland Country, playing out of Bond University on the Gold Coast. The teams are based in the same cities as the former ARC sides, the Ballymore Tornadoes, and East Coast Aces respectively. Both are managed by the QRU, with the coaching and training programs used at the Queensland Reds extended to players joining the NRC teams from the Reds and local Queensland clubs. Brisbane City won the inaugural NRC competition, defeating Perth Spirit in the 2014 grand final. CompetitionsPremier rugby= Queensland Premier Rugby is currently the highest level competition in the state and equivalent to the Shute Shield in NSW. There are currently nine teams that compete in the annual competition: *Bond University *Brothers Old Boys *Easts *GPS *Norths *Souths *Sunnybank *University of Queensland *Wests =Country rugby= The Queensland Country Rugby Union has eleven country sub-unions, each running their own club competitions during the year. The sub-unions are grouped into three regional divisions in Northern, Central, and Southern Queensland: North Queensland *Cairns *Townsville * Mount Isa * Mackay Central Queensland * Rockhampton * Central Highlands * Western Queensland * Wide Bay ‚Äì selected from Bundaberg and District Rugby Union, plus teams from Fraser Coast, Gympie, and South Burnett. South Queensland *Sunshine Coast Rugby Union * Darling Downs Rugby Union *Gold Coast District Rugby Union Sub-union teams compete in Regional Championships against other teams in their regional division. Representative sides from the three regions are then selected to play at the Queensland Country Championships. Following the Country Championships, a representative Queensland Country Heelers team is selected by the Queensland Country Rugby Union to play regular fixtures including City-Country matches against Brisbane selections, and the \\"Battle of the Borders\\" Cup against the New South Wales Country Cockatoos. =Queensland State Cup= The Queensland State Cup was an early-season statewide premier competition that was run for just one season in 2009. It involved 16 Queensland teams; 9 Brisbane clubs and 7 teams based in the major sub-unions of Queensland Country. The competition ran prior to the Queensland Premier Rugby competition. Due to logistical issues the competition has now ceased. =Brisbane club rugby= Club rugby in Brisbane starts at an Under 7 years of age level and goes right up to an open age group level just below the premier level. =Suburban rugby= The grassroots rugby competition colloquially known as \\"Subbies\\" in Brisbane and South East Queensland is run by the Queensland Suburban Rugby Union (QSRU). The purpose of this competition is to provide community-based recreation for participants, irrespective of ability. It provides another tier of rugby behind the main Brisbane club competition. The \\"Subbies\\" competition has around 1,000 players and 25 clubs competing across 3 divisions: As of 2014, the First Division clubs competing for the Barber Cup and Pegg Cup are: * Brisbane Irish RFC * Caboolture RFC * Everton Park RFC * Goodna RFC * Ipswich RFC * Pine Rivers Boars RFC * Redlands RFC * Springfield RFC * Wynnum RUC The QSRU also selects a Queensland Suburban team to play an annual match against New South Wales Suburban for the Barraclough Shield. = Women's rugby= Club competitions for women's 15-a-side teams are run in Brisbane, Sunshine Coast and Cairns. The Queensland Rugby Union sends a Queensland side to the ARU's National Championship each year. Queensland also selects 7-a-side teams to compete in the National Sevens Championships and tournaments such as the Darwin Hottest Sevens. The ten clubs in the Brisbane Women's competition, as of 2014, are: *Albany Creek-GPS *Colleges *Goodna *GPS *Logan City *Norths *Redlands *Sunnybank *University of Queensland *Wests = Schools and Junior rugby= The Queensland Rugby Football Schools Union (QRFSU) administers the game within Queensland schools and selects state teams for national championships at various age group levels, including the Australian Schools Rugby Championships. Clubs for junior rugby players (up to 17 years of age) operate within the Queensland Junior Rugby Union (QJRU), which also holds state championships for representative teams from metropolitan and country regions. Ballymore Cup The Ballymore Cup is the largest school boys rugby competition in Queensland. It was founded to promote the sport of rugby across rural and metropolitan Queensland. The winner of the 2012 Ballymore Cup in the open age went to Rockhampton Grammar, and in the under-15's St Brendan's College, Yeppoon.

(NRC, reporting mark: NR / ‡§®‡•á. ‡§∞‡•á) is a state-owned company which operates passenger train service in Nepal. Currently it operates passenger transport service on the 28 km line from Jaynagar, India to Janakpur,Nepal. History A Nepal Railway locomotive in 1927 during the reign of Rana PM Chandra SJBR The first railway in Nepal was the Nepal Government Railway (NGR), a narrow gauge railway, built by the British in 1927, during the Rana period. The railway connected Raxaul in British India with Amlekhganj in the Kingdom of Nepal. This line allowed people from different areas of the country to reach Amlekhganj, and helped move heavy vehicles to Bhimphedi. It was then possible to reach Kathmandu from Bhimphedi on foot. The railway possessed seven steam locomotives, 12 coaches and 82 wagons. It operated steam-powered Garratt locomotives manufactured by Beyer, Peacock and Company of the United Kingdom. The second railway in the country was the Nepal Janakpur‚ÄìJaynagar Railway (NJJR), a narrow gauge railway, built by the British in 1937, during the Rana period. This track was built to carry timber from the then heavily forested areas of Janakpur in the Kingdom of Nepal to Jaynagar in British India. The railway was later extended to Bijalpura. The Raxaul-Amlekhganj railway track was operational until 1965. It was closed down after opening of the Tribhuvan Highway. The railway track from Raxaul was converted to broad gauge by Indian Railways to connect Sirsiya (Birganj) Inland Container Depot (ICD). The railway became fully operational in 2005, though certain segments were used as early as 2002. It is used to move containers and other cargo to and from the Kolkata port and other places in India. It is the most important entry point for imports into China, and is essential for Nepal's commerce and trade. Birganj is located from the Kolkata port by railway. After a washout of the railway embankment and two bridges, the track between Janakpur and Bijayalpura (22 km railway line) was closed in 2001. The remaining Janakpur‚ÄìJaynagar railway track was converted to broad gauge in 2018. The extension to Bardibas remains under construction. Incidents * In August 2012, a serious incident occurred when a locomotive ran away without bogies while a driver was putting in oil. The locomotive ran from Jaynagar to Janakpur at speeds far exceeding the restrictions on the line, resulting in the normally two-and-a-half hours journey of taking only 45 minutes. The staff at Janakpur diverted the locomotive engine onto a damaged track where its wheels became stuck in the ground and it came to a full stop without causing any injuries.

He is known for his improv style, never playing a song the same way twice.  Early career  After graduating from Brooklyn College with a music degree in 1970, Garson was a member of rock/country/jazz band Brethren with Rick Marotta, Tom Cosgrove and Stu Woods. They recorded two hard-to-find albums, Brethren (1970) and Moment of Truth (1971), on the Tiffany label, which featured guest piano and liner notes by Dr. John (and album photography by Murray Head, who scored a hit with \\"Say it Ain't So Joe\\", \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\", and later with the single \\"One Night in Bangkok\\").

Bowie at the time was on the verge of breaking America, already huge in Britain ... Garson also earned notice when he played on the I'm the One (1972) album by early 1970s experimental artist Annette Peacock. David Bowie asked Peacock to join him on a tour; she declined, but Garson began an enduring working relationship with Bowie.  Work with David Bowie Garson was David Bowie‚Äôs longest and most frequent band member. They performed together for both Bowie's first and last concerts in the United States as well as 1,000 concerts around the globe in between. Garson provided the piano and keyboard backing on the later Ziggy Stardust tour of 1972‚Äì73 and his contribution to the song \\"Aladdin Sane\\" (1973) gave the song an avant-garde jazz feel with lengthy and sometimes atonal piano solos. Garson played also for Bowie's guitarist bandmate Mick Ronson on his first and last solo tour, and his first Slaughter on Tenth Avenue (1974) and second solo album Play Don't Worry (1975). Garson came to replace Ronson as Bowie's musical lieutenant on several occasions, notably on \\"We Are the Dead\\" from the 1974 Diamond Dogs album, where Garson's metronome- like keyboard provides a dramatic setting for Bowie's vocals, and on the title track to Young Americans (1975) where his jaunty piano leads the band. Garson played with Bowie on and off over the years, resurfacing on The Buddha of Suburbia (1993) and 1 Outside (1995).  Music career  Parallel to this work with Bowie, Garson engaged in his own solo career as a jazz pianist. He is regarded in the industry as one of the very few 'rock' pianists capable of performing extended piano solos. He remains one of the most highly sought- after session musicians with a unique sound of his own. Garson worked with the reformed Spiders from Mars in 1975, alongside Mick Woodmansey, Trevor Bolder, Dave Black (guitar) and Pete McDonald (vocals). They recorded one eponymous album in 1976 before going their separate ways. In 1984, Garson became a member of the jazz ensemble Free Flight, founded by flautist Jim Walker. In 1993, Garson began a short-lived series of Screen Themes albums, jazz renditions of major themes and suites from film scores of 1993 (Man & a Woman, Sax at the Movies), and the following year, 1994 (Reel Romance). The latter album featured the recording debut of Jessica L. Tivens, at age 13, who had previously appeared on the American television show Star Search. Both albums were released by Discovery Records. Garson joined in 1998 The Smashing Pumpkins for their Adore tour, playing piano, keyboards and synthesizer. His piano playing was an integral part of the Pumpkins' performance. After the tour, he joined The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Billy Corgan on his solo effort‚Äîthe soundtrack for the 1999 supernatural horror film Stigmata. Additionally Garson played piano on The Smashing Pumpkins next 2000 album Machina/The Machines of God on the songs \\"Glass and the Ghost Children\\" and \\"With Every Light\\". Garson has played also on Nine Inch Nails 1999 album The Fragile, in 2000 with No Doubt and Perry Farrell, in 2007 with St. Vincent, and many others. Garson collaborated with Nine Inch Nails singer Trent Reznor again on for the Grammy nominated score to the 2014 Gone Girl film on which they collaborated and Garson performed. Mike Garson appeared on Myspace with his own music site, and to date has released some 50 free tracks. He is currently working on three new albums, as well as collaborating with several bands as touring player/session musician. His latest collaboration shows up on the last \\"met-on-Myspace\\" French artist Kuta's 2007 album A Home. Garson also contributed to and received co writing credit on the track \\"Something Unseen\\" by Athens, Georgia based power pop band Chris McKay & the Critical Darlings. He has also been collaborating with the Norwegian band Sleepyard. In addition to this, he worked on the writing and recording of two songs on mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan's 2010 release, Option Paralysis. In 2011, Garson contributed a remarkable piano solo to \\"Night Garden\\", a pop-psychedelic-Latin jazz song by singer-songwriter Johnny J. Blair. The track was issued on Blair's album I Like the Street , an album that drew comparisons to David Bowie, Roxy Music, and Velvet Underground. Garson premiered a new commissioned work in 2014, written in collaboration with medical patients in partnership with brain surgeon Dr. Christopher Duma of the Foundation for Neuroscience, Stroke and Recovery. Mike‚Äôs work, a set of movements of original music compositions, titled ‚ÄúSymphonic Healing Suite‚Äù which will continue with the National Symphony in 2016 along with Garson‚Äôs latest solo album release. A comprehensive biography of Garson's life and career to date was published in 2015, under the title Bowie's Piano Man: The Life of Mike Garson, by Clifford Slapper.  Current work  Garson performed in the concert series Celebrating David Bowie from early 2017 through early 2018 and headlined a tour of the UK in November 2017 with his Aladdin Sane tour. Mike and fellow David Bowie band alumni began touring in 2018 with a new show A Bowie Celebration: The David Bowie Alumni Tour and continued the tour each year since.. In December 2018, Garson returned to perform with both The Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails in separate Los Angeles area concerts. Mike continued his collaboration with Reznor in 2019, composing the opening piano number for his HBO series Watchmen score. In 2020, Mike's Bowie alumni tour returned to play the Diamond Dogs and Ziggy Stardust albums in their entirety only to be stopped by the COVID-19_pandemic after having performed just a portion of their previously scheduled tour dates.  Personal life  Garson married his wife Susan on March 24, 1968. They have two daughters, Jennifer and Heather, and seven grandchildren. They lived in Bell Canyon, California where Garson had his recording studio,Hero: David Bowie ‚Äì Lesley-Ann Jones ‚Äì Google Books Retrieved 2016-12-09. until the Woolsey Fires hit, leveling both Garson's home and studio to the ground. Garson joined the Church of Scientology in 1970, having been introduced to it by Chick Corea. While he played with Bowie he advocated Scientology to the other members of the Spiders from Mars, with Woodmansey converting as a result. Garson left the Church in 1982.

It is the only certification scheme which, with the same logo, certifies both wild and farmed seafood.  Overview  Friend of the Sea was started in 2008, by environmentalist and economist Paolo Bray, Director of International Programs of the Dolphin-Safe Tuna program and as a project of the Earth Island Institute, the NGO which operates the successful International Dolphin-Safe project.International Dolphin-Safe project Some of the main world retailers participate, such as Carrefour, Coop Italia, Manor, Finiper, Aligro, Citysuper, Coldstorage, Conad, Despar, Esselunga, Fairprice, Lidl, Metro, Rewe, Spar, Walgreens, Walmart. Some important producers also have their products certified. Friend of the Sea‚Äôs mission, in line with the United Nations 2020 Sustainable Development Goal 14, is to use its ecolabel and conservation projects and campaigns to contribute to the health of the world's oceans. Friend of the Sea audits of seafood and omega3 products from sustainable fisheries and aquaculture are carried out only by qualified auditors of international certification bodies accredited by national accreditation bodies.Friend of the Sea is the only standard for sustainable fisheries to be recognized by the national accreditation bodies. Audits and surveillance are carried out every year. As of 2018, FoS certifies about 770 companies including both farmed and wild species including 44 approved fisheries and fleets, 3,000 products and 150 commercial species have been certified by FoS. As per the 2015 UN State of Sustainability Initiatives, its certified volumes have \\"grown at a rate of 91% per annum between 2008 and 2015, reaching 9.3 million metric tons of FoS certified wild catch seafood in 2015.\\" Friend of the Sea, in collaboration with FEM2-Ambiente, has introduced the systematic use of DNA Barcoding to avoid frauds and to confirm seafood and omega3 products sustainability.  Studies and recognitions  According to the ‚ÄúState of Sustainability Initiatives Review: Standards and the Blue Economy‚Äù published in 2016 by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), ‚ÄúFOS production has grown at a rate of 91% per annum between 2008 and 2015, reaching 9.3 million metric tons of FOS-certified wild catch seafood in 2015 (5.7% of global, 10.1% of total wild catch) making it the single largest source of certified catch on the global market.‚Äù Friend of the Sea is a Member Associate of Infofish, the project of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, providing marketing information and technical advisory services to the fishery industry. The peer reviewed study ‚ÄúEvaluation and legal assessment of certified seafood‚Äù by Rainer Froese and Alexander Proelss concluded that ‚ÄúFor the stocks with available status information, 19% (FOS) to 31% (MSC) Marine Stewardship Council had overfished stock sizes and were subject to ongoing overfishing.‚Äù thus highlighting the performance of FOS standards. The report ‚ÄúDe-Coding Seafood Eco-Labels: How the European Commission Can Help Consumers Access Sustainable Seafood‚Äù by Food and Water Watch Europe identified only 4 concerns regarding Friend of the Sea fisheries standard compared to 8 concerns regarding MSC.  Conservation projects and campaigns  In May 2019 Friend of the Sea managed to lead Just Eat, Deliveroo and Menulog (Australia) to take off shark fin soups off their menu. FOS's Change.org petition to prevent ship strikes has obtained almost 50.000 signatures. FOS managed to lead the major members of the World Shipping Council to request the Sri Lankan government to shift the shipping lanes 15 miles South of current lanes, to reduce whales strikes by over 90%. Friend of the Sea collaborates with Tartalife project, introducing a Turtle Safe certification label to motivate fishermen and shipowners to deploy Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and other turtle bycatch reduction measures. Friend of the Sea supports the Maldives Whale Shark Research Program (MWSRP), a research based conservation charity dedicated to whale shark studies and fostering community-focused conservation initiatives in the Maldives and the greater Indian Ocean. Friend of the Sea supports The Aquaculture Development for the Environment Organisation (ADE), is a non- profit organisation that develops coral reef conservation and research projects in Fiji, such as reef rehabilitation with the involvement of the local community. Compliance and criteria Friend of the Sea's criteria compliance is verified by independent accredited certification bodies. Essential criteria for fisheries are: * the product should not originate from overexploited (nor depleted, data deficient or recovering) stocks * the fishing method should not impact the seabed * the fishing method should be selective (below the world average for discards, which in 2005 was about 8%). * the fishery should respect all legal requirements.

Skouras (born March 21, 1963) is a retired Greek-American soccer midfielder who was the \\"First American Born Professional Soccer player to sign a contract in a European First Division.\\" On December 15, 1984 Skouras signed a first team contract with Greek First Division power Olympiakos Piraeus pioneering the way for American professional soccer players to create careers in Europe and around the world. Skouras' professional career in Europe began with the opportunity and exposure provided by the United States Soccer Federation's Youth National Team programs which began in England as a youth professional with Brighton & Hove Albion of the English First Division. Skouras played professionally in both the United States and Greece for over ten seasons. Player In 1978, Skouras was selected by the United States Soccer Federation to participate in the prestigious Montigue, France International (U-15) youth tournament. Coached by Bill Muse and Lothar Osiander and captained by Skouras, the US played two scoreless games against Romania and Portugal before losing 5‚Äì0 to France and 1‚Äì0 to West Germany. Upon his return to the United States, Skouras was identified by English 1st Division Club Brighton & Hove Albion, who were on tour in the United States. Brighton manager Alan Mullery offered Skouras a three-month trial at Brighton. After signing \\"apprentice forms\\" and spending one season with Brighton & Hove Albion's apprentice professional ranks, Skouras' work permit application was denied by the U.K. Home Office. Peter Skouras returned to the United States and turned professional at the age of sixteen with the California Sunshine of the American Soccer League, making Skouras the youngest native born American professional soccer player of his time. In the fall of 1980 and at the conclusion of the CONCACAF qualifications of which the United States coached by Walt Chyzowich and assisted by Bob Gansler qualified for the Coca-Cola Youth World Cup in Australia, Skouras was once again the youngster on the United States U-20 squad. At the age of 17, Skouras was signed immediately by Ron Newman and the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League making him the youngest native born North American in a league dominated by foreign international stars. Despite a major reconstruction knee surgery, Skouras survived and played two NASL indoor seasons, four NASL outdoor seasons and one Major Indoor Soccer League season with the Sockers while American players were being released on a daily basis. In 1984 at 21 years of age, the North American Soccer League ceased operations and Skouras made the trip to West Germany to continue his ambitions and living. After multiple trials at Bundesliga clubs, Skouras finally landed a contract with Karlsruhe Sport Club. After observing Skouras, Werner Olk the Karlsruhe manager gave the \\"green light\\" for the acquisition of Skouras which officially made Skouras the \\"First American\\" to sign a European First Division contract. Ironically and in a matter of days, Skouras was transferred to Greek Super League power Olympiakos Piraeus with the confirmation of former Netherlands and current Manager Georg Ke√üler and United States National Team Manager Alketas Panagoulias. Skouras spent one year at Olympiakos (December 1984 ‚Äì 1985) playing in a few number of matches. However, being selected week in and week out in the squads of 16 was not a simple feat in such a \\"massive club\\" as Olympiakos. Returning to the United States in 1986 and signing for a short period with the San Jose Earthquakes of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL), PAOK Thessaloniki of the Greek Super League signed Skouras under the direction of former Dutch National Team Manager Thijs Libregts. Due to Skouras' physical style of play,injuries plagued Skouras throughout his stay in the Greek Sub- Capital. Skouras continued his footballing career in the Greek Super League with Diagoras Rhodes for the 1987-88 season, and in the Greek Second Professional Division with Panseraikos F.C. who in 1988‚Äì89 were promoted to the Greek Super League under the technical guidance of Athanasios Dokas. In 1990, Skouras returned to the United States and the Los Angeles Heat of the American Professional Soccer League. After a few number of matches, injury again plagued Skouras with a severely torn hamstring and would bring his playing career to an end. Skouras was 27 years of age. Coach On September 16, 1994, the Buffalo Blizzard of the National Professional Soccer League hired Skouras as head coach.September 16, 1994 Transactions Due to serious health reasons, Skouras stepped down and was replaced by Brian May. Upon his return, in 1994 Skouras assisted the Hellenic Football Federation with \\"Scouting\\" data for then National Team Manager Alketas Panagoulias. Additionally, Skouras worked with numerous players both professional and youth on an individual level where fitness was concerned. In 1989, Skouras also \\"Scouted\\" for the California Youth Soccer Association-South (CYSA-S) while under the direction of former US National Team Coach, Steve Sampson who implemented a massive youth player identification program in the Southern California area.

He studied in Frankfurt am Main under Joachim Raff. In 1854 he married Wagner's niece Franziska (1829-1895). They had a daughter Hertha, who in 1902 became the wife of the Austrian composer Siegmund von Hausegger. Ritter had a strong influence on Richard Strauss. He persuaded him to abandon the conservative style of his youth, and begin writing tone poems; he also introduced Strauss to the essays of Richard Wagner and the writings of Schopenhauer. He encouraged Strauss to write his first opera Guntram, but was deeply disappointed at the final version of the libretto, which Ritter took to be a rejection of Schopenhauerian-Christian ideals.

Its outsource is the Beaver Brook, which flows into Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey's largest lake. Lake Shawnee and its watershed are the headwaters of the Musconetcong River watershed. The Lake Shawnee Reservation as it is known was developed in 1946 by the Arthur D. Crane Company of Sparta, real estate developers, which incorporated the Lake Shawnee Club and began selling home sites on the Lake many of which were originally summer homes. By 1948, the first two homes were built and during the next 15 years the Club reached its peak of 562 resident members. The clubhouse was then constructed and First Beach, not included in the original deeds, was subsequently purchased from the Crane Company with funds raised from within the membership. Carl Peterson was instrumental in developing the Third Beach area and was known as Mr. Shawnee among local residents. The Lake Shawnee dam was damaged during a storm in March 2010. The dam had already been under pressure by a snowy winter, causing rising water levels. In 2016, there was an effort to change the mailing address from a Wharton, New Jersey 07885 ZIP code, to a Lake Hopatcong 07849 ZIP code. The effort was narrowly defeated.

She was nominated by President-elect Barack Obama on December 19, 2008, confirmed unanimously by the Senate on April 2, 2009, and sworn in on April 6, 2009. During her tenure, her office was elevated to the rank of Cabinet-level officer, expanding her power on policy decisions and granting her inclusion in the President's cabinet meetings. On February 11, 2013, she announced her resignation as Administratorhttps://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-initiatives/small-business- jobs-act-2010 and left the post on September 1, 2013. Since leaving the SBA, Mills has served as a Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School and Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. She is the president of the investment firm MMP Group, Inc., the vice chairman of the board of directors of the immigration services company Envoy Global, and a regular contributor to Fortune and other publications. She is the author of Fintech, Small Business & the American Dream. Early life Mills is the daughter of Ellen (n√©e Rubin), the CEO of Tootsie Roll since 2015, and Melvin Gordon, the President and CEO of Tootsie Roll Industries from 1962 until 2015. She holds an AB in economics from Harvard University and an MBA from Harvard Business School, where she was a Baker Scholar.  Career  During the 1980s and 1990s, Mills invested in and managed several small manufacturing firms throughout the country, including producers of hardwood flooring, refrigerator motors, and plastic injection molding. Before becoming SBA Administrator, Mills served as president of the private equity firm MMP Group, a firm focused on growing businesses in areas such as consumer products, food, textiles, and industrial components. Prior to MMP, she was a founding partner and managing director of Solera Capital, a venture capital firm based in New York City which invested in many women-owned firms, such as natural food producer Annie's. In 2007, former Maine Governor John Baldacci appointed her to chair the state's Council on Competitiveness and the Economy, which was focused on rural and regional development. She also served on the state's Council for the Redevelopment of the Brunswick Naval Air Station. Previously, she has worked as a management consultant in the US and Europe for McKinsey and Co., and as a product manager for General Foods, and has served on the boards of directors for Scotts Miracle-Gro and Arrow Electronics.  Clustering  Mills is an advocate for regional innovation clusters‚Äîgeographic groupings of related industries (such as tech companies in Silicon Valley) that can share resources, ideas, and human capital. In 2005, Mills became involved with the effort to create new jobs following the closing of the Brunswick Naval Air Station. She helped organize the North Star Alliance, a partnership between local boat builders, composite material manufacturers, and researchers at the University of Maine, which has helped increase the global competitiveness of Maine's boat building and composite industries. She went on to organize the creation of a specialty foods cluster in Maine, with specialty producers, such as Peak Organic Beer, taking advantage of Maine's local agriculture. In 2007 she was appointed chair of Maine's Council on Competitiveness and the Economy, where she focused on attracting investment in regional industries and rural areas of Maine.[tt_news]=1&tx;_ttnews[backPid]=2&cHash;=1b6bfe2dda) Drawing on her experience working with regional innovation clusters, Mills authored a paper on the subject for the Brookings Institution in April, 2008.  US Small Business Administration  Created in 1953, the Small Business Administration operates in four key areas: expanding access to capital, increasing government contracting opportunities, entrepreneurial development, and disaster relief. The agency gained a higher profile under President Obama, who made small businesses a cornerstone of his effort to revive the economy in the wake of the Great Recession. Mills was confirmed as Administrator of the SBA at a critical time in early 2009 when the small business lending market had ground to a halt, including SBA-backed lending. She oversaw implementation of key provisions of President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including the waiving of fees on SBA-backed loans and increasing the agency's government guarantee on loans made by private sector lenders. The impact of these provisions were immediate with average weekly loan volume increasing by more than 60 percent. Leveraging bipartisan support for America's small businesses, Mills led efforts for the passage of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which was referred to at the time as the most significant piece of small business legislation in more than a decade. Among other things, the Act extended the successful Recovery Act loan provisions, raised the maximum size of SBA-guaranteed loans, expanded opportunities for small businesses competing for federal contracts, created the State Trade and Export grant program, provided $50 million in additional funding for Small Business Development Centers, and strengthened the agency's oversight and enforcement tools. Under Mills, SBA also launched the Impact Fund pilot program, under the agency's Small Business Investment Company program, with the goal of capitalizing investment funds that seek both financial and social return, as well as its first regional clusters initiative.http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2010/04/sbas- mills-making-progress-in-forming.html In January 2012, the position of Administrator of the SBA was elevated to the rank of Cabinet-level officer, expanding Mills' power on policy decisions and granting her access to cabinet meetings. On February 11, 2013, she announced that she would resign as Administrator of the SBA, with President Obama saying that; \\"because of Karen's hard work and dedication, our small businesses are better positioned to create jobs and our entire economy is stronger.\\" Mills left her position at SBA on September 1, 2013. She received praise for her leadership of the agency from the lending industry because of her work to tackle outdated regulations, bureaucracy and strengthening and simplifying the agency's core loan programs. During her tenure, the agency supported more than $106 billion in lending to more than 193,000 small businesses, including two record years of SBA-backed lending and three record years of investments made through the Small Business Investment Company program. Additionally, in federal fiscal years 2011‚Äì13, $286.3 billion in federal contracts were awarded to small businesses, which was $32 billion more than the three previous years.  Post-SBA work  Since leaving the SBA, Mills has served as a Senior Fellow at the Harvard Business School and was previously a Senior Fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School . In July 2014, she released The State of Small Business Lending: Credit Access During the Recovery and How Technology May Change the Game, which looked at the structural and cyclical contributors to the severity of the credit crunch following the 2008‚Äì2009 recession and the slow recovery of the small business lending markets. It also examined the rapid growth, trends and impact of online lenders focused on the small business market. In November 2016, she co- authored The State of Small Business Lending: Innovation and Technology and Implications for Regulation Additionally, at HBS she has contributed research and recommendations on the link between entrepreneurship and middle class opportunity, including in the September 2015 U.S. Competitiveness project reports The Challenge of Shared Prosperity and Growth and Shared Prosperity. In both reports she authored sections considering the impact of the declining rate of new business startups on issues like income inequality and economic mobility, and offered recommendations on how to increase startup rates through a combination of policies focused on access to capital, skills training and the creation of entrepreneurial ecosystems. She is also a member of the Milstein Commission on Entrepreneurship and Middle Class Jobs at the University of Virginia's Miller Center and a contributor to the commission's January 2015 report Can Startups Save the American Dream? which proposed a series of \\"practical, meaningful measures that can generate consensus and advance America's startup community in service of the middle class.\\" She is a Chair of the Advisory Committee for the Private Capital Research Institute, co-Chair of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Main Street Finance Task Force, a member of the Milken Institute's Fintech Advisory Committee, and serves on the Board of Directors of the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 2013, Mills also returned to her position as president of MMP Group, Inc., a firm that has invested in businesses in consumer products and services, food, textiles, and industrial components, and is the vice chairman of the board of the immigration services company Envoy Global. She also served on the board of the Maine Technology Institute, a nonprofit that invests in local technology companies and innovative small businesses. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and previously served as a vice chairman of the Harvard Board of Overseers, the older, more consultative, and larger of the two Harvard governing bodies. In 2014, she was elected to fill a vacancy in the Harvard Corporation (made up of the President and Fellows of Harvard College), the University's smaller governing body that is its principal fiduciary authority.https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/pages/profile.aspx?facId=123725 She is also the recipient of the U.S. Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award and a regular contributor to Fortune and other publications, writing primarily on the economy, small business and entrepreneurship.

Although it includes some detail about the president- elect's early life, its focus is on the period between Obama's landmark speech to the 2004 Democratic National Convention and his election as president on November 4, 2008. It draws heavily on Stanage's eye-witness campaign trail reporting, including interviews with key Obama advisers, old friends and grassroots volunteers.

Capercaillie performs traditional Gaelic and contemporary English songs. The group adapts traditional Gaelic music and traditional lyrics with modern production techniques and instruments such as electric guitar and bass guitar, though rarely synthesizers or drum machines. The group's albums have appeared in the UK Albums Chart. Origins Originating from Argyll, a region of western Scotland, the band is named after the Western capercaillie, sometimes called a wood grouse, a native Scottish bird. Their first album, Cascade, was recorded in 1984. Musical style Capercaillie's repertoire includes both traditional Gaelic songs and tunes, as well as modern English-language songs and tunes, composed by other folk writers and musicians, or by members of the band. The group often adapt traditional Gaelic songs and music using modern production techniques, and often mix musical forms, combining traditional lyrics and tunes with modern techniques and instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines, electric guitar and bass. Capercaillie's first two albums, Cascade and Crosswinds featured few modern instruments and the tunes and songs were played in a more traditional arrangement. However beginning with later albums such as Sidewaulk, and the soundtrack of The Blood Is Strong, Capercaillie began to experiment with adding funk bass-lines into certain tracks, as well as synthesisers and electric guitar. This fusion style gained Capercaillie chart success in the 1990s, on albums such as Delirium and Secret People (see Chart Success, below) and reached its peak in the albums To the Moon and Beautiful Wasteland, with the remix albums Get Out and Capercaillie being released during this period. Capercaillie have drawn back slightly from the heavy fusion style featured on their albums the 1990s, and their more recent albums from N√†durra (2003) up to At the Heart of It All (2013) feature more traditional arrangements and instruments, while still retaining a slight fusion feel. The opening track from their 2000 album N√†durra, \\"Skye Waulking Song\\", is used in the Edexcel Music GCSE Specification from 2009 onwards. The song is in the world music section, and is used as a representation of traditional folk music combined with rock music. Chart success Their 1992 EP, A Prince Among Islands, was the first Scottish Gaelic-language record to have a single that reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart: \\"Coisich A Ruin\\" peaked at No. 39. Another single, \\"Dark Alan (Ailein duinn)\\" reached No. 65 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1995. The album Secret People (1993) reached No. 40, and To the Moon (1995) peaked at No. 41 in the UK Albums Chart.
