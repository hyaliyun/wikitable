Early life Iosif Berman was born in , near Suceava to a Jewish father who had been awarded the Romanian citizenship for participating in the 1877 Romanian War of Independence.Iosif Berman ‚Äûomul cu o mie de ochi‚Äú, Historia From an early age, Berman became interested in photography and as a child he spent time in the company of the itinerant photographers of Suceava and CernƒÉu»õi. Before the age of 18, he moved to Bucharest, where he earned money to buy a camera.Domnica Macri, \\"Iosif Berman - Un fotograf roman in National Geographic.\\", National Geographic Romania, June 2008, p.39 His first photos were published in 1913 in the ' depicting the cholera lazaretto from Turtucaia. He continued working at the AdevƒÉrul and Diminea≈£a newspapers, both of which were owned by left-wing activist Constantin Mille. During World War I, he was a regiment photographer and he was able to take photos of the October Revolution in Odessa, but his photographic plates were confiscated, on turns, by the Whites and by the Bolsheviks. In 1918, he contributed to Realitatea IlustratƒÉ with a set of photographs of the fleeing German Army. After his regiment was disbanded, he traveled to Novorossiysk, in the Caucasus, where he met Raisa, whom he married and with whom he had a daughter, Luiza. Photojournalist Between 1920 and 1923, he was a correspondent from Istanbul for the Romanian newspaper. After returning to Romania, he was a photographer for the major Romanian newspaper, taking photographs of the Royal Family. During the mid-1920s, Berman collaborated with sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, who studied the Romanian village and traditions, and with for his reportage articles. His photographs were published in all the major Romanian newspapers of the time: AdevƒÉrul, Diminea≈£a, Curentul, Realitatea ilustratƒÉ, Rom√¢nia ilustratƒÉ, Ilustra≈£iunea rom√¢nƒÉ, Cuv√¢ntul liber, ' and also in The New York Times and National Geographic, being a correspondent of the Associated Press and Scandinavian Newspaper Press.

Nevertheless, he continued to work and to send photographs to The New York Times. Following the advice of Romanian historian and later Prime Minister Nicolae Iorga, Berman began using a pseudonym, I. B. Urseanu, (which is a translation of his Jewish name) in order not to attract the attention of the antisemitic Iron Guard. Nevertheless, in 1940, he was banned from continuing his work due to the Anti-Jewish laws which were enacted by the National Legionary State. Depressed, he soon died on September 17, 1941. According to his daughter, he succumbed to a renal disease for which he refused to get any treatment. Legacy After World War II, the communist government tried to use the photos for propaganda, but they were hardly propaganda material. According to a researcher at Museum of the Romanian Peasant, he presented a realist view of the village, with its poor, its gypsies, its village idiot.

He has won the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle in 2011, the RSA Chase in 2012 and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2013 at the Cheltenham Festival, making him the first horse since Flyingbolt in the 1960s to win three different races at consecutive Cheltenham Festivals. In 2012, he also won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury. Bobs Worth is trained by Nicky Henderson, owned by the Not Afraid Partnership. Background Bobs Worth is a bay gelding bred by Mrs L Eadie and foaled on 21 May 2005. His sire was top jump sire Bob Back. Bob Back's progeny include Mildmay Novices' Chase winner Burton Port and Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner Back In Front. Bob Back was a son of 1972 Epsom Derby winner Roberto. Bobs Worth's dam, Fashionista, is a daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner King's Theatre. Racing career =Early career= Bobs Worth started his racing career in the 2009/10 National Hunt season. He ran in two national hunt flat races at Kempton Park, finishing second in one and winning the other. In November 2010 he raced for the first time over hurdles, beating Sire De Grugy by nine lengths in a two- mile novices hurdle race at Kempton Park. He followed this up, racing away from Kempton for the first time, by winning a two and a half mile hurdle race at Cheltenham. He then stepped up in class for the Grade 2 Classic Novices' Hurdle, also at Cheltenham. Ridden by Barry Geraghty, he won the race by two and a quarter lengths from future Champion Hurdle winner Rock On Ruby, with the two nine lengths clear of third placed Habbie Simpson. At the Cheltenham Festival he started as the 15/8 favourite for the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle. In the early stages of the race he was placed in the middle of the eighteen-runner field by Geraghty. He took the lead between the last two hurdles and won by two and a quarter lengths from Mossley. Court In Motion finished in third place, with Champion Court finishing fourth. =2011/12 season= Bobs Worth started his steeplechase career by winning the 2011 Berkshire Novices' Chase, beating former Champion Bumper winner Cue Card by a short head, with the two well clear of the other two runners. He then finished third in the Feltham Novices' Chase, about five lengths behind winner Grands Crus and two lengths behind runner-up Silviniaco Conti. Bobs Worth finished ahead of Silviniaco Conti in his next race, the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase, but was beaten two lengths into second by Invictus. At the 2012 Cheltenham Festival he contested the RSA Chase. Grands Crus started the race as the 6/5 favourite, with the previous year's Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle winner First Lieutenant and Bobs Worth next in the betting, both priced at 9/2. Bobs Worth was in the middle of the pack in the early stages and made progress through the field with eight fences still to jump, taking the lead four out. He was overtaken as they turned into the straight, but regained the lead at the final fence. He drew away near the finish to win by two and a half lengths from First Lieutenant. Call The Police was a further nine lengths back in third, with Grands Crus finishing fourth. =2012/13 season= The Cheltenham Gold Cup, which Bobs Worth won in 2013 Carrying 11 stone 6 pounds, Bobs Worth started as the favourite for the Hennessy Gold Cup. He won the race by three and a quarter lengths from Tidal Bay. After the win, he was immediately installed as the favourite for the 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup, at about 5/1. He was scheduled to take part in the Argento Chase in January, but was withdrawn by trainer Nicky Henderson. He did however take part in a racecourse gallop with Binocular and Long Run in February. On 15 March, Bobs Worth started the 11/4 favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He appeared unlikely to win after being hampered at the third last fence and was still eight lengths behind Long Run on the final turn. Geraghty, however, produced the horse with a strong run to take the lead approaching the final fence and Bobs Worth drew away from the field on the run-in to win by seven lengths from Sir Des Champs. His win took his career prize money earnings to ¬£578,135 and made him the first horse since Flyingbolt in 1964‚Äì1966 to win three different races at the Cheltenham Festival in consecutive years. =2013/14 season= Bobs Worth made his seasonal debut in the Betfair Chase at Haydock Park Racecourse in November and started 15/8 favourite in a strong field which included Silviniaco Conti, Long Run, Tidal Bay and Cue Card. He was never travelling well and was eased down by Geraghty when his chance had gone, finishing sixth, forty lengths behind the winner Cue Card. On 28 December 2013, Bobs Worth started 11/4 joint favourite with Sir Des Champs in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown, a race which also attracted the 2013 RSA Chase winner Lord Windermere. Racing on soft ground, Bobs Worth appeared to be struggling four fences out but stayed on strongly to take the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a half lengths from First Lieutenant, with Sir Des Champs fourth and Lord Windermere seventh of the nine runners. Henderson commented \\"I would have given anything to take him out two days ago. With the ground and the weather, I wasn't that happy with him, but the horse never stops surprising you\\". On 14 March, Bobs Worth started 6/4 favourite ahead of Silviniaco Conti to become the first horse since Best Mate to win consecutive Cheltenham Gold Cups. He was towards the rear of the field in the early stages, but made steady progress to challenge the leader Silviniaco Conti at the last fence, but the two leading contenders were overtaken by a trio of outsiders on the run-in and Bob Worth finished fifth behind Lord Windermere, On His Own, The Giant Bolster and Silviniaco Conti. =2014/15 season= Bobs Worth struggled to recover his form in the following year. He started favourite for the Lexus Chase in December but came home last of the eight finishers behind Road To Riches. When attempting to regain the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March he was never in contention and was pulled up by Geraghty five fences from the finish in a race won by Coneygree. In his final start of the season he raced in the Bet365 Gold Cup and failed to give weight away carrying 11st-8lb finishing only second last. =2015/16 season= Bobs Worth made a successful start of his new campaign on 7 November 2015 in the Betfred Hurdle after being sent off as the outsider of the 5 runner field, he made all from the front and battled well in the last furlong to repel the challenge from his stablemate Simonsig who was also having his first outing for 970 days. Bobs Worth finished 1¬Ω lengths in front of Simonsig and their trainer Nicky Henderson said:\\"It's been a long way back for both of them from the wilderness\\". It was Bobs Worth first run over hurdles since winning the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle at the 2011 Cheltenham Festival and remained unbeaten over the code until coming third in the World Hurdle at the 2016 Cheltenham Festival.

Captured by the Sanfedista forces, he was soon executed along with many other rebels of the Bourbon rule of Ferdinand IV of Naples. Biography He obtained degrees in medicine from Nola and in law from Naples universities. Agreeing with the Jacobin principles of Robespierre, he joined two secret societies - the Club Rivoluzionario and the Societ√† Patrottica - where he advocated the use of revolutionary, armed struggle against the Bourbon state in favor of the weakest in society. He was exiled for holding such \\"proto-communist\\" ideas. Inspired by the French Revolution, Russo fled to Milan, then Switzerland, and then to Rome where he supported the French-supported Roman Republic of 1798-9. During this period he took an active part in the cultural life of the republic, helping organise heated discussions in the democratic clubs and writing for the newly founded press. He was among those who pressed the French into declaring Campania a republic. In the newly proclaimed Neapolitan Republic (also known as the Parthenopean Republic) he contributed to the \\"Monitore Napolitano\\", the journal edited by Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel, and went down to speak among the people. However, the republic was short-lived: Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo soon counter-attacked with his army of Sanfedisti, fighting on the side of the Bourbon king (aided in this mainly by the British), and supported by an uprising of the royalist rabble, the Naples Lazzaroni. With weapons in hand, Russo was taken prisoner on 13 June 1799. He became a martyr to the cause of Italian Jacobinism at the age of 29 when he was hanged in Piazza del Mercato, Naples, on 19 November 1799. He was buried, according to one source,Giglioli, p.139 on the seashore near the Ponte della Maddalena, Naples, for refusing to utter the required words just prior to execution. A later source gives his last resting place as the Church of San Matteo al Lavinaio, Naples. Political thought In his most important work, \\"Pensieri politici\\", published in Rome in 1798, Russo puts forward a socio-political theory of a peasant state, founded on justice and barbarism, where the degree of egalitarianism was to exceed even that of Louis Saint-Just. An individual's freedom from want would be based on the tenancy of a piece of land belonging to the community, and not on hereditary property. Russo establishes a legitimate property limit at just the amount needed to satisfy a person's basic needs; such a limit would be \\"calculated\\" from a combination of the needs of each individual and the amount required to secure his or her economic freedom and equality to other members of the community. So, for Russo, economic equality is the essential precondition for genuine political equality. But such equality would only be possible in small communities, such as the Ancient Greek polis, as had been suggested by Plato and Jean Jacques Rousseau. For both these thinkers, the city should be limited in size in order to guarantee the effective participation of all citizens in the political process. A public system of general education would be necessary in order for everyone to take part in the running of the community in an informed way. Given the close link between landed property and political awareness in Russo's ideal state, it could be likened to a \\"republic of peasant- philosophers\\". He therefore rejects industrial development and commercePagden, p.147 on the basis that they would create, respectively, unhealthy living conditions for workers, and a craving for ever more wealth to the detriment of an honest and simple life. Sections 23-5 of his \\"Pensieri politici\\" contain the fundamentals of his thought on the questions of commerce, agriculture and the city.

Currently, PGL is executing a number of funded game development and game technology projects, including sonic, a low level toolset for creation of audio-only games, and lux, a platform for creation of collaborative games. Both are being developed under a permissive MIT License. Location PGL operates from the 5th floor of 30 South 15th Street (the Graham Building). It was formerly located at the Benjamin's Desk building at 1701 Walnut Street. Funding PGL's core initiative, funded development of games and game technologies by current students and recent graduates of Pennsylvania universities, is backed by a D2PA Grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. History Nathan Solomon founded PGL in late 2011,. Philadelphia Game Lab compares itself to diverse initiatives, including Boston's MassDiGI, Toronto's Hand Eye Society, New York University's Game Center, and creative facilitators/organizations such as The Wild Rumpus, Babycastles and Juegosrancheros. Solomon said of the Philadelphia business environment: \\"We should emphasize bootstrapped entities, and reject the model of massive scalability (required by the conventional tech venture capital model), as the primary requirement of a tech startup. I'm not saying that if someone is offered funding and takes it, that's a bad thing (it's definitely a very good thing); however, this city should brand itself as so good for bootstrapping that it has unique value that cannot be found in NYC or San Francisco or even Boston.\\" Regarding locating in Philadelphia, Solomon said, \\"From a hard numbers perspective, Philadelphia probably has the lowest per- capita number of professional game developers for a city its size in North America. At the same time, though, Philadelphia is a great place for creative and technical initiatives, and I think there's a valid argument that we're uniquely strong in grassroots initiatives here, especially those for social or creative good.\\" Grassroots Game Conference First held in from April 23 to April 28 in 2012 in coordination with Philly Tech Week, the Grassroots Game Conference is an annual event which targets game developers, as well as those involved in arts, non-profits, and education. The conference is dedicated to facilitating \\"small team\\" game development, with tracks in Games and Art, Games and Music, and Games and Gamification for Non-profits. The conference differs from-user-focused events such the Penny Arcade Expo and ComicCon, events focused on professional developers such as the Game Developers Conference and retail event Electronic Entertainment Expo. Similar events include Indiecade and the Games for Change Festival. Nationally recognized game developers and educators spoke at the 2012 event, including representatives from the Smithsonian, the National Endowment for the Arts, and GlitchLabs. Gabe Zichermann, a gamification expert, gave the keynote speech. The 2013 Grassroots Game Conference was significantly larger than 2012, including more events and additional interest tracks, as well as international presenters.

Family and early life  Ted Lousley was born in 1907 at Clapham, London, England, and was the only son of Jethro Lousley MBE (1882 ‚Äì 1963) and Christine Clarke (c. 1880 ‚Äì 1945) who was of Huguenot stock. He married Dorothy Winifred Thorpe (1913-2000) and they had one child, Margaret. He went to Strand Grammar School, Brixton, and Selhurst Grammar School, Norbury, and as a schoolboy of 12 or 13 developed an interest in natural history. Along with a group of other like-minded schoolboys he was invited to use the facilities of the South London Botanical Institute and to go on field trips, mainly in the Surrey countryside, with the then curator W. R. Sherrin whose main interest was bryophytes. Botany He left school in April 1924 and worked for ten years for Barclays Bank in South London before moving to the City and working in the Stock Exchange, various city branches and the Trustee Department of Head Office. At the age of 19 he was serving on the council of the British Empire Naturalists Association. He also joined the Watson Botanical Exchange Club in 1926 and the Botanical Society and Exchange Club of the British Isles the following year. He was now meeting or corresponding with other botanists in Britain and gained a reputation for having an intimate knowledge of the British flora. He realised at an early age the need to specialise and chose docks (Rumex), a neglected group, which was to gain him an international reputation. He published two papers in 1939 and 1944 that settled the differences between Patience Dock (Rumex patientia) and Rumex cristatus and found aliens such as Rumex confertus hybridizing with native species. He named Rumex wrightii (R conglomeratus x R frutescens and R cuneifolius), as new to science. Up until the Second World War he gained his knowledge of the British flora by travelling to every part of the British Isles collecting what was to be the largest private herbarium in the British Isles. He first visited the Isles of Scilly in September 1936 and added Western Ramping‚Äìfumitory (Fumaria occidentalis) to the flora. He returned over the next four years covering every month from March to September and recording many additional species. The first manuscript of the flora was completed in 1941 and the work was finally published in 1971. During the Second World War he worked in London which gave him the chance to visit bombed sites and he went on to list species in the Square Mile. It led, in collaboration with Richard Fitter, to the Natural History of the City published in 1953 which listed 269 wild flowers, grasses and ferns. He was the first to discover American Willow‚Äìherb (Epilobium ciliatum) in 1945 which is now abundant in England. He also named a new hybrid Senecio discovered by N. Y. Sandwith which he named London Ragwort (Senecio x londinensis). With further work on plants introduced by the woollen industry in shoddy he became an authority on introductions. In 1950 he was author of Wild Flowers of Chalk and Limestone (No. 103 in the New Naturalist series) and in the same year he became the secretary of the BSBI, on the death of A. J. Wilmott. He was the honorary curator of the South London Botanical Institute (1955‚Äì68) and in 1963 he was the first recipient of the H. H. Bloomer Award of the Linnean Society of London. On retirement in 1967, at the age of 60, he was a Departmental Manager with Barclays Bank. He died in 1976 at Streatham Common and his herbarium was donated to the University of Reading, and some of his notebooks, photos, papers, letters and the manuscript of the flora of Scilly are held in the archives of the Isles of Scilly Museum.

In a racing career which lasted from August 2000 to June 2001 the filly ran ten times and won four races. As a two-year-old, Imagine ran six times, winning the Group Three C. L. Weld Park Stakes at the Curragh and finishing second in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket. The following spring, the filly was beaten in her first two races before winning the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Imagine recorded her most valuable success on her final appearance, winning the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. She never raced again, but proved to be a successful broodmare. Background Imagine is a dark-coated bay mare sired by the thirteen time Champion sire Sadler's Wells. She was the last foal of her dam, the American bred mare Doff the Derby, who had become famous a decade earlier as the dam of The Derby winner Generous. Doff the Derby was a half-sister of the leading racemare Trillion, who in turn produced the multiple Group One winner Triptych. Imagine was bred by a partnership between Barronstown Stud, who owned Doff the Derby, and Orpendale, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore organisation. Like many Coolmore horses, Imagine was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. The filly usually raced in the colours of Susan Magnier, the wife of John Magnier although she was partly owned by Diane Nagle one of the owners of Barronstown. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Imagine initially bypassed maiden races, making her first appearance in the Listed Debutante Stakes at the Curragh in August 2000 and finishing third behind the more experienced fillies Affianced and Sequoyah. She was then moved up to Group One level for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over the same course two weeks later. Ridden by the British veteran George Duffield, she finished sixth of the ten runners behind Sequoyah. Eleven days later Imagine was dropped in class for maiden race at Gowran Park and recorded her first win, ridden for the first time by Mick Kinane. Nine days late, Imagine was sent to England to contest the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot. She led for most of the way, but weakened in the closing stages and finished fourth to Crystal Music. On 30 September, Imagine, running for the fifth time in forty-one days contested the Group Three C. L. Weld Park Stakes at the Curragh. Starting the 5/2 favourite against eleven other fillies, she led from the start and held the late challenge of Katherine Seymour to win by half a length. Imagine's final appearance of 2000 came in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket in October. In a close and rough finish, Imagine overcame interference to finish third, beaten a short head and half a length by Sayedah and Katherine Seymour, but was promoted to second place when the runner-up was disqualified after a steward's inquiry. =2001: three-year-old season= Imagine reappeared as a three-year-old in the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes in April. She started the 9/10 favourite but was beaten five and a half lengths by the easy winner Rebelline. On 7 May, Imagine was made favourite for the Listed Athasi Stakes but finished third behind Cool Clarity and Rose Gypsy. The field for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh included Rebelline, Cool Clarity, Sequoyah, Katherine Seymour and Crystal Music, who started favourite, while Imagine was not fancied and started a 16/1 outsider. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, Imagine was restrained in the early stages before moving up to fourth place a quarter of a mile from the finish. Imagine took the lead just inside the final furlong and ran on strongly to win by two lengths from Crystal Music. Imagine's win, which came one day after O'Brien had trained the first three horses in the Irish 2000 Guineas, enabled Sadler's Wells to equal the record of 45 individual Group One/Grade I set by Sir Tristram. Twelve days after her win in the Irish classic, Imagine started 3/1 favourite against thirteen opponents in the Epsom Oaks. O'Brien had not been able to run his horses in Britain earlier in the season because of restrictions on the movement of livestock imposed as a result of the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and- mouth outbreak. Ridden by Kinane, Imagine was restrained at the back of the field in the early stages and seemed to be struggling just after halfway as she seemed unable to handle the downhill section of the course. She turned into the straight in eighth place but then made steady progress down the centre of the course to challenge the leader Relish the Thought inside the last quarter mile. Imagine overtook Relish the Thought 150 yards from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths with the fast-finishing second favourite Flight of Fancy (owned by the Queen) taking second place in the last strides. The first three were all daughters of Sadler's Wells. After the race O'Brien said that Imagine was \\"an amazing filly to win like that when it was ground she didn't like.\\" Shortly after the Oaks, Imagine sustained an injury (described by O'Brien as a \\"stone bruise\\") which interrupted her training. During her break she gained a great deal of weight and it proved impossible to bring her back to peak fitness for a run in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In September it was announced that she would be retired from racing. Assessment and honours In the 2001 International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings), Imagine was given a rating of 117, making her the equal tenth best three-year-old filly in the world (and the third best in Europe), six pounds below the top-rated Banks Hill. The independent Timeform organisation gave Imagine a rating of 119.http://www.thoroughbredinternet.com/newsmore.html?Id=1262 Stud record Imagine was retired to become a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud, and proved highly successful. Her first foal was Horatio Nelson, by Danehill who won the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re and was fatally injured when second favourite for the 2006 Epsom Derby. She went on to produce the Group Two winners Viscount Nelson and Kitty Matcham as well as Red Rock Canyon, who won only one minor race but acted as pacemaker for the Ballydoyle champions Dylan Thomas and Duke of Marmalade. *2003 Horatio Nelson (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 30 April, by Danehill (USA) ‚Äì won 4 races including G1 Grand Crit√©rium Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re, Longchamp; G2 Futurity Stakes, Curragh; G3 Superlative Stakes, Newmarket; 2nd G1 Dewhurst Stakes, Newmarket from 7 starts in Ireland and England 2005-6 *2004 Red Rock Canyon (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 8 May, by Rock of Gibraltar (IRE) ‚Äì winner and 2nd G3 Meld Stakes, Leopardstown; 3rd G1 Irish Champion Stakes, Leopardstown; G1 Tattersalls Gold Cup, Curragh; 3rd G2 Royal Whip Stakes, Curragh; 3rd G3 International Stakes, Curragh; 4th G1 King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Ascot in Ireland, England, U.S.A. and Dubai 2006‚Äì10 *2005 Kitty Matcham (IRE) : Bay filly, foaled 21 May, by Rock of Gibraltar (IRE) ‚Äì won 2 races including G2 Rockfel Stakes, Newmarket from 10 starts in Ireland and England 2007-8 *2007 Viscount Nelson (USA) : Bay colt, foaled 6 February, by Giant's Causeway (USA) ‚Äì won 4 races including G2 Al Fahidi Fort, Meydan; LR Hurricane Run Stakes, Tipperary; LR Silver Stakes, Curragh; 2nd G2 Champagne Stakes, Doncaster; 2nd G2 Godolphin Mile, Meydan; 3rd G1 Irish 2000 Guineas, Curragh; 3rd G1 Eclipse Stakes, Sandown from 20 starts in Ireland, England, France, U.S.A. and Dubai 2009‚Äì12 *2008 Guessing (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 27 February, by Kingmambo (USA) ‚Äì unplaced in Ireland and New Zealand 2011‚Äì12 *2010 Point Piper (USA) : Bay colt, foaled 16 March, by Giant's Causeway (USA) ‚Äì won and placed twice from 5 starts in Ireland 2012‚Äì13; won 2 races including G3 Longacres Mile H, Emerald Downs and placed 6 times including 3rd G2 Oaklawn H, Oaklawn Park; G3 Mineshaft H, Fairgrounds from 12 starts to date (4/11/16) in the U.S.A. 2015‚Äì16. *2011 Adeste Fideles (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 14 March, by Giant's Causeway (USA) ‚Äì won one race and placed three times from seven starts in Ireland 2013‚Äì14 *2013 General Macarthur (USA) : Bay colt, foaled 19 March, by War Front (USA) ‚Äì won twice and placed 2nd once and 4th twice, including G3 Meld S, Leopardstown from 11 starts to date (4/11/16) in Ireland 2015‚Äì16 Pedigree References Category:1998 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Irish Classic Race winners Category:Thoroughbred family 4-n Category:Epsom Oaks winners ","title":"Imagine (horse)"},{"id":"36747956","text":"The National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program (NAHDAP) is a repository of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS research data primarily including social science and behavioral data.Addiction, 106, 1708-1710 NAHDAP‚Äôs mission is to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction by supporting research across a wide range of disciplines and ensuring the rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of that research to improve prevention, treatment and policy.

Presumably the declaration was orchestrated by President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna in agreement with the high clergy. After the triumph of the Plan of Cuernavaca, all laws enacted by the progressives during ten months in office were repealed, the Pontifical and National University of Mexico was reopened, Congress was dissolved and the officials who implemented the reform measures were dismissed. Santa Anna's first dictatorship began. A year later, the conservative faction of the Congress approved the basis for the new constitution that gave rise to the centralist regime in Mexico. Background In March 1833, Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna was elected as President and Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as as Vice-President of Mexico. They alternated leadership of the executive branch due to the frequent absences of Santa Anna, sometimeS so that he could personally suppress uprisings, and other times to \\"restore his failing health.\\" While Vice President G√≥mez Far√≠as was at the head of government, he implemented reform measures affecting the interests of both the army and the Catholic Church. Both institutions held special privileges (fueros). A law was proposed to expand the militias controlled by the States, which would relieve the federal budget which funded the army. This law, and a discussion about disposal of church property by the States, led to the rebellions of Escalda and Dur√°n in support of \\"Religion and privileges.\\" Santa Anna asked Congress for permission to take command of the army and combat the rebels. In response to these rebellions, in June 1833 Congress passed the famous Ley del Caso (Case Law) that ordered opponents of the reformist regime into exile. In November 1833, Congress issued a decree that ordered dissolution of army corps that had rebelled against federal institutions. In ecclesiastical matters, mandatory tithing was removed, the hospitals and farms of the Philippines missionaries were placed in charge of the Federation, and the College of Santa Mar√≠a de Todos Santos and the Pontifical and National University of Mexico were closed. In its place, the Department of Public Instruction for the Federal District and Territories was created. Congress ordered creation of primary schools, schools for secular education of primary school teachers, and schools for women and girls, all of which were aimed at broadening access to education beyond elite men. The property of the California missions was secularized. On 17 December 1833, Congress issued a decree that authorized the government to fill parish vacancies. This was exercised in some States in the same way that the viceroys had used the power of royal patronage, an assertion of state power not recognized by the papacy since Mexican independence. Bishops and governors of bishoprics who did not comply with this decree would be fined on the first two occasions, and banished from the country after a third offense. In Jalisco and Tamaulipas, government funding of religion was declared. In Durango and the State of Mexico the governors exercised their patronage over ecclesiastical posts. In Michoac√°n the local legislature regulated observance of the canons and discipline of the clergy. Religious tolerance was declared in Yucat√°n. On 13 March 1834 there was an earthquake, with aftershocks on 15 and 21 March, and on 24 March there was a severe thunderstorm with hail and water saturated with sulfur. These events were interpreted as \\"divine signs\\" by some priests, who urged the population to oppose the new reform laws. Resistance by clergy, supported by Santa Anna In November 1833, Santa Anna asked Congress for permission to be absent for six months to replenish his \\"failing health\\" at the hacienda of Manga Clavo. At this place he received and heard complaints from the opponents of Vice President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as's reform regime, including a letter from the Bishop of Puebla, Francisco Pablo V√°zquez, who called the law of 17 December \\"a sacrilegious statement against the divine authority of the Pope.\\" Meanwhile, the Bishop of Monterrey, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Belaunzar√°n y Ure√±a, announced he was willing to pay the fines and suffer exile before enforcing the new law. The Bishop of Chiapas, Luis Garc√≠a Guill√©n, Governor of the Guadalajara bishopric, Diego de Aranda y Carpinteiro, governor of Oaxaca bishopric, Florencio del Castillo, and the Bishop of Michoac√°n, Juan Cayetano G√≥mez de Portugal y Sol√≠s refused to obey the law of December 17. In contrast, the governor of Sonora bishopric, Orrantia Francisco, and the governor of Yucat√°n bishopric, Jose Maria Meneses, were willing to obey the reform laws. Later the first was disowned and deposed, while the second asked to exculpate himself before the council. Santa Anna took the side that defended the interests of the Church. On 12 March 1834 he sent a long letter to G√≥mez Far√≠as expressing dissatisfaction with the directives and agreements that the government had made. On 20 April, the town of Orizaba opposed the decree of the local Legislature that ordered the convents of San Jos√© de Gracia and del Carmen to be closed. The rebellion of the people took some lives, but failed to prevent enforcement of the law. Two days later, Congress enacted a 30-day extension before the law of 17 December would be rigidly enforced, after which bishops, councils or governors of bishoprics who did not comply would lose their posts and would be expelled from the country. On 24 April, before the expiration of his six-months leave, Santa Anna returned to Mexico City. Five days later he published a manifesto in which he informed the public of the bitter division between reformists and conservatives, and declared himself impartial and ready to enforce the Constitution to preserve the rights of citizens. In the first days of May, he issued a decree for the people of Veracruz to return to order, restoring local authorities. He order the disarmament of the civic militia in face of protests by their commander, Lucas Balderas, and suggested to Congress that they should abolish the Ley del Caso. Dismayed, the members of the Chamber sent a delegation to ask the President whether or not they had the freedom to legislate. Santa Anna replied, \\"they have, but to do what is right and no more, because I make the Constitution with one hand and in the other hold the sword to ensure it is observed. I had the resolution to attack tyranny, and I will have the resolution to fight demagogy.\\" Given this response, on 15 May Congress decided to suspend its activities since it lacked freedom, \\"reserving the right to continue at such the time as it saw fit.\\" Congress based its decision on Article 69 of the Rules of Procedure, and prorogued its session. However, Santa Anna decided to summon the Congress for 21 May, show he was not adverse to the legislature power. Proclamation of the plan of Cuernavaca On 16 May 1834, in Xalapa and Coatepec, Santa Anna was proclaimed \\"protector of the Catholic religion.\\" On 23 May, in Oaxaca, he was proclaimed \\"sustainer of religion and freedom of the country\\". Finally, on 25 May in the town of Cuernavaca, Ignacio Echeverria and Jos√© Mariano Campos proclaimed the Plan of Cuernavaca, containing five articles that demanded: # Repeal the Ley del Caso and do not tolerate the influence of Masonic lodges. # Declare void the laws passed by Congress and the local legislatures. # Request the protection of President Santa Anna to fulfill the plan, and recognize it as the only authority. # Remove from office the deputies and officials who carried out enforcement of the reform laws and decrees. # Provide military force to support the president in implementing the plan. The plan and its declaration had been orchestrated by Jos√© Mar√≠a Tornel, governor of the Federal District. On the day that the plan was announced, Tornel issued a decree subjecting the press to censorship and making it a crime to publish posters that offended the regime. Tornel ensured that news of support for the plan by other garrisons was given full publicity. The plan was followed a week later by the \\"Plan of Toluca\\", issued by the garrison of the State of Mexico, which threw out the governor and the federalist state legislature. Between 25 May and 11 June the following towns issued declarations in support of the Plan of Cuernavaca and of safeguarding the Catholic religion: Tlaxcala; Huitzuco; Chignahuapan; Mazatepec, Morelos; Iguala; Chiautempan, Tlaxcala; Zacapoaxtla; Huejotzingo; Tepecoacuilco de Trujano; Ixtlahuaca de Ray√≥n; Santa Mar√≠a Nativitas; Tlacotepec; San Agust√≠n del Palmar; Tenancingo, Mexico State; Toluca; Tecualoya; San Salvador el Verde; San Mart√≠n Texmelucan; Misantla, Veracruz; Tehuac√°n, Puebla; San Luis Huexotla; Malinalco, State of Mexico; San Andr√©s Tuxtla; Teotitlan del Valle, Oax.; Teziutl√°n; Joquicingo; Colima; San Juan Teotihuac√°n; San Pablo del Monte; Aquixtla; Otumba de G√≥mez Far√≠as; Apan; Coronango; Totolapan; San Mart√≠n Xaltocan; Todos Santos Zempoala, Tulancingo; Chalco; Santa Mar√≠a Ozumba; Santiago Tetla; San Nicol√°s Panotla ; Jiutepec; San Ildefonso Hueyotlipan; Cuautitl√°n; Azcapotzalco; Santa In√©s Zacatelco; Maravat√≠o; Iguala; Tepotzotl√°n; Santa Ana Monte Alto; Tula; Tlalmanalco; Tlayacapan; San Andr√©s Chalchicomula; Tepeaca; Santa Mar√≠a Tultepec; San Salvador Atenco; Tenango Tepopola; Contepec; Xochitepec; Singuilucan; Tianguismanalco; Ixtapaluca; Amecameca; Cadereyta; Ixmiquilpan; San Juan del R√≠o; Tecali; Coyoac√°n; Zimap√°n; Atlixco; Santo Domingo Mixcoac, Actopan, Mineral de Cardonal; Acatzingo; Atotonilco el Grande, San √Ångel, D.F., Tacubaya; San Pedro Tolim√°n, Tlaxcoapan, Santiago de Quer√©taro; Santiago Tulyehualco; Tacuba; San Agust√≠n Tlaxco; Pachuca; Celaya; Irapuato, Guanajuato; Huascazaloya, and the parish of Santa Catarina M√°rtir in Mexico City. The pronouncements were not uniform. Sometimes they specifically said they only wanted to throw out the religious reforms, but wanted to retain the federal form of government. However, the wave of supporting proclamations gave Santa Anna the justification he needed to close Congress and repeal the unpopular legislation. The lack of support for the Congress indicated that the general population, with its traditional support for religion, considered that Congress no longer represented their views and resented its exercise of power. When members of the Chamber wanted to meet, they found that the room keys had been collected and that the doors were guarded by an armed force. In response to the demands of the legislators, Santa Anna replied that the meetings could not continue beyond the period specified by the Constitution. On 1 June he defined his position in another public manifesto, which expressed willingness to defend the people's wishes to maintain the Catholic religion unharmed, saying he had \\"begged\\" to the Chambers to repeal the laws to stop the upheavals and religious fears. Nine days after the Plan of Cuernavaca had been published, the Church agreed to pay Santa Anna from 30,000 to 40,000 pesos monthly as long as church privileges were maintained. On 12 June, Santa Anna threw off his mask, dissolved the council and announced his decision to adopt the Plan of Cuernavaca. The church bells pealed and signs were posted reading \\"Long Live Religion and the illustrious Santa Anna.\\" On 14 June, the new council of the capital supported the president's decision. The same day, Bishop Juan Cayetano Gomez de Portugal led Mass at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City and sang the Te Deum. The people hailed the president's decision. Reactions and consequences Several municipalities in the country continued to adhere to the plan and support the decision of Santa Anna. On 24 June in Mexico City, Santa Anna abolished the law of Ecclesiastical Trusts issued on 17 December 1833 and ratified on 24 April 1834. At the same time he appointed Juan Cayetano G√≥mez de Portugal y Sol√≠s as Secretary of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs in place of Andr√©s Quintana Roo. On 9 July he issued a call for election of new Members of Congress. On 26 July he approved the appointment of the bishop of Yucat√°n, Jos√© Mar√≠a Guerra y Rodr√≠guez Correa. Two days later he suspended the arrest warrant issued against Lucas Alam√°n and the process that was being followed against Anastasio Bustamante for the murder of Vicente Guerrero. On 30 July, repealed the Ley del Caso. On 1 August he ordered restoration of the Papal and National University of Mexico. On 8 August, he ordered the reinstatement of the judges of the Supreme Court who had been dismissed in March. A month later, on 8 September 1834, Valentin Gomez Farias went into exile in Mexico en route to New Orleans. Events in the city of Puebla followed a different course. Before the proclamation of the Plan of Cuernavaca, the civic militia had proclaimed a local plan to support the Catholic religion and had urged the local legislature to declare the same. Although some deputies joined with the militia's wishes, President Pedro Pablo Carrillo was not in the room, so a picket of militia forced him to attend the sessions. The Congress of Puebla refused to deliberate until the militia had been withdrawn. The deputies decided not to accept the plan announced by the militia and decided to keep the reform institutions \\"even at the cost of a bloody war.\\" Meanwhile, Santa Anna tried to overthrow the state government. The governor, Cosme Furlong, had only three thousand men, who were besieged by federal troops of General Luis Quintanar with seven thousand troops and thirty guns. On 13 and 29 June the besiegers made assaults that were repelled, but on 5 July 5 they managed to occupy the Inns of Cristo and the Roncal. On 16 July, the besiegers opened negotiations with representatives of the governor, Agust√≠n M. Callejo, Juan Jos√© S√°nchez and the priest Apolinario Zacar√≠as. After long discussions with General Luis de Quintanar, they left for the capital for talks with the president. On 26 July there was a peace agreement, in which Santa Anna promised to preserve the federal system and designate Guadalupe Victoria as commanding general. Although the militants felt betrayed, the city was surrendered on 1 August. Cosme Furlong handed over the state government to General Victoria. With rumors of the establishment of a centralized system, the governments of Zacatecas, Coahuila and Texas strengthened their militias. Aguascalientes was separated from Zacatecas in May 1835. The rumors were confirmed when Congress declared that the centralized system was constitutional and implemented it on 23 October 1835. This policy led to the Independence of Texas and, years later, the separation of Yucat√°n.

The present house was designed by Frederick Pepys Cockerell and constructed between 1870 and 1874. It is built in an Elizabethan style of grey stone overlooking Lough Fadda and is surrounded by gardens with yew trees, a gravel terrace and a rhododendron walk. Woodland trails lead round the lake. The entire estate now comprises some s and is a working farm. In recent times the coach house has been made available for private functions and the outbuildings converted to holiday apartments. An 8 km mountain bike trail has been newly laid out. History The Blessingbourne estate came to the Montgomery family by marriage to the Armar family in the early 18th century. However the first Montgomery to actually live on the estate was Hugh Montgomery, known as \\"Colonel Eclipse\\", who was born in 1779. He vowed he would never marry and built himself a romantic thatched cottage on the estate as a bachelor retreat. He did give way however and had a son, Hugh Ralph Severin Montgomery, who built a Tudor style gate lodge c.1845 when he succeeded to the property in 1838. The larger present house was built by the latter's only son, Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery, who employed Frederick Pepys Cockerell as his architect. Building stated soon after his marriage in 1870 and finished in 1874. At that time the estate covered some and straddled the border between Tyrone and Fermanagh. It descended in the family to Peter Montgomery, Vice- Lord Lieutenant of Tyrone, who died childless, after which it passed to a cousin. The property was ultimately inherited by Captain Robert Lowry, a direct descendant of Colonel Eclipse, and now belongs to Colleen and Nicholas Lowry.

Fegan (London: Deverell, Gibson & Hoare, n.d.), 15. Both parents were devout Non-Conformists and made the acquaintance of John Nelson Darby, the founder of the Plymouth Brethren.Fegan biography at GospelHall.org. In 1865, the family moved to London, and James entered the City of London School, where Edwin Abbott Abbott, the young headmaster, later provided Fegan with a \\"glowing testimonial.\\"Tifflin, 15. In 1869, he entered the office of colonial brokers in Mincing Lane, London; but the following year, he was suddenly converted while sitting alone reading a Greek play.Tifflin, 15. He began distributing Christian tracts, teaching in the evenings at a Ragged School, and preaching at open-air meetings. The strain of working in the brokerage by day and the school by night weakened his health, and he took a vacation to Bognor Regis, where a vagrant boy caught his attention and led him toward his life's work.Tifflin, 16-17; Fullerton, Fegan, 18-25. On May 1, 1872, with the help of friends, Fegan opened his first boys' home at 112/114 High Street, Deptford, southeast London, and soon gained the title \\"Fegan of Deptford\\" for his work with youth in this notorious area.Kohli, 164. The number of boys soon outgrew that house and then the one next door, and he established The Little Wanderer's Home at Greenwich in 1879, with a country branch in 1881 for boys in poor health.Tifflin, 17. Fegan soon became a friendly rival of the philanthropist Thomas John Barnardo, who established similar institutions in east London. Fegan was so endowed with \\"prodigious energy\\" that he was able to enlist even those in his office to help in his after-hours search for \\"street Arabs.\\"Fullerton, 45-46. In 1882, after abandoning his business career, Fegan moved his base of activities to Southwark Street and the following year also established an orphanage at Ramsgate.Tifflin, 18-19. In 1889, Fegan married Mary Pope, who quickly became her husband's associate, caring for him \\"with assiduous forethought and sympathy, and in many a tight corner advising him in the work.\\"Fullerton, 60. Fegan had been living with his widowed mother, and his marriage seems to have been announced \\"almost without warning.\\" During this period, emigration to other parts of the British Empire was being encouraged, and in 1884, Fegan took ten boys‚Äîand then fifty more‚Äîto Canada in 1884. A \\"distributing home\\" was given to him in Toronto, and from there annual parties of boys were sent to farms in various parts of the country.Tifflin, 19. The boys were encouraged to repay the cost of their passage and outfits to make the same opportunity available for others, and many of them did so. By 1907, Canadian emigrants had sent more than $11,000 back to England, and their names were inscribed on copper plates at the English orphanages.Kohli, 167. After the expiration of the lease on the Greenwich property in 1900, Fegan decided to move the orphanage to the country and in a spirit of \\"divine recklessness\\" offered ¬£4,500 for a building at Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire worth ten times that amount. The mortgage holder readily agreed to sell if payment were made within two weeks, and Fegan duly raised the sum after meeting with his friends for nightly prayer.Kohli, 164; Fullerton, 74-76. ‚Ç§4500 was worth at least ¬£300,000 at the turn of the 21st century. In 1913 Fegan vacated the Southwark Street property and opened another building at 62-64 Horseferry Road, which he called \\"The Red Lamp\\" because of the light left on at night to signal assistance given to anyone who needed shelter whatever the hour.Tiffin, 21; RCVS Charitable Trust Library website. To prepare boys for emigration to Canada, Fegan also established at Goudhurst in Kent a farm using Canadian farming methods and implements. By the 1920s the farm included a home for Fegan and his wife, which they called Blantyre Lodge after one of their earliest supporters Lord Blantyre.Tiffin, 21-22. The farm and the boys accommodation is now HMP Blantyre. Fegan died at the Goudhurst farm on December 9, 1925. His wife continued his work until she was killed in an air raid that struck the farm in October 1945.Kohli, 168. Acquaintance with Charles Darwin In 1880, Fegan's parents moved to Downe, a village about fourteen miles from central London, and Fegan spent a great deal of time there with his widowed mother during the summers of 1881-83. Charles Darwin lived nearby, and once when Fegan took his boys camping in the neighborhood, they sang hymns in front of his residence, Down House. Darwin expressed sympathy for Fegan's philanthropic work and (to ringing cheers) gave each of the boys sixpence.Fullerton, 29-30. Fegan also held regular tent services in the area, and when he needed a more permanent base of operations, he asked Darwin for the use of a slightly frequented temperance reading room Darwin had established for the villagers. Darwin lent it with pleasure, complimenting Fegan that he had \\"done more for the village in a few months than all our efforts for many years. We have never been able to reclaim a drunkard, but through your services I do not know that there is a drunkard left in the village.\\"Fullerton, 31; James Moore, The Darwin Legend (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1994), 86-88. Late in Fegan's life, after Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope had publicized a story about how Darwin had recanted his belief in evolution, Fegan was asked to pronounce on the story's truthfulness, presumably because in the 1880s Hope had worked with him in Downe.Moore, 153-54. In 1925 Fegan wrote that he \\"had been appealed to over and over again as to the probability of this story, and have had no hesitation in pronouncing it to be fabrication on the part of poor Lady Hope.\\" Darwin, said Fegan, \\"was an honorable, courteous, benevolent gentleman; but you may be sure that Sir Francis Darwin is right in saying that his father died as he had lived‚Äîan agnostic.\\"Fegan to S. J. Pratt, May 22, 1925, in Moore, 161. Personality Even a private secretary who greatly admired Fegan called him \\"autocratic, dictatorial and impatient, for he was a perfectionist and did not suffer fools gladly.\\" Nevertheless, the secretary also credited his employer with considerable human sympathy and a fine sense of humor.Tiffin, 25.

Wei sees Huang as \\"an important voice in Taiwanese women's cinema. The fact that her film Twin Bracelets received relatively much attention \\"enabled Huang to have in-depth discussions with American independent filmmakers and feminist directors. From then on she began to push consciously forward [with] films about women.\\"S. Louisa Wei, ibidem. Plot Twin Bracelets takes place in Hui An, a remote coastal village of Fujian (a southern province of the People's Republic of China).John Charles, ibidem. The film is a stark denunciation of the culturally specific ‚Äòmachismo‚Äô of Chinese men, as observed in a traditional coastal village. Juxtaposed to it, we find poetic scenes that portray female tenderness, as found in girls and young women who have not yet succumbed to the so-called realities of life. The two female protagonists, Hsiu and Hui-hua, have not yet surrendered their dreams when we observe them in the initial sequences of the film. But it is clear that they cannot escape the pressures of village society. Whatever their subjective longings, how can they turn a blind eyes to the expectations of their next of kin that are anchored in tradition? We see that these expectations are in turn influenced by social customs and by fear of gossip among neighbors. But also by the spontaneous comprehension that social roles have to be accepted if families want to make ends meet and if the local economy of a fishing village is to function ‚Äòas it always did.‚Äô When Hui-hua succumbs to the expectations of her family that, at her age, she should marry and obey her husband, Xiu commits suicide. The one surrenders to the ‚Äòforce of circumstances‚Äô ‚Äì the others finds only a self-destructive way out. Yet this act expresses her rebellion, her protest and revolt, and it lays bare the source of the female alliance of hope and the alternative vision it embodied. Instead of wife-beating, it was caresses that these young human beings longed for when they made their initial vow to each other that they would never marry. They had sensed the injustice enshrined in the old game of master and slave, they did not want words and deeds that boss and command and leave no alternative. They desired human respect, equality, careful awareness of each other's needs. And for a short time, enabled by their affection for each other, they lived like that, turning to each other, experiencing the secluded, intimate freedom of a human relationship that was genuine and reciprocal in their acceptance of each other's dignity. It was like this that exploitation could give way to cooperation, rule to freedom. It embodies, as a relationship of merely two human beings, an entire vision of how humans could live together. When the film turns to the intimate scenes that show the closeness of these young women who comprehend their relationship in a traditional way, by seeing themselves as ‚Äòsister-spouses,‚Äô we begin to understand their affection for each other as the support that is necessary to resist the wrong, antiquated, patriarchal social relations that dominate village society. It is the affectionate bond between them that gives them strength to resist.When Hui-hua is finally required to accept submission to a husband, \\"the only way out for her is to run home to mother, who promptly condemns her action. The only person Hui-ha can call on for a spiritual boost and moral strength is her sister-spouse, Hsiu.\\" (U.S.-China Review, Vol, 17, No. 3, 1993, p.22). The formal language of the film Twin Bracelets, which was the second feature done by Huang Yu- shan, is a solidly realized, thoughtful film. In terms of its filmic form, it is conventional cinema. It is narrative cinema, telling a story chronologically, without any flash backs. Its attraction and significance clearly is due to its subject matter. How this subject matter is treated has made it an interesting and, in the eyes of some viewers, a controversial film. As narrative cinema, Twin Bracelets departs, however, from the Western norm. It is Chinese. This is especially apparent in that the actresses occasionally rely to some extent on Chinese conventions of acting which a Western audience is hardly acquainted with. This has occasionally caused irritation. It is hard to tell who or what is to blame in this case. Is it Western rejection of other canons and conventions than their own? Is it the fact that the filmmaker chose to work with what the product information of the company describes as a \\"cast and crew of newcomers\\"?Product Information http://www.yesasia.com/us/the-twin- bracelets/1004000183-0-0-0-en/info.html ). Or the Chinese director's halfhearted reliance, at least in some scenes, on the conventions of the Chinese Opera which have seeped into film-making and, more crudely, into soap operas? It is clear that these are acting conventions that Taiwanese, Hong Kong and mainland audience are familiar with, on account of innumerable films and soap operas that fulfill purposes of entertainment, distraction, and ideological indoctrination. They are stylized movements and gestures that long established convention invests with fixed meanings. And they reappear even in everyday situations (thus, outside television, drama, and film) as stereotyped behavior. Girls for instance have their peculiar movements that symbolize a need to express embarrassment or slight shame. They may rely on them when conventional morality (or their superego, the Freudian ‚Äòueber-ich‚Äô) requires it. The gestures thus relied on are translatable by Xi≈´ xi≈´ ÁæûÁæû (‚ÄòI‚Äôm ashamed‚Äô). Such ways of acting are to some extent watered-down adaptations of an entire repertoire of very formal, stylistically refined conventions of the Peking Opera, or of coarser, but also heartier varieties that exist in the form of local opera genres. The latter tend to be more down-to-earth and they are meant to address the sociocultural needs and appetites of the common people. (They are typically performed in the evening on makeshift stages in public squares or at street corners, the stage being protected by canvas against the rain.) It is clear that ‚Äòmodernist‚Äô Western art theory rejects these conventions, especially in their trivialized form. Viktor Shklovsky would have referred to them as \\"automatic\\" or \\"automatized.\\" It is also not really surprising if this acting appears as overdone to Western viewers accustomed to the naturalism of Elia Kazan, John Ford, or John Huston. On the other hand, Western audiences accept the routine acting that is typical of a certain, glossy variety of 'naturalism' that nowadays seems to define the norm of professional acting in Hollywood. There is nothing to be said against stylized acting. The anti-naturalist theater author and stage director Bert Brecht, who thought highly of Mei Lanfang, relied on it in his epic theatre. So did Brechtian film directors, most notably Daniele Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub (see Straub-Huillet ). What can be said against occasional reliance of Chinese conventions of acting in Huang Yu-shan‚Äòs feature film is that this acting is not stylized enough and that it is integrated in what remains basically a naturalist film. Does it jar? Is the occasional use of conventional, stylized acting hardly noticed by Chinese audiences because it is considered as ‚Äònormal‚Äô and as a ‚Äònaturalist‚Äô representation of how young Chinese women may ‚Äòact‚Äô? This remains open to debate. Critical reception =Viewing Twin Bracelets as a lesbian film= Discussing Twin Bracelets, a number of critics make lesbianism its main cause. Teri Silvio noted that Twin Bracelets \\"was seen as a ‚ÄòLesbian film‚Äô in the United States and by some people in Taiwan.\\"Teri Silvio, \\"Lesbianism and Taiwanese Localism in The Silent Thrush,\\" in: Fran Martin / Peter A. Jackson / Mark McLelland / Audrey Yue (eds.), Asia-Pacific Queer: Rethinking Genders and Sexualities. Urbana.IL (University of Illinois Press) 2008, p.232. The filmmaker, collaborating with Wang Chun-chi, explained it was due to \\"the way the film treats same-sex romantic love and friendship among women\\" that it was \\"taken as a Lesbian story\\" in the West.Huang Yu-shan and Wang Chun-chi, \\"Post-Taiwan New Cinema Women Directors and Their Films: Auteurs, Images, Language,\\" in: Lin-zhen Wang (ed.), Chinese Women‚Äôs Cinema. Transnational Contexts. New York (Columbia University Press) 2011, p.141. And Vivian Price said that \\"the film‚Äôs representation of women rejecting oppression resembles the lesbian utopia envisioned in the West.\\"Vivian Price, quoted by Huang Yu-shan and Wang Chun- chi, \\"Post-Taiwan New Cinema Women Directors and Their Films: Auteurs, Images, Language,\\" in: Lin-zhen Wang (ed.), ibidem, p.142. Marie K. Morohoshi states in an interview that Twin Bracelets, just like another movie she mentions (The East is Red), has \\"the great gender bender thing going on throughout the film‚Ä¶or a subtext.\\" In her view, the film \\"is so ‚Äòclearly‚Äô lesbian that it can‚Äôt be anything but lesbian.\\"Ju Hui Judy Han (interviewer) with Marie K. Morohoshi, \\"Creating; Curating and Consuming Queer Asian American Cinema: An Interview with Marie K. Morohoshi,\\" in: David L. Eng / Alice Y. Horn (eds.), Queer in Asian America. Philadelphia (Temple University Press) 1998, p.88. According to Vivian Ng, who resents the fact that \\"one of the women commit(s) suicide at the end of the story,\\" the film does not present a positive image of lesbians.Vivian Ng, \\"China,\\" in:Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures. New York (Garland Publishing Inc.) 2000, p.164. The same view is held by the filmmaker Paul Lee.Cf. the interview with Paul Lee, in: Gina Marchetti (ed.), From Tian'anmen to Times Square: Transnational China and the Chinese Diaspora on Global Screens, 1989-1997. Philadelphia PA (Temple Univ. Press) 2006, p.66. Other critics in the West have also focused on sexuality as a presumed key subject matter of the film. Referring specifically to Huang Yu- shan's Twin Bracelets, the French film critic B√©r√©nice Reynaud assumes that her treatment of sexual desire is explained or at least partly influenced by the fact that she is one of those Taiwanese filmmakers who \\"spent some time abroad.\\"B√©r√©nice Reynaud, \\"Cinema in Taiwan,\\" in: Edward Davis (ed.), Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture. New York and Abbington, UK (Routledge) 2005, p.149. ‚Äì The critic spells the name of the film director Huang Yu-chan instead of Huang Yu-shan. The tendency to overemphasis the sexual aspect of liberation was strong in the West because of a Puritan western heritage that has fanned guilt feelings for centuries. In the context of East Asian societies marked by Confucian patriarchal ideology, it is shame, rather than guilt, that is a typical psychological reaction when boundaries defined by traditional morality are crossed. Lisa Odham Stokes and Michael Hoover put more emphasis on \\"the oppression experienced by two women\\" and the fact that they were expected to submit to \\"arrange marriages.\\"Lisa Odham Stokes and Michael Hoover, City on Fire: Hong Kong Cinema. London (Verso) 1999, p.357. This confirms the feminist interpretation of the filmmaker. Calling Twin Bracelets a ‚Äúremarkable film,‚Äù one author saw the film as ‚Äúa deeply moving and tragic portray of one woman‚Äôs struggle for independence.‚Äù This acknowledged at least the feminist orientation of the film. But then the writer went on to say that it is also (or above all?) a struggle ‚Äúfor the love of another woman. Desperately in love with Hsiu, Hui-ha flirts shamelessly with her‚Äù and is ‚Äúintensely jealous of Hsiu‚Äôs arranged marriage.‚Äù Cf. Jenni Olson (ed.), The Ultimate Guide to Lesbian and Gay Film and Video. New York (Serpent‚Äôs Tail)1996. Such a view may be questioned by pointing out that Hsiu does not give her consent to be married willingly and happily but submits to severe pressure. There is little cause for jealousy. Hui-hua has also been exposed to pressure by kin-folks who know that according to the customs of village society she should already be married. Now that her intimate friend gets married, she feels that she is losing a comrade in arms. Hsiu was after all opposed to marriage like she, Hui-hua, still is - and for the same reasons. Both made the vow by which they promised each other that they would never succumb and be obedient wives. Hui-hua instinctively knows that no woman (or man) is an island, able to exist and strong enough to carry on a fight all by herself (or himself): few can continue to resist pressures alone. This aspect is not given sufficient attention by critics who interpret Hui-hua's desperation as an expression of jealousy or the effect of grief experienced by a deserted lover. Furthermore, different authors can obviously have different ideas of what ‚Äúflirting shamelessly‚Äù means. Even to a Western audience, it should be apparent that most of the time, Hui-hua's and Hsiu's intimacy was rather coy and girlish. Yes, physical tenderness mattered to them. But the emotional closeness and the recognition of the resistance both put up against the coarseness and roughly lived-out male dominance of potential marriage partners in the village mattered so much more. In line with the interpretation of the film as a lesbian film, certain Western authors see the ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù course of events as an ideological nexus between sinful desire, thus guilt, and necessary punishment. Thus, one author felt that ‚ÄúTwin Bracelets by Huang Yu-Shan [‚Ä¶] deals with the impossible price that must be paid as punishment for the transgression of conventional desires.‚ÄùFilmmaker (published by the Independent Feature Project), Vol. 1, 1992, p.39. Apparently ignorant of Chinese socioculture which is not characterized by a Christian defamation of sexuality or haunted by guilt feelings associated with sexual desire, many Western critics typically underestimated the extent to which conflict with traditional customs and disrespect for or rebellion against traditional authority (of governments, superiors, fathers, husbands) is sanctioned. To the extent that the suspicion of lesbian love would have been aroused in the village, it would have been the departure from convention, not desire as such that would have given rise to disapproval. But a refusal to fulfill conventional expectations to get married and accept the role of a dutiful, obedient wife is clearly something that evokes greater scorn than any revelation of desire. And it is such a departure from the norm that leads to corresponding moral sanctions. Feminists like Huang Yu-shan turn against this traditional world view and thus against an ideology that has always evoked the age-old teachings of Confucius while serving to maintain repressive social and political relations that are contemporary. =The ethnographic focus= According to Huang Yu-shan and Wang Chun-chi, ‚Äú(t)he subject matter of ‚Ä¶ Twin Bracelets is taken from the tradition of the ‚Äòzishu n√º‚Äô (‚Äòthe women who comb their hair‚Äô - a term for women who are self-sufficient) in Hui‚Äôan, Fujian and its environs...‚ÄùHuang Yu-shan and Wang Chun-chi, ‚ÄúPost-Taiwan New Cinema Women Directors and Their Films: Auteurs, Images, Language,‚Äù in: Lin-zhen Wang (ed.),ibidem, p.141. Lingzhen Wang writes that the film ‚Äúfocuses on Fujian local tradition of female sisterhood‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale bonding.‚ÄùLingzhen Wang, ‚ÄúChinese Women‚Äôs Cinema‚Äù, in: Yingjin Zhang (ed.), A Companion to Chinese Cinema, Chichester UK (Blackwell) 2012, p.342. This appears to put the accent on a special constellation, rooted in Huidong socioculture. In 1994, the ethnologist Sara Friedman went to Fujian to do field work in eastern Hui‚Äôan. Here she noted that married woman were reluctant to visit their husband's home. In 1995 she did further research in Hui‚Äôan, staying for ‚Äúeighteen month in the Huidong village of Shanlin.‚ÄùSara Friedman, ibidem, p.6. While in Shanlin, Friedman showed a particular interest in the kind of group suicide, committed by women, ‚Äúthat inspired ‚Ä¶ Lu Zhaohuan to pen the short story ‚ÄòShuang zhuo‚Äô (Twin Bracelets) about the relationship between two female(s) ... in a Huidong village.‚ÄùSara Friedman, ibidem, p.289. It is possible that Friedman‚Äôs research interest was fanned not only by the story but also by the more widely noted film Twin Bracelets which also culminates in a suicide, though not of two women, but of one woman. A significant detail which indicates a difference between Lu Zhaohuan‚Äôs story that was adapted by the film director and the film that was made. It was Fran Martin who first has pointed out the nexus between Lu Zhaohuan‚Äôs story ‚ÄòTwin Bracelets‚Äô and Huang Yu-shan's film. He also supplies a specific ‚Äòexplanation‚Äô of the opposition to marriage exhibited by the film's young female protagonists. According to him, it is the ‚Äústrict ethnic (marriage) custom‚Äù which ‚Äúdictates that husbands and wives must live separately.‚Äù Fran Martin thinks that ‚Äúthe film stages a critique of the harshness of the local marriage customs.‚Äù He thus chooses the ethnologically oriented approach. But he also deciphers a lesbian alternative that the young protagonists temporarily enact in his opinion. He writes that Huang Yu-shan is ‚Äúsetting these (sc. harsh marriage customs) against the loving bonds between two women‚Äù who ‚Äúvow to remain unmarried and live as ‚Äòsister-spouses‚Äô (jiemei fuqi)‚Äù but whose choice is finally ‚Äúdefeated by the pressures towards cross-sex marriage.‚ÄùFran Martin, ibidem, p.244-245. In view of this interpretation it is not surprising that some writers with ties to Taiwan chose to depict the entire constellation as either exceptional or as an expression of backwardness still found in the People's Republic of China. Thus, an author suggested in the U.S.-China Review that ‚Äú(v)iewers of The Twin Bracelets‚Äù may of course ‚Äúask, in the light of the film‚Äôs contemporary settings, whether these unusual social phenomenon still exist in China (‚Ä¶).‚ÄùU.S.-China Review, Vol. 17, No. 3, 1993, p.22. The implications of this reading are obvious: The film is either about the past or about a place that certainly is not identifiable as Taiwan. It serves a voyeur‚Äôs appetite for the exotic, the strange. This is a notion that the filmmaker sharply disagreed with, however. =Recognition of the feminist critique of social relations= Fran Martin is not blind to the feminist impulse that motivated the choice of Zhaohuan Lu‚Äôs short story. He notes that the girls object to \\"the violently patriarchal marriage custom.\\"Fran Martin, ibidem, p.245. Now it is indeed true that the film portrays coarse behavior and male violence that is informed by a patriarchal sense of being in charge, whereas a woman should know her place and must obey. But the marriage custom as such, stipulating separate households of husband and wife, gives women an unusual free space and a certain measure of independence. The specific marriage custom of the ethnic Huidong group living in Fujian (SW China) is certainly no longer matriarchal like that of the Mosuo based in Yunnan (also SW China). But it tends in that direction, a fact that must have aroused the filmmakers interest in the Huidong. Huang could have chosen Mosuo women as a positive example, if she had wanted to go to extremes in constructing a utopia (which does not exist ‚Äì not even in Mosuo society). Instead, she chose working people in a contemporary Chinese coastal village. A Huidong village, it is true. Still, the filmmaker does not idealize anything with regard to the Huidong of this village. Nor does she probe their custom deeply. Instead, she accentuates the harsh facts of everyday relations between man and woman that exist even here and that could have been observed in Taiwan villages or working-class neighborhoods, as well. She chose a situation that she could critique. In pre-war China, influenced by the 4 May movement, progressive writers with sympathies for the cause of women chose that strategy, too. Authors of that period wrote scathing depictions of newly-wed Chinese women subjected to the tyranny of mothers-in- law in their husband's household. To the husband and his parents, they often were not much more than a water buffalo that pulls the plow. In other words, a cheap female worker, and if they were lucky, also a mother of future male offspring. To the parents of the girl ‚Äòsent away‚Äô to the young husband's household (which inevitably was that of the husband's father), the daughter that had left the parental home was ‚Äòno more than a bucket of water, emptied in front of the door.‚Äô On principle, the daughter could not return to her parents, regardless of how badly she was treated in her new domicile. To welcome her back would bring shame on her parents.This is the essence of Ye Shengtao‚Äôs short story Zhe yeshi yige ren (Is this also a human being?) (published in 1919) that was later renamed ‚ÄòYisheng‚Äô (A Life) by the author. See: Ye Shengtao, Ye Shengtao ji (Collected Works of Ye Shengtao), Nanjing (Jiangsu jiaoyu chubanche) 1987. ‚Äì The representation of women in Chinese literature between 1919 and 1949 is also discussed (in a Western language) by Prof. Weigui Fang (Beida) in his book Selbstreflexion in der Zeit des Erwachens und des Widerstands (Reflecting Identity in the Period of Awakening and of Resistance. Wiesbaden (Harrassowitz) 2006, especially chapt. III, The Basic Experience of Women in China: ‚ÄòWoman isn‚Äôt the master of her fate,‚Äô pp.233-315. It is the impulse to critique the effects of patriarchal customs and patriarchally structured social relations that has kept the filmmaker from focusing on positive traits of Huidong society, which allows women to live separately. On the contrary, we note that in the film, Hui-ha is criticized when she \\"run(s) home to her mother.\\" This is a typical ingredient not of the exceptional Huidong society but of traditional Chinese mainstream society. The ethnological focus of certain film critics on the short story that preceded the film deflects the critique of Chinese patriarchal patterns that survive in today's mainstream society, both on the mainland and in Taiwan. Yushan Huang's adaptation of Zhaohuan Lu's story can be compared to Brecht's adaptation of an older tale which served as the narrative thread of his play The Caucasian Chalk Circle. What is seemingly distant in terms of time and place, is in fact our own reality subjected to the Brechtian artistic device of making the familiar look strange in order to allow a new scrutiny and discovery of everything that is scandalous with regard to it. Clearly, the plot of Zhaohuan Lu's story serves only as a pretext for the film's narrative. This narrative focuses first, on Hsiu's enforced surrender to tradition-based social custom and the male dominance it implies. And secondly, on Hui-hua's final tragic rebellion. But this rebellion is not represented as a lesson which might warn other women not to rebel, as some pro-Lesbian feminist film critics assumed. On the contrary, the film's strategy, in this respect, is entirely in line with the paradigm of such writers critical of tradition as Ye Shengtao, Lao She and Lu Xun. That Hui-hua sees no way out but to commit suicide is a red- hot accusation of a society which is wrong and which requires drastic change. Huang Yu-shan called it \\"the film‚Äôs strong protest at the way patriarchal ideology oppresses women.\\"Huang Yu-shan and Wang Chun-chi, \\"Post-Taiwan New Cinema Women Directors and Their Films: Auteurs, Images, Language,\\" in: Lin- zhen Wang (ed.), ibidem, p.141  References  Literature * Lin-zhen Wang (ed.), Chinese Women's Cinema.

A typical Harz Mountains Mooskappe It is known that the Mooskappe was definitely used in the Harz and Barsinghausen mining regions. It appears in steel engravings from about 1850, for example by Wilhelm Ripe, as an important item of safety gear. In 1824 Heinrich Heine visited the Caroline and Dorothea mines at Clausthal. He wrote about these visits in various places including in his work Die Harzreise where he says: The Mooskappe was usually made of a hard, green felt, but there were also \\"crocheted\\" (geh√§kelte) designs.

Springfield: Illinois State Museum Society, 1963. a group of similar sites on the Illinois side of the Wabash near its confluence with the Ohio River. Duffy is distinctive largely because of its pottery: the site's inhabitants typically produced ceramics of various thicknesses and comparatively few decorative elements, tempered with grog. What decorations exist are typically limited to one or two rows of simple lines or bars that have been incised or stamped on the side of the piece of pottery. Projectile points found at the site are small triangular \\"Mounds Stemless\\" points, and the inhabitants produced celts of a vaguely rectangular shape. The site is believed to have been inhabited circa AD 1000. Duffy is clearly related to sites of the Yankeetown Complex, which is named for the Yankeetown Site on the Ohio River east of Evansville, Indiana. Like Duffy, the people of Yankeetown produced grog-tempered pottery with few details other than incisions,Kellar, James H.

National Park Service, 1975-02-20. although differences between Duffy and Yankeetown pottery are substantial enough to rule out a close connection between the two peoples. Nevertheless, the two sites share certain cultural influences: both feature Late Woodland elements,Muller, Jon. Archaeology of the Lower Ohio River Valley. Walnut Creek: Left Coast, 2009. and as Yankeetown appears to show the beginnings of an indigenous form of the Mississippian culture, Duffy bears some evidence of Mississippian influence. Other Illinois sites potentially related to the Duffy Complex include Carrier Mills in Saline County, which shows some Duffy influence, and Gallatin County's Illinois Salines, which has yielded pottery more closely resembling that of Duffy than that of Yankeetown. The latter site appears to have been under Duffy control as the region was transitioning from terminal Late Woodland to Mississippian. In 1977, the Duffy Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its archaeological importance; it is one of seven Gallatin County locations on the Register, as is the Great Salt Spring.

The physical embodiment of the music is called a score, which includes the music and, if there are lyrics, it also shows the lyrics. History Since the earliest days of the theatre, music has played an important part in stage drama. In Greek drama in the fifth century BC, choric odes were written to be chanted and danced between the spoken sections of both tragedies and comedies. Only fragments of the music have survived. Attempts to recreate the form for revivals from the Renaissance to modern times have branched in several directions. Composers from Andrea Gabrieli to Mendelssohn to Vaughan Williams have composed chorus music for productions of plays by Sophocles, Aristophanes and others. Playwrights including Racine, Yeats and Brecht wrote original plays in styles derived from ancient drama, with sung commentaries by a chorus or narrator. In late 16th century Florence, attempts to revive ancient Greek drama, with sung vocal contributions, developed into the modern genre of opera.Arnold, Denis, et al. \\"Opera\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, ed. Alison Latham, Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 Folk theatre has always deployed dance music and song.Savage, Roger. \\"Incidental music\\", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 In the 16th and 17th centuries, theatre music was performed during the action of plays and as afterpieces. Christopher R. Wilson, discussing Shakespeare's use of music, lists \\"stage music\\" (fanfares to introduce important characters or accompany battle scenes), \\"magic music\\" (as in the lullaby in A Midsummer Night's Dream), \\"character music\\" (as in Twelfth Night, illustrating the high, low, sad or merry natures of the characters) and \\"atmospheric music\\" (such as Ariel's \\"Where the bee sucks\\", in The Tempest).Wilson, Christopher R. \\"Shakespeare, William\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 By the early 18th century, music was firmly established as part of practically all theatrical performances in Europe, whether of opera, dance, or spoken drama. Theatres were built with orchestra pits, and music was either specially composed for the production or appropriated and arranged from existing material. The writer Roger Savage notes in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians: \\"The classic forms of Asian theatre from India to Japan rely heavily on music, as do the dramatic rituals of sub-Saharan Africa and of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\\" In Western theatre genres, Savage writes that music features importantly in medieval liturgical drama, ballet de cour, ballet d'action, classical ballet, modern dance, com√©die-ballet, semi-opera, 18th-century pantomime, ballad opera, Singspiel, op√©ra comique, Victorian burlesque, music hall, vaudeville, variety show, operetta, Edwardian musical comedy, the modern musical including rock musicals (listen to the example, at right, from Hair), and other forms of musical theatre. In common with radio, cinema and television, the theatre has long made use of incidental music to accompany spoken drama.Kennedy, Michael, ed. \\"Incidental Music\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed. rev., Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 See also * Show tune * Aria * Sheet music * Film score * Theatre Musicians Association Bibliography *Green, Stanley.

At one point in her career, she supervised 1500 people at Naval Intelligence Command, including openly gay civilians.Congress, House, Military Personnel Subcommittee, Don't Ask Don't Tell Review, 110th Cong., 2nd sess., July 23, 2008, 6-7, 17, 18, 24, 35, 45 Darrah was a Navy officer who narrowly escaped being killed in the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon, which caused her to reevaluate the harm the policy was causing to her life. Due to this, she retired in 2002 after serving for thirty years. In pursuit of ending DADT, in 2006 she founded and chaired a Mount Vernon Unitarian Church (MVUC) Task Force, and in 2007, she and several other MVUC members collected signatures and successfully advocated for a Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) Action of Immediate Witness (AIW) to repeal DADT.

As a former quarterback in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, he is a two-time All-Canadian and two-time winner of the Hec Crighton Trophy in 2002 and 2003. He played professionally for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Calgary Stampeders, and Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). High school Denison played his high school football at Beamsville District Secondary School, where he was a part of two Zone 4 championship football teams. Great Lakes Football League Denison played for the Niagara Colts of the GLFL and set numerous records including an 836-yard passing performance against the Brantford Bisons that was recognized in Sports Illustrated's Faces in the Crowd. He threw for 6,700 yards and 68 touchdowns in the 1998 season. University career Denison first attended Graceland College in 1998 where he was a member of the Graceland Yellowjackets. He then transferred to the Mansfield University of Pennsylvania in 1999, where he won the starting quarterback job midway through his redshirt freshman season. There he completed 68 of his 144 pass attempts for 735 yards with six touchdowns and ten interceptions. =Queen's University= In 2001, Dension returned to Canada and became a member of the Queen's Golden Gaels football team. In his first year, he initially split quarterbacking duties before starting the last four games of the regular season where he finished 6th nationally in passing yards with 1684 yards. In 2002, Denison set new standards for quarterback play and aerial offense. He became the first CIS football quarterback to pass for more than 3,000 yards in a single season. His 3,001 passing yards surpassed the old record set by Greg Vavra of the Calgary Dinos in 1983. The Gaels finished the 2002 season with a 7‚Äì1 record where Denison had 183 completions out of 312 attempts with 22 passing touchdowns. He recorded the most yards passing in a single OUA game on November 2, 2002 against the Western Mustangs in the OUA semifinal with 561 yards, which remains a U Sports playoff record as of 2019. He took the team to the Yates Cup where the Golden Gaels lost to the McMaster Marauders. For his record-setting season, Denison was awarded the Hec Crighton Trophy, becoming the second Golden Gael to win the award. Denison continued his dominant play in 2003 as he completed 203 of his 313 passing attempts for 2,907 yards with a then-OUA-record 24 passing touchdowns. The Golden Gaels once again finished second in the OUA with a 7‚Äì1 record, but lost to the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks in the semi-final playoff game. Nonetheless, based on another outstanding season, Denison was awarded his second consecutive Hec Crighton MVP award, becoming the second CIS quarterback to ever win the award more than once (Chris Flynn won the award three times). He finished his three-year CIS career with 7,592 passing yards, which was eighth all-time in CIS history, despite all seven players ahead of him having played five seasons. Denison was the central figure in the revival of Queen‚Äôs football program, helping to return a once proud program to the national scene. Professional career Since he began his collegiate career in 1998, Denison was eligible four year later for the 2002 CFL Draft, prior to his back-to-back Hec Crighton Trophy wins. As a result, he was undrafted and was able to sign with any professional team. On December 10, 2003, it was announced that he had signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He attended training camp with the Blue Bombers in 2004 and played in the first pre-season game against the Calgary Stampeders where he had four completions on six pass attempts for 46 yards. However, he was released by the team shortly thereafter. On August 31, 2004, Denison was signed by the Calgary Stampeders. He dressed in one regular season game with the team in 2004 but spent the remainder of his term with the team on the practice roster. He was eventually released by the Stampeders and signed with the Toronto Argonauts, but did not play in a game and was released. Denison was a member of the Albany Conquest in their 2005 season. Northern Football Conference Denison played for the Toronto Titans of the Northern Football Conference (a senior amateur league) from 2011 to 2012, and did not play in 2013. The club was re-named the GTA All-Stars and he re-joined to play for the team from 2014 to 2016. Coaching career While playing for the GTA All-Stars, Denison served as the team's offensive coordinator for four years and the team's head coach in his final year. With the experience, he was hired as the associate head coach (offense) and quarterbacks coach for the Saint Mary's Huskies in 2017. He then moved back to Ontario where he joined the Toronto Varsity Blues as the team's quarterbacks coach for the 2019 season. On April 6, 2020, it was announced that Denison had joined the York Lions to serve as the team's offensive coordinator.

The preferential trade regime within the British Empire continued in some form amongst Commonwealth nations under the Imperial Preference system, until that system was dismantled after World War II due to changes in geopolitics and the pattern of global trade, and the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community. The idea of promoting renewed inter-Commonwealth trade emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the evolution of the global economy. At one extreme, proposals have been raised for the creation of a multilateral free trade area comprising all member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. Today, most Commonwealth countries are pursuing regional integration projects, including the European Union (2 members), Caribbean Community (12 members), Southern African Customs Union (5 members), East African Community (4 members), and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (4 members). However, at the 2005 Summit in Malta, the heads of government endorsed Commonwealth members pursuing free trade amongst one another in order to assist the development of poorest members by allowing them duty-free and quota-free access to the markets of developing and developed countries. The heads of government also endorsed looking into ways the organisation can strengthen dialogue, networking, and collaboration on trade and economic issues between Commonwealth members. The concept of a multilateral Commonwealth free trade area has recently become popularised in Britain among Eurosceptics who campaigned for withdrawal from the EU prior to the UK's EU membership referendum, which resulted in the decision to leave. Historical origins Throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Britain exercised an informal trade system with her colonies and self-governing dominions. During the early 20th century, several political figures in Britain, led by Joseph Chamberlain, argued for a policy of Imperial Preference ‚Äì both to promote unity within the British Empire, and to assure Britain's position as a world power. The policy was controversial as it pitted proponents of Imperial trade with those who sought a general policy of trade liberalisation with all nations. Vision of Imperial Trade The schism helped contribute to the defeat of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and his Conservative-Unionist government in 1906, and had serious ramifications for Conservative prospects in the 1923 and 1929 general elections. One notable victory had been the establishment of the Empire Marketing Board in 1926, which encouraged Britons to 'Buy Empire'. In 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, representatives of Britain, the Dominions, and the Colonies met in Ottawa, Canada to hold the Commonwealth Conference on Economic Consultation and Co-operation. There had been an initial agreement on Imperial Preference, but a comprehensive agreement failed to materialise. Many of the Dominion leaders attributed this to the attitude of the British Dominions Secretary J. H. Thomas during the negotiations. In 1935, the Canadian Prime Minister, R. B. Bennett, a Conservative who endorsed Imperial Preference, was replaced by a Liberal, William Lyon Mackenzie King. King responded to pressure from U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and abandoned Imperial Preference. In the case of the Commonwealth, the U.S. was hostile to it from its inception, notwithstanding the fact that in the cases of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, there was an overwhelming preference for a trade system based on the United Kingdom rather than the U.S. The conclusion of World War II drastically affected the prospects for an agreement Commonwealth trade. The United States emerged as the foremost political and economic power, and its policy was to promote generalised free trade, primarily through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Bretton Woods conference, held in New Hampshire in 1944, had also created a direct link between the value of gold and the US dollar, thereby establishing it as the world's reserve fiat currency. The war had also left Britain heavily indebted, economically weakened, and unable to absorb the flow of exports from Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Dominions, primarily Canada, directed their trade more heavily to the US market as a consequence. The idea of enhanced trade between Canada and Britain was explored in the mid-1950s by the Conservative government of Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker. The plan, in response to the Canadian government's concern with over-reliance on the United States, was to adopt policies that would see up to 15 percent of Canada's US exports diverted to the UK. Representatives for both Diefenbaker and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan held exploratory talks, but no agreement was ever reached.Smith, Denis (1995), Rogue Tory: The Life and Legend of John Diefenbaker, Macfarlane Walter & Ross, =British entry into the EEC= Britain's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, and its evolution as a member state of the European Union (EU) has meant that for practical purposes, the United Kingdom cannot independently enter into negotiations with Commonwealth states to establish a free trade agreement. Instead, the EU, as a representative of all its members, negotiates collectively. However, after the decision on 23 June 2016 by Britain to leave the EU and as the Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty has been invoked, Britain will be able to negotiate its own trade deals. Present day =The Commonwealth Effect= In 1997, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at Edinburgh was presented with research conducted by Drs. Sarianna Lundan and Geoffrey Jones, and commissioned by the Commonwealth Secretariat. The paper, entitled \\"The 'Commonwealth Effect' and the Process of Internationalisation\\", measured whether or not Commonwealth jurisdictions enjoyed a qualitative advantage in trade with one another as opposed to equivalent non-Commonwealth nations. Their research found that even in the absence of trade treaties, there was a clear cost advantage in trade between Commonwealth nations, and that the overhead costs of doing business were reduced by up to 15 percent in comparison to trade outside the Commonwealth. =Commonwealth Advantage= The Commonwealth Advantage program was a shared initiative between the Toronto Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society, and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance (CATA) which ran from 2004 until 2008. Chaired by the Hon. Sinclair Stevens, a former Canadian International Trade Minister, the campaign was focused on developing strategic partnerships between Commonwealth-based companies. =CHOGM 2005 ‚Äì Malta= In response to the lack of progress achieved in the Doha round of trade liberalisation negotiations in the World Trade Organization, Commonwealth Heads of Government, at their 2005 Summit in Malta, endorsed the idea of pursuing trade agreements among Commonwealth member states. Commonwealth free trade as policy Because of their very different economic profiles Commonwealth countries' interests are not always aligned. In principle, resource exporters such as Canada, Australia, and most of the Caribbean and African Commonwealth countries are complementary to resource importers such as the United Kingdom and India. However, the historical trade ties between them were based on terms which were dictated by the Colonial Office in Britain. Since the former dominions and colonies have achieved independence, they are free to refuse British initiatives and seek better deals elsewhere. Specifically, agricultural exporters in the Cairns Group (including members Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, and South Africa) are at odds with the importing countries at the World Trade Organization. These countries pursue independent trade policies. Notably Australia (2005) and Canada (1988), and Singapore (2004) have free trade agreements with the United States, and New Zealand (2008) has one with China. Meanwhile, New Zealand and Singapore are already members of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, which Australia, Canada and Malaysia are attempting to join (along with major non- Commonwealth countries). Furthermore, the proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia would include Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, India, Australia, and New Zealand. = Canada = Commonwealth trade, as such, has not been a notable policy position in Canada since the failed Diefenbaker proposal of the 1950s. Instead Canada has pursued deep economic integration with the United States on the one hand (including a free trade agreement in 1988), and a generalised diversification of trade on the other hand including the \\"third option\\" policy of the 1970 (a failed attempt to diversify Canada's trade via negotiations with Japan and the European Economic Community). This has been reinforced with a new wave of free trade agreements following NAFTA in 1994, including five Latin American countries, the European Free Trade Association and more recently the European Union, as well the failed Free Trade Area of the Americas in the early 2000s, and negotiations towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership since 2012. In 2005, Canadian writer and political activist Brent H. Cameron wrote 'The Case for Commonwealth Free Trade', which argued the merits of establishing a trade and investment agreement that would initially combine the most developed member economies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore) but could eventually include developing members such as India and South Africa. Cameron conceded that UK participation would be difficult with European Union (EU) membership, but suggested that it be included if Britain were to exit that agreement: \\"It is proposed that a CFTA membership and expansion be conducted in four distinct phases: Phase 1 would see the creation of an initial grouping of four nations - Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. This grouping represents the most affluent and industrialized economies of the Commonwealth. Combined with stable political, judicial and social institutions, their ability to quickly integrate into a CFTA is vitally important if the organization is to have the ability to expand and succeed.\\" , 75% of Canadian trade takes place with countries which Canada has a free trade agreement, but this does not include any Commonwealth members. Canada is currently in negotiations with the Caribbean Community (primarily Commonwealth countries), the European Union (UK, Malta and Cyprus are Commonwealth members), as well as India and Singapore. =New Zealand= Winston Peters, the leader of the New Zealand First political party, called in February 2016 for a Commonwealth Free Trade Area modelled on the one in existence between Australia and New Zealand. In his comments, he suggested the inclusion of the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in this area, with the possibility of adding South Africa, India, or others, referring to the putative free trade area as a 'Closer Commonwealth Economic Relations' area, or CCER. CCER was included as New Zealand government policy in the Labour-NZ First coalition agreement. =United Kingdom= A map of the countries with which the EU is negotiating, or already has, free trade agreements. Amongst Commonwealth countries, the EU has free trade agreements with South Africa, Cameroon, Zambia, and the 12 commonwealth members of the Caribbean Community. The United Kingdom has been a member of the European Union and has therefore been unable to negotiate its own trade agreements for several decades. However, after the United Kingdom formally leaves the European Union, it may again be able to negotiate its own trade deals. While the UK has been in the EU it has actively pressured the EU to pursue trade agreements with other Commonwealth countries.Cameron fights back: his full statement on the EU deal, blogs.spectator.co.uk. Retrieved 24 February 2016. In part, this has resulted in the EU initiating negotiations on free trade agreements with a number of Commonwealth countries. At present, Canada and India are both in the midst of negotiating free trade agreements with the European Union. Furthermore, a number of Commonwealth countries, including South Africa, Cameroon, Zambia, and the 12 commonwealth members of the Caribbean Community, already have free trade agreements with the EU. The EU, through the Lome and Cotonou Agreements, have extended some preferential trade access to developing Commonwealth countries. However, the idea of establishing a free trade area within the Commonwealth has garnered interests in the UK amongst politicians and parties that advocated leaving the European Union who cite the development of a Commonwealth free trade policy as an important step in reshaping the UK's trade policy. The UK Independence Party has included a call for a Commonwealth Free Trade Agreement in its policy manifesto during the 2010 British general election. In addition, some members of Britain's Conservative Party, including MEP Daniel Hannan and MP Andrew Rosindell, have written extensively on the merits of expanding trade within the Commonwealth and the broader Anglosphere. On October 8, 2012, Tim Hewish and James Styles released their paper \\"Common Trade, Common Wealth, Common Growth\\" at the UK Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England. The following day saw British Foreign Secretary William Hague comment upon how the Commonwealth, which had been 'neglected' by previous UK governments, presented \\"enormous opportunities\\" for the nation. Supporters of Britain's membership of the European Union have criticised the proposal for a Commonwealth free trade area as unlikely in practice to come to fruition.

She is the fourth female chef to win three Michelin stars, and was named the Best Female Chef by The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2011. Biography Anne- Sophie Pic was born in Valence, Dr√¥me, in France on 12 July 1969. She is the daughter of chef Jacques Pic, and grew up at her family's restaurant, Maison Pic. Her grandfather, Andre Pic, was also a chef, who was particularly known for a crayfish gratin dish, and who first gained the restaurant three Michelin stars in 1934. She initially decided not to follow in their footsteps, and instead travelled overseas to train in management. She worked in Japan and the United States as an intern for various companies, including Cartier and Mo√´t & Chandon, but found herself drawn back to the restaurant for her \\"passion\\". In 1992, at the age of 23, she returned to Maison Pic to train under her father to become a chef. He died three months later, and she moved to working the front of the house. In 1995, the restaurant lost its third Michelin star, for which she felt she had lost \\"her father's star\\", and spurred her to return to the kitchen. In 1997, Pic took control of the restaurant. She had no formal training in cooking. In 2007, she regained Maison Pic's three Michelin stars. This was only the fourth time ever that a female chef had achieved three Michelin stars. That same year, Pic was the only woman on French newspaper Le Figaros list of the top twenty richest chefs in France. She opened her second restaurant, Restaurant Anne-Sophie Pic, in Lausanne, Switzerland. It was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and is located within the Beau-Rivage Palace hotel. In September 2012, she opened her first Paris-based restaurant, La Dame de Pic. Pic is married to David Sinapian and has a son named Nathan. In 2015 and 2016, Pic was a member of the Prix Versailles judges panel. In 2018, she appeared as a judge on the \\"France\\" episode and in the finale of The Final Table, season 1. In June 2020, she and other chefs, as well as architects, Nobel laureates in Economics and leaders of international organizations, signed the appeal in favour of the purple economy (\\"Towards a cultural renaissance of the economy\\"), published in the Corriere della Sera, El Pa√≠s and Le Monde. Awards In 2011, she received the Veuve Clicquot World's Best Female Chef award, named after Madame Clicquot Ponsardin and given by the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards scheme from British magazine Restaurant. It was the first time the category had been awarded, and it was thought to have been closely fought between Pic, Elena Arzak and Nadia Santini. At the time of the award, Pic was the only three Michelin starred female chef in France. On 14 July 2011, she was named a Chevalier (Knight) of the French Legion of Honour. In 2009, Pic received the Eckart Witzigmann Award for excellent culinary art.

Kgosiemang was born on 5 August 1946 in Aminuis. He was related to chief Morwe, the Tswana leader from Kuruman (South Africa) who founded the Tswana minority in South-West Africa. Kgosiemang became Kgosi-kgolo (chief) of this group on 28 April 1979 at a ceremony in Gobabis. In this position he also led the Tswana Alliance, a group participating at the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference in Windhoek between 1975 and 1977. He oversaw the name change from Tswana Alliance to Seoposengwe Party and its fusion into the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance in 1980. Allocation of land to bantustans according to the Odendaal Plan. Tswanaland is the rectangle in eastern central South-West Africa When the apartheid government of South Africa devised the Odendaal Plan in the 1960s, Tswanaland was one of the planned bantustans, intended to be a self-governing homeland for the Tswana people. Unlike all other homelands, it was never implemented that way. The Ovaherero were allowed to stay in the area, and the Tswana remained a minority. Kgosimang was the political leader of this entity between 1980 and 1989. In the twilight days of South-West Africa, Kgosiemang was a member of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia, and after Namibian independence he became a member of Namibia's first parliament. He served until 1993, when pressure from his Tswana community forced him to resign and concentrate on his duties as traditional leader. He later joined ruling SWAPO but never returned to the National Assembly. Constance Kgosiemang died of a heart attack on 16 August 2012.

D. Ludlow, 'Pill Priory, 1996-1999: Recent Work at a Tironian House in Pembrokeshire', Medieval Archaeology 46 (2002). Pill Priory was founded as a daughter house of St Dogmaels Abbey (raised to Abbey status in 1120), near Cardigan, itself a priory of the Tironensian order of reformed Benedictine monks. The other daughter houses were Caldey (Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire, Wales) and Glascarrig, County Wexford in Ireland. Pill Priory was established by the Roche family of the Barony and Roch Castle, Pembrokeshire and was founded within a few years of St Dogmaels. The founder was Adam de la Roche, a descendant of Godebert de Fleming.E. M. Pritchard, The History of St Dogmael's Abbey (London, 1907) in which much of the primary source material for the priory is assembled and introduced (esp. pp. 124-38). E.M. Pritchard thought it to be around 1180-90,Pritchard 1907, p. 124 while the Pembrokeshire antiquarian Richard Fenton considered the earlier date of 1160-70 to be possible.R. Fenton. A Historical Tour through Pembrokeshire (London 1811), London 180. The priory was jointly dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to St Budoc, a dedication of it was the former chapel of St Budoc (now \\"St Botolph\\") which lay 1.3 km north-east of Pill Priory. The community may always have been small; it was recorded as five monks in 1534 and four in 1536.Pritchard 1907, p. 139. It appears, moreover, that the sister house at Caldey was, periodically at least, occupied by a single monk (Haverfordwest Reference Library, Francis Green Collection, Vol. 12, 538, State papers). The priory site and its environs, including five orchards, a wood and a meadow at Pill, the priory mill and several other possessions including St Budoc's and Steynton Church were demised by the crown to John Doune who, in 1544, confirmed the grant of his interest to John Wogan who in turn had been the lessee of the \\"Priory\\" in 1536-7.E.

A. Roberts(ed.), Espicopal Registers of the Bishops of St Davids 1397-1518. Vol. II (London, 1917), 73. He was granted a pension of ¬£10 (Haverfordwest Reference Library, Francis Green Collention, Vol. I2, 538, State papers).

The manor of Pill, including the priory site and associated holdings, was sold in June 1546 to the aspiring local landowners Roger Barlow of Slebech and his brother Thomas. An account of Pill Priory by the Pembrokeshire antiquarian Richard Fenton, writing c. 1811, describes the priory ruins much as they survive today.Fenton 1811, pp. 179-81. The entire site remains in private hands. The free-standing remains of the priory church's chancel arch is now the most striking element of the site, and forms a garden feature, together with the remains of the south transept. The Pill Priory Cottage living quarters contain elements from the conventual buildings which were arranged around a more-or-less formalised cloister. The remains of all are constructed from Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone, both from local sources.

This phenomenon can feature in identity disturbance, dissociative identity disorder, and other specified dissociative disorders, among other things. Some individuals describe their experience of multiplicity as a form of neurodiversity, rather than something that demands a diagnosis. Since 1994, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) no longer refers to \\"multiple personality disorder\\", favoring other terms. In a body that contains multiple personas, a \\"system\\" may associate behavior with each persona and switch among them. Somebody who experiences multiplicity is described as a \\"multiple,\\" while a person who does not experience is described as a \\"singlet\\". History Throughout history, concepts of phantoms, muses, and fluid \\"selves\\" have been applied to this phenomenon. This has been extended to concepts such as tulpamancy. Additionally, some individuals throughout history have stated that they had been taken over by a spirit, soul, or ghost. Plato described the soul (\\"psyche\\") as tripartite, calling them Logos (rationality), Eros (erotic love), and Thymus (desire). According to Carter,[Who?] Shakespeare showed examples of this via characters such as Hamlet and Macbeth who had distinct personalities. Carter claimed that Freud supported the notion of different personalities when he came up with the Id, Ego, and Superego, arguing that a split separates the conscious and unconscious mind. Carl Jung proposed: \\"The many contains the unity of the one without losing the possibilities of the many.\\" Carter says that Italian psychologist Roberto Assagioli developed psychosynthesis, and hypothesized that an individual may not be consciously aware of their many personae. American psychologist John G. Watkins used hypnosis to bring out different personalities. Systems Many people who experience multiplicity have a \\"system\\" of multiple, mostly- independent selves, each with a name, thoughts, emotions, behavioral patterns, preferences, and memories, along with a gender and sexual orientation. An individual's personae can adopt different ages, including as children, sometimes called littles. They can be grouped into subsystems or families. Favored terminology describes them as \\"members,\\" \\"alters,\\" or \\"resident persons\\". \\"Alter\\" has lost favor among the \\"plural\\" community because it implies that some personae are not fully realized. One member can control behavior for some period. This is often referred to as \\"fronting\\". \\"Switching\\" occurs when a different member begins to front. This can happen voluntarily or involuntarily. Some systems are developed during childhood from age 6 to around 9 due to extensive trauma. Amnesia separates these memories, and this barrier prevents the child from fully integrating its experiences into one persona. Instead the separate identities develop independently. Specific alters may not know what other alters do while fronting. Within a system, a \\"main\\" host often lacks knowledge of past traumatic events. The main usually controls the body during quotidian activities. Each system is unique when it comes to organization, depth and breadth of memory, and how much control they can exercise over switching. Many multiples use \\"we\\" instead of \\"I.\\" Multiples may perform well in day-to-day life. Some people use multiplicity as a means of coping. Online communities and forums support multiples and provide fora for discussing unique experiences. A 2017 study estimated that around 200 to 300 people were part of these communities; however, the online community is much larger currently.  Media portrayal  Movies may portray systems in a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde fashion, where the host struggles against an abusive alter ego. Multiplicity may be confused with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder, which are represented similarly as inherently violent or shameful. Multiples may want to depict their positive and negative experiences in a respectful and understanding way.

The river drains a rugged, lightly populated wilderness watershed in the Salmon River Mountains. It is the second-largest tributary of the Salmon River, after the Middle Fork. Geography Beginning near Monumental Peak in the Boise National Forest, the river flows generally north to its confluence with the Salmon near Mackay Bar, about above the larger river's mouth on the Snake River. About midway along its course, it is joined by its two main tributaries ‚Äì the East Fork South Fork Salmon River from the east, and the Secesh River from the west. The river receives runoff from a total of of land, ranging in elevation from at North Loon Mountain to at the mouth of the river. History The Native Americans living along the river were the Nez Perce, Shoshone, Bannock and Paiute. The river and its valley were used largely as a place for fishing, hunting and gathering, while local hot springs provided camping sites during the winter. The first recorded Europeans to see the South Fork may have been a group of mountain men working under the American Fur Company in 1831. They crossed the upper part of the river while reconnoitering the western part of the Salmon River system for good beaver streams. In the 1860s, prospectors discovered gold on the South Fork, leading to the initial settlement of the drainage by Westerners. After the gold rush faded, a few of the miners stayed on as homesteaders and ranchers. The drainage was heavily logged from the 1940s to the mid-1960s, when an estimated 320 million board feet of timber was taken from the basin. More than of logging roads were constructed across the drainage. Ecology The South Fork is an important habitat for Chinook salmon, Westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout and steelhead trout and has been designated a critical habitat for salmon. Although aquatic habitat in the South Fork drainage is considered good as a whole, some tributaries have been damaged by logging, mining and road-building activities, which has increased the sediment load in the river. About of backcountry roads in the drainage have been decommissioned and are undergoing restoration by the U.S. Forest Service. Plant communities in the South Fork drainage range from grassland and shrubland, Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir and Grand fir forests at lower elevations, to subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, whitebark pine and aspen at mid to high elevations. Among large mammals, the watershed is home to Rocky Mountain elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, black bear, cougar, mountain goat, bighorn sheep and gray wolf. The area has over 200 confirmed species of resident and migratory birds. Hydrology The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated a stream gage at the mouth of the South Fork between 1993 and 2003, recording an annual mean of . The highest annual mean was in 1997, and the lowest was in 2001. Mean monthly discharge rates for the South Fork are displayed in the below graph.

Furnas et al. (1987) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem.Furnas, G., et al, The Vocabulary Problem in Human-System Communication, Communications of the ACM, 1987, 30(11), pp. 964-971. Their results show that on average 80% of the times different people (experts in the same field) will name the same thing differently. There are usually tens of possible names that can be attributed to the same thing. This research motivated the work on latent semantic indexing. The vocabulary mismatch between user created queries and relevant documents in a corpus causes the term mismatch problem in information retrieval.

Toronto, Canada, 2010. were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem in a retrieval setting. Their results show that an average query term fails to appear in 30-40% of the documents that are relevant to the user query. They also showed that this probability of mismatch is a central probability in one of the fundamental probabilistic retrieval models, the Binary Independence Model. They developed novel term weight prediction methods that can lead to potentially 50-80% accuracy gains in retrieval over strong keyword retrieval models. Further research along the line shows that expert users can use Boolean Conjunctive Normal Form expansion to improve retrieval performance by 50-300% over unexpanded keyword queries.Zhao, L. and Callan, J., Automatic term mismatch diagnosis for selective query expansion, SIGIR 2012.  Techniques that solve mismatch  * Stemming * Full-text indexing instead of only indexing keywords or abstracts * Indexing text on inbound links from other documents (or other social tagging * Query expansion.

The present house is a two-storey building constructed in the 1840s from block rubble. It has a terraced front with octagonal pinnacles and gables at each projection of the fa√ßade, a big bay window and an upper oriel and incorporates an earlier two storey building as an east wing. At the rear is a coach house and free-standing office block. History The Parkanaur land, previously owned by the O'Donnelly family, was granted by James I to Toby Caulfeild, 1st Baron Caulfeild in the early 17th century. The property remained in the Caulfeild family until they sold it to Ynyr Burges in 1771. His descendants built Edenfield, a two-storey cottage on the estate. In the 1820s, John Henry Burges moved in and enlarged the cottage. His son, John Ynyr Burges, commissioned architect Thomas Duff to design a new mansion, which was built between 1839 and 1854. Burges names the mansion \\"Parkanaur\\". Parkanaur remained in the Burges family until they moved to England in 1955. It was then bought by American millionaire Thomas Doran. who had emigrated from Castlecaulfield as a teenager. He made Parkanaur available to his friend Rev. Gerry Eakins to develop a new centre for the education of disabled young adults. The house reopened in 1960 as 'The Thomas Doran Training Centre', (Parkanaur College) and much of the house continues today in this role. The grounds were opened to the public as Parkanaur Forest Park in 1983. They contain a rare herd of white fallow deer.

The roughly American River rises at and flows generally south to the confluence, while the northwest flowing Red River, rising at , is about long. The American River is sometimes considered part of the main stem. From the confluence the South Fork flows west through a canyon followed by Idaho State Highway 14, receiving the Crooked River from the left and Newsome Creek from the right before reaching Golden, where it receives Tenmile Creek from the left. Further west the river receives Johns Creek from the left, Meadow Creek from the right and Mill Creek from the left, and the gorge deepens to a maximum of some as the river swings north near Grangeville. From there the river flows generally north, past Harpster and Stites, before reaching its mouth on the Clearwater at Kooskia, at an elevation of . Grangeville (Harpster) Dam was built on the South Fork in 1910 for hydroelectricity generation. In 1963, the dam was demolished, restoring the river's populations of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout.

April 19, 2002, Mexico City) was a Mexican graphic artist and painter known principally for his work with publications such as illustrations and political cartoons but he created a number of murals as well. He was born in the rough neighborhood of Tepito and began drawing for local publishers when he was a teenager. He attended the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas where one of his teachers introduced him to the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular where he began his career in earnest. From the late 1940s until his death, he work with various publications, mostly newspapers, but he also did book illustrations as well. In his later career, he worked on a number of murals, especially in the state of Veracruz, which he had an affinity for. Despite winning a number of important awards for his work, he is relatively unknown even in Mexico, with collections of his work scattered among a number of institutions. Life Alberto Beltr√°n Garc√≠a was born on March 22, 1923, in the rough Tepito neighborhood of Mexico City to Hesiquio Beltr√°n Franco and Josefina Garc√≠a. As his family was poor, he only completed primary school before working. In 1939, while still a teenager, he entered the Escuela Libre de Arte y Publicidad to study drawing and soon after was drawing illustrations for several local publishers. In 1943, he entered the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas where he learning basic engraving with Carlos Alvarado Lang and fresco painting with Alfredo Zalce. However, much of his ability was self-taught, for example the ability to engrave on linoleum. During his lifetime he was solitary and never had children. He was described as shy, simple and prudent who did not like to be the center of attention. He had a particular affinity for the state of Veracruz, considering himself one at heart, prompting him to work on many artistic and other projects in Xalapa, the city of Veracruz and San Andr√©s Tuxtla. As a member of the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular, he believed that artists should work for the people rather than for themselves. He never sold any of his engravings and did not always charge for his book illustration work. He lived simply and saved much of the money he earned or won through prizes without ever spending it. Near the end of his life, he lived at the Club de Periodistas, a home for aging journalists. He wanted to form a fund for the education of artists with his considerable saving, but legal and economic problems eventually made this impossible. He died at age eighty from complications due to a brain hemorrhage on April 19, 2002. Career Linoleum engraving by Beltr√°n of Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n Beltr√°n was one of the most prolific, versatile and successful graphic artists in Mexico in the 20th century, as an illustrator, cartoonist, designer, founder of newspaper and magazines and engraver. He work was added to that of poets, novelists, historians, anthropologists, economists and politicians. His career began in earnest when he joined the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular in 1944. He was introduced to the organization by Alfredo Zalce. There he created engravings with themes nationalism, the Mexican Revolution, social criticism and peace working with artists such as Leopoldo M√©ndez, Pablo O'Higgins, Adolfo Mexiac, Fanny Rabel, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Celia Calder√≥n, Elizabeth Catlett, Andrea G√≥mez and Mariana Yampolsky. He remained with the organization until 1959, serving as its president several times. In the late 1940s, he began doing political cartoons and illustrations for leading newspapers in Mexico City and other parts of the country, appearing regularly in Exc√©lsior, Novedades de M√©xico, Diario de la tarde and La Prensa . He traveled to inner cities and mountainous rural areas doing work as a reporter, generally telling his stories with graphics, which reflected what he saw. He was founder or co- founder of several publications. One of these was El Popular with Alejandro Carrillo Marcor, since stopped publishing. In the 1970s he was one of the founders of the daily El D√≠a, creating its cultural supplement called El Gallo Ilustrado, which he directed. In 1976 he worked with a children's magazine called Caminito. Near the end of his life, he also worked on a publication called Agua-Cero published by the Pascual Cooperative. He worked right up until his death, despite his frail health, serving on the editorial board and was one of its most active collaborators. His offices there were used for his funeral in accordance to his wishes. His newspaper and book work became so popular that it was credited with propping up a struggling Mexican publishing industry. Books which feature his work include Origen, vida y milagros de su apellido by Gutierre Tib√≥n (1946), Juan P√©rez Jolote: Biograph√≠a de un Tzotzil by Ricardo Pozas Arciniega (1948), La ruta de Hern√°n Cort√©s by Fernando Ben√≠tez (1950), Dona B√°rbara by R√≥mulo Gallegos (1954), La visi√≥n de los vencidos by Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla (1959), and Las Tierras flacas by Agust√≠n Y√°√±ez (1968). He also did the illustration for Todo empez√≥ el domingo by Elena Poniatowska. Beltr√°n also worked in education, starting with his participation in literacy campaigns, often in indigenous languages. He also worked in political campaigns to promote nationalism and leftist ideals. He collaborated with the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica to produce textbooks and other educational materials in Spanish and other languages. In 1960 he worked with Revista Magisterio, a magazine dedicated to education. He was also the director of the Escuela Libre de Arte y Publicidad, which he had attended as a teenager. In his later career, he also did painting and sculpture. One early piece is a relief in the upper part of the Pulmonology Institute of the Centro M√©dico Siglo XXI in 1959 collaborating with Francisco Z√∫√±iga. In 1967 he created the mural Quetzalc√≥atl y el hombre hoy done in mosaic tile, snail shells and ceramics for the exterior of the Museo de Antropolog√≠a de Xalapa, Veracruz. This was later moved to the campus of the Universidad Veracruzana in the same city. In 1969 he created a mosaic mural on the vault of the Museum of the City of Veracruz. In 1972 he did a monumental glass piece for the Civil Registry of Veracruz. In 1988, he painted a mural in acrylic for the Attorney General's office in Mexico City. One other late project was the creation of the Centro de Informaci√≥n y Documentaci√≥n Alberto Beltr√°n, created in 1971 with the collaboration of the Direcci√≥n General de Arte Popular and the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. It is a unique institution dedicated to the study, promotion and protection of Mexico's many subcultures. It produces books, pamphlets, newsletters, field notes and various other documents which are contained in its Archivo de la Traditiones y Arte Popular. This center is now part of the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares. Recognition for his work includes Premio de Carteles de Alfabetizaci√≥n in 1953 (for his work in literacy), the National Engraving Prize in 1956, the first prize at the InterAmerican Biennial in Painting and Engraving in 1958, the National Journalism Prize in 1976 (for his political cartoons), third place in the Satire for Peace Contest in the former Soviet Union in 1984, Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1985. Memberships include the Academia de Artes from 1966, the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, Seminario de Cultura Mexicana from 1980 and Creator Emertitus with the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte from 1993. In 2005, the Direcci√≥n General de Culturas Populares e Ind√≠genas published a book about him called Apuntes, retratos y testimonios de un artista inolvidable. Homenaje a Alberto Beltr√°n. However, despite the awards he is relatively unknown, even in Mexico. One of his drawings, that of Benito Ju√°rez entering Mexico City, was exhibited for decades in the Zocalo metro station as a mural, but misattributed to ‚Äúan unknown artist of the last (19th) century.‚Äù Beltr√°n comment this was that he wished he had lived in the 19th century instead of the 20th. In the last year of his life, there were three exhibitions of his life's work to honor him but much of it was exhibited as copies as the originals were lost and many of the originals were in poor condition. It is not known exactly how many works he created during his lifetime or where those that still exist are. However, those works which have been authenticated are valuable. A large quantity of his work, probable the largest collection of his to exist, was donated by the artists to UNAM, which the university edited into a book in 2003 called Alberto Beltr√°n, 1923-2002 Cronista e Ilustrador. The book also included essays by Vicente Quitarte, Ernesto de la Torre Villar, Silvia Gonz√°lez and Elena Poniatowska. Other important collections include the archives of the Taller de Gr√°fica popular (including original engraving plates), the Museo de la Caricatura in Mexico City, the Centro de Informaci√≥n y Documentaci√≥n (mostly drawings of indigenous and popular culture) and at the Universidad Obrera de M√©xico (mostly politically themed work). Artistry He was a noted painter, engraver and political cartoonist, with most of his notable work in the graphic arts. He is considered to be the successor of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada and Leopoldo M√©ndez. Most of his work was related to publications. He was a political cartoonist, with emphasis on pointing out the excesses of those in power and the vices of society. He was also a journalist with his reporting mostly done with his graphic work, depicting what he saw without romanticizing. He's considered to be part of the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura, with his work featuring realistic and detailed facial expressions, which often told much of the story. For book illustration, he principally used three techniques, woodcut, metal engraving and lithography. His accurate portrayals of indigenous life came from his frequent travels to rural areas in various parts of Mexico. These were used to illustrate publications such as literature published by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista and a book called Relatos, mitos y leyendas de la Chinantla by Roberto Weitlaner. The book Los mexicanos se pintan solos by Ricardo Cort√©s Tamayo features images by him illustrating various scenes featuring the common people of the country in the 1950s and 1960s. His work with the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular focused on anti-US imperialism, Nazism, fascism and Francoist Spain. It supported various social and civic movements in Mexico, especially those related to the ideals of the Mexican Revolution and those related to workers. He often drew depictions of common men such as street vendors, cooks, bakers, police and many others along with symbols such as the nopal cactus, maguey, huaraches, machetes, sombreros and sarapes. From his time at the Taller, he believed that art was for the masses not his personal enrichment or fame. He signed his work ‚Äúbeltran‚Äù without a capital letter or accent mark.

History =Jerry Luedders (1983‚Äì1986)= Jerry Luedders founded the Portland Columbia Symphony in 1982 as the Palatine Hill Symphony. Luedders, who had moved to Portland in 1977, was then serving as director of the school of music at Lewis & Clark College and conductor of the school's orchestra. He later recalled of the Palatine Hill Symphony's origins that Portland had several \\"average\\" community orchestras at the time, but the \\"best\\" players from each agreed to join his orchestra while continuing to perform with their respective ensembles. Orchestra rehearsals were held at Evans Auditorium on the campus of Lewis & Clark. The orchestra's first concert was presented in February 1983 and included Johannes Brahms' Tragic Overture. Luedders served as conductor and music director until the summer of 1986. He later returned to conduct the orchestra in celebration of its twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversaries. =John Trudeau (1986‚Äì2000)= John Trudeau, a teacher at Portland State University, became conductor and music director in 1986. When rehearsals were moved from Lewis & Clark, the Palatine Hill Symphony was renamed the Portland Columbia Symphony.

In April 2012 Edwards announced his resignation at the end of his twelfth season, citing exhaustion from the commutes between Olympia and Portland as the reason. The orchestra's final performances under Edwards' leadership were held in May 2012 at First United Methodist Church in Portland and the Mt. Hood Community College Theatre in Gresham. Edwards was named Conductor Emeritus and Principal Guest Conductor and is scheduled to return for the 2012‚Äì2013 season finale concert.

It was built between 1888 and 1892 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. In 1914 the fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Namur. Maizeret was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the fortified position of Namur in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. It saw action in 1940 during the Battle of Belgium, and was captured by German forces. The fort is now abandoned on private property. Description The Fort de Maizeret is located about east of the center of Namur. The fort, one of the smaller Brialmont forts, is an irregular trapezoid overlooking a bend in the Meuse. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif, closely grouped in a solid mass of concrete. Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Namur), with lesser protection than the front and \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Construction The three forts on the right bank of the Meuse were linked by a military railway, with a repair shop for the rolling stock at Maizeret. Materials delivered from the Meuse were moved to Maizeret by an inclined plane from the river below. Armament Maizeret's guns included one twin 15cm turret, one single 21cm turret and two twin 12cm turrets, all for distant targets. Three 57mm turrets with another six 57mm guns in embrasures providing defense of the fort's ditches and postern. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight.Donnell, p. 17 The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort. World War I The forts of Namur In the summer of 1914 the Fort de Maizeret was under the command of Captain-Commandant Poncelet, with about 400 men. The fort was bombarded by invading German forces beginning on 21 August 1914. The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Li√®ge, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Maizeret was abandoned by Poncelet and his garrison on 22 August, its ability to resist destroyed by the heavy German artillery. Fortified Position of Namur Maizeret's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Namur, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 Protection was substantially increased and armament was modernized. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. The area surrounding the fort was equipped with improved shelters for the interval troops. After its renovation, Maizeret was armed with one twin 105mm turret, four 75mm single turrets, one twin machine gun turret and two twin grenade launcher turrets. Machine guns provided close protection. Ventilation was provided by an air inlet in a nearby ravine. The 75mm turrets could be lowered for better protection. Second World War The Fort de Maizeret in May 1940 was commanded by Captain-Commandant Hambrenne. The fort opened fire against distant targets on 14 May. On the 15th Maizeret fired in support of the Fort de Marchovelette, but was inactive on the following two days. On the 18thy Maizeret again supported Marchovelette. On the 19th there were skirmishes and two wounded Germans were captured. In the 20th, Maizeret supported the Fort d'Andoy. Sporadic action continued on the 21st and 22nd. On the morning of the 23rd the fort came under heavy fire from 88mm high-velocity guns, followed by an infantry assault. The fort surrendered at 2:45 PM, having lost all means of resistance. Present The Fort de Maizeret is on private property and is not open to the public. It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II.Donnell, p. 59 A quarry has been excavated just to the east of the fort. One of the counterscarp positions is directly on the edge of the quarry, overlooking the Meuse. The present owner lives in the former commandant's house.Donnell, p. 59 References  Bibliography  *Donnell, Clayton, The Forts of the Meuse in World War I, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2007, . *Kauffmann, J.E., Jurga, R., Fortress Europe: European Fortifications of World War II, Da Capo Press, USA, 2002, .

All water was released downstream to flow across the Kansas state border, about six miles to the east, to satisfy a May 2003 United States Supreme Court decision on a dispute arising from the Republican River Compact. In September and October 2011, Bonny Lake was drained and many of the Bonny Lake State Park's services were eliminated, including the fishery and the visitors' center. The dam structure remains.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He played college football at Baylor, where he earned All-American recognition. Early years Williams was born in Highland Hills, Dallas. He attended W. T. White High School in Dallas, and played for the White Longhorns high school football team. As a senior, he had 59 receptions for 972 yards and eight touchdowns. Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, he accepted a scholarship to Baylor over an offer from Colorado State. College career Williams attended Baylor University, where he played for the Baylor Bears football team from 2008 to 2012. During his college career, he had 202 receptions for 3,334 yards with 27 touchdowns. Williams was also a Biletnikoff Award finalist for 2011. In 2012, he led the nation with 1,832 receiving yards.\\"2012 NCAA Division I-A College Football Individual Statistics Leaders for Receiving\\". espn.go.com. Retrieved February 7, 2013. Professional career = Dallas Cowboys = 2013 season: Rookie year In the 2013 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys traded down in the first round with the San Francisco 49ers, in exchange for a third round pick that the team used to select Williams with the 74th overall pick. Williams struggled in training camp adjusting to the team's offense, but by the end of the preseason, he had supplanted Dwayne Harris as the third wide receiver. He again struggled at the start of the regular season with his route running and dropped passes, until the fourth game against the San Diego Chargers, where he started in place of an injured Miles Austin and registered seven receptions for 71 yards, but also had a critical fumble trying to extend for a touchdown in the last minutes of the game. He started the next week playing against the Denver Broncos and had four receptions for 151 yards and a touchdown. By Week 8 against the Detroit Lions, Williams set a Cowboys franchise record for rookies, with a touchdown in his fourth consecutive game. He returned to his third receiver position in the 11th game of the season against the 2013 New York Giants and also started returning kickoffs in place of an injured Harris. Williams finished his rookie season with 44 receptions for 736 yards (16.7 average) and 5 receiving touchdowns. At the time, his totals ranked fourth for most receptions, most receiving yards and most receiving touchdowns by a rookie in franchise history. 2014 season Williams started the year looking to improve on a productive rookie campaign, immediately establishing himself as a legitimate No. 2 wideout and deep threat opposite Dez Bryant by catching 6 touchdowns in the first 7 weeks. After a strong start to his season that included a critical first down reception in the Seattle Seahawks win, he slowed down catching only 2 touchdown passes in the remaining 10 weeks, finishing with 37 receptions for 621 yards and 8 touchdowns. During the first playoff game of the Cowboys season and his career, Williams once again solidified his status as a playmaker by registering 3 receptions for 92 yards, while scoring 2 critical touchdowns against the Detroit Lions and their No. 2 ranked defense. This included a 76-yard catch-and-run in which he caught a 14-yard pass on a slant route and ran through 4 defenders en route to a 76-yard touchdown as well as the game-winning 8-yard score, Dallas won the game 24-20. In the next playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, Williams drew a pass interference in the first quarter that led to a touchdown and also scored on a 38-yard touchdown reception, but he was a non-factor in the second half of the game, in which the Cowboys lost 21‚Äì26. 2015 season Williams in 2015 With leading wide receiver Dez Bryant missing most of the season, Williams failed to show that he was ready to be a number one receiver, which was complicated by the fact that he played with 4 different starting quarterbacks with varying degrees of knowledge of the team's offense. Williams had a career-game statistically in the season finale against the Washington Redskins, making 8 receptions for 173 yards in a 34-23 loss with Kellen Moore as the starting quarterback. He only had two games where he registered over 80 receiving yards and finished with a total of 52 receptions for 840 yards and 3 touchdowns. 2016 season In the Cowboys' 2016 home opener against the New York Giants, Williams caught the ball near the end of the game but didn't run out of bounds allowing the Giants to win the game 20-19. Williams caught his first touchdown of the season against the San Francisco 49ers in a 24-17 victory during Week 4. In the regular season finale on January 1, 2017, against the Philadelphia Eagles, Williams caught a touchdown on what would prove to be the final play of Tony Romo's career. Williams finished the season with 44 receptions for 594 yards and 4 touchdowns. In the postseason against the Green Bay Packers, Williams caught four passes for 68 yards. The Cowboys lost 31‚Äì34. 2017 season On March 10, 2017, Williams signed a four- year, $17 million contract extension with the Cowboys. He played in all 16 games with 14 starts, recording a career-high 53 receptions with 568 yards and no touchdowns. 2018 season Williams was limited during training camp while recovering from offseason foot surgery. He played in the first three games of the season before aggravating the foot injury. He was placed on injured reserve on October 6, 2018. On October 18, 2018, he was suspended for three games by the NFL for breaking the substance abuse policy. On February 18, 2019, the Cowboys declined the option on the final year his contract, making Williams a free agent at the start of the new league year. = St. Louis BattleHawks = In October 2019, he was selected by the St. Louis BattleHawks in the 2020 XFL Supplemental Draft.

McAree spent four largely uneventful seasons with Fulham, but scored a vital winning goal in the final minute against Carlisle United, which eventually led to Fulham's promotion. Despite only playing a handful of games, McAree became a cult hero, and his name is still occasionally sung by Fulham fans. In 2000, McAree returned to Northern Ireland, signing for Glenavon making 33 league appearances and scoring 3 goals. In 2002, he joined his hometown club, Dungannon Swifts, who were then managed by his father Joe, who later became chairman.

He was a youth team player at Brussels, Anderlecht and Lille, going on to play in the reserve team of the latter. In 2012, he joined Zulte Waregem, and was a regular player as they finished runners-up of the 2012‚Äì13 Belgian Pro League. After that he was signed by Wolfsburg of the Bundesliga on a five-year contract, loaning him back for the first season before recalling him. He also represented Belgium up to under-21 level. Malanda died at the age of 20, when a car in which he was travelling crashed in northern Germany, killing him instantly. The accident was attributed to excessive speed and wet conditions. Over 1,000 mourners attended his funeral at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in his native Brussels. Club career =Early career= Formerly of the youth teams of the Belgian clubs RWDM Brussels FC and R.S.C. Anderlecht, Malanda joined French Ligue 1 club Lille OSC in 2007.

Matroid minors are closely related to graph minors, and the restriction and contraction operations by which they are formed correspond to edge deletion and edge contraction operations in graphs. The theory of matroid minors leads to structural decompositions of matroids, and characterizations of matroid families by forbidden minors, analogous to the corresponding theory in graphs. Definitions If M is a matroid on the set E and S is a subset of E, then the restriction of M to S, written M S, is the matroid on the set S whose independent sets are the independent sets of M that are contained in S. Its circuits are the circuits of M that are contained in S and its rank function is that of M restricted to subsets of S. If T is an independent subset of E, the contraction of M by T, written M/T, is the matroid on the underlying set E ‚àí T whose independent sets are the sets whose union with T is independent in M. This definition may be extended to arbitrary T by choosing a basis for T and defining a set to be independent in the contraction if its union with this basis remains independent in M. The rank function of the contraction is r'(A) = r(A \\\\cup T) - r(T). A matroid N is a minor of a matroid M if it can be constructed from M by restriction and contraction operations. In terms of the geometric lattice formed by the flats of a matroid, taking a minor of a matroid corresponds to taking an interval of the lattice, the part of the lattice lying between a given lower bound and upper bound element. Forbidden matroid characterizations Many important families of matroids are closed under the operation of taking minors: if a matroid M belongs to the family, then every minor of M also belongs to the family. In this case, the family may be characterized by its set of \\"forbidden matroids\\", the minor- minimal matroids that do not belong to the family. A matroid belongs to the family if and only if it does not have a forbidden matroid as a minor. Often, but not always, the set of forbidden matroids is finite, paralleling the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem which states that the set of forbidden minors of a minor-closed graph family is always finite. An example of this phenomenon is given by the regular matroids, matroids that are representable over all fields. Equivalently a matroid is regular if it can be represented by a totally unimodular matrix (a matrix whose square submatrices all have determinants equal to 0, 1, or ‚àí1). proved that a matroid is regular if and only if it does not have one of three forbidden minors: the uniform matroid U{}^2_4 (the four-point line), the Fano plane, or the dual matroid of the Fano plane. For this he used his difficult homotopy theorem. Simpler proofs have since been found. The graphic matroids, matroids whose independent sets are the forest subgraphs of a graph, have five forbidden minors: the three for the regular matroids, and the two duals of the graphic matroids for the graphs K5 and K3,3 that by Wagner's theorem are forbidden minors for the planar graphs. The binary matroids, matroids representable over the two-element finite field, include both graphic and regular matroids. Tutte again showed that these matroids have a forbidden minor characterization: they are the matroids that do not have the four-point line as a minor. Rota conjectured that, for any finite field, the matroids representable over that field have finitely many forbidden minors.. A full proof of this conjecture has been announced by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle; it has not appeared. However, the matroids that can be represented over the real numbers have infinitely many forbidden minors.. Branchwidth Branch-decompositions of matroids may be defined analogously to their definition for graphs. A branch-decomposition of a matroid is a hierarchical clustering of the matroid elements, represented as an unrooted binary tree with the elements of the matroid at its leaves. Removing any edge of this tree partitions the matroids into two disjoint subsets; such a partition is called an e-separation. If r denotes the rank function of the matroid, then the width of an e-separation is defined as . The width of a decomposition is the maximum width of any of its e-separations, and the branchwidth of a matroid is the minimum width of any of its branch- decompositions. The branchwidth of a graph and the branchwidth of the corresponding graphic matroid may differ: for instance, the three-edge path graph and the three-edge star have different branchwidths, 2 and 1 respectively, but they both induce the same graphic matroid with branchwidth 1. However, for graphs that are not trees, the branchwidth of the graph is equal to the branchwidth of its associated graphic matroid.; . The branchwidth of a matroid always equals the branchwidth of its dual.. Branchwidth is an important component of attempts to extend the theory of graph minors to matroids: although treewidth can also be generalized to matroids,. and plays a bigger role than branchwidth in the theory of graph minors, branchwidth has more convenient properties in the matroid setting.. If a minor-closed family of matroids representable over a finite field does not include the graphic matroids of all planar graphs, then there is a constant bound on the branchwidth of the matroids in the family, generalizing similar results for minor-closed graph families.; . Well-quasi-ordering The Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem implies that every matroid property of graphic matroids characterized by a list of forbidden minors can be characterized by a finite list. Another way of saying the same thing is that the partial order on graphic matroids formed by the minor operation is a well-quasi-ordering. However, the example of the real-representable matroids, which have infinitely many forbidden minors, shows that the minor ordering is not a well-quasi-ordering on all matroids. Robertson and Seymour conjectured that the matroids representable over any particular finite field are well-quasi-ordered. So far this has been proven only for the matroids of bounded branchwidth.; . Matroid decompositions The graph structure theorem is an important tool in the theory of graph minors, according to which the graphs in any minor-closed family can be built up from simpler graphs by clique-sum operations. Some analogous results are also known in matroid theory. In particular, Seymour's decomposition theorem states that all regular matroids can be built up in a simple way as the clique-sum of graphic matroids, their duals, and one special 10-element matroid.. As a consequence, linear programs defined by totally unimodular matrices may be solved combinatorially by combining the solutions to a set of minimum spanning tree problems corresponding to the graphic and co-graphic parts of this decomposition. Algorithms and complexity One of the important components of graph minor theory is the existence of an algorithm for testing whether a graph H is a minor of another graph G, taking an amount of time that is polynomial in G for any fixed choice of H (and more strongly fixed-parameter tractable if the size of H is allowed to vary). By combining this result with the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem, it is possible to recognize the members of any minor-closed graph family in polynomial time. Correspondingly, in matroid theory, it would be desirable to develop efficient algorithms for recognizing whether a given fixed matroid is a minor of an input matroid. Unfortunately, such a strong result is not possible: in the matroid oracle model, the only minors that can be recognized in polynomial time are the uniform matroids with rank or corank one. However, if the problem is restricted to the matroids that are representable over some fixed finite field (and represented as a matrix over that field) then, as in the graph case, it is conjectured to be possible to recognize the matroids that contain any fixed minor in polynomial time.

Background  Poster of a demonstration connected to the 8 March 2017 strike in Turin (Italy). Women and girls perform nearly two-thirds of the work in most given households. This work includes physical labor such as washing dishes, doing laundry, vacuuming, etc. but also emotional labor such as sending out birthday cards, organizing family vacations, preparing for holidays, etc. Much of this work in the household, while at times is referred to as a ‚Äúsecond shift,‚Äù remains unpaid. It is also not included in a country's Gross National Product or Gross Domestic Product, although women's unpaid labor is estimated at nearly $11 trillion. Many of the women engaged in this campaign argue that a large portion of this problem can be traced back to the military-industrial complex. Over $1 trillion a year is spent on the military worldwide, owing a large portion of this spending to the United States. If 10% of this money was circulated back into the community, it could be used to provide essentials for living: water, basic health care, sanitation, nutrition programs, literacy programs, minimum wage. The Global Women's Strike, which is a result of the International Wages for Housework Campaign started by Selma James in 1972, seeks the recognition and payment for all caring work and the return of military spending to the community through a policy of ‚ÄúInvest in Caring, Not Killing\\".100 Women: Should mothers get living wage?, 23 October 2013 article on www.bbc.co.uk\\"Stop the world and change it: the global women's strike\\", The Guardian, 7 March 2000.

Its terms of service were similar to the Territorial Army of the UK. The Auxiliary Force India, which provided officers to the Army during World War II, was disbanded in 1947. The Nilgiri Malabar Bn., Auxiliary Force India Edmund Frank Boother is second from left (standing) and Gregory Ambrose is extreme right (standing). circa 1940's Eurasians of Peninsular India The first Europeans who came to India were the Portuguese, followed by the Dutch, British and the French. In 1498 Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut. Calicut was the capital of the Zamorin, the most powerful ruler in south-west India. Portuguese women in the east were few in number, and Portuguese men began to live with local women. The Portuguese, Dutch and British instituted systems of encouraging their men to marry local women, paying a gold mohur for each child born of such unions. This young generation was seen as a cornerstone, a bulwark of empires. European settlements in India The Portuguese used the term mestico from about 1546. The British introduced the derisive term half-caste from about 1789. According to Edgar Thurston 'The influence of the various European nations-Portuguese, Dutch, British, Danish, and French-which have at different times acquired territory in peninsular India, is clearly visible in the polyglot medley of Eurasian surnames.' Later in the nineteenth century Eurasian took its place until the official acceptance of Anglo-Indian as the community name in 1911. The descendants of these Eurasians who came to be known as Anglo-Indians constituted the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion. Nilgiri and Malabar The Nilgiris Two main mountain systems of Southern India are respectively called the eastern & western ghats, which include between them the great table land of the Deccan and Mysore, and meet at an angle in the Nilgiri Hills. The name Nilgiri or Blue Mountains (nila-giri)is probably derived from the blue haze, which hangs over the hills when viewed from the distant plains. The ghats of the Nilgiris lead to the plains of Malabar and Coimbatore. Malabar The name Malabar in Malayalam means the hill country.The first two syllables are almost certainly the ordinary Dravidian word mala (=hill, mountain) and bar is probably the Arabic word barr (=continent) or the Persian word bar (=country). Calicut was the headquarters of the British District of Malabar. The district of the Nilgiris (Nilgiris District) and the district of Malabar (Malabar District) were part of the Madras Presidency. Origins Cannanore, Efficiency Decorations awarded for meritorious service. The Volunteer Force in India came into organized existence in 1860. Besides the regular European and Native military forces, the Europeans and Eurasians of civil life formed volunteer regiments. The Nilgiri Malabar Battalion began life as the Nilgiri Volunteer Rifles in October 1878. In 1892 it incorporated the Coimbatore Volunteer Corps (formed August 1885). Spoons were often awarded as prizes in regimental and other competitions. Some spoons were made of silver, others Electro-Plated Nickel Silver featuring regimental designs. This Spoon awarded to Pte. Edmund Frank Boother of Calicut has the Regimental Sign of the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion, Auxiliary Force, India. In 1885 the European and Eurasian inhabitants of Calicut organised themselves into two companies of Volunteer Rifles. These companies and others located at Tellicherry, Wayanad and Cochin, with a section at Palghat and numbering altogether about 300 men, were amalgamated into the ‚ÄúMalabar Volunteer Rifles‚Äù under a Major Commandant with headquarters at Calicut., Appendix XXI. With Calicut as its headquarters, the regiment recruited mainly from the populous Eurasian community, and has detachments at Cannanore, Tellicherry and Cochin. The Malabar Volunteer Rifles was formed on 14 August 1885, from the Calicut and Tellicherry Volunteer Corps and was amalgamated as the 29th Nilgiri Malabar Battalion on 1 April 1917. The badge was a stag's head inside a garter inscribed 'Auxiliary Force India'. A crown was above, the wreath was coconut palm and the scroll below read 'Nilgiri Malabar Battalion'. The battalion uniform was khaki and their HQ base was at Ootacamund the headquarters of the Nilgris district. Operations Second Dorsets deployed at Malabar in 1921 jointly with other Auxiliary Forces India, including the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion, quelled the Moplah Rebellion The Moplah Rebellion, which remained confined to Ernad, Walluvanad and Ponnani taluks of South Malabar, began in August 1921. Following an incident in Pookhottur village a major rebellion broke out with the government deploying the army to take control of the civil administration. Between August and November there were two major battles between the Moplahs and the armed forces. By the end of December 1921, the Moplah Rebellion was completely suppressed. Four officers along with hundred and eighty four men of The Nilgiri Malabar Battalion were part of the armed forces unit that quelled the Moplah Rebellion of 1921. Members of the Cannanore and Tellicherry detachments of the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion took part in a combined Naval and Military exercise in December 1924 at Cannanore. Lord Goschen, Governor of Madras Presidency (1924‚Äì29), inspected the annual camp of exercise of the Nilgiri Malabar Battalion at Podanur in 1925.Pioneer Mail and Indian Weekly News, Volume 52, 1925, p. 1. During the Second World War members of the Auxiliary Force (India) continued to function as part-time soldiers while contributing to the war effort by carrying on their normal occupation. The Nilgiri Malabar Battalion was disbanded together with all Auxiliary Force regiments following partition and India's independence in 1947 .

Although not released as a single, the song reached #35 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The political overtones of the song represent the beginning of the political activism that would recur throughout much of Sting's and the Police's subsequent music. Theme The theme of the song is the divide between rich and poor. It was one of the first politically themed songs the Police released, and the first that Sting wrote. Sting was inspired to write the song while on tour in the United States in 1979 after seeing the plight of starving children in Biafra on television. Sting has stated that the title and song came to him because he was literally driven to tears by the show. The song asks questions but finds no answers. One line of the song refers to the fact that people can afford the technology to watch television, but not food for the starving children. Composition The song is in the key of A minor. It incorporates a powerful eight bar guitar solo by Police guitarist Andy Summers, one of his few solos on Zenyatta Mondatta. Author Erica Starr has described Stewart Copeland's drum playing on the song as \\"jerky\\" and \\"syncopated\\" but that the beats \\"float around with great ease,\\" noting that the song has \\"tremendous energy and forward momentum.\\" Rolling Stone critic David Fricke points to \\"Driven to Tears\\" as an example of The Police indulging \\"their love for reggae,\\" describing the song as \\"brooding.\\" Allmusic critic Chris True describes the song as a \\"midtempo reggae workout.\\" Author Chris Welch states that \\"Driven to Tears\\" \\"surges with an unstoppable anger.\\" Washington Post music critic Robert Hull claimed that the song \\"has the driving force of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.\\" Allmusic critic Chris True considers Summers' short guitar solo to be one of his best. Summers himself considered \\"Driven to Tears\\" one of the better songs Sting wrote that formed \\"the meat\\" of Zenyatta Mondatta. Live history A live performance (circa 1980) of \\"Driven to Tears\\" is the opening number of the film Urgh! A Music War. Sting played \\"Driven to Tears\\" at the Live Aid concert in 1985. He also released a live version on his solo album Bring on the Night in 1986. That version included a solo by saxophone player Branford Marsalis. A live version performed by the Police was released on the 1993 box set Message in a Box. The song was included in the setlist for Sting's 2014 \\"On Stage Together\\" concert tour with legendary artist Paul Simon.Paul Simon & Sting Houston Concert Review This rendition featured a guitar and a violin solo performed by Sting's accompanying musicians.

However, Mary aged slowly over time, and by World War II, she was an adventurous teenager who could participate in the war. By then, Little Mary Mixup had developed from a gag strip into an adventure strip that involved kidnappers, crooks, and a treasure hunt. However, the Sunday strips were separated from the daily continuity and continued to feature simple gags. The Sunday page also had a topper strip, All in the Family, drawn by Brinkerhoff. The topper ran from April 3, 1932 to July 21, 1940. The strip was distributed by Press Publishing (New York World) (1918-1931), World Feature Service (1931-1932) and United Feature Syndicate (1933‚Äì1957).

Background Elections for the city, district and regional councils of New Zealand have a fixed election date, unlike general elections. Under section 10 of the Local Electoral Act 2001, elections must be held on the \\"second Saturday in October in every third year\\" from the date the Act came into effect in 2001. The last local body elections were held on 12 October 2019. The next will be held on 8 October 2022. Local elections are mostly organised by district and city councils, with other organisations (for example the Electoral Commission, the Department of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Health) having peripheral roles. The elections determine the membership of district, city, and regional councils, as well as the elected parts of district health boards. In some places, licensing trusts and local boards are also voted for. Elections are held by postal voting. Under New Zealand law, those who are eligible to enrol (18 year of age, lived in New Zealand continuously for at least one year at some time, and are either a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident) must do so. People can vote in the area where they live, and it is up to voters to decide which address they consider their home (e.g. a student may choose to enrol where they live during term time, or their parents' place if they go home during the holidays). If a person owns property in which they do not live, they can also apply to be put onto the ratepayer roll for local elections. That is, an individual may be eligible to vote in more than one voting area for local elections.

The projects cover a range of themes and subjects in the Northwest and Seattle, with a particular focus on working people and their movements. The effort, particularly the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, has garnered praise for the breadth of primary and secondary resources made available and its joint creation by academics, community members and hundreds of students. It has been recognized as a model of digital and publicly engaged scholarship. Projects The primary projects in the series are the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, the Great Depression in Washington State Project, the Waterfront Workers History Project, the Labor Press Project, the Seattle General Strike Project, the Communism in Washington State Project and the Antiwar and Radical History Project. The Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia for the Pacific Northwest draws together the resources available on the other sites and adds additional information on workers from the many industries and communities of the region. Many of these resources are only digitized and available through the projects, having been culled from archival material and personal collections, and materials including the only known film of the 1919 Seattle General Strike and the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike are exceedingly rare. Impact The Projects have gained attention as a trailblazing initiative in public scholarship and engagement between the University of Washington and the Seattle community to record histories like Filipino Cannery Unionism and the Chicano Movement in Washington state that are largely unavailable elsewhere. A unique, collaborative process has also given community members greater control over content than traditional academic research and created more investment by students in their work. The impact of the Projects beyond the academic realm was demonstrated when Washington state law on neighborhood association covenants changed as a result of information brought to light on racially exclusive housing covenants that remained in neighborhood charters. In other cases, the projects have brought light to rarely studied topics, like the Seattle Black Panther Party. The local Chapter was one of the first founded outside Oakland and one of the longest-lived. The Civil Rights and Labor History Project unearthed material and conducted oral histories that form the largest body of material on any Party chapter in the nation, including the founding chapter in Oakland. All of the projects have been notable for the quantity of material made available online. The Labor Press Project hosts thousands of digitized articles from more than thirty different union and radical newspapers, and the Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia contains a day-by-day database of articles from the Northwest related to labor, covering the crucial periods of 1915-1919 and 1930-1939. Video oral histories are a key part of the projects, showing first-hand perspectives that are placed alongside original academic essays and digitized historical materials. The Projects have also focused on outreach to Washington's public schools, working with educators to design curriculums using the materials to teach students about the sometimes forgotten history of labor and civil rights in the Northwest and fulfill State requirements.

Nulst is typically heard after a preposition: \\"Zi'j woont op 'n Ulst\\", They live at 'n Ulst. is a historical Dutch hamlet which was incorporated into the village and municipality of Nieuwleusen (today in the municipality of Dalfsen). The northern part of Nieuwleusen is known as Den Hulst to this day. Location Den Hulst is located in the central north of the province of Overijssel. It is a built-up stretch along provincial motorway N377, itself called de Den Hulst where it traverses the locality. The locality predates the motorway, which was constructed along the trajectory of the former Dedemsvaart canal (parts of which still exist). Immediately north of Den Hulst is the municipality of Staphorst, where the Staphorst woods are located nearby. Hulsterplas lake, dug south of the Dedemsvaart when the canal was filled in, is part of Den Hulst, as is the northern end of Burgemeester Backxlaan, the street that connects it with the historical core of Nieuwleusen. West of Den Hulst, at the junction of the N377 and the A28 motorway, is De Lichtmis, the location of a historical sconce and today a hub of roadside facilities including a motel and restaurants. Early history and the Dedemsvaart References from the early 18th century make mention of \\"in Den Hulst, that is, at the Canal\\" and \\"at the Canal in the Oosterhulst\\". The canal in question is not the Dedemsvaart, which was started in 1809, but the earlier and smaller Beentjesgraven, a drainage channel a bit further north which still exists. The Oosterhulst is the present-day name for a stretch of the N377 motorway east of Den Hulst.Sterken Rzn, H. (1976), Ni'j luusen mien d√∂rpien, Nieuwleusen (p.14) In the first half of the 19th century the Dedemsvaart canal was constructed to transport peat on an east-west axis, from the moors in the eastern Netherlands to the more urban west, where the peat was burnt for fuel. The canal, which ran from Hasselt in the west to Gramsbergen in the east, had eight locks. Hamlets and towns grew up around the canal's locks and bridges. Den Hulst, which had twelve houses when the canal reached it, developed economic activity around the Dedemsvaart. Peat transporters who accompanied horse-drawn barges frequented caf√©s along the towpaths; Rijkman Wicherson's caf√© in Den Hulst was one such establishment.Sterken Rzn, H. (1976), Ni'j luusen mien d√∂rpien, Nieuwleusen (p.31) The Dedemsvaart's patron, Willem Jan baron Van Dedem, wrote about his canal: :\\"As early as the autumn of that year [1809, when construction was begun at Hasselt] the stretch to the Ligtmis inn was almost finished. A channel was dug as far as the hamlet of de Hulst and in 1811 the canal was navigable up to the Oosterhuizer field [some 7 km east of Den Hulst], a distance of about five hours on foot from Hasselt.\\"Willem Jan baron Van Dedem tot den Berg, Memorie, in: G.H. van Senden (1834), Leerrede ter inwijding van het Kerkgebouw en ter vestiging van de Gereformeerde Gemeente aan de Dedemsvaart, Zwolle: R. Boelens Jr. Den Hulst was located at lock number three and the Ommerdieker bridge. People living in Den Hulst were said to be living \\"an de vaort\\" (along the canal), just like residents of the town of Dedemsvaart which sprung up to the east. The south side of Den Hulst was called the \\"zaandkaante\\", the sand side, because of the sand towpath.Schoemaker-Ytsma, A.C.M. (2006), \\"Zo zegge wi'j det\\" van A tot Z! Woorden en gezegdes in het dialect van Nieuwleusen, Nieuwleusen: The Readshop J. Hilbrink (p.64) Traffic grew, and at the end of the 19th century a tram track was laid along the canal between De Lichtmis and Lutten. The steam tram took people from Den Hulst to the city of Zwolle until it became an antiquated form of long-distance transportation, when the tracks were removed. Den Hulst gradually merged with the settlement of Nieuwleusen to the south, which had its origin in peat cutting and agricultural activity. De Rollecate In 1913 a state college was founded in Den Hulst to train teachers in girls' education (specifically, landbouwhuishoud education, where rural women were trained in housekeeping, agricultural and horticultural tasks). The school was called Rollecate after baron Van Dedem's estate of that name, which he had made available to enable the founding of the college. Rollecate mansion had been built in Vollenhove around 1654-1655 and Van Dedem had moved it to Den Hulst in 1821, where he had a view of his canal. The school was led by pedagogue Theda Mansholt and later by Greta Smit. In 1930 the college moved to Deventer, and the mansion was torn down.Bartels-Martens, Gees (1997), Een rondje Nieuwleusen: Een bescheiden rondgang door de literatuur en geschiedenis van Nieuwleusen, Kampen: IJsselacademie (pp.97-101)Rollecate (accessed 18 August 2012) Union A building of the former Union bicycle manufacturing plant in Den Hulst In 1904, the Van den Berg brothers opened the Union bicycle manufacturing plant in Den Hulst. The company also included building materials and lumber plants and eventually branched into mopeds. It fast became Nieuwleusen's biggest employer. In its early years, Union printed \\"on the Dedemsvaart\\" or simply \\"Dedemsvaart\\" on its publicity material because people were more likely to be familiar with the canal than with the settlement of Den Hulst; this caused some to link the factory with the town of Dedemsvaart east of Den Hulst.Ni'jluusn van vrogger, volume 25, no. 4, December 2007 (pp.50-51) From the mid-seventies on, Union was plagued by mismanagement and conflicts between managers and employees. The old Union factory building was consumed by fire in 1979 in circumstances that were never cleared up.Interview with Lambert Likkel, former designer at Union (accessed 18 August 2012) The company went bankrupt in 2001 and was placed in the curatorship of social enterprise Larcom in Ommen. Union ceased to exist as a company when it was sold to the Dutch Bicycle Group in Schiedam in 2005.Union chronology (accessed 18 August 2012) The former Union premises are now used by several companies. Another large fire destroyed most of Union's former buildings in 2009.Canon van Nieuwleusen: Union Rijwielfabriek (accessed 18 August 2012) End of the Dedemsvaart canal After World War II, the Dedemsvaart canal lost its economic significance due to the rise in motorised land transportation. The 1960s saw large tracts filled and replaced with motorways, and in 1969, the Den Hulst canal was filled, although a tract just to the west in the neighbouring hamlet of De Meele is still open. As a result of the canal's disappearance, Den Hulst is now essentially a row of houses, farm houses and companies on either side of the motorway. The sand used for filling in the canal was obtained by excavating farmland just south of it, which was then converted into a small lake, the Hulsterplas. Nieuwleusen-Noord In the course of its integration into Nieuwleusen, Den Hulst came to be called Nieuwleusen-noord or noord (north), whereas the southern part of Nieuwleusen is called zuid (south). The Ommerdiek road that ran from north to south was rebaptised Burgemeester Backxlaan. The northern and southern parts of the village are today separated by sports fields and sports facilities. Both north and south have a concentration of retailers who organize separate cultural and commercial activities. A small market is held every Saturday and moves between north and south every half year. The name of the hamlet of Den Hulst is reflected in such names as Hulstkampenweg and Hulsterpad roads and retirement home de Hulstkampen.
