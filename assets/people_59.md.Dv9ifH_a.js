Dorfmann Productions. Directed by Edward L. Cahn, it stars David Bruce, Mary Marshall, Tommy Ivo, and Bruce Edwards. The story centers on an American Protestant man who believes he is tolerant of other religions and nationalities, but feels threatened by his Jewish colleague. As the film delves into the reasons for prejudice, he and other main characters realize that they are both perpetrators and victims of intolerance. The film concludes that only with faith in Christ, who loved all men equally, can prejudice be eliminated. This was the first PFC production to be released theatrically; it was also distributed to 30,000 denominational churches and schools, religious clubs, and unions in the United States and Canada. The $100,000 production budget was funded by 17 Protestant denominations and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. The film was said to be the \\"most popular\\" of the PFC's productions. Plot Co-workers Joe Hanson (David Bruce) (left) and Al Green (Bruce Edwards) in their office Doris Green (Barbara Billingsley) comforts her husband Al (Bruce Edwards) after he is transferred because he is Jewish Joe, Beth, and Joey Hanson settle into their new home in Springville, where Joe has found a job as production manager for the Baker company, and befriend their neighbors, the Greens. When Joe reports for work, he discovers that Al Green has been running the division until his arrival and, if Joe determines him fit, will earn a permanent position. Joe gives Al a lift home and when his car is blocked by the stalled car of a black man, they hear derisive calls of \\"nigger\\" from other drivers. Joe tells Al that he is a Scandinavian-American Protestant and is not prejudiced toward anyone. Al reveals that he is Jewish and often encounters intolerance. At home, Joe tells Beth that her new friends are Jewish and she should be careful what she says about them. When Joey asks, \\"What's wrong with Jews?\\" Joe tells him they are just like any other people. Pamphlets warning against the influence of \\"Negros, Jews and foreigners\\" appear in the town and the minister delivers a sermon urging his congregants to treat others with brotherhood and love. At work, Joe begins to feel that the talented Al is going to take over his job. He begins putting in a lot of overtime to take care of everything himself. During a home visit from the minister, Joey comes in after a fight, saying that he and his friends beat some \\"wops\\". Joe is horrified by Joey's behavior, wondering where it came from. The minister explains that prejudicial attitudes begin in childhood, and urges Joe to think of his own youthful experiences. Joe now remembers his mother complaining about foreigners competing for his father's job, and how he also lost a delivery route to a Jewish boy. He further remembers being tackled by a Jewish classmate in a football game and being convinced by the others that the \\"dirty Jew\\" cheated. The minister now explains to Joe that all prejudice and scapegoating stem from personal insecurity and fear. When Joe's boss asks him about Al's work performance, Joe replies that although he himself doesn't feel this way, others in the company might not be comfortable working with a Jew. The boss decides to transfer Al to another division for the good of the company. In the Green home, Al's wife consoles him but he maintains that Jews will always suffer prejudice. Meanwhile, in the Hanson home, Beth realizes to her horror that Joe had something to do with Al's transfer. Joey comes in crying that other children are calling him a \\"dumb Swede\\". Joe realizes that prejudice is everywhere, and can play both ways. The minister delivers another sermon in which he advises that to overcome prejudice, one must strengthen his faith in Christ, who loves all men equally. This will imbue him with personal security and dignity, and eliminate his fear of others. Joe drops off Joey and Ellen Green at their school and watches a group of children taunt Ellen, calling her \\"Jew\\". Joe drives away with conflicted feelings, hearing the minister's words in his head. Finally he works up the nerve to admit his prejudicial statement to his boss and ask him to reinstate Green as his assistant. Cast *David Bruce as Joe Hanson *Mary Marshall as Beth Hanson *Tommy Ivo as Joey Hanson *Bruce Edwards as Al Green *Barbara Billingsley as Doris Green *James Seay as minister *Joseph Crehan as J. P. Baker *Sharon McManus as Ellen Green ProductionDevelopment= Prejudice was the third film released by the Protestant Film Commission (PFC), established in 1945. The $100,000 production budget was underwritten by 17 Protestant denominations and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. The script, from an original story by Jarvis Couillard, drives its point home by having characters use many ethnic slurs, including \\"nigger\\", \\"wops\\", \\"dagoes\\", \\"dirty Jew\\", and \\"dumb Swede\\". =Casting= The cast largely consisted of established film actors. This was the film debut of Mary Marshall, wife of actor Alan Marshall. =Filming= Filming began on August 9, 1948, at Nassour Studios in Los Angeles. Release On October 17, 1949, the film had its New York premiere at Town Hall in Manhattan under the sponsorship of the Protestant Council of the City of New York. The opening included speeches by \\"representatives of the three major faiths and Negro groups\\". The film simultaneously premiered in London, with sales and distribution of 35-mm prints for theatrical release handled by the Motion Picture Sales Corporation. On October 18, the film had its non-theatrical premiere in 100 churches in the United States and Canada. 16-mm prints were subsequently made available for rent to approximately 30,000 denominational churches in the United States and Canada, schools, religious clubs, and unions. According to the New York Daily News, Prejudice was the first film produced under \\"exclusively religious auspices to receive commercial distribution\\". Reception Lindvall and Quicke quote a contemporary review by N. F. Forsyth which stated, \\"Whether the person involved is a Jew, Negro, Swede or person of any other national background, he both displays and is in turn the object of prejudice. ‚Ä¶ While audiences will find it interesting enough, it will not be a pleasant picture to see\\". Daily Variety predicted that the film \\"will prove acceptable fare in churches, clubs, schools, etc. When it comes to selling it to theatres, however, distributors will likely bump into the answer 'another film which tries to capitalize on intolerance'\\". Variety was critical of the script and pacing, stating that it \\"suffers from punching too hard, too directly and too repetitiously. The story elements are developed without plausibility, serving only as an obvious peg for several long sermons which are used as a substitute for dramatic situations. General production values also suffer paradoxically from a slickness which lessens the impression of sincerity\\". Prejudice was later said to be the \\"most popular\\" film released by the PFC. It continued to be shown to both Christian and Jewish audiences for several years. In 1951, for example, a free screening followed by an interdenominational panel discussion, sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League with invitations extended to the public and members of 200 organizations, was held in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in conjunction with Brotherhood Week. That same year, the film arrived in Australia through the Australian Religious Films Society, which planned to distribute it to church and other non-Jewish organizations.

A French frigate division, departing Brest, met two British 74-gun ships of the line. The frigates tried to flee their stronger opponents, which gave chase. One of the frigates sacrificed herself to allow the others to escape.  Background  The War of American Independence had started in 1776, increasing tension between England and France. French support for the American insurgents and British provocations against French ships finally triggered the Anglo-French War in 1778. French fleet sailed to America under Orvilliers and Estaing. In 1781, another expedition was preparing under Grasse. Frigates served as reconnaissance screens for the squadrons, but between major movements, they would often cruise independently to engage in commerce raiding.  Battle  On 3 January 1781, a frigate division departed Brest to cruise at the entrance of the English Channel. It comprised the 32-gun frigates Fine, under Tanouarn, and Minerve, under Grimouard, as well as the lighter 26-gun Diligente and Aigrette. In the morning of 4, in heavy weather, the division detected the British 74-gun HMS Valiant and Courageux, under Mulgrave, and the frigate tried to escape. At 1330, Courageux caught up with Minerve and engaged. Grimouard was wounded in the battle, and Lieutenant Villeneuve took over. One hour later, Valiant also engaged Minerve, which then struck her colours. After Minerve surrendered, Valiant chased Fine, which successfully escaped.  Aftermath  Courageux had sustained serious damage to her rigging, and had change her bowsprit, foremast and mizzen to repair. Fine went on to serve in the Indian Ocean in the squadron under Suffren.

The station bears this name (derived from nearby Porta Nolana) since 2003; previously the station was simply called Napoli, although it was known colloquially as Napoli Terminale.  History  The station was opened for operation in 1843, as the Neapolitan terminus of the line for Caserta. It was built immediately north of the Bayard company station, the terminus of the railway to Salerno. The two stations were connected by a connecting track. Following the concentration of the two railway lines in the new station of Napoli Centrale (1867), Porta Nolana station lost its function as a passenger terminus, downgraded to a service facility. Some years later the station passed to the Societ√† Anonima Ferrovia Napoli‚ÄìOttaviano (the current Circumvesuviana), which used it as the terminus of the Naples-Ottaviano line, the first of a vast network. In 1904 the station became the terminus of the line for Torre Annunziata, and in the sixties of that for Baiano. The original traveler building, dating back to the Bourbon era, was demolished in the early seventies and replaced by the current one, built from 1972 to 1975 to a design by Giulio De Luca and Arrigo Marseille. The structure is in reinforced concrete with a cantilevered roof, and exposed concrete beams that protrude up to a certain point, and then become innervated in the roof. On the roof there is a reinforced concrete floor, connected to a glazed building that houses the various services and offices of the main headquarters of the EAV. The platform surface is raised by a few tens of centimeters, with a concrete roof supported by pillars of the same material.  Structures and installations  The Napoli Porta Nolana station has 13 trunk tracks all dedicated to passenger traffic (the Circumvesuviana has never had freight service), as well as a small garage for the electric trains temporarily not used.

Later that year she badly damaged a French destroyer in a collision at night while training. Bouvines returned to reserve status in 1912, but she was decommissioned the following year. Despite this, the ship served as a guard ship during World War I. Bouvines was condemned in mid-1918 and was sold for scrap in 1920. Design and description The Bouvines-class coast-defence ships were ordered in accordance with the 's belief in the primacy of coastal defences and commerce raiding.Ropp, p. 173 The ships were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. They displaced . Once in service they proved to roll badly so bilge keels were later fitted. The crew of the Bouvines class numbered 15 officers and 318 ratings; service as a flagship added 5 more officers and 33 more ratings.Sturton, p. 177 The Bouvines-class ships were powered by two inclined horizontal triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a propeller. Bouviness engines used steam provided by 16 d'Allest-Lagrafel water-tube boilers at a working pressure of that exhausted through two funnels. The engines produced a total of and gave a top speed of on trials.

The other four were carried on pivot mounts with gun shields on the shelter deck directly above the four casemated guns on the corners of the superstructure. Initially four Canon de Mod√®le 1885 Hotchkiss guns were carried for defence from torpedo boats in the fighting top in the military mast, but this was later increased to eight, with the new guns on the superstructure. Initially ten Hotchkiss revolving cannon were positioned on the superstructure, but this was reduced to three when the additional 47 mm guns were added. Two torpedo tubes were mounted above the waterline, but they were removed in 1906. The Bouvines class had a full-length waterline armor belt of steel that tapered from the maximum thickness of amidships to at the ships' ends. They were intended to have of the belt showing above the waterline, but they were overweight as completed and only of the belt was above the waterline. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was and it was joined to the top of the armor belt. The main turret armor was thick although the barbettes were only thick. The plates protecting the conning tower measured in thickness.Sturton, pp. 177‚Äì178 Construction and career A postcard of Bouvines Bouvines, named for the 1214 Battle of Bouvines,Silverstone, p. 91 was authorized in the 1889 Supplementary Naval Programme and was ordered from Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e on 18 December 1889. The ship was laid down on 30 September 1890 at their La Seyne- sur-Mer shipyard and launched on 29 March 1892. She was commissioned for preliminary trials on 15 October 1894, but excessive heating in her boiler rooms and funnels took some time to rectify and official trials did not begin until mid-1895. A premature detonation of a 47 mm shell during gunnery tests on 23 July killed two men and wounded two others, including Rear Admiral Chateauminois, President of the Trials Commission. Bouvines was fully commissioned () on 1 December. Her construction cost 14,986,587 francs. The ship arrived at Brest on 22 January 1896 and briefly became the flagship of Rear Admiral M√©nard, commander of the Second Battleship Division () of the Northern Squadron, on 1 February. M√©nard was replaced eight days later by Rear Admiral Charles-F√©lix-Edgard de Courthille. Bouvines had engine problems shortly afterwards and conducted trials on the 22nd. For the next year and a half, she spent her time at sea training in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, interrupted only by ferrying the President of France, F√©lix Faure, from Saint-Nazaire to Rochefort on 22 April 1897. De Courthille was relieved by Rear Admiral Auguste √âl√©onor de Penfentenyo de Kerv√©r√©guen on 10 October 1898 and transferred his flag to another ship when Bouvines was ordered to proceed to Toulon to be placed in reserve on 26 September. The ship was recommissioned on 15 December and became the flagship of Rear Admiral L√©once Caillard, commander of the Coast-Defence Division () of the Mediterranean Squadron. She conducted routine exercises off the coast of Provence in 1899 and Caillard was replaced by Rear Admiral Escande on 15 July, but he was relieved in his turn by Rear Admiral Charles-Alfred Mallarm√© on 1 September. Bouvines departed Toulon on 21 June 1900 together with the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron to participate in manoeuvres with the Northern Squadron in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay. From 22 July the division was attached to the Northern Squadron and based in Cherbourg with reduced crews. Bouvines in 1905 The crews were filled out to full strength in preparation for the following year's manoeuvres and gunnery exercises in the Mediterranean. The Northern Squadron departed Cherbourg on 20 June 1901 and returned on 13 August. Bouvines rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division on 1 September as the flagship of Rear Admiral Rouvier. The division was transferred to Brest in 1902 and then joined the rest of the Squadron for the annual manoeuvres in the Mediterranean on 30 June. The ship made port visits in Lisbon, Portugal, and French North Africa between exercises before returning to Cherbourg on 4 September. Over the next three years, she trained in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Rouvier was relieved by Rear Admiral Fran√ßois Leygue on 28 March 1904; Rear Admiral Joseph-Albert Philibert replaced him on 3 April 1906. The Northern Squadron joined with the Mediterranean Squadron for combined manoeuvres in the Eastern Mediterranean in mid-1906 and returned to Brest after the customary port visits on 28 August. The division arrived at Cherbourg on 5 October and Bouvines was reduced to reserve there on 1 January 1907.de la Loge d'Ausson, pp. 21‚Äì22 The ship was reactivated on 13 April 1910 as the flagship for the commander of the Channel Flotillas (). She was sent to Calais to assist with the salvage of the wreck of the submarine on 28 May. While conducting night training on 13 September, Bouvines collided with, and badly damaged, the destroyer . She was returned to reserve at Cherbourg on 1 June 1912 and was decommissioned on 1 July 1913. Bouvines was reactivated on 1 August 1914, just a few days before the French declaration of war on Imperial Germany. She served as the guard ship for Cherbourg until 1917. The ship was condemned and stricken from the navy list on 8 June 1918.

In 2014, Floyd moved to Minneapolis to help rebuild his life and find work. He was a truck driver and a bouncer, and lived in St. Louis Park. In 2017, he filmed an anti-gun violence video. From 2017 to 2018, he was a security guard for a Salvation Army facility. In 2019, George Floyd worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo club, where police officer Derek Chauvin also worked off-duty as a security guard. In 2020, Floyd lost his security job at a bar and restaurant affected by the COVID-19 pandemic rules, and in April of that year contracted COVID-19 himself, but recovered a few weeks later. Floyd had five children, including two daughters (aged 6 and 22 at the time of his death) and an adult son. He also had two grandchildren. A GoFundMe account to support Floyd's funeral costs and benefit his family broke the site's record for number of individual donations.  Death  On May 25, 2020, Floyd was arrested after allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood of Minneapolis. He died after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee to Floyd's neck for over eight minutes during the arrest. Floyd was handcuffed face down in the street, while two other officers further restrained Floyd and a fourth prevented onlookers from intervening. During the final two minutes, Floyd was motionless and had no pulse. Though the officers called for medical assistance, they took no action to treat him. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck as emergency medical technicians arrived. The official autopsy report classified Floyd's death as a homicide attributed to cardiopulmonary arrest caused by subdual and restraint. Fentanyl intoxication and methamphetamine use were listed as \\"significant conditions\\". A second autopsy, commissioned by Floyd's family and performed by Michael Baden, without access to various tissue and fluid samples, found that the \\"evidence is consistent with mechanical asphyxia as the cause\\" of death, with neck compression restricting blood flow to the brain, and back compression restricting breathing. After Floyd's death, protests were held globally against the use of excessive force by police officers against black suspects and lack of police accountability. Protests began in Minneapolis the day after his death and developed in cities throughout all 50 U.S. states and internationally.  Memorials and legacy  The carriage carrying Floyd's casket to his burial in Pearland, Texas, June 9 alt=Large area of sidewalk covered in flowers and other tributes beside a building with a mural painted on the wall George Floyd mural created by protesters in Portland, Oregon Several memorial services were held. On June 4, 2020, a memorial service for Floyd took place in Minneapolis with Al Sharpton delivering the eulogy. Services were planned in North Carolina with a public viewing and private service on June 6 and in Houston on June 8 and 9. Floyd was buried next to his mother in Pearland, Texas. Colleges and universities which have created scholarships in Floyd's name included North Central University (which hosted a memorial service for Floyd), Alabama State, Oakwood University, Missouri State University, Southeast Missouri State, Ohio University, Buffalo State College, Copper Mountain College, and others. Amid nationwide protests over Floyd's killing, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and his wife Patty Quillin made a $120 million donation to be split equally among Morehouse College, Spelman College and the United Negro College Fund. The donation was the largest ever made to historically black colleges and universities. Street artists globally created murals honoring Floyd. Depictions included Floyd as a ghost in Minneapolis, as an angel in Houston, and as a saint weeping blood in Naples. A mural on the International Wall in Belfast commissioned by Festival of the People (F√©ile an Phobail) and Visit West Belfast (F√°ilte Feirste Thiar) featured a large portrait of Floyd above a tableau showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck while the three other officers turn their backs and each covers his eyes, ears, or mouth in the manner of the Three Wise Monkeys (\\"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\\"). One Houston mural is on the side of Scott Food Mart in the Third Ward, \\\\- Full names from: while the other is on the property of The Breakfast Klub restaurant in Midtown. By June 6, murals had been created in many cities, including Manchester, Dallas, Miami, Idlib, Los Angeles, Nairobi, Oakland, Strombeek-Bever, Berlin, Pensacola, and La Mesa. A bill proposed by US Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, the George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, was designed to reduce police brutality and establish national policing standards and accreditations. The length of time that Chauvin was initially believed to have had his knee on Floyd's neck, eight minutes 46 seconds, was widely commemorated as a \\"moment of silence\\" to honor Floyd. Floyd's death was featured prominently in The Economist, with the magazine running an obituary, multiple articles, and numerous reader letters, ultimately making the legacy of his death its June 13 cover story. It wrote that his legacy \\"[is] the rich promise of social reform.\\" On September 18, 2020, the Minneapolis City Council approved designating the section of Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th Streets as George Perry Floyd Jr. Place, with a marker at the intersection with 38th Street where the incident took place. On 6 October 2020, Amnesty International wrote a letter with one million signatures from around the world to the US Attorney General William Barr to demand justice for George Floyd. The human rights advocacy group demanded that the police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd be held accountable.

The bishop advocated monenergism at the beginning of the monothelite controversy. Theodore wrote in Greek. His major work is the Preparation, which seeks to reconcile the terminology of Cyril of Alexandria (d. 441) with the canons of the Council of Chalcedon (451) as against the interpretations of the anti-Chalcedonian monophysites. It is divided into two parts. The first is a list of heresies of Christology from Mani to Severus of Antioch with their refutations, wherein he attacks the views of Julian of Halicarnassus and presents Chalcedonianism as a middle ground between monophysitism and Nestorianism. The second is a philosophical presentation of Chalcedonian Christology in the tradition of Greek dialectic. Theodore may also be the author of the treatise On Sects, which is usually attributed to Leontius of Byzantium in the manuscripts. It also survives in a Georgian translation and has also been attributed to Theodore Abu Qurrah.

The campaign in June ‚Äì July 1964 was led by Robert Hayling, Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Hosea Williams, C. T. Vivian, Fred Shuttlesworth, among others. St. Augustine was chosen to be the next battleground against racial segregation on account of it being both highly racist yet also relying heavily on the northern tourism dollar. Furthermore, the city was due to celebrate its 400th anniversary the following year, which would heighten the campaign's profile even more. Nightly marches were organized to the Slave Market, which were regularly attacked and the marchers were beaten. Meanwhile, the civil rights bill was being filibustered in the U.S. Senate. On June 10, the filibuster collapsed. The following day, King was arrested in St. Augustine. King had attempted to be served lunch at the Monson Motor Lodge, but the owner, James Brock‚Äîwho was also the president of the St. Augustine Hotel, Motel, and Restaurant Owners Association‚Äîrefused to serve him. King was arrested for trespass and jailed; while imprisoned, he wrote a letter to leading Jewish reformer, Rabbi Israel Dresner, urging him to recruit rabbis to come to St. Augustine and take part in the movement. This they did, and at another confrontation at the Monson, 17 rabbis were arrested on June 18. This was the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history. At the same time, a group of black and white activists, protesters who had arrived from Albany, Georgia, JT Johnson, Brenda Darten, and Mamie Nell Ford, jumped into the Monson's swimming pool. Brock‚Äîby now on edge from the constant picketing of his business‚Äîappeared to pour hydrochloric acid into the pool to burn the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool in everything but his shoes to arrest them, made headline news around the world. By now the Civil Rights Act had been passed, but St. Augustine businesses‚Äîparticularly in the restaurant and culinary trades‚Äîwere slow at desegregating. Eventually the courts forced Brock and his colleagues to integrate their businesses, and soon after he did, the Monson was firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), who violently opposed desegregation. The state judge was unsympathetic to his predicament, however, feeling that Brock and his colleagues had brought the violence of the KKK upon themselves; they had taken advantage of it while it was in their favor, and could not stop it now that it was not. On 30 June, Florida Governor Farris Bryant announced the formation of a biracial committee to restore interracial communication in St. Augustine. Although the Civil Rights Act had passed, there were further problems for both Brock personally and Florid particularly. He had been repeatedly refused bank loans to pay for the damage caused by the protests, and declared himself bankrupt the following year. Also in 1965, although the city celebrated its quadricentennial, there was still a palpable underlying racial tension; the tourist trade had been badly damaged and it has been estimated that St. Augustine lost millions of dollars in tourism. Hotel, motels, and restaurants were especially badly hit. BackgroundSCLC planning= The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) had decided to renew their campaign against segregation, and give \\"new dignity to the movement\\". The leadership was originally divided on where to target. James Bevel, for example, wanted to focus on one state‚ÄîAlabama‚Äîwhereas Hosea Williams advocated the Floridian seaside holiday town of St. Augustine. St. Augustine was approaching its 400th anniversary. Although much smaller than previous civil rights battlegrounds, such as Birmingham, Alabama, it was no less‚Äîand probably more‚Äîviolently segregated, argues author Jim Bishop. Unlike Birmingham, racial power lay not with the mayor and chief of police, he says, but in =Choosing of St. Augustine= For King‚Äîrecently named Time Magazine's Man of the Year‚Äîit was his preferred choice of \\"non-violent battlefield\\" for \\"expos[ing] Klan savagery to the eyes of the world\\". It was a highly segregated town, argues the author Thomas E. Jackson, and its celebrations would be restricted to whites only. It was deliberately chosen, continues Jackson, as it had \\"a business elite vulnerable to negative publicity because it was dependent on northern tourist dollars, a police force with close ties to the Klan, and a reputation for brutal extralegal violence\\". Social ethicist and theologian Gary Dorrien has described St. Augustine as Florida's \\"most violently racist city...a Klan stronghold policed by unabashedly racist thugs\\", where \\"Blacks who tried to enroll their children in public schools got their homes bombed\\". scholar Stephen B. Oates says of St. Augustine's law enforcement: However, suggests Webb, this was known to be a dangerous strategy. The Florida Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights informed them that St. Augustine was a \\"segregated superbomb...with an extremely short fuse\\". Law enforcement in St. Augustine, says David Chalmers, can be summed up in the response to the Klansmen who rioted and the blacks who trespassed: the formers' bonds rarely rose above , while the latter's could \\"run into thousands\\". The Mayor of St. Augustine has been described by scholar L. V. Baldwin as a \\"biblical fundamentalist who tolerated such lawlessness while insisting that 'God segregated the races when he made the skins a different color'\\". received advance warning of the SCLC plans, including that protesters would include figures such as Governor Peabody's mother. The Boston Globe asked the mayor whether he had ever heard of her; he had not. When asked what would happen if, during the protests, she violated segregation laws, the mayor replied, \\"if she comes down and breaks the law, we are going to arrest her\\". = James Brock = A \\"short, moustachioed man\\", the scholar David Garrow describes Brock as being \\"a relative moderate\\" in the St. Augustine business community, although personally a segregationist. Warren, similarly, has said that Brock was \\"a decent man caught between the violence of the Klan and the unwillingness of community leaders to find meaningful ways to end segregation\\", while Colburn says he was usually gregarious and \\"rather mild-mannered, religious man who suddenly found himself thrust\\" into a civil rights struggle. Chalmers suggest that, while he was willing to desegregate, \\"he dare not be the first\\". Brock later explained his position as he saw it: \\"if I integrated, there wouldn't be more than one Negro a month registered at the motel, but the first night I integrated, all my windows would be busted in\\". Prelude Beginning the campaign = A segregationist being arrested, June 1964; their bail bond was usually a fraction of their opponents' The campaign in St. Augustine effectively began on Easter Sunday, March 29, 1964, and was deliberately aimed at the city's food and tourism industries, which, argues sociologist Ralph C. Scott, \\"were as much about race as they were about national and class privilege\\". This was also the first, but not last, time that the Monson Motor Lodge, at 32 Avenida Menendez‚Äîa \\"big posh lily white\\" motel‚Äîwas to be targeted. Monson's was targeted because its owner, James Brock, was not only a prominent local businessman and president of the trade association, but the motel was regularly patronized by reporters, so was felt to provide easy access to the media. An interracial group, which included the 72-year-old mother of Massachusetts' Governor, Endicott Peabody, and the wife of that state's Episcopal Bishop, John Burgess, led by Reverend David Robinson, attempted to integrate the motel's restaurant. Peabody and Burgess and 37 others were arrested and the affair made national headlines. The mayor condemned the protests, not as local discontent over segregation, but the work of \\"scalawags\\" from the north. Colburn argues that \\"the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of this 72-year-old drew the nation's attention to conditions in St. Augustine as no other incident had. It was a watershed in the community's race relations.\\" It was not long before leading members of the SCLC‚ÄîVivian, Williams, Lee, Shuttlesworth and James Bevel‚Äîarrived in St. Augustine and launched workshops on non-violent militant protest. Focussing on local businesses, such as the Monson, would, the SCLC concluded, apply fiscal pressure on the business community and persuade the local whites to see the benefit to granting concessions, and by the end of May the motel was subject to almost daily sit ins. Jackson suggests that, as far as their strategy went, King and the SCLC had learned from the Birmingham campaign of the previous year that \\"vivid images of confrontation, with black and white protesters putting their bodies on the line against white supremacists moved the nation more effectively than inspired preaching or patient lobbying\\". To increase pressure on authorities, King and the SCLC turned to \\"wade-ins\\" to integrate public pools and beaches. In retaliation, large numbers of Ku Klux Klan (KKK) arrived in St. Augustine in droves and commenced drive-by shootings in black neighborhoods, as well as attacking demonstrations with iron bars and bicycle chains. By now, argues the historian Michael R. Belnap, St. Augustine was \\"slipping into chaos\\". Confrontations occurred by day and night; one occasion, King only narrowly managed to persuade the young men not to go home and fetch their guns; Brun suggests that \\"had they done so, St. Augustine would have gone down as the most violent racial battle in King's nonviolent movement\\". = Sit-in protest = King arrived in St. Augustine on Sunday, May 31, and stayed in Lincolnville, less than a mile from Monson Motor Lodge; Lincolnville was home to prominent leaders of the black community. This was to be King's only visit to Florida. Dorrien posits that he was deliberately kept out of St. Augustine by his colleagues as it was deemed too dangerous to risk his life there. At a strategy meeting he \\"spoke of touching white hearts with Christian non-violence\\". His audience, on the other hand, says Bishop, \\"wondered if King knew their town\\": white community leaders knew the SCLC's strategy. They also knew that bigger and stronger cities had eventually had come to agreements with King in return for peace on the streets. St. Augustine, though, was \\"prepared to die on its feet rather than truckle to King\\", comments Bishop. King had made a tactical decision to get arrested in order to intensify the struggle. As such, he intented to take part in a sit in at Monson Motor Lodge's, a traditional‚Äîand segregated‚Äîmotel and restaurant overlooking Matanzas Bay. At around 12:20, on June 11, King and his colleagues Ralph Abernathy, Bernard Lee, Clyde Jenkins, Will England, a white chaplain from Boston University, and five others arrived at the Monson for lunch. The SCLC had alerted the press to King's presence and several were there to witness King‚Äîwho wore a black badge with the word \\"equal\\" in white‚Äîarrive. The motel manager, James Brock, was also awaiting him on the welcome mat. Brock told his visitors that they were on private property. Although Brock tried to talk privately to King‚Äîwho introduced himself as \\"Martin King\\"‚Äîmicrophones were pushed between them. Newsmen jockeyed for position, amid shouts of \\"duck your head\\" and \\"get that flashgun down\\". The delegation attempted to enter the restaurant, but Brock told that the restaurant did not serve blacks. King said they would wait until it did, and some of those with him began a sit in. Brock's and King's conversation was polite. The manager told King and his party, \\"we can't serve you. We're not integrated.\\" He did state, though, that he would give them entrance should either they present \\"a federal court order or if a group of St. Augustine businessmen prevail upon me\\". Their discussion lasted around 15 minutes; Scholar David Colburn describes there being something of a carnival atmosphere to King and Brock's encounter, particularly as King responded with sermon-like replies. Brock eventually asked King and his party to leave, but, argues Colburn, King \\"had no intention of leaving. He was there to be arrested.\\" Their conversation ended with Brock beginning to lose his temper, demanding of King, \\"will you take your nonviolent army somewhere else? I have already had 85 people arrested here.\\" To this King replied, \\"we'll wait in the hope that the conscience of someone will be aroused\\". Abernethy asked why Brock had a sign welcoming tourists such as themselves. Brock publicly told King that the only blacks allowed on the premises were servants of white patrons, who allowed them to eat in the service area. In response, King asked Brock, if he understood \\"the humiliation our people go through\\". Brock, in turn, appealed to King to see it from his point of view. As a respected local businessman, he argued, it would damage him and his social position if he allowed black people into his restaurant. Asking that King understand Brock's responsibilities to his family, he announced to the gathered reporters \\"I would like to invite my many friends throughout the country to visit Monson's. We expect to remain segregated.\\" =Activist arrests= However, says Garrow, Brock was becoming \\"increasingly exasperated\\" with the situation, and appears to have called the police. In the meantime, other customers had arrived at the motel and, interrupting Brock' and King's discussion, a white customer asked if the restaurant was open yet. Brock replied in the affirmative, and the customer physically pushed his way through King's party, calling King a black bastard as he did so. At this point, the Chief of police Virgil Stuart and Sheriff L. O. Davis, arrived in possession of arrest warrant for breach of the peace, conspiracy and trespass against King and his colleagues. Brock, says Colburn, \\"breathed a sigh of relief\\". King and his companions were arrested under Florida's \\"unwanted guest\\" law. Branch describes how, then: King and his colleagues refused to post bail, which led automatically to their imprisonment in the crowded St John's County Jail. Fear of a jailhouse lynching led King to be moved to Jacksonville. Before he was sent there and wishing, says Branch, to \\"maintain the spirit of the St. Augustine movement\\", King wrote to Israel \\"Sy\\" Dresner in New York, who, as a 1961 Freedom Rider, had supported King on a previous occasion, requesting him to come to St. Augustine and act as an independent witness to events: King also telegraphed Johnson to tell him that he had witnessed \\"most complete breakdown of law and order since Oxford, Mississippi\\". Johnson replied to King's telegram and was keen to know if it pleased King, who was known to have been upset at having heard an unfounded rumor that Johnson was intending to drop his support for the Bill; Johnson also wanted King to know that the White House was in contact with the State Governor. While in prison, says Webb, King also \\"secretly testified\\" to a grand jury that he would prevent future night marches if a biracial commission were to be established. = Civil Rights Bill debates = Furthermore, comments scholar Dan Warren, a Civil Rights Bill was being filibustered before the Senate, which made King's arrests \\"particularly timely\\". The filibuster had been on-going for 75 days, and on the same night King was arrested, the Senate voted for cloture of the debate, the first time in United States history that the Senate had closed down one of its own debates on civil rights; the passage of the bill was now \\"virtually inevitable\\". It is possible, argues the scholar James A. Colaiaco that, \\"had the white population of St. Augustine continued to allow the demonstrators to march unmolested, the protest would have probably died out within a few weeks. But once again, SCLC provoked white racists\\". However, says Garrow, the situation was about to take \\"a turn for the worse\\". = Prison release and tensions = Ku Klux Klan rally in St. Augustine, July 23, 1964: Note Charles Conley Lynch in the Confederate flag vest, holding microphone King was released from jail the following day. Looking, according to Hayling, haggard and frightened\\", he refused to talk about his overnight imprisonment and left St. Augustine immediately, traveling first to Harvard University to collect an honorary degree and then to Washington, DC to be photographed with Johnson. King had ensured that \\"the nation's attention would be focused on the brutal actions of the Klan and the adamant stand elected officials of St. Augustine had taken to prevent demonstrators from protesting segregation\\". Klan demonstrations continued over the next few days. On the 14th, Klansman, attorney, and leader of the newly- founded National States Rights Party J. B. Stoner spoke before a large crowd at the Slave Market, declaring that \\"tonight, we're going to find out whether white people have any rights! When the Constitution said all men are created equal, it wasn't talking about niggers. The coons have been parading around St. Augustine for a long time.\\" King was accused of being a \\"longtime associate\\" of communism, while the Supreme Court was \\"Jew-stacked\\". Accompanied by local Klan leader Charles Conley Lynch‚Äîwhose trademark costume, notes Garrow, was a \\"vest cut from a Confederate battle flag\\"‚ÄîStoner \\"claimed that African Americans were sexually depraved brutes more closely related to apes than humans...The two men evoked the Lost Cause as a means to rally white males in defense of their wives and daughters\\". The same day King was released from jail, a number of city business leaders met at the Monson. These included Herbert E. Wofe, head of St. Augustine's largest bank, four executives from the Fairchild Stratos corporation, and the mayor. The businessmen proposed to the latter that he support the creation of a committee to examine racial tensions in the city. This was not intended to have any black members, although, comments Bishop, \\"this oversight was called to their attention\\". The committee was then suggested to be a biracial one. The mayor, however, saw this as surrendering to the SCLC, and refused. The committee was, in any case, not indeed to have to negotiate with King or Abernethy, as it was deliberately phrased as wishing to deal with law-abiding locals. Nor, indeed, did they wish to talk to locals they had not chosen: Hayling, although local, was deemed not to pass the \\"law-abiding\\" criterion, having already been arrested. In the background, an offer had been made by the city authorities to set up a biracial commission comprising five blacks and five whites. This would investigate complaints regarding segregation in return for an end to the demonstrations and mass meetings; it was supported by the SCLC as a fair compromise, and at a secret meeting of St. Augustine businessmen, the new committee was also endorsed. A Grand Jury was due to decide the issue over the next few days. = Protest meetings = On the evening of Wednesday, June 17, leading Reform rabbi Albert Vorspan and 16 colleagues from eight different states joined a mass-meeting in the St. Augustine Baptist Church, where King \\"announced their entrance to an enthusiastic crowd\\". Dresner addressed the crowd‚Äîthe only member of the delegation with experience of these meetings‚Äîin the form of a call and response sermon. The rabbis left the church and followed Fred Shuttlesworth, Andrew Young,‚ÄîKing's deputy in the town‚Äîand 300 others on a long march to the old St. Augustine Slave Market, which historian Clive Webb calls a \\"symbolic focus of protest\\" in St. Augustine. and then to the Monson Motel. The rabbis dispersed to the local homes where they being billeted, while King and his colleagues discussed strategy. Branch argues that it was originally Hosea Williams' idea to launch an integration against a swimming pool, with the aim of maintaining popular momentum. However, \\"Williams suffered a ribbing when he refused to lead one of his own wild schemes...Williams admitted he could not swim\\".  Protest Protesters enter the motel= Shuttlesworth and C. T. Vivian led a group of around 50 supporters to Downtown's Monson Motor Lodge at about 12:40 PM. King observed the operation from a waterfront park over the road; Again, Brock met the integrated group at the doors and again announced his was a segregated business. By now, suggests Colburn, after almost daily marches to and trespasses on his business‚Äîcombined with equal pressure from segregationists not to surrender‚Äîhad worn away Brock's usual calm and pleasant demeanor leaving his irritable and short-tempered. He had also received death threats. Warren has described it as being a \\"rather comical scene, arranged primarily for its news value\\", particularly due to Brock's \\"frantic, comical antics\\". Described by Branch as \\"normally a bookish and controlled businessman\\"‚Äîlocked the doors on the group on their arrival at 12:40 PM . = Jewish prayers = In an attempt to distract the motel authorities from the activists' plans at the rear of the building, Rabbi Israel S. Dresner led 15 colleagues in an open-air Hebrew prayer meeting in the parking lot. The rabbis requested Brock to allow them to enter his restaurant and eat, which he refused. He appears to have begun losing his temper when, on his refusal, the rabbis knelt to pray in his car park for him. At this, Brock‚Äîa Baptist deacon and a superintendent of the local Sunday School‚Äîlost control. By now the police were on the scene, and Branch describes Brock as pushing each kneeling rabbi, one at a time, towards them to be arrested. = Protesters enter pool = In the meantime, SCLC activists Al Lingo and J. T.Johnson, leading a group of supporters, attempted an integration: this time, a \\"dive-in\\". Again, the press had been alerted. Seven minutes after the rabbis' arrival at the front door, shouts from the swimming pool drew everyone. There, they saw a number of young people swimming together, both black‚Äîsix men and a woman‚Äîand white. Two white activists, both possessing room keys, indicating they were guests, stated that they had invited friends to use the pool, as they believed to be within their rights. =Brock's harassment of protesters= News cameras began rolling. Brock told the white swimmers \\"you're not putting these people in my pool\\", and‚Äî\\"with exaggerated gusto\\", suggests Warren‚Äîwent to his office and brought out a drum of muriatic acid into the pool. This was a cleaning fluid, and Brock was \\"screaming that he would burn them out\\", comments Branch. Brock also yelled that he was \\"cleaning the pool\\", a presumed reference to it now being, in his eyes, racially contaminated. Another report states that he also allowed an alligator into the pool. = Crowding and Dr. King's arrival = As they attempted to leave the pool, members of the straining crowd shouted numerous threats, including to shoot, stone or drown the swimmers and called for dogs. Police held them back; by now, suggest Branch, both police and civilians were \\"enraged at the sight of the intermingled wet bodies\\" and the audacity of it. Brock appears to have \\"lost his cool\\", and, weeping, shouted \\"I can't stand it, I can't stand it\\". King and his party approached the motel only to be surrounded by hecklers; Hosea Williams later recalled wanting to \\"get the hell out of there\\". Williams feared that, on account of his being unable to swim, they were going to throw him in the pool. = Arrest of protesters = Brock's attempt to force the protesters out did not work, and, impatient at the slow progress the swimmers were making in leaving the pool, Officer James Hewitt announced that they were all under arrest. An off-duty policeman, Officer Henry Billitz, jumped in‚Äîexcept for his shoes still fully clothed‚Äîin an attempt at dragging them out himself; he beat them up as well. Then-state attorney Dan R. Warren later wrote how, from his office in the courthouse, he heard a \\"near riot\\" taking place from the motel, which was \\"only a block away\\". By now there were over 100 people watching by the poolside. Colburn speculates that the SCLC's new integrationist tactics \\"had a greater impact than even they perhaps envisioned.\\" It also alienated the St. Augustine business community further; James Brock, for example, says Colburn, who had previously supported compromise, \\"conceded his attitude had changed as had those of his colleagues in the motel business\\". Whites were told that this was an example of the future if blacks were given more rights. alt=black and white photograph of the state governor, Bryant Three days before the integration, the State Governor, Farris Bryant had ordained that state officers took custody of those arrested under riot conditions. However, local officers were intermingled with them outside the motel, and notes Branch, one \\"overwrought local deputy reached over and around a trooper to pummel one arrested swimmer most of the way from the pool to a State Police cruiser\\". Still wet, they were arrested for trespassing. The arrest of Dresner and his fellow rabbis remains the record number of rabbis arrested on a single occasion. While in prison overnight, the rabbis composed a document they titled \\"Common Testament\\", which Rabbi Eugene Borowitz wrote on the back of a KKK leaflet. Following the rabbis' arrests, comments Bishop, \\"a wave of antisemitism swept through St. Augustine\\".  Aftermath Brock's reaction= Brock, suggests Branch, was \\"enraged [and] feeling betrayed on both flanks for his moderation, drained and refilled his pool to purify it of integration\\". He also hired armed guards for the swimming pool and raised the Confederate flag above the motel. It has been described as \\"one of the most significant events of the St. Augustine Civil Rights Movement\\". Business leaders, meanwhile, reversed their earlier support for the biracial committee on the grounds that intensifying protests went against the spirit of the proposal. They were particularly concerned, argues Garrow, that King had intended to, in his words \\"put the Monson out of business\\". After all, says Warren, Brock's entire business was focused around the Monson and repeated demonstrations threatened its profitability. =Official reactions= Two days after the integration, Bryant banned public demonstrations, but the violence continued unabated. The all-white grand jury summoned witnesses to the Monson integration and, instead of authorizing the biracial committee as had been expected, issued a new report. In this, they suggested that St. Augustine demonstrated \\"a solid background of harmonious race relations\\" with \\"a past history of non-discrimination in governmental affairs\\". Instead of granting the commission, the jury now attacked the motives of King and SCLC, asking whether they really wanted St. Augustine's issues solved; if they did, instructed the grand jury, King \\"and all others [were] to demonstrate their good faith by removing their influences from this community for a period of 30 days\\". If, after this period, King and the SCLC had done so, the jury said it would confirm the biracial commission. In the event, all its white members resigned, and the commission never met: Bryant, suggests Webb, had only ever intended the prospect of the commission to \\"expedite a resolution to the crisis\\". This was very much down to the Monson motel integration, argues Warren which, while it may have been intended as an almost-comic episode in the protest, \\"its impact on the jury's decision was anything but comical\\". =Beach protest= Segregationists trying to prevent blacks from swimming at a \\"White only\\" beach in St. Augustine, June 25, 1964 Segregationists, highway patrol and black demonstrators at a \\"white only\\" beach, June 25, 1964 The same strategy was repeated less than a week later when SCLC activists performed a \\"wade-in\\" at the whites-only St. Augustine beach. On this occasion, violence broke out when the protesters were attacked by segregationists and multiple arrests were made by Florida Highway Patrol officers. Armed gangs of both blacks and whites drove around shooting up cars and windows at night. =Civil Rights Act of 1964= However, on July 2 the same year, the Civil Rights Act was signed into United States Federal law, This effectively enforced desegregation: The Civil Rights Act was passed by the Senate the day after the Monson Motel swim-in. Jackson argues that, while the St. Augustine protest had probably been directly responsible for enabling the act to be passed, \\"locals had paid a heavy price\\". Unemployment went up as, not having security of employment, many were fired from their jobs. An SCLC official later reported that St. Augustine had been \\"the toughest nut to crack\\" that he had encountered in his career of direct action; King, too, called it the \\"most lawless\\" place he had campaigned it. = Desegregation of St. Augustine = Brock chaired a meeting of 80 local businessmen to decide how the business community would respond to the new act. Brock told reporters that although his colleagues were, to a man, opposed on principle‚Äî and although with \\"considerable unease\\", suggests Garrow‚Äîby a majority of 75, they agreed to abide by it. The unease stemmed from fears as to how the KKK would react to their adhering to desegregation, and he wrote to Judge Simpson requesting the aid of US Marshals from \\"the mob action that will undoubtedly occur\\". With the Johnson administration refusing the aid of federal marshals, says, Oates, \\"St. Augustine had become a nightmare\\" for King and the SCLC. On July 4, Brock, as the spokesman for the St. Augustine Hotel, Motel, and Restaurant Owners Association, stated that they \\"want[ed] to do everything we can to get our community back to normal with harmonious relations between the races\\". =Segregationist protests of the Monson Motor Lodge= On Thursday July 9, 1964, James Brock welcomed the first black guests to the Monson Motor Lodge restaurant. Visitors were greeted at the entrance by a picket line; the confederate flag flew and placards announced \\"Niggers Ate Here\\". Brock, suggests Warren, \\"would pay a high price for advocating harmony among the races\\", and the Monson was picketed daily from this point. Placards with slogans such as \\"gated establishments, carrying picket signs proclaiming \\"Delicious Food‚ÄîEat with Niggers Here\\", \\"Niggers Sleep Here‚ÄîWould You?\\" and \\"Civil Rights Has To Go\\" were prominent. Brock asked Stoner, who was on the picket, why the Monson had been targeted; Stoner told him, \\"we're just trying to help you get some nigger business\\". Blacks who attempted to eat at Monson were beaten before being driven away. =Re-segregation of the Monson Motor Lodge= By July 16, Brock had de-integrated, partly in order, argues Branch, to avoid punishment from local klansmen. If this was the case, however, his attempt failed; Branch notes that, while he remained on good terms with the local KKK, the Monson was still firebombed by an out-of-state gang. A few days later, the KKK held their biggest march yet, boasting that they had recruited significantly on the back of the pending Civil Rights Act. The SCLC had brought a case against around 30 St. Augustine restaurants and eateries in an attempt to force them to integrate. Warren recounts how Brock‚Äî\\"besieged operator of the now infamous Monson Motor Lodge\\"‚Äîpersonally testified to the court \\"his frustration in attempting to comply with the new law and demanded the court get Holstead Manucy and the picketers off his back\\". =Legal hearings= As a result, following a two-day hearing, Florida Chief Justice Simpson ordered that blacks be allowed to eat at two restaurants in St. Augustine. Holstead's testimony was punctuated by his pleading the fifth about 30 times on one day. The SCLC attempted to show that a conspiracy existed to prevented enforcement of the new law. Brock testified that when he had first begun serving blacks and had been picketed, he had asked Manucy to \\"get the[m]...off his back\\". When Manucy denied having that kind of influence, Brock had disbelieved him, saying \\"you are the kingfish with these people\\". However, he told the court, it had not done any good, and the Monson continued to be picketed. When Simpson pressed Brock to state who was with Manucy on these occasions, Brock requested that the judge not make him answer, telling Simpson, \\"you put me in an unpleasant position when you ask me this. I am a little bit afraid to be talking like this.\\" Simpson ordered Brock to receive a bodyguard for the remainder of the hearings. Simpson's judgment was as the first federal ruling under the new Act, a \\"landmark\\", argues Warren. All parties were ordered to refrain from further violation; Brock and his colleagues were to desegregate again in accordance with the law and \\"regardless of threats\\". Brock did so, despite threats from the KKK. On the evening of July 23, business leaders met at the Monson to discuss the legal options available to them. One strategy decided on was to allow themselves to be summonsed, as this might also persuade a judge to condemn the KKK picketing. The following morning, two white men threw a molotov cocktail into the lobby of the Monson, causing damage valued at around $(adjusted for inflation). For the rest of the day, comments Colburn, \\"those businesses who had not started turning blacks away now did\\". =Dr. King visits St. Augustine= On August 5, King returned to St. Augustine for the first time since his release from jail. He was concerned because the struggle there had taken a disproportionate amount of time and manpower, and, notes Bishop, \\"he was a man with a carefully planned schedule and the calendar of coming events was becoming crowded\\". =Segregationist backlash= The following day the Monson Motel was firebombed. Judge Simpson ordered Brock and his colleagues to obey the law and resegregate: this, argues Oates, \\"gave them the excuse of external coercion to take down the \\"WHITES ONLY\\" signs‚Äî\\"what else can we do?'\\", they could ask. Warren also describes Brock and colleagues as \\"pander[ing] to the Klan\\" by claiming \\"we're not capitulating to anybody...we had no other choice\\". Simpson also passed a restraining order against both Davies and Manucy. This quotes Oates, \\"ended their reign of terror and moved Abernathy to quip that the movement changed Manucy \\"from a Hoss to a mule\\". Not everyone was sympathetic to the St. Augustine business community. The State Attorney, James Kynes, watching from Tallahassee, had \\"little sympathy\\". He believed that businesses had encouraged white thugs to confront black picketers and demonstrators‚Äîif only through lack of protesting‚Äîso they could hardly now complain that the \\"monster\\" they had created \\"now ran amok in their city\\". Historian David Mark Chalmers agrees, believing that, had business leaders told the sheriff to intervene against the Klan, he probably would have had to. However, \\"community leaders who had been willing to countenance violence against black people and integrationists found that they were now unable to control it or turn it off\\". And they were publicly blamed for that failure. Webb, too, argues that silence implicitly equaled approval, particularly among restaurateurs, some of whom not only held KKK fundraisers but provided leading Klansmen and segregationists with free meals. Brock put out another association statement qualifying their support for the act: \\"We deplore the action of the Congress and the Courts in enforcing integration...integration of places of accommodation is obnoxious to us\\". Some of Brock's colleagues put signs above their tills informing patrons that money earned from black customers would be donated to Barry Goldwater's current presidential campaign, as Goldwater was known to be anti-integrationist. = Tourism downturn = The civil rights protests of June‚ÄìJuly 1964 nearly witnessed the destruction of the St. Augustine tourist trade, and a contemporary report declared that \\"the tourist trade is already off at least 50 per cent...and many a motel owner is threatened by bankruptcy and foreclosure\\". Jackson estimates that St. Augustine lost approximately 122,000 tourists and $(adjusted for inflation) as a result of the protests, which the historian Michael Honey has compared in their ferocity to those of Birmingham, Alabama and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. An investigative committee announced by the state legislature eventually‚Äîand, comments Warren, with a \\"remarkable lack of understanding\\"‚Äîvariously blamed King, the KKK, newspapers, and television, for racial problems that could otherwise \\"have been solved amicably by Negro and White citizens last summer had they been free from outside agitation.\\" The committee also declared that such was the ultimate cost of the events of 1964, that the taxpayers of St. Augustine had effectively paid for King's visit. Likewise, the SCLC campaign, argues Webb, failed to address the fundamental issues \\"of poverty and deprivation that afflicted the local black community\\". = Racial tensions = St. Augustine celebrated ins quadricentennial the following year. Tourists flocked, but there was a seething racial tension beneath the surface. Although the business community had changed its policies if not its attitude towards racial integration by 1965, Blacks were still unsure, generally, of where they stood and few dined out in white motels or restaurants. One later said = Brock's bankruptcy = Tourism helped the desperately in-need city economy; hotels and motels, in particular, were fully booked. Brock, however, did not do as well as he might have hoped. St. Augustine's main bank refused to provide financial cover, and Brock had been consistently refused bank loans to cover costs incurred during the pickets and demonstrations the previous year. On May 2, 1965, he declared bankruptcy, stating =Official report= Nearly two years after the original disturbances, in June 1965, the Florida investigative Committee published its report, titled Racial and Civil Disorders in St. Augustine. The committee was careful to share the blame equally between the Klan and the SCLC, in both cases emphasizing that it was \\"out of town\\", rather than resident, elements who had caused the trouble between them. Wade-ins and swim-ins remained a central tactic for Floridian blacks even after the passing of the Civil Rights Act, and laid the path of integrating other areas of society that were proving less than susceptible to change, such as green open spaces and schools.  Legacy  Jacksonville Courthouse named after him = Fate of the Monson Motor Lodge = Brock sold the Monson in 1998. The motel and pool were demolished in March 2003 following five years of protests, although not before its early modern foundations had been excavated. Those who disagreed with the proposed demolition argues that it would eliminate one of the nation's important landmarks of the civil rights movement. Author David Nolan told WJCT that \\"people would claim the motel had no historic significance, even though a large civil rights protest occurred there\\". The owner, a local property developer, wanted to build a new corporate hotel, while opponents believed it would be a useful target for drawing more black tourists to Florida, something the state was attempting to do. A city planner, on the other hand, commented \\"the Monson is not the only historical site [in St. Augustine]...This one just happens to have Martin Luther King involved\\". The Hilton Bayfront Hotel was built on the site, although the steps of the Monson‚Äîwhere Brock and King had their \\"quiet chat\\"‚Äîhave been preserved with a plaque to commemorate King's activism in the city. Brock, interviewed in 1999, stated that \\"I don't feel sorry for any of that stuff. I have nothing to be ashamed of\\", as he was obeying the law of the time. = Jewish commemoration = On June 18, 2015, the St. Augustine Jewish Historical Society commemorated the arrest of the rabbis 41 years earlier. The events, called \\"Why We Went to St. Augustine\\" included a public reading of the letter they jointly wrote in jail that night.  In photographs and film  A number of iconic photographs were taken during the integration. One, by an Associated Press photographer caught Officer Billitz in mid-jump as he leapt into the pool. This appeared the next day on the front pages of the Miami Herald and New York Times. Photographs of Brock pouring acid into the pool made international news headlines, as well as proving ammunition for what has been termed King's \\"war of images\\". This photograph has since been described as \\"infamous\\". Warren notes, too, that due to the distance film had to travel for processing and distribution, for an event to hit the ABC, CBS and NBC six o'clock news bulletins, it had to take place before noon; as the swim-in had taken place just before, it was guaranteed to be headline news that evening.

Bianco: 100 years of anarchist press  History  In the late 1960s, a new generation of militant anarchists appeared in Europe, disappointed by the European synthesis federations whose raison d'√™tre was to regroup all the tendencies of anarchism, which they saw as a purely ideological work. These militants began to cluster in trends within these old groups. In 1967 the libertarian communists, who had previously merged with other groups to form the Anarchist Federation (FA), regrouped to form an organized trend within it, the Anarchist Revolutionary Organization (ORA), which published a magazine called The Insurgent. The \\"Federacion Anarquista Comunista d'Occit√†nia\\" (FACO), Guy Malouvier in 1968, International dictionary of anarchist militants, photo was put together by Guy Malouvier, Joan-Pau Verdier and G√©rard Bodinier, after the events of May 68 saw the emergence of Occitan nationalism. Guy Malouvier,' 'National liberation struggles and social revolution' ', mentioned in the International dictionary of anarchist activists, notice. The \\"Anarchist- Communist Federation of Occitania\\" defended the idea of a \\"socialist federation of the regions\\" of Occitania and tried to link libertarian communism to national and cultural emancipation, breaking with the Jacobin order. Malouvier was a member of the ORA and created the FACO in principle as a branch of it. Organization r√©volutionnaire anarchiste In 1970 the ORA became independent of the FA. In 1971 Daniel Gu√©rin tried to unite the ORA with the Movement for the Struggle for Change (MLC). The two groups do not manage to merge but, a group of MLC militants joined the ORA while other ORA groups joined the MLC to form the first Libertarian Communist Organization (OCL-1). The FACO, meanwhile, withdrew from the ORA due to ideological disagreements, including the issue of nationality. FACO was made up of fifteen groups and up to a hundred activists. The organization led public meetings with other Occitanist groups, some of a Marxist tendency and other nationalist types like the Party of the Occitan Nation (PNO), but linguistically, FACO differed from other Occitan nationalists by their refusal to unify the language. Multiple different dialects were used in Occitania libertaria; Limousin, Gascon, Proven√ßal, etc.Summary of n¬∞1 online here and here. The emblem of the FACO was the red and black flag struck with the Occitan cross and the Star of F√©librige. At demonstrations, they marched with the other anarchist organizations. They also had sympathy for ETA, at war with Francoist Spain, and with a Basque libertarian communist magazine, \\"Askatasuna\\", which was beginning the reconstruction of the CNT in Euskadi towards the end of the dictatorship.  Legacy  After the dissolution of the FACO in 1976, Occitan anarchists, disillusioned with the sectarianism and racism of the French anarchist movement, organized themselves in Languedoc. This lead to the foundation of Libertarian Occitania (, OL) in the 1980s, a new libertarian communist group, inspired by the FACO, with a platform: * for the collectivization of the means of production and the expropriation of colonized Occitan land * for the respect and expansion of Occitan national identity * for the recognition of the Occitan people and their national rights * for the Occitan national community's control of their economic, social and cultural development.

Dobriceanu (19 September 1894 ‚Äì 10 February 1978) was an officer in the Romanian Army who fought in both World War I and World War II, and rose to the rank of major general afterwards. BiographyEarly life= He was born on 19 September 1894 in Craiova, Dolj County, in the Oltenia region of the Kingdom of Romania. He descended from a family from Dobriceni, Olt County with a long military tradition. His father, Sergeant Alexandru Dobriceanu- Chiorul fought at the Siege of Plevna during the Romanian War of Independence, where he lost his left eye. Young Dobriceanu spent part of his childhood in the family compound at Dobriceni, and then returned to Craiova. =Military career= In 1913 he went to study at the Artillery Officer School in Bucharest; soon after, he was sent to fight in Southern Dobruja, during the Second Balkan War. He graduated in 1916 with the rank of second lieutenant, and starting in July he served with the heavy artillery 1st Regiment‚ÄìDolj. He fought during the Romanian Campaign of World War I, notably at the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, when he was gravely wounded in his left arm at Muncelu, on 6 August 1917. While recovering in a hospital, he was promoted to lieutenant. In 1919 he participated in the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War, commanding his platoon all the way to Budapest. After being promoted to captain in 1923, he studied at the Higher War School in Bucharest from 1928 to 1930. From 1929 to 1938 he served as staff officer with the elite V√¢nƒÉtori de munte troops. He advanced in rank to major in 1934 and lieutenant colonel in 1938, after which he took command of the 1st Regiment‚ÄìDolj. On behalf of the General Staff, Dobriceanu attended in 1937 the Geneva International Conference for the protection of prisoners of war and civilian population, and was a delegate at the Prague Conference of the Little Entente. In June 1940 he was awarded the Order of the Crown, Officer rank. =World War II= On 22 June 1941 Romania joined Operation Barbarossa in order to reclaim the lost territories of Bessarabia and Bukovina, which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in June 1940. Dobriceanu was in command of the 3rd Battalion of the V√¢nƒÉtori de GardƒÉ Regiment. His troops crossed the Prut River and took control of LƒÉrgu»õa on 12 July. For his actions during this operation he was awarded on 22 September the Order of the Star of Romania, Officer rank. Subsequently, he took part in the Siege of Odessa. He was promoted to Colonel in June 1943 and was put in command of the 1st Heavy Artillery Regiment. In April 1944 he was commanding the 1st Regiment during the First Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, providing artillery support for Friedrich Mieth's IV Army Corps. After King Michael's Coup of 23 August 1944, Romania switched sides and joined the Allies. Dobriceanu disengaged his regiment and took new positions at Poienarii Burchii, just south of Ploie»ôti. On 7 September he was assigned to the 4th Army (commanded by General Gheorghe Avramescu), in support of the 6th Infantry Division. He fought against the German and Hungarian forces in the Battle of Turda, first at T√¢rnƒÉveni, and then along the Mure»ô River Valley. He continued advancing with the 4th Army towards Oradea and then crossed into Hungary. On 19 October, at the battle for R√°k√≥czifalva, his regiment fought was attacked by some 50‚Äì60 Tiger and Panther tanks, coming from the direction of Szolnok. Although lacking infantry support, skillful maneuvering and precise firing of the artillery pieces carried the day; four German tanks were destroyed and several damaged, while only two Romanian guns were lost. For this feat of arms, Dobriceanu was awarded in 1945 the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd class. By the end of the war he had advanced with his artillery regiment all the way to Brno in Czechoslovakia. =After the war= Dobriceanu was put in reserve on 9 August 1946, promoted to brigadier general on 21 December, and retired on 9 August 1947.Decretul Regal nr. 1.652 din 7 august 1947 pentru treceri √Æn pozi»õiunea de rezervƒÉ, publicat √Æn Monitorul Oficial, anul CXV, nr. 191 din 20 august 1947, partea I-a, p. 7.512. After the establishment of the Communist regime, he was tried for participating in the fighting on the Eastern Front and was declared a war criminal. All his properties (including the family mansion from Dobriceni) were confiscated, he was demoted to the rank of soldier, and was put under forced domicile. Fortuitously, he met in 1966 his former orderly, Andru»õƒÉ Ceau»ôescu, who agreed to intercede with his son, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. As a result, Dobriceanu was rehabilitated, his property in the Doroban»õi neighborhood was returned to him, and he was promoted to major general (in the reserves) in 1967. That same year he published a book of his war memoirs. He died on 10 February 1978 in Bucharest. Some of his memorabilia are displayed in the village museum at Dobriceni, while part of his book collection is with the Municipal Library in T√¢rnƒÉveni.

Early life Stuart- Hill was born in 1889 was born in Perth, Scotland. His father, William Hill, was a fishmonger. He studied at Edinburgh College of Art, where he was awarded a scholarship that allowed him to travel around France, Italy and Spain. Career From 1920 to 1947, Stuart-Hill regularly exhibited portraits and landscapes at the Royal Academy of Arts. He showed at the Grosvenor Gallery with the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, and at the New Chenil Galleries in Chelsea.The Times, 22 February 1919, p. 8; 25 January 1927, p. 10. In 1932, he designed a poster for Shell with Vorticist overtones which showed Mousehole, Penzance.National Motor Museum: Shell Advertising Art Collection, 360; London Transport Museum, 1983/4/5543. In 1937, the Redfern Gallery held a one-man exhibition of his portraits and views of London bridges,The Times, 7 October 1937, p. 12 including Battersea Bridge (1937) and The Thames at Charing Cross Bridge (which famously had been painted by Claude Monet in 1899). In 1943, he designed another poster for London Transport that featured bridges over the Thames. His portrait subjects included The Duchesse de Choiseuil-Praslin , Lilias Livingstone Mackinnon , Admiral Sir H. Goodenough King-Hall (1920), Arthur Greenhow Lupton, First Pro-Chancellor of the University of Leeds (1923), Turner Layton (1927), Florence Mills (1927), and the Baroness Posznanska (1945). He landscape subjects focused on his native Scotland as well as other parts of Europe, including views of Santa Margherita, Italy ‚Äì1928) and Early Spring Sunshine in Amalfi. In Perth, he painted The Tay in Sunshine, Kinnoull Hill, and the Cottage at Burghmuir. Personal life 1923 wedding portrait of Lady Louise and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf During World War I, Stuart-Hill worked in a military hospital in Nevers where he began a relationship with fellow volunteer Lady Louise Mountbatten. She was a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg, an admiral in the British Royal Navy who renounced his German title during the First World War and anglicised the family name to \\"Mountbatten\\" at the behest of King George V in 1917. Louise's mother was Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and she was a sister of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and of Princess Alice of Battenberg (the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh). She was also a niece of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia. Anticipating that her parents would be disappointed in the choice, Louise kept their engagement a secret for two years. Eventually, she confided in her parents, who were initially understanding, and twice invited him for visits at Kent House at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Her family, referring to him as \\"Shakespeare\\" because of his odd appearance, found him \\"eccentric\\" and \\"affected\\". Lacking resources, the engaged couple agreed to postpone marriage until after the war. But in 1918, Louise's father explained to her that Stuart-Hill was most likely homosexual, and that a marriage with him was impossible. In 1923, Louise later married Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden and upon his ascension to the Swedish throne in 1950, she became Queen consort of Sweden. According to his obituary in The Times, besides painting, \\"there was nothing \\"Stuart\\" could not do with his hands, from building chimneys and repairing roofs to the most delicate work in petit-point embroidery.\\"The Times, 24 February 1948, p. 7 His studio, located at 41 Glebe Place in Chelsea, was a \\"lively social meeting place in the years before the Second World War.\\" Attendees included members of the Bright young things, including Evelyn Waugh, Florence Mills, Alice Delysia, Turner Layton, and Clarence ‚ÄúTandy‚Äù Johnstone.

It is exclusively built for Bangladesh Army officers. It was refereed by the name Army Housing Scheme in the past. History In 2010, Army Housing Scheme had purchased 1400 bigha for the Jolshiri residential project. Quarter Master General of Bangladesh Army was the Chairman for the Scheme. The plan was to purchase up to 13 thousand bigha or 4333 acres in Rupganj Upazila, Narayanganj District. On 24 October 2010, seven thousand residents of Rupganj laid siege to Tanmushury camp, of Bangladesh Army involved with the Army Housing Scheme. The protesters had clashed with law-enforcement personnel. In the ensuing violence, 50 people were injured including 15 who were shot by members of Rapid Action Battalion and Bangladesh Army. Bangladesh Police reported that their personnel did not fire any rounds. The Army officers were airlifted out of the camp. The protesters then burned down the camp and two vehicles of Bangladesh Army. The protesters accused Bangladesh Army of forcefully purchasing their lands. They accused local Member of Parliament, Golam Dastagir Gazi, of supporting the Army officers buy land at Rupganj for below market rates. Gazi denied the allegations against him and described them as a conspiracy by the opposition party Following the protests, cases were filed against three to four thousand people by Rapid Action Battalion. Members of Bangladesh Police and Armed Police Battalion were stationed there to maintain peace. Male residents of Rupganj went into hiding fearing arrest following the filing of cases. Shops were closed in Rupganj and carried a deserted look. Three villagers were missing after the clash. One protester, Mostafa Jamal Haider, died of bullet injuries at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases. Police officers at the scene said Army officers were using government vehicles and resources for the private development project. Inter Services Public Relations died the camps were army camps, despite being manned by uniformed personnel, and called them temporary project site offices. One missing man was discovered in Army custody and was at Combined Military Hospital. He had been taken by the army personnel while they were being airlifted out of the camp. The Daily Star criticised the presence of Army officers at the local land registry office monitoring sale land. It also questioned the appropriateness of serving army officers managing a private corporation and the legal basis of the development project. On 30 October Bangladesh Army sued 50-60 people over the protests with Rupganj Police Station. Relatives the of missing accused the authorities of shooting the missing and taking away their bodies. Bangladesh Army had established several camps in Rupganj Upazila. They established a presence at the local land registry office and would refuse to let people sell their land to anyone other than the army. The army also offered a price lower than the market rate. The army defended its role in the project by describing it as government approved but Abdul Mannan Khan, State Minister for Housing and Public Works, denied any knowledge of the project. The army recorded all sales at the land office. They prevent registering land, an Eid prayer ground, as Waqf property. The land sold to the project were recorded at a lower value than the selling price to dodge taxes. On 28 October 2010, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina approved Army Housing Scheme and asked them to ensure that there is no conflicts with locals. Bangladesh Army also decided to scale down the project in light of the protests Jolshiri Abashon was incorporated on 11 April 2011 under the companies act, 2011. It is lead by a board of directors and Major General Abu Syeed Md. Masud is chairman of the board. It was given the responsibility to develop Jolshiri Abashon which is 2100 acre property in Rupganj Upazila, Narayanganj District which is on the outskirts of Dhaka. On 4 June 2019, General Aziz Ahmed, chief of Bangladesh Army, inaugurated the construction of buildings for Adamji Public School and College, Bangladesh International School and College, and Jolshiri Public School and College at Jolshiri Abashon. Environmental impact The site is situated a designated flood flow zone of Dhaka. According to Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan this area cannot be developed or built upon. Md Nurul Huda, Chairman of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha said that Army officials did not consult them or seek their approval for the construction of the project. Major General Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan was the chairman of the scheme in 2010. Department of Environment fined Jolshiri Abashon for lacking an enviromnment clearance certificate in 2015. It was fined following a hearing at the department headquarters in Dhaka.

He was raised around gospel music, learning classical and jazz music on the piano before turning to the organ as a teenager. His interest in the instrument was influenced by watching Catharine Crozier on the Hour of Power. The churches he attended as a child didn't have organs, so he tracked down local organists to ask if they would take him on as a student. He studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where he obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees, before pursuing a PhD in music at McGill University, studying the organ under Hans-Ola Ericsson. Chriss appeared in Stacey Tenenbaum's 2019 documentary Pipe Dreams alongside Yuan Shen, Thomas Gaynor, Nick Cappozoli, and Sebastian Heindl as they prepared to compete in the Canadian International Organ Competition (CIOC).

The primary approaches include DNA/RNA tests, serological tests and antigen tests.  History  COVID 19 = In March 2020, Abbott received emergency use authorization (EUA) for its isothermal nucleic acid test for COVID-19. It produces test results in 5 minutes using its ID NOW portable testing system. It also received EUA for its m2000-based laboratory nucleic acid test for COVID-19. In April 2020, Abbott received EUA for its ARCHITECT IgG laboratory antibody test for COVID-19. Also in April, Abbott's ID NOW test was reported to have sensitivity of 85.2%. A later study found sensitivity of only 52%, inducing the FDA to issue an alert. A different study found sensitivity of 91%. The UK spent $20 million for antibody tests that proved flawed. In May 2020, a rapid antigen test from Quidel Corporation received EUA for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Test results were said to be available at point of care within 15 minutes. Sensitivity is 85%. Also in May 2020, a CRISPR genetic test was approved for emergency use that claimed 100% selectivity and 97.5% sensitivity. That month Abbott received EUA for its Alinity antibody test for COVID-19. The company claimed 100% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity for patients tested 14 days after symptoms began. Another review found that the accuracy of PCR tests depended on the interval between the infection and the test. Immediately after infection, the sensitivity was 0, rising to 80% after three days and then declining thereafter. In May 2020 the FDA withdrew approval for 29 of 41 antibody tests for which it had given EUAs.  Types  DNA/RNA tests = Tests for viral DNA can look for either DNA or RNA. They typically use reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions to multiply the amount of genetic material in a small sample into an amount that is measurable. The genetic material is generally taken from the nose/sinus. One study found clinical sensitivity was found to range from 66 to 80%. Another found accuracy of 70%. A newer form uses CRISPR to produce a test result without requiring lab equipment. The test reacts with genetic material to produce a visible signal without requiring amplification. = Serological tests = Serological tests look for the presence of antibodies in a test sample. Antibodies are materials that the body produces to fight off an infection. The primary antibodies sought in viral testing are IgE and IgG. = Rapid antigen tests = A rapid antigen test quickly searches for antigens, protein fragments that are found on the surface of or within a virus. Antigen tests can be analyzed within a few minutes. Antigen tests are less accurate than PCR tests. It has a low false positive rate, but a higher false negative rate. A negative test result may require confirmation with a PCR test.Advocates claim that antigen tests are less expensive and can be scaled up more rapidly than PCR tests.Antigen tests are available for a variety of conditions, including streptococcus, influenza, giardia, Ebola and Heliobacter pylori.Antigens can be detected via blood, urine or stool. = Imaging = Imaging such as computerized tomography can be used to inform a diagnostic process. CT scans are considerably more expensive than nucleic acid tests and involve a small dose of radiation. For COVID-19, they are seen as the most accurate diagnostic tool, because the disease creates patchy \\"ground glass\\" areas in the lungs that are revealed by a scan. One study found 97% sensitivity.  Accuracy  Accuracy is measured in terms of specificity and selectivity. Test errors can come false positives (the test is positive, but the virus is not present) or false negatives, (the test is negative, but the virus is present). = Sensitivity = Sensitivity indicates whether the test accurately identifies whether the virus is or is present. A 90% sensitive test will correctly identify 90% of infections, leaving 10% with a false negative result. = Specificity = Specificity indicates how well- targeted the test is to the virus in question. Highly specific tests pick up only the virus in question. Non-selective tests pick up other viruses as well. A 90% specific test will correctly identify 90% of those who are uninfected, leaving 10% with a false positive result.

Among the reptiles, there is the grass snake (Natrix natrix), as well as the green whip snake (Hierophis viridiflavus), the lizard (Lacertilia), the gecko (Tarentola mauritanica). The nocturnal fauna includes foxes (Vulpes vulpes), common pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), crested porcupines (Hystrix cristata) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). Among the raptors, which often nest in the numerous farmhouses of the Reserve, there are the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the little owl (Athene noctua) and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Finally, the Reserve hosts several species of birds, including the grey heron (Ardea cinerea), the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), the hoopoe (Upupa epops), the nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The presence of the barn owl (Tyto alba) has been signaled. Flora In the Reserve grow holm oak (Quercus ilex) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) woods, as well as willows (Salix), poplars (Populus), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus). The area shows a modest forest cover, modified by the intense agricultural use and by the surrounding urbanization, but with good chance of recovery. Places of interest The name Acqua Acetosa (or Acquacetosa or Acqua Cetosa) is due to the presence of the ditch of Acqua Acetosa, a tributary stream of the Vallerano, in turn a left tributary of the Tiber, otherwise known as Acqua Acetosa Ostiense, to distinguish it from another stream with the same name in the quarter Parioli. Roughly at kilometer 8 of the Via Laurentina there is a source of sulfur mineral waterDintorni di Roma: 1, Antonio Nibby January 1837, Tip. Belle Arti. The source, known to the ancient Romans, was probably used for therapeutic purposesWebsite of the Municipality. This water was sold by street vendors known as Acquacetosari. In 1937 a plant for the bottling and sale of the water was installedAcqua San Paolo; the plant, called \\"Fonte S. Paolo\\", is currently closed sine die, due to pollution of the acquifer. Probably this source was already used in protohistoric times, since a settlement - maybe the ancient Tellenae - developed on the plateau overlooking the ditch and the source of Acqua Acetosa. In 1976 the village and the nearby necropolis were protected with the establishment of the archaeological area of Acqua Acetosa, which however is not part of the Nature Reserve. Issues The area included in the Reserve is one of the smallest (152 hectares, then increased up to 273) and the most degraded in the Province of Rome. Biodiversity is reduced to just few floral and faunal species, mainly anthropophilic. The agricultural areas are those that maintain an appearance more similar to that preceding the massive building expansion. As for the archaeological site, this is closed to the public - although it falls within the redevelopment area of the Reserve - since it is under the exclusive control of the Archaeological Superintendence of Rome. This patch of land of a few hectares is actually a crucial knot to untie for a coherent development of the Reserve, since, in addition to Roman antiquities, it includes the 17th-century casale of San Sisto, the old bottling plant of Fonte San Paolo, the Judicial Deposit and an unofficial landfill.

In his Austrian homeland he is primarily remembered as the composer of the anthem of the Burgenland state.  Life  Peter Zauner was the son of a Burgenland winegrower, master shoemaker and musician, who was a member of the Carl Michael Ziehrer musical ensemble, where he rose to play the lead violin. His son Peter received his first violin lessons at the age of five. During his military service in Vienna, beginning in 1903 he received further music lessons and joined the military music corps of the Infantry Regiment 71 in Trenƒç√≠n and worked from 1908 as a conductor in P√∂ttsching and Wiener Neustadt. During the First World War he served as a Combat medic at the rank of a Sergeant. Upon his return to his hometown P√∂ttsching he took over his family farm and from 1919 to 1948 he served as music teacher in the rural areas of the Mattersburg and Eisenstadt districts. He established his legendary Z-Banda and quickly became a role model for countless concert bands of the Burgenland. He and his band had already been renown throughout the various regions of Austria, when he composed his Burgenland national anthem. At the 1936 Vaterl√§ndische Front competition for the composition of the anthem, the jury panel pointed out, that the work should preferably be of artistic value, easy to sing and folkloristic. In its closing session on April 30, 1936, the jury selected Peter Zauner's musical composition of Ernst G√∂rlich's poem Mein Heimatvolk, mein Heimatland (My people, my homeland) from a total of 283 applications. Peter Zauner continued to be a winemaker and in 1938 he founded the First Burgenland Wine Cooperative P√∂ttsching (Erste burgenl√§ndische Winzergenossenschaft P√∂ttsching). He also made a name for himself as he promoted the cultivation and growth of tobacco in his home region.  Works  Between 1901 and 1968 Zauner produced a total of 234 musical compositions, mainly works for strings and wind orchestras (Marches, Waltzes, Polkas, L√§ndlers), piano works, vocal works (songs for folklore theater pieces). The Burgenland national anthem was his 58th work. The Wieser Graben-Polka, also known as Erinnerungen an Brennberg (Memories of Brennberg) - a folk music classic - remains one of Zauner's most popular works throughout Alpine German-speaking countries.

They received media attention from their appearances on the fourteenth season of the reality television series Bad Girls Club in 2015, and have since developed an extensive online and social media presence.  Lives and careers  Early lives and education = The identical twins were born in Montclair, New Jersey on March 21, 1994; they are the youngest of five siblings, with one sister and two brothers. Their parents are both immigrants; their mother is from Jamaica and operated a daycare, and their father is from Haiti and owned a moving company. They have described their family as \\"hard- working, working class,\\" and moved to Dallas, Georgia when they were nine years old. They began modeling when they were 14 years old; after winning a six-month program at an acting and modeling school, they worked as stand-ins for television shows including Tyler Perry's House of Payne. The twins developed an interest in fashion from their aunt, a fashion designer in New York City. They stated that \\"[they] didn't have any other plan other than getting to New York City\\" despite both receiving full college scholarships in Georgia; Shannon attended the Fashion Institute of Technology for fashion merchandising and Shannade attended Parsons School of Design for strategic design, and both graduated with bachelor's degrees in 2016. They have since relocated to Los Angeles. = Reality television = In 2015, the Clermont twins appeared as two of the seven original cast members on the fourteenth season of the reality television series Bad Girls Club. Shannon stated that they participated on the show because \\"[they] just wanted people to know who [they] are\\" on a national level. They were removed from the series following the seventh episode, in which an altercation occurred involving other cast members destroying their belongings. They stated that \\"[they] would never do [Bad Girls Club] again,\\" but stated that \\"[they] definitely grew from that show [and] learned a lot\\" and credited the show with \\"[allowing them] to get an audience that really grew with [them].\\" They have acknowledged the show for having significantly expanded their fanbase on social media, and have been labeled as influencers following their appearance. Highsnobiety writer Lia McGarrigle commented that the Clermont twins' appearances on Bad Girls Club \\"harnessed their [...] notoriety as a launchpad to build their personal brand\\", and was comparable to Cardi B's appearance on Love & Hip Hop: New York before the release of her signature song \\"Bodak Yellow\\". = Fashion and modeling = The Clermont twins' public profile was significantly increased after being featured in Kanye West's \\"Yeezy Season 6\\" collection in January 2018, in which they appeared alongside models including Paris Hilton as \\"clones\\" of Kim Kardashian. They were unaware of Kardashian's and West's interest in their participation until the day before the campaign was shot in December 2017. The twins later modeled for Gypsy Sport during New York Fashion Week in 2018; they walked together for The Blonds in January 2019 and Shannon independently for Chromat in September 2019. They previously modeled for the fall 2015 Married to the Mob collection. They launched their Mont Boudoir fashion label in 2017, which they designed to be \\"timeless\\" and has been reviewed as \\"equal parts Western cowboy and gothy '90s starlet.\\" The brand relaunched with the \\"Money\\" sunglasses in June 2020. They acknowledged Mary- Kate and Ashley Olsen as being among their inspirations for the collection. Previously, the twins interned for fashion labels including Jovani and Yves Saint Laurent. The twins have appeared in music videos including \\"Same Damn Time\\" and \\"Real Sisters\\" by Future, and \\"Good Form\\" by Nicki Minaj.  Personal lives  The Clermont twins share two Yorkshire Terrier dogs named Chase and Chloe, which they rotate together between each of their apartments so the dogs are not separated. Speculation regarding the twins' changed appearances began following their appearances on Bad Girls Club. They have since acknowledged that they have underwent cosmetic surgery for \\"everything besides [their] boobs,\\" including buttock, cheek, chin, and lip augmentations. They are of Jamaican, Indian, Haitian and Chinese descent. = Shannade's legal charges = Shannade Clermont was arrested and charged with aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud on July 11, 2018. Clermont was stated to have been solicited as a prostitute by Manhattan-based real estate broker James Alesi on January 31, 2017, and to have recorded his debit card information before his incidental death while under the influence of alcohol, cocaine, and fentanyl that evening after her departure. She was not suspected for involvement in his death, however was investigated after Alesi's account information was connected to purchases and money transfers made by Clermont after his death. She plead guilty in November, and was sentenced to one year in prison in April 2019. Clermont turned herself into FCI Dublin on June 4, 2019, and was released early on March 9, 2020.

The Vegetarian Crusade: The Rise of an American Reform Movement, 1817-1921. University of North Carolina Press. p. 195.

Born Again Bodies: Flesh and Spirit in American Christianity. University of California Press. pp. 111-112. He also experimented with seven to fifteen day fasts. Low stated that he had increased strength during fasts. Osteopathic physician Irving James Eales took interest in fasting and Low's feats. He documented Low's fasts in his book Healthology, published in 1907. In 1903, Low demonstrated a million pound lift in front of witnesses at strongman Anthony Barker's gymnasium. The million-pound lift was originally proposed by Bernarr Macfadden to Low in early 1902. Macfadden told Low that if he could lift 1,000 pounds 1,000 times as quickly as possible it would make a million-pound lift and if successful he would publish the results in his Physical Culture magazine.\\"How I Lifted 1,000,000 Pounds and How I Failed\\". The Washington Times (October 27, 1907). Low established a world record by reportedly back lifting 1.6 million pounds over a thirty-five minute period. His vegetarian diet in training for two months consisted of cereals, eggs, fruits, milk, nuts, whole wheat bread and plenty of distilled water. The results were published in Physical Culture, in 1903. Low contributed articles to Bernarr Macfadden's Physical Culture.Fair, John D. (2015). Mr. America: The Tragic History of a Bodybuilding Icon.

Life Anne Esdall was born Anne Middleton around 1718. She married the printer, publisher, and bookseller, James Esdall on 31 August 1745. In her husband's absences due to legal issues regarding the content of his newspapers The Censor, or Citizen's Journal and The Censor Extraordinary, Esdall would run his printing shop from Copper-Alley on Cork Hill, Dublin. This led to serious financial and emotional distress. Esdall kept The General News-letter, also known as Esdall's News-letter from 1745‚Äì1755, going while raising the couple's four children. It was unusual for women to be involved in the print trade in the 1700s, the small number of women running businesses were widows who inherited them. She was examined by the Irish House of Commons in December 1749 when she was asked to reveal the identity of an author from her husband's publications who wrote \\"scandalous\\" paragraphs, which she did. The author was Charles Lucas, a controversial politician, with whom James Esdall had a long relationship. As a result of the session in the House of Commons, copies of the Censor and other works by Lucas were burned publicly and the Guild of St Luke was warned to control its members. Her husband returned to Dublin in 1750, and continued to publish controversial works including The case and tryal of John Peter Zenger (1750), but his health had been affected by the Lucas case. He died on 24 March 1755, at which time Esdall intended to carry on the business. However, in June 1755 she sold the printing materials, shop stock, and household furniture. The News-letter was taken over by her husband's apprentice, Henry Saunders, in 1755 and he renamed it the Saunder's News-letter. Lucas' reputation was later rehabilitated and he was elected MP in 1761. Esdall petitioned the Guild of St Luke for relief in 1768, and later in 1795 due to \\"distressed circumstances\\" following the death of her son and was granted three guineas. It is likely she died soon after this date. The Esdalls had four children, including the artist and engraver, William Esdall (c.1750‚Äì1795).

Roberts, 1884 Ames Van Wart (January 20, 1841 ‚Äì February 11, 1927) was an American sculpture artist who lived in Europe. Early life Van Wart was born on January 20, 1841 in New York City to a wealthy and prominent family. He was a son of Irving van Wart (1808‚Äì1896) and, his second wife, Sarah Craig (n√©e Ames) van Wart. His twin brother was Irving Van Wart Jr. and the family had a residence in New York City and a country home in Craigville in Orange County, New York, which had been named after their great-grandfather Hector Craig. He was a grandson of Sarah (n√©e Irving) van Wart (a sister of Washington Irving) and Henry van Wart, an American who became British by special act of Parliament and founded the Birmingham Stock Exchange (where Irving wrote Rip Van Winkle). As children, Van Wart and his twin brother visited their great-uncle at Sunnyside his country home in Irvington, celebrated his 72nd birthday, and went with him to the opera in New York. His grandfather was a grand-nephew of Revolutionary War soldier Isaac Van Wart, who was one of three men who captured British Major John Andr√©. His maternal grandparents were Mary (n√©e Craig) Ames and Barrett Ames, a wealthy cotton merchant, and his uncle was Hector Ames, one of Washington Irving's attach√©s' at Madrid. His grandmother's father was U.S. Representative Hector Craig, and her sister, Sarah Agnes Craig, married William F. Havemeyer, three-time mayor of New York City. In 1859, the Van Wart family moved to Paris. Career While in Paris, he likely met sculptor Richard Saltonstall Greenough (younger brother of Horatio Greenough), who encouraged Van Wart to pursue the study of sculpture in Italy, so the Van Wart family spent the winter of 1861 to 1862 in Florence, where he studied under Hiram Powers, the prominent American sculptor. He made busts of his grandfather, Henry van Wart (1864), Horace Greeley, his grand-uncle Washington Irving, and Peter Cooper. He returned to New York in the 1860s, married, and became a member of the Century Association. In 1872, Van Wart and his wife traveled extensively around Europe with her father-in-law (an avid art collector), spending time at Nice, in the south of France and London, where they lived (and became friends with Lord Frederick Leighton). They also spent time in Rome with his friend William Wetmore Story. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1872 and at the Paris Salon from 1904 to 1905. Today, his work can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Other known works by Van Wart include a Bust of a Quadroon Girl, which was exhibited in Boston and New York in 1869. He posthumously created a bust of his father-in-law, which today is also in the Metropolitan Museum. In 1923, he published his autobiography in Paris, titled Reminiscences and Nonsense. Personal life On April 23, 1869, Van Wart was married to heiress Caroline Marshall \\"Carrie\\" Roberts (1849‚Äì1893). She was a daughter of Marshall Owen Roberts and, his second wife, Caroline Danforth (n√©e Smith) Roberts. Carrie's aunt, Mary Boardman Smith, was the wife of abolitionist William Weston Patton (fifth president of Howard University). After their marriage, they lived at the Roberts residence, 107 Fifth Avenue at the southeast corner of 18th Street. Together, they were the parents of: * Evelyn Mary Frances Van Wart (1870‚Äì1910), who died unmarried in Bordighera, Italy.

Tsalikov served as a junior officer in the early 1930s and held staff positions after graduating from the Frunze Military Academy. A division chief of staff when Operation Barbarossa began, he became a regimental commander in the first weeks of the war and was decorated for his performance. As a result, Tsalikov was given command of the 377th Rifle Division, which he led in operations to relieve the Siege of Leningrad. In late 1942 he was appointed commander of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division, leading it in the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad. Tsalikov was decorated for his leadership of the division in the latter, the Donbass Strategic Offensive, and the Crimean Offensive. He rose to command the 13th Guards Rifle Corps after the end of the Crimean Offensive, but was killed by a mine during the ≈†iauliai Offensive in mid-1944.  Early life and prewar service  An Ossetian, Tsalikov was born on 10 April 1908 in the village of Nogkau, Terek Oblast. He joined the Red Army in October 1929 and became a cadet at the Transcaucasian Infantry School. Following his graduation in March 1932, Tsalikov was posted to the 240th Rifle Regiment of the 80th Rifle Division in the Ukrainian Military District, where he served as a rifle and training platoon commander and as commander and political officer of a company. Awarded the Order of the Red Star in 1934 for successes in combat training, he began advanced studies at the Frunze Military Academy in May 1935 and after his graduation in August 1938 was appointed senior assistant section chief of the 1st staff department of the Far Eastern Front. This post proved brief and a month later Tsalikov became chief of staff of the 1st Separate Rifle Brigade of the 1st Red Banner Army, before being transferred west in October 1939 to serve as chief of staff of the 176th Rifle Division, which became part of the 35th Rifle Corps of the Odessa Military District.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Tsalikov and his unit fought in Bessarabia with the 9th Army of the Southern Front. Defending positions on the east bank of the Prut, the division faced the German and Romanian advance southwest of Kishinev. During the fighting, Tsalikov, by now a major, assumed command of the 591st Rifle Regiment of the 176th after its commander was wounded. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his \\"bravery and courage\\" in the fighting near Skulyany and \\"skillful organization\\" of the crossing of the Dniester by the 591st and 300th Artillery Regiments of the division. In September, Tsalikov was sent to the Ural Military District to command the 377th Rifle Division, forming in the camps at Chebarkul. The division was railed to the front during November and the first half of December to join the 39th Army in reserve near Tikhvin. The 377th was soon transferred to the 4th Army on the Volkhov Front and from 21 December fought in the Tikhvin Offensive, fighting in the area of Moshki, Nikitino, Moiseyevo, and Zarechye. In January it bypassed German forces to reach the east bank of the Volkhov south of Kirishi, where it crossed the river and entrenched on the opposite bank. Shifted to the 59th Army, the 377th fought in the Lyuban Offensive beginning on 28 January and four days later cut roads in the German rear. Reaching the line of Maloye Opochivalovo by 6 February, it was ordered to strike southwest to exploit the successful advance of the 378th Rifle Division. The offensive stalled in late February, by which time the division had advanced as far as the line of Hill 28.3 and Mikhalevo. For his \\"skillful leadership\\" of the division in these operations, Tsalikov was awarded a second Order of the Red Banner. For the next several months the division defended positions on the Polist. Appointed commander of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division of the 2nd Shock Army in September 1942, Tsalikov was transferred with the division to the Stalingrad Front to join the 2nd Guards Army in mid-December following nearly two months in reserve near Sinyavino. The division repulsed the German attack in Operation Winter Storm and on 24 December went on the offensive. Breaking through stubborn Axis resistance, the 3rd Guards crossed the Manych on 19 January 1943 and reached the Don in the North Caucasus Offensive. In the subsequent Rostov Offensive, the division captured the northern part of Novocherkassk with an attack from the north and northeast and pursued the retreating Axis troops to the Mius, reached by 18 February. Withdrawn to the reserve to rebuild, the division returned to combat with the 2nd Guards Army in the Mius Offensive in mid-July. Tsalikov and his division were surrounded by a German counterattack on 30 July and did not break out until 1 August. After receiving reinforcements, the 3rd Guards fought in the Donbass Strategic Offensive from 18 August, then went on to participate in the Melitopol Offensive and the Crimean Offensive. His superior, 1st Guards Rifle Corps commander Lieutenant General Ivan Missan, evaluated him as \\"personally daring and decisive\\" and \\"always on the frontline, inspiring subordinates with his courage.\\" After the end of the Crimean Offensive, the 3rd Guards and its army were withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, and two days later Tsalikov was appointed commander of the 13th Guards Rifle Corps of the army, which the division was assigned to. He led the corps as part of the army in the ≈†iauliai Offensive from 8 July. He was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for his \\"skillful command of rifle units and formations in different types of battle\\" and \\"proving himself to be a brave and courageous officer\\". Tsalikov was killed at 08:30 on 21 July while circling the positions of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division when the Willys Jeep he was riding in struck a land mine near the village of Dudy, north of Kurkliai.

They began the season in Nashville, Tennessee, as the Nashville Centennials, but relocated to Henderson, Kentucky, after June 3. They played their home games at the city's fair grounds for the remainder of the season.  History  The team began the 1897 Central League season as the Nashville Centennials of Nashville, Tennessee, but suffered financial problems brought on principally by poor attendance. They played their final game in Nashville on June 3. The Centennials left town in second place with a 18‚Äì14 (.563) record. League president George Simons announced the league's intention to transfer the club to Decatur, Illinois. The league took possession of the team and placed it in the hands of catcher Frank Belt. He would lead the team until it could be permanently established in its new city. After an off day on June 4, the team played a series each against the Cairo Egyptians and Paducah Little Colonels, where they were still referred to as Nashville. Meanwhile, Simons was still trying to place the former Nashville franchise in a new city. Decatur, the intended spot, refused to accept the team and its over $400 debt in unpaid player salaries and forthwith demolished their ballpark. Simons next turned to Springfield, Illinois; Owensboro, Kentucky; and Henderson, Kentucky. The league gave Nashville a five-day window to get together the funds to guarantee finishing the season, but it failed to do so. Instead, the citizens of Henderson gathered enough money to have the team transferred there. Their first game as the Henderson club was played on June 13 on the road against the Evansville Brewers. They won, 5‚Äì4, with the battery of Will Geralds and Belt. A. D. Rogers, owner of the Henderson opera house and president of the city's fair association, was named the new manager. The team's home games were played at the Henderson Fair Grounds. They defeated Evansville, 6‚Äì2, in their Henderson home opener on June 22. On the morning of July 20, the Washington Browns disbanded amid poor attendance and severe debt. Evansville and the Terre Haute Hottentots dropped out of the league later that day. The Central League was finished. Henderson played its final league game on July 19 at Terre Haute, a 5‚Äì4 loss. At the cessation of play, the team was in second place with a record of 39‚Äì31 (.557), one-and-a-half games behind Evansville. They played one final exhibition game against a team from Princeton, Indiana, on July 21, winning 5‚Äì0, before disbanding.

The concept originated in the United States, where the first council was founded in Knoxville in 1982 to battle the effects of an economic recession on the local food supply system. Food Policy Councils bring together different stakeholders that want to work on making healthy, local and sustainable food available for people in a certain region. In this way the councils connect representatives of consumers, producers, NGOs and governments to find solutions suitable to their region. The idea of local councils of this type has spread across North America and to other continents. In Brazil a national Food Policy Council called CONSEA (Conselho de Seguran√ßa Alimentar e Nutricional) was established in the 90s. It was very successful in reducing the number of people affected by hunger and undernourishment. In 2019 President Jair Bolsonaro disbanded CONSEA on his first day in office to give the agrobusiness sector more power over the Amazon.

For example, he coined the term \\"Trinity of Sound\\": it depends on the contact point, pressure and speed of the bow. He can be considered the founder of a new German cello school. Eichhorn was one of the first students of Emanuel Feuermann in Cologne. With the help of knowledge gained from additional studies in anatomy and physics in Heidelberg, Eichhorn analysed Feuermann's game and developed, among other things, a theory of an artistically highly efficient biomechanical lever system in , as he believed to have observed it in Feuermann. This lever system can be characterised by the fact that the bow guiding arm is set into mass balancing oscillations. Figuratively, this can be imagined as a chain of connected rockers, so that the mass inertia to be overcome in the bow guidance is reduced to a minimum. In such a mobile-like system of coupled oscillators, small muscular impulses can already keep relatively large reactionary movements in motion. Eichhorn subsequently attempted to give his students systematic artistic progress by communicating his theories. The relevance of the use of Eichhorn's movement model for the training of artistic expertise was rudimentarily proven in studies using three-dimensional computer-aided movement analysis (see Hasselbach & Gruhn & Gollhofer 2010, 2011). However, a more recent study showed that in a study of professional violinists from several German orchestras, no significant correlation could be found between the degree of mass balancing oscillations (MBOs) and the position achieved in the orchestra or the orchestra's reputation. However, highly significant correlations were found between the level of MBOs and the presence or severity of a play-related illness. (cf. Hasselbach & Gruhn & Gollhofer 2019) Conclusion: Eichhorn's movement model in terms of a biomechanical topology (cf. Bernstein 1996 and Schack 2010) seems to be just one possible route among many to artistic expertise, but one of the healthiest routes under professional stress in the long term. Other variables such as personality or marketing strategies seem to have a greater influence on concrete professional success than the learned movement model. Eichhorn died in Bensheim at the age of 80.  Source  * Margarete Hopfer: Die Klanggestaltung auf Streichinstrumenten. Das Naturgesetz der Tonansprache.Die Klanggestaltung auf Streichinstrumenten.

She has written sociological studies, essay collections, and poetic anthologies about misogyny in the history of Western philosophy, the connection between machismo and violence against women, and racial discrimination, particularly against Afro-Venezuelans. Pineda holds a PhD in sociology, and her writing frequently uses tools of sociological analysis. Education Pineda attended the Central University of Venezuela, graduating in 2010. She continued to study there as a graduate student, earning an MS degree in women's studies in 2013, and a doctorate in social sciences in 2015. She completed postdoctoral training there, also in social sciences, in 2017. CareerProfessional positions= Pineda has been a regular columnist for outlets in several South American countries and Europe, including Uruguay's La Red 21 (es), Montenegro's Wall Street International, Spain's Iberoam√©rica Social (es), and Venezuela's Contrapunto (es). =Books= Pineda has also published several books. In 2011, she published Roles de g√©nero y sexismo en seis discursos sobre la familia nuclear, a collection of six anthropological discourses on the way that sexist models of behaviour are enforced in the context of the nuclear family. In 2014, she published Racismo, endorracismo y resistencia, a discussion of race and racism in Venezuela that was written with support by the Venezuelan Ministry of Culture. In Racismo, endorracismo y resistencia, she challenges the clich√© that history, in the case of Venezuela, is written by the victors; rather, she argues that the writers of Venezuelan history perpetrated a genocide against both Indigenous peoples in Venezuela and Afro-Venezuelans, and that to be a victor implies that a legitimate fight was held on equal terms, whereas repression in Venezuela has not historically been a balanced fight. She also reflects on the cultural legacy of the white savior myth in Venezuelan culture and politics. A review of Racismo, endorracismo y resistencia in the outlet Aporrea drew connections between Pineda's argument and those of other contemporary Venezuelan writers, while arguing that the topics investigated in Racismo, endorracismo y resistencia remain under-discussed. In 2017, Pineda published the book Machismo y vindicaci√≥n: La mujer en el pensamiento sociofilos√≥fico. In Machismo y vindicaci√≥n, Pineda studies the role of misogyny in historical Western thought, arguing that discrimination against women is a central feature of Western philosophy. She traces women's role in Western thought through 19th and 20th century thinkers who rejected the claim that social differences between women and men are naturally guaranteed, and she connects these arguments to the contemporary phenomenon of machismo. Pineda describes the effects of machismo culture, citing data on violence against women to argue that macho violence constitutes a silent massacre of women. In 2019, she published the book Cultura femicida. =Themes= In her work, Pineda has studied themes of machismo and misogyny in philosophy and sociology, gender stereotypes and roles within the family institution, violence against women, and sexism in the media such as in the popularity of beauty pageants and the portrayal of women in video games. She has popularized the concept through using the term violencia est√©tica (aesthetic violence) to describe the damaging and discriminatory pressure on women to respond to prevailing ideas of beauty. Pineda has also devoted a large part of her writing to the study of racial discrimination, especially racist discrimination against Afro-Venezuelans. She has written on topics like the hypersexualization of Black women, racism in daily life, and police brutality. She has also written extensively on the topic of endorracismo (endoracism), which is the perpetuation of racist tropes and behaviours by people who are themselves victims of racist discrimination.

She was the first woman to be elected in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. McDougall was born in Burnstown, Ontario (then Canada East), the daughter of Peter Morris and Helen Bailey. The Morris family was a prominent pioneer family in Renfrew County. Her grandfather was the first registrar of the county, and her uncle was the first sheriff. Her family moved to Ottawa when she was about 9 years old. During her life, she served as president of the Ottawa Historical Society, director of the Maternity Hospital board, and was a member of the board of management of the Elizabeth Residence for indigent women. A keen gardener, she won many awards at the Lady Grey horticultural exhibition. During World War I, she was active in the recruitment effort and with the Red Cross. She also headed the Belgian relief war work, and was decorated with a medal of honour by the Queen of Belgium. McDougall was elected to Ottawa's Public School Board in the 1919 Ottawa municipal election for a two-year term. She was one of three female candidates running for school board in that election, and the only one elected. She won by a majority of 115 votes over her nearest opponent, J. E. McClenaghan. Upon taking her seat, her presence on the board was met with apparent applause by her male colleagues. The board's newly elected chair, R. W.

It situated in North Cascades National Park, on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Chelan County with Skagit County. Despite its position only west of the North Cascades Highway, it is not visible from any road. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Arriva, to the north. The first ascent of the summit was made August 2, 1972, by Bill Arundell, Frank King, Marilyn and Stan Jensen, and Joanne Williams. The lower northeast summit is known as Meulefire Peak (~7,930 ft), which is a portmanteau of Meulemans and Firey, the names of the first mountaineers to climb it in 1966. Climate Indecision Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. This climate supports a small glacier on the northeast side of the peak. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from Indecision Peak drains into tributaries of the Stehekin and Skagit Rivers. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The law is designed specifically to allow authorities to respond to fake news or false information through a graduated process of enforcing links to fact-checking statements, censorship of website or assets on social media platforms, and criminal charges. The law is controversial and has received criticism both locally and internationally by opposition politicians, human rights groups, journalists and academics.  History  On 3 April 2017, Minister of Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam called for a review of existing laws to combat fake news. He cited the websites The Real Singapore which published an article claiming that a commotion between Thaipusam participants and the police was sparked by complaints from a Filipino family, the States Times Review which mocked former President S. R. Nathan with an article claiming near-zero turnout for his funeral, and All Singapore Stuff which reported eye-witness account of a collapsed HDB roof at Punggol Waterway Terraces which fooled the police and civil defence to investigate. The Minister claimed that fake news, when not debunked, can quickly cause harm to Singaporeans, panic to public, waste emergency resources, and damage reputations of businesses and people. He also claimed that nasty people seek to profit from fake news and that foreign agencies and foreign governments seek to destabilise the government through fake news. On 10 January 2018, 80 MPs present voted unanimously in Parliament to appoint a Select Committee of eight PAP MPs, one opposition MP and one NMP to study and report on the problem of deliberate online falsehoods and recommend strategies to deal with them. The Select Committee convened public hearings from 14 March to 29 March 2018, lasting eight days in total, where 79 individuals and organisations were invited to testify. On 1 April 2019, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation (POFMA) Bill was tabled in parliament for first reading. The Ministry of Law stated that the legislation seeks to protect the society from deliberate online falsehoods created by malicious actors by targeting falsehoods, not opinions and criticisms, nor satire or parody. It defines a falsehood as a statement of fact that is false or misleading. After concerns were raised about the Bill's scope, ministers gave reassurances that the bill will not affect free speech. The Bill was passed with a 72‚Äì9 vote on 8 May 2019 after a two-day debate. The POFMA came into effect on 2 October 2019, with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) being the agency administering Act through a dedicated office. Subsidiary legislation is also laid out in the Act detailing how the Act will work, including court challenges that take nine days at maximum and cost as little as $200. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Communications and Information lifted the exemption of social media platforms, search engines and Internet intermediaries from complying with POFMA. These platforms were required to comply with general correction directions issued from 31 January, 2020. The exemptions initially applied when the law first took effect.  Purpose  There were concerns that the Act would enable authorities to suppress criticism and dissent. Section 2(2)(b) defines a false statement as \\"if it is false or misleading, whether wholly or in part, and whether on its own or in the context in which it appears\\". Satire, parody, opinions and criticisms are expressively not covered by the POFMA Act. Section 3 of the Act covers any statements that are made available to one or more end-users in Singapore via the internet, SMS or MMS. The platforms include social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other online closed groups such private chat groups and social media groups. The purpose of the Act,as outlined in section 5 is to: # to prevent the communication of false statements of fact in Singapore and to enable measures to be taken to counteract the effects of such communication; # to suppress the financing, promotion and other support of online locations that repeatedly communicate false statements of fact in Singapore; # to enable measures to be taken to detect, control and safeguard against coordinated inauthentic behaviour and other misuses of online accounts and bots; and # to enable measures to be taken to enhance disclosure of information concerning paid content directed towards a political end.  Prohibited activities and penalties  Part 2 of the POFMA Act criminalises the communication of false statements of facts in Singapore through Section 7 even if the person communicating it is not in Singapore, and that the false statement is detrimental to \\"the security of Singapore\\", \\"public health, public safety, public tranquillity or public finances\\", friendly international relations with other countries, influence the outcome of parliamentary and presidential elections or referendums, incite tension between different groups of people, or diminish public confidence in the public service or general governance of Singapore. Through Section 8, the creation and usage of bots or enabling another person to utilise, with the intention to communicate a false statement of fact in Singapore is prohibited. Section 9 prohibits solicit, receive, or agree to receive a benefit for providing a service which the person knows is or will be used to communicate a false statement of fact in Singapore, if the service is in fact used in the communication. However, Section 9 is not applicable on intermediary services such as internet intermediaries, telecommunications services, public internet access services, or a computing resource service. Contravening these prohibitions may see fines and/or prison terms imposed on the offender.  Correction mechanism  A Correction Direction may be sent out to a communicator of the false statement, instructing the person to place a notice stating that the statement was found to be false and a correction of the false statement. The placement location of this notice may also be specified at an online location or in close proximity of the false statement, or in newspapers. A Stop Communication Direction may be issued as well, instructing the person to disable access of the false statement to end-users in Singapore by a specific time. Concurrently, a Targeted Correction Direction may be sent to internet intermediaries and providers of mass media services to communicate the correction notice in response to a false statement to end-users in Singapore. A Disabling Direction may be issued to disable access an online location to end-users in Singapore. A General Correction Direction may be sent to instruct publication of correction notice on the relevant platforms. If an online location has three or more false statements, it may be tagged as an declared online location. A declared online location will need to place a notice of such declaration for up to two years, and are not able to receive any financial support. Non-compliance of these Directions may accrue fines and/or prison terms by the offender. An Access Block Order on online location may be issued in event of noncompliance as well to instruct Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to order internet service providers to disable access to the online location. To deal with fake accounts and bots, an Account Restriction Direction may be issued to order an internet intermediary to shut down any fake accounts and bots on its platforms and/or prevent the accounts' owners from interacting with end-users in Singapore. Government ministers will issue instructions to correct falsehoods through an appointed Competent Authority, as laid out in Section 6. The Ministry of Communications and Information established a POFMA Office within IMDA to administer the law, on basis that IMDA has relevant connections to the tech industry and experience in administering the Broadcasting Act and other similar content regulation policies. The POFMA Office maintains a registry of Declared Online Locations and also establishes a mechanism for the general public to apply for a relevant Direction or Declaration to the relevant ministry. All applications to vary or cancel any Directions or Declaration must be made within 14 days to the High Court.  Burden of Proof  In September 2020, a panel of senior judges in the Court of Appeal reserved judgement on several legal issues, one of them is whether the burden of proof fell on the statement maker or the minister.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/toc-sdp-pofma-appeals- judgement-court-appeal-13121094https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pofma- curtails-constitutional-right-to-free-speech-sdp-argues-in-apex-court- appealhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/court-appeal-reserves-judgement- toc-sdps-pofma-challenges  Notable uses  The first Correction Direction was issued to Brad Bowyer, a Progress Singapore Party member, to place a correction notice on statements of falsehoods which implied that the Government controls Temasek‚Äôs and GIC‚Äôs commercial decisions, that billions of dollars in investments were wasted on the canned Amaravati city project, and Salt Bae's parent company, which received an investment from Temasek, was debt-laden. The commercial decisions made by Temasek and GIC are asserted to be independent, while only millions of dollars was sunk into the city project, and the investment made in D.ream International BV, and not in one of D.ream International BV‚Äôs shareholders called Doƒüu≈ü Holding that was reportedly in difficulties. Bowyer placed the correction notice when he received the Direction. The PSP subsequently protested, stating that \\"the Act falls short of the values of transparency, independence and accountability\\" and that it could be used by ministers to declare a piece of news to be \\"falsehood, without requiring any justification, criteria or standards\\". Ministry of Law refuted stating that the reasons to use the law were stated clearly, and that the correction notice does not curtail one's freedom of speech, and will instead help end-users make up their mind as to what is the truth. The second Correction Direction was issued to Alex Tan on 28 November 2019 to place a correction notice on a falsehood in a post on the Straits Times Review's Facebook page alleging that People's Action Party would field a Christian evangelist as a candidate in the upcoming elections to garner support from Christian community and possibly turning Singapore into a Christian state, and that a whistleblower was arrested and would be charged for \\"fabricating fake news\\". The claims were found to be false and baseless, with no one being arrested and charged while the site made other ‚Äúscurrilous, absurd‚Äù allegations on Singapore's election process. However, Tan did not intend to comply, saying that he is no longer a Singapore citizen and now lives abroad. This resulted a Targeted Correction Direction being issued to Facebook to place the correction notice on the Facebook post. Tan and his Facebook pages were subjected to subsequent Declared Online Locations, which he did not comply, and Facebook was then mandated to disable Singapore users' access to his pages. Facebook complied, however with concerns that \\"blocking orders such as this are severe and risk being misused to stifle voices and perspectives on the internet\\". = During the 2020 Singaporean general election = In July 2020, during the campaigning period of the general election, five correction directions were issued to the National University of Singapore Society, Channel News Asia, The Online Citizen and New Naratif by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) jointly, taking issue on the following statements made, which the ministries said to be false: > # MOM's email advisory to employers on testing of migrant workers was made > without the advice from public health medical professionals # MOM's advisory > stated that employers would lose their work pass privileges if they brought > their workers for Covid-19 testing # MOM actively discouraged the testing of > workers In response, the Singapore Democratic Party's chairman Paul Tambyah stated that what he said was from a circular from MOM and the advisory was signed by an MOM official, not anybody from Ministry of Health. He added the correction direction was an inappropriate use of POFMA and a complete distraction. He wanted to focus on issues that matter to Singaporeans, instead of arguing about who signed a circular.  Criticism  Local criticism = During the parliamentary debate over the proposed Act, Pritam Singh of the Workers' Party, who was a member of the 13th Parliament of Singapore representing Aljunied GRC, criticised the legislation, saying that \\"ministers should not be the deciding body on what constitutes false matters\\". Pritam argued that the Government should still be able to take down false claims, however the courts should be the avenue which such orders can be legitimise, as an understanding of legislation was that it gave \\"broad latitude to the executive to clamp down on what is misleading but which may not be false per se\\". Pritam's fellow member, Sylvia Lim commented that the process to appeal against the orders could be \\"very onerous\\" to the applicants due to \\"information asymmetry between the Government and individuals\\". An editorial on The Online Citizen questioned why POFMA was not applied on foreign news outlets where there are false statements, and diplomats were responding with lengthy letters to disagree with the false statements instead. = International criticism = The act has been heavily criticised by human rights and free speech organisations. Reporters Without Borders claimed the bill is \\"terrible\\", stating that it is \\"totalitarian\\" and used as a tool for censorship. Reuters states that the act \\"ensnares\\" government critics. After having to remove several posts under the act, Facebook stated that it was \\"concerned\\" by the \\"broad powers\\" the act provides the Singaporean government with.  Controversies  The Media Literacy Council (MLC), an outreach programme under IMDA which promotes digital and media literacy, included satire as an example of fake news in one of its Facebook posts and info-graphics on 5 September 2019. The MLC took down the post and issued an apology on 8 September, saying that they would review their materials. Shanmugan attributed it as a mistake or inaccuracy being made by the MLC.

Completed in 1896, little is known about her service. During World War I, the ship served as a submarine tender. She was sold for scrap in 1920.

They had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. They displaced . Once in service they proved to roll badly so bilge keels were later fitted. The crew of the Bouvines class numbered 15 officers and 318 ratings; service as a flagship added 5 more officers and 33 more ratings.Sturton, p. 177 The Bouvines-class ships were powered by two inclined horizontal triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft. Amiral Tr√©houarts engines used steam provided by 16 Belleville boilers that exhausted through a single funnel. The engines produced a total of and gave a top speed of on trials.

The other four were carried on pivot mounts with gun shields on the shelter deck directly above the four casemated guns on the corners of the superstructure. Initially four Canon de Mod√®le 1885 Hotchkiss guns were carried for defence from torpedo boats in the fighting top in the military mast, but this was later increased to eight, with the new guns on the superstructure. Initially ten Hotchkiss revolving cannon were positioned on the superstructure, but this was reduced to three when the additional 47 mm guns were added. Two torpedo tubes were mounted above the waterline, but they were removed in 1906. The Bouvines class had a full-length waterline armor belt of steel that tapered from the maximum thickness of amidships to at the ship's ends. The ships were intended to have of the belt showing above the waterline, but they were overweight as completed and only of the belt was above the waterline. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was and it was joined to the top of the armor belt. The main turret armor was thick although the barbettes were only thick. The plates protecting the conning tower measured in thickness.Sturton, pp. 177‚Äì178 Construction and career Amiral Tr√©houart, named for Admiral Fran√ßois Thomas Tr√©houart, was authorized in the 1889 Naval Programme and was ordered from Arsenal de Lorient. The ship was laid down on 20 October 1890 under the name of Tr√©houart and launched on 16 May 1893. She was given her final name on 25 March 1895 and was completed on 29 June 1896.Silverstone, p. 88 In 1914 Amiral Tr√©houart became a submarine depot ship.

As Eichler and his family solely rented the home, they moved in 1945 when the home was sold to Betty and Louis Frank, who occupied the home for 55 years, which accounts for its \\"Bazett-Frank\\" house. The Franks were also Wright clients. In the mid-1950s, the Franks commissioned Wright to add a playroom onto the structure.* Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

The NQSC replaces state-by-state NDIS quality legislation, gaining responsibility on a rolling basis from 1 July 2018 to 1 July 2020. More than 10,000 cases are submitted each month to the NQSC.  Purpose  The NQSC was created in December 2017 to \\"improve the quality and safety of NDIS supports and services.\\" The Commission exists as part of a federal agreement between the Australian Government and states and territory governments, the NDIS Quality and Safeguarding Framework. It aligns the various quality and safeguard programs each state and territory developed during the initial rollout of the NDIS, benefiting from additional federal investigative and regulatory powers.

Starting 1 July 2019, it also gained responsibility in Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory. The NQSC was created under the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 through the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Quality and Safeguards Commission and Other Measures) Act 2017. More than 10,000 cases are submitted each month to the NQSC. The Commission was originally planned to rollout to Western Australia, the final jurisdiction, on 1 July 2020, however it was postponed by the Government of Western Australia until 1 December to allow providers to \\"focus on critical support issues for people with disability during the COVID-19 recovery period\\".  Structure  The NQSC is led by its Commissioner, Registrar and Chief Operating Officer.

Atkinson, was a Canadian painter of landscape whose work was influenced by Impressionism combined with aesthetics drawn from the Barbizon school combined with the Hague School. \\"He delights in quiet communion with peaceful pastoral scenes\\", wrote E.F.B. Johnston in 1912.  Biography  Indian Summer Evening, Normandy (1899). Watercolour on paper. Government of Ontario Art Collection. Atkinson, born in England, moved with his family to Oshawa, Ontario as a child because his father opened an English Drug Store in the town. He attended the University of Toronto, studying chemistry, and worked as a pharmacist before he took the decision to be an artist. He trained at Ontario School of Art in 1881 where he studied with Robert Harris (painter), then in 1883-1884, attended at the Pennsylvania Academy, studying with Thomas Eakins. While in Philadelphia, he roomed with George Agnew Reid. In 1889, he travelled to Paris, France, to study at the Acad√©mie Julian and took private lessons with several teachers, of whom the most important was Paul-Louis Delance. That summer, he painted in Pont-Aven in Brittany, an art colony which favored North American students. October (1904). Oil on canvas. Government of Ontario Art Collection. From Pont-Aven, Atkinson wrote letters home, describing his experiences which were published in his hometown newspaper,The Vindicator. Paul Gauguin was in Pont-Aven that summer and one day when Atkinson was painting an old mill, Gauguin, passing by, told him to use stronger colour, saying that (Atkinson recalled later)), \\"If the sky is blue, paint the roof red. If the roof is blue, paint the sky green.\\" (Atkinson's account of the meeting is recounted in the Toronto Star of 1926.) It is clear that that Atkinson followed the broad outline of Gauguin\`s advice and strengthened his colour. The American artist Robert Henri, in Pont-Aven in September that year, noted that Atkinson had keyed his colour up to the highest pitch. The Old Town, Brittany, Night Effect (1913). Oil on canvas. Government of Ontario Art Collection. After Paris, Atkinson worked for some time in Devon, England and in Holland before returning to Canada. He settled in Toronto. His paintings in Canada reveal that he never forgot what he had learned abroad: the low tones and subject-matter of the Barbizon school and the Hague school as well as the loose brushwork of a modified form of Impressionism. The light in his work might be hazy, but the forms are luminous and his use of colour, though muted, is brighter than that of his predecessors. For the period, his work was considered progressive and as a result, he was made an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and in 1907, invited to be one of the founders of the Canadian Art Club in Toronto. His paintings are in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Government of Ontario Art Collection, Toronto; the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa; and The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax. In 2009, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in his hometown today remembered his work with an exhibition, William Atkinson, Gertrude Spurr Cutts, Florence McGillivray: Art and Identity in the Region of Durham.

History  The Dutch Reformed Church of Zwartsluis was constructed in 1604, after the previous medieval church was torn down in 1581. Some of the original structural material was used to fortify the new church. The building was first renovated in 1649 with a second pillar on the north side, then again in 1743 by expanding two pillars eastwards. Hervormde Kerk of Zwartsluis was renovated in 1865, whereby the columns between the pillars were split away and the two barrel-formed vaults were supplanted by one enormous put vault with plaster improvements.  Steeple  The original steeple was demolished in 1930 due to deterioration. The steeple was rebuilt by Hendrik Schraa on the southwest side of the church building in 1932.  Organ  The organ in the Hervormde Kerk of Zwartsluis is a designated Rijksmonument.  Clocks  The congregation steeple contains two clocks, one huge and one little. The smaller clock was built by Henrick Wegewart in 1606 and the larger clock was built by Adriaen Steijlaert in 1566. The larger clock was one of the historic thirteen clocks that Steijlaert originally made for the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam. The larger clock is decorated with a ship, the Amsterdam coat of arms, as well as depictions of Saint Peter, Mary, and Jesus. During World War II, both clocks were taken by German occupiers in 1943. The smaller clock was returned intact, but the larger clock was so extensively damaged that Jacobus van Bergen had to reconstruct it at Midwolda in 1946.  Pulpit  Dutch woodcarver Hermannus van Arnhem is believed to have constructed the pulpit in 1683. It is extensively decorated with woodcarving detail.  Current usage  As of 2007, the Dutch Reformed congregation has been reestablished at the Hervormde Kerk of Zwartsluis.

He played as a defender. Football career Graf played most of his youth football by FC St. Gallen, with a short visit to FC Gossau, and advanced to the St. Gallen first team, who played in the Nationalliga A as an 18-year-old. During his first two seasons he played only three games and was therefore was loaned to Br√ºhl St. Gallen in the second tier of Swiss football to obtain more playing experience. Following his return to his club of origin, things did not work out as Graf wished and therefore a few years later, in 1977, he moved on to Young Fellows Z√ºrich. But he could not help the Young Fellows from suffering relegation to the Nationalliga B that season. Thus, for the following season, Graf signed for Chiasso. Here he became a regular starter for the team and stayed for three seasons. Graf joined FC Basel's first team for their 1981‚Äì82 season under manager Helmut Benthaus. He played his domestic league debut for his new club in the home game at the St. Jakob Stadium on 15 August 1981 as Basel won 2‚Äì0 against FC Aarau. Between the years 1981 and 1983 Graf played a total of 43 games for Basel scoring one goal. 19 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, two in the Swiss Cup, two in the Swiss League Cup, seven in the Cup of the Alps and 13 were friendly games. He scored his first and only goal for the club on 30 September 1982 in the test game as Basel won 3‚Äì1 against German team SV Weil. Following his time with Basel, Graf moved on to Wettingen where he played for three seasons. In 1986 he moved to Winterthur where he ended his active playing career.  Private life  As a youngster Graf completed his apprenticeship as Typwriter mechanic. After his professional football career, he worked for a while in the insurance industry, but then he switched to advertising technology. Up until his retirement, he worked in marketing for the company Historika in Oberuzwil, after he obtained his business diploma while working for them. Graf married local girl Gabi Fantelli and they had twins. In 2011 their son Leandro lost his life in a motorcycle accident. Soon after, Bruno Graf was diagnosed with cancer. His daughter is quoted in saying: \\"My father was a fighter, he remained an optimist, full of all the joys of life, he enjoyed his retirement despite illness, with traveling and by meeting old friends\\". On 15 May 2020, after a s two-day stay at the St. Gallen Cantonal Hospital, he died in the presence of his wife Gabi and his daughter Vanessa Graf. ReferencesSources * Die ersten 125 Jahre.

Biography  He took his first art lessons at the , then moved to Madrid to finish his studies at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Encouraged by regional showings in Valladolid, which were well-received, in 1862 he participated in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts with a painting depicting \\"The Cid's oath in Santa Gadea\\". Two years later, he presented a Biblical scene showing the \\"Raising of Jairus' daughter\\", in hopes of winning a scholarship to Rome, but he was not successful. He had no more significant showings until 1878, when he received a third-class medal for his painting \\"An Excorcism\\", which was then sent to the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1881, the city of M√°laga acquired his painting of the two lovers whose suicide inspired the name of a local landmark; the \\"Pe√±a de los Enamorados\\" (Lovers' Rock).Museo Nacional del Prado.

It lies to the south east of Canonmills, west of Leith Walk and south of Leith, incorporating the northernmost extent of Edinburgh's New Town UNESCO heritage site. The area was formerly open fields which became the second and penultimate location of the Royal Botanic Garden in 1763 . HistoryRoyal Botanic Garden Edinburgh= In 1763, the Edinburgh botanic garden moved away from the city's pollution, from St. Anne's Yard, near Holyrood Palace, to a larger plot in then open fields between the city and its port, Leith, to the west of the main thoroughfare, Leith Walk, under the direction of Prof John Hope. After sixty years, in the early 1820s under the direction of new Curator, William McNab, the garden moved to its present location, in Inverleith. =The Royal Edinburgh Zoological Gardens= Scotland's first zoo was called The Royal Edinburgh Zoological Gardens, preceding the current Edinburgh Zoo by nearly a century. It was situated south of East Claremont Street, in the gardens of Broughton Hall , then owned by James Donaldson and opened as a zoological park nine years after his death in 1830. The Zoological Gardens were also frequently used as a venue for concerts, acrobatics shows and displays of fireworks and Montgolfier balloons . With the animals suffering from disease, cramped cages - the whole site covered only - and unsuitable climate, the park was closed after less than 20 years. In 1857 the house was demolished and the gardens redeveloped as new tenement buildings, the residents of which continued to pay feuduty to the Donaldson Trust until its abolition in Scotland on 28 November 2004. BuildingsBellevue Crescent= Bellevue Crescent, Edinburgh, UK. Facing North Bellevue Crescent is a classical 34-bay sweeping curved terrace, part of the first extension of the New Town planned by Robert Reid and William Sibbald in 1802, designed by architect Thomas Bonnar in 1818. Construction started the following year in 1819. However, the design had to be radically revised after the finalistion of the location of Bellevue Church at the apex of the sweep of the crescent in 1822. The southern section was completed in 1832, but the northern section was not built for another 50 years, until 1882‚Äì4, still following the original facade design, but slightly modified by David Cousin. =Broughton St Mary‚Äôs= Broughton St Marys Church, Edinburgh, UK. Side elevation, facing south Originally the structure was known simply as Bellevue Church (not to be confused with the smaller Bellevue Chapel, directly north of Bellevue Crescent), then named St Mary's Parish Church. It finally became Broughton St Mary's in 1992 as a result of the union with Broughton McDonald Church. Designed by architect Thomas Brown (then Superintendent of City Works for Edinburgh), the site for the Church was finalised on 11 September 1822 at the northern extent of Edinburgh's New Town development. Although the Church was opened for public worship on 12 December 1824, the striking and unusual colonnaded tower was not finished until the following year and the clock was not installed for another year after that. Other notable features include the stained glass windows installed in 1864, the unusual heavily embossed wallpaper added in 1897 to resemble wooden panelling around the gallery and the organ, built by Thomas Lewis of London, and installed in 1882. The pulpit, based on the Athenian Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, is one of the few surviving pulpits of the 1820s and reputedly the highest in Scotland. =The Botanic Cottage= At the entrance to the Royal Botanic Garden in its Bellevue based incarnation, in 1764, the \\"Botanic Cottage\\" was built, designed by John Adam and James Craig (designer of Edinburgh's New Town plan). It served as a home for the principal gardener, a classroom where medical student were taught botany and the main entry point to the gardens through doors in the wing walls. Despite the Garden's further relocation, this time to Inverleith in 1820, the cottage remained on the garden's original site, facing Leith Walk, for nearly another two hundred years, in an increasing state of disrepair and in the early 2000s it was earmarked for demolition, its significance forgotten. In 2008, after a community campaign, the building was painstakingly relocated stone by numbered stone over 8 years to a site within the current gardens. =Edinburgh Central Bus Depot= Originally designed by G M Holmes and the prolific Ebenezer James MacRae, and constructed of red brick with ashlar red sandstone dressings and incorporating a large, central, circular glass dome cupola in just a remarkable few weeks in 1922 for the Edinburgh Exhibition Association as Edinburgh's Industrial Exhibition Hall, the building briefly played host to many large national shows through the 1920s, including the Scottish Motor Show and Edinburgh's Christmas Fun Fair. The building was extended in 1933 to become a bus depot the following year, and extended again 1963. =East Claremont Street drill hall= East Claremont Street drill hall was designed by Thomas Duncan Rhind in the free Renaissance style, facing on to East Claremont Street, directly west of Claremont Crescent. =Claremont Cresent= Claremont Crescent, Edinburgh, UK. Facing West Originally designed by William Burn in 1823, sited at the summit of Sandy Hill (lead to by the later added West Annandale Street), allowing it to look across the grounds of Broughton Hall to the then Royal Botanic Garden and beyond that, Carlton Hill, Claremont Crescent is an A listed small, neo-classic crescent terrace, completed in 1860 by Charles Kinnear and John Dick Peddie. =Mansfield Traquair Centre= Mansfield Traquair Centre, Edinburgh, UK. Front elevation. The murals inside the former Catholic Apostolic Church, designed by Robert Rowand Anderson \\\\- regarded as his most ambitious eclesial project - and built in 1893 are Phoebe Anna Traquair's best-known work and lead to the building to become often referred to as \\"Edinburgh‚Äôs Sistine Chapel\\" and confirmed her international recognition. =McDonald Road Power Station= McDonald Road Power Station, Edinburgh, UK. Front elevation Designed by John Cooper and built in 1899, this former Coal Fired Power station highly unusually had an Italian Renaissance basilica style sandstone frontage. The station originally powered the Leith Walk tram system and although it still houses an operational sub station, the building is in such poor repair, with the frontage now badly disintegrating, that it was put on the Buildings at Risk register in 2009, where it remains. The towering red brick chimney stack, however, is well preserved. =Claremont Court Estate= Claremont Court housing estate, facing East Claremont Court is a rare example of a Modernist style municipal flatted housing scheme (surrounding a landscape courtyard) situated this close to the New Town UNESCO zone. The scheme was designed by Basil Spence and Partners (Peter Ferguson, partner in charge; Richard Cassidy, job architect; T Harley Haddow, engineers), constructed between 1959 and 1962 and Grade C listed 19 July 2011 as an important example of Scottish post-war housing.

Early life Bulloch, along with his twin sister Yvonne, was born on 19 February 1916 in Lisburn, County Antrim, to Samuel, a linen trader, and Elsie Bulloch. His family moved to Malone Park, Belfast, when Bulloch was very young. Bulloch was educated at Mourne Grange School in Kilkeel and later Campbell College, Belfast ‚Äì the same schools as his older brother Hugh Larmor McLearn Bulloch. While at Campbell College, he joined the Officers' Training Corps, becoming the sergeant piper. Bulloch became interested in joining the Royal Air Force after attending a lecture by a Wing Commander from RAF Aldergrove at Campbell College, who offered a flight in a Vickers Virginia. Military service1936‚Äì1941= No. 206 Squadron Lockheed Hudson Mk.I, which Bulloch flew between March and December 1940. Bulloch signed up with the Royal Air Force in 1936 on a short service commission, having been denied entry to Royal Air Force College Cranwell on medical grounds. He underwent his initial training at Prestwick, Ayrshire, in the winter of 1936, before moving on to No. 6 Flying Training School at RAF Netheravon, flying the Hawker Hart and Hawker Audax. He received his commission as a Pilot officer in May 1937. Bulloch was posted to No. 220 Squadron, Coastal Command, who were based at RAF Bircham Newton, Norfolk, flying Avro Anson Mk.Is. He was flying with No. 220 Squadron at the outbreak of war in September 1939, before being transferred to No. 206 Squadron in early 1940. Bulloch began flying the Lockheed Hudson Mk.I after they were delivered to the squadron in March 1940. While operating the Hudson, Bulloch flew sorties over the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts ‚Äì helping to support the British Expeditionary Force evacuate Dunkirk in May/June 1940. During this time, Bulloch shot down two German aircraft and was part of a detachment at RAF Aldergrove to flew anti-submarine sorties over the Atlantic. In September 1940, he attacked Channel ports that were being used in preparation for Operation Sea Lion. At the end of his first tour, Bulloch was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in October 1940, and was mentioned in dispatches the next month. Now a Flight Lieutenant, in December 1940 instead of being given leave, Bulloch was assigned to what would become RAF Ferry Command and was tasked with bringing aircraft across from North America to the United Kingdom. On 13/14 April 1941, Bulloch became the first pilot to fly the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress (known as the Fortress Mk.I in RAF service) across the Atlantic, arriving at Prestwick after an eight-hour flight. Bulloch later delivered Consolidated Liberator GR.Is in June 1941. =No. 120 Squadron= No. 120 Squadron, circa 1941‚Äì42. No. 120 Squadron was stood-up at RAF Nutts Corner, County Antrim, on 2 June 1941 as a maritime reconnaissance unit, equipped with the Liberator GR.I. Bulloch marked a return to operational duties in August 1941, when he was posted to No. CXX Squadron. On 21 October 1941, he participated in the squadron's first attack against a U-Boat using three depth charges, however the damage was inconclusive. Bulloch made six more U-Boat sightings over the next nine months, before relocating to RAF Ballykelly, County Londonderry, in July 1942. In September 1942, he was detached to RAF Reykjavik in Iceland, from here Bulloch sank the squadron's first submarine U-597 in the mid-Atlantic on 12 October 1942 while flying AM929. For his successful attack, Bulloch was awarded a bar to his DFC. On 1 December 1942, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his attacks on U-89 and U-132 on 5 November, for which he was credited with sinking U-132 and damaging U-89.Bowman 2014, pp. 79. On 8 December 1942, Bulloch came to the aid of convoy HX.217 who were under attack by a wolfpack ‚Äì sinking U-611 and attacking another five with depth charges and machine gun fire ‚Äì including U-254 which was sunk after it had collided with U-211.

Combined Swedish-Hanoverian-L√ºneburgian forces (guarantors by the treaty of Holstein-Gottorp, along with England and the Netherlands) of 17,500 men, under the supreme command of Nils Gyllenstierna, were ready to march towards the 20,000 strong Danish army under Ferdinand Willem, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, to relief the Siege of T√∂nning. Danish forces of 5,600 men were positioned partly behind the river of Bille, in a 45 kilometer long defensive line, in an attempt to block them. Gyllenstierna, approaching with the bulk of his forces from the south ‚Äî around 11,000 Swedes and L√ºneburgians ‚Äî split these in two; he marched towards 2,000 Danes with four cannons at Reinbek, under Carl Rudolf, Prince of W√ºrttemberg (the brother of Willem), with about 5,000-7,000 men of his own. The other section was ordered to go around and attack the Danish positions from the back. After reaching Reinbek, Gyllenstierna sent two Swedish battalions to the bridge, while four cannons were dragged up to the heights, by which a rather insignificant firefight commenced between the two sides. The fighting continued until dawn, when the Prince of W√ºrttemberg, fearing he would get outflanked, decided to destroy the bridge and withdraw with all of his forces. Only a fraction of the two armies had been engaged in the fighting and the losses sustained on both sides had barely reached ten men. The siege was lifted soon thereafter and, after a Swedish landing in Zealand on August 4, the Danish king Frederick IV signed the Peace of Travendal on August 18, 1700.

They were small ( long), short-bodied animals with three recognizable sections: an oval head divided along the midline, ten limb-bearing segments forming a cylindrical trunk that tapered slightly towards the front, and a characteristic swollen tail formed by a modified segment that tapers at its rear into an \\"anal segment\\". The cuticle forming their exoskeletons was thick, heavily calcified, and composed of two layers. The genus was named by David Page in 1856 for a \\"small phyllopod, or the larval stage of some larger crustacean\\" from Silurian deposits of Angus, Scotland (formerly Forfarshire), but it was not until 1882 that Ben Peach recognized the affinities of this animal to millipedes and named the species K. forfarensis. Peach named another Silurian species, K. obanensis, from Old Red Sandstone deposits from the Scottish island of Kerrera in 1899; John Almond questioned the affinity of this species to Kampecaris in 1985, for several reasons including the presence of 14 segments behind the head. In 1951, B.B. Clarke described a Devonian species, K. dinmorensis, from Dinmore Hill, Herefordshire, England. Another Devonian species, K. tuberculata, was subsequently recognized as being closer to flat-backed millipedes in the group Archipolypoda, and renamed to Palaeodesmus.

After the Crossing of the D√ºna Charles went into an alliance with the Sapieha family to gain his support in dethroning Augustus II the Strong from the Polish throne, in exchange for protection from rival families in Samogitia, such as the Ogi≈Ñski family. After initial engagements between Swedish forces and those loyal to Grzegorz Antoni Ogi≈Ñski, the Swedish king personally takes command of the troops and engages Grzegorz at the town of Tryszki; after a brief encounter, Grzegorz is forced on the run and, with Charles being hot on his heels, eventually retreats out of Samogitia altogether. A Swedish detachment is established at Wilno (Vilnius) in Lithuania, as a sort of forward operating base before the inevitable Swedish invasion of Poland (1701‚Äì1706); further engagements, foremost the Battle of Dars≈´ni≈°kis, confirms the Swedish invasion. Although only a small action in a major war, the battle quickly sparked false rumours to be spread around Europe; one spoke of the death of Charles, somewhere in Lithuania, while the other mentioned a major defeat for Grzegorz, involving many thousands of participants. Prelude The Swedish king had, ever since the Crossing of the D√ºna and the conquest of Courland earlier that year, contemplated actions against the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth to have Augustus II, whom Charles considered as too unpredictable, dethroned. In the wake of the Lithuanian power struggle the Sapieha family pleaded for Swedish protection against, among others, the Ogi≈Ñski family (supported by Augustus II), which frequently raided their estates in the Duchy of Samogitia. Charles, who sought political support within the Commonwealth, seized the opportunity and, in September, sent two contingents as protection; 600 horse under Alexander Hummerhielm, and 200 horse under Johan August Meijerfeldt. These were frequently being harassed by Grzegorz Antoni Ogi≈Ñski's forces (the governor-general of the Duchy), as a consequence. The fighting escalated as Grzegorz numbers grew larger and the two Swedish commanders soon requested reinforcements. Charles answered by assembling an additional 100 dragoons and 400 foot guards, merged the contingents together and rode out on December 12 ‚Äî with only a handful of followers and without noticing the headquarters ‚Äî to personally lead the combined forces in Samogitia and destroy the troubling army under Grzegorz. Battle On December 15, the Swedish horse reached Tryszki, owned by the Ogi≈Ñski family. Here they stumbled upon the rearguard of the Lithuanian army (2 companies) which escaped only after destroying the bridge leading into the town, forcing the Swedes to wade across the river; the bulk of the Lithuanian forces, with most of the inhabitants, had left the town just before the Swedish arrival. Once across, Charles set up camp and left merely 40 men in the town square as guards, additional outposts or patrols were forbidden. Just before midnight, at 23:00, Grzegorz launched a surprise attack on the sleeping Swedes; between 1,000 and 2,000 of his cavalry rushed into the town, uncontested, and caused panic by killing Swedish horses and igniting the houses. The town square, which was in danger of getting completely overwhelmed, was saved as dismounted Swedish dragoons arrived and forced the Lithuanians away. Grzegorz Antoni Ogi≈Ñski in 1702, by Fran√ßois de la Croix =Grzegorz on the run= Soon Charles personally appeared with the bulk of the cavalry and rapidly counterattacked. The battle shifted tides as more Swedish troops mobilized and the Lithuanians had, after an hourly long struggle, been defeated; they were chased for about five kilometers before the fighting stopped. Grzegorz, who had been close to being captured ‚Äî in the chaotic retreat, Swedish Lieutenant colonel Claes Bonde (who would make a name for himself in the events leading up to the Battle of Warsaw, where he died) captured his timpani, servant and reserve horse, but was unable to capture Grzegorz himself ‚Äî lost 140 men and retreated into Lithuania, towards Kowno (Kaunas); a bunch of wounded Lithuanians were found on the following morning in the neighbouring villages. The Swedes, who had 10 men killed and 18 wounded, struck camp on December 17, as soon as the weather allowed and the wounded had been sent home, to give chase. Kelmƒó, another town owned by the Ogi≈Ñski family, was ravaged and burnt down by the Swedes in their pursue of the Lithuanian hetman. Aftermath Charles once again forced Grzegorz on the run at Kowno, towards Wilno (Vilnius), after which he left a 1,300 man strong garrison under Hummerhielm in the town, before heading back towards the main army in Courland ‚Äî away ‚Äî with only a few companions. While the complete destruction of Grzegorz' forces had failed, they had been successfully forced out of Samogitia; although they soon returned to the vicinity of Kowno and fought several skirmishes with the Swedish troops posted there. Nonetheless, an important Swedish forward operating base in Lithuania had been established, in form of Kowno. Charles XII of Sweden in 1706, by Johan David Schwartz =Swedish army invades= As Charles reached the Swedish headquarters in Courland, on January 9, 1702, he immediately ordered the main army to prepare for a march into Lithuania ‚Äî and the inevitable Swedish invasion of Poland ‚Äî to reinforce Hummerhielm at Kowno, in contrast to the advice of most of his generals. Hummerhielm's troops remained quite active despite being heavily outnumbered, with an insufficient amount of provisions, forage and ammunition; on March 18, he beat 12 banners of the Wi≈õniowiecki family ‚Äî another enemy to the Sapieha's ‚Äî at Jieznas, and there seized ten metal cannons, of which he could only bring back four to Kowno. Three days later, a small party of 40 men sent out by Hummerhielm to gather supplies, was attacked at Osinitza by 1,700 men under Micha≈Ç Serwacy Wi≈õniowiecki, the Swedes were beaten back with a loss of 17‚Äì22 men. The Swedish retaliation did not wait as Hummerhielm assembled a force of 130 cavalry and 100 infantry and marched against the Lithuanians to collect the remaining six guns at Jieznas; these events led to the Battle of Dars≈´ni≈°kis, where the Swedish cavalry was annihilated and Hummerhielm captured. The news of Hummerhielm's defeat deeply angered Charles who promptly proceeded with the advance of the Swedish army into the commonwealth. This forced Grzegorz party to retreat to the rich-wooded areas in the northeastern Lithuania, from where he would keep harassing the Swedes who were left behind to hold Courland, under Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt. =Rumours after the battle= Shortly after the battle of Tryszki and the following chase, the Swedish main army had received rumours saying Charles XII had been killed somewhere between Kowno and Vilnius; he had supposedly been chasing Grzegorz deep into Lithuania. On the contrary, other rumours spoke of a great battle between Charles and Ogi≈Ñski's forces; the latter had, with 10,000 men (more than twice as many as the Swedes), been decisively defeated and forced on the run, after having lost 2,000 men killed. These rumours made it into several later publications, including \\"The History of Poland Under Augustus II\\", and \\"The History of the Wars, of His Late Majesty Charles XII, King of Sweden\\".

Prelude The governor of Lemberg, Franciszek Ga≈Çecki, had earlier refused to pay a contribution demanded by the Swedes. Charles XII of Sweden, likely angered by this, struck camp at Jaros≈Çaw, on September 1, and marched towards Lemberg with 16 regiments. He arrived with his vanguard on September 5The same day as the Swedish garrison at Warsaw surrendered. and immediately drove off a force of around two thousand under Janusz Antoni Wi≈õniowiecki and Stanis≈Çaw Mateusz Rzewuski, after a brief fight. The garrison, about 600 strong (including 200 Saxons), then quickly scorched the suburbs and opened fire with cannons. Battle Charles, who wanted to storm the town immediately, proceeded with a reconnaissance from the High Castle and ordered three dragoon regiments to prepare to attack; heavy rain, however, forced him to postpone it until the following day. While the dragoon regiments made preparations, the rest of the force encircled the town to block any relief forces. The following day, September 6, the attack was carried out. About 50 Swedes stormed a fortified monastery outside the town, while Charles with the remainder of the force climbed the earthwork, where a wooden wall had to be cut through. This protected the large fortification walls directly surrounding the town. As they attacked, they were shot at through the portholes of the wooden wall. The defenders were, however, effectively forced away by grenades. As the Swedes broke through, the defenders panicked and ran towards the main gate accessing the town, with Charles pursuing them. In the chaos, the Swedes managed to take control of the gate, then the town square, and soon the whole town, all in half an hour.Similar to how the Battle of Pu≈Çtusk played out. The fortified monastery had also been captured. Aftermath Between 30 and 40 Swedes had been killed or wounded during the fighting while the garrison lost about 530 men captured and between 50 and 60 killed, apart from a few armed citizens.The Swedes seized the weapons from about 600 armed citizens after the battle. Franciszek Ga≈Çecki, along with his captured men (with the exception of the Saxons), soon went over to the side of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski and the Swedes, and were once again garrisoned in Lemberg. Charles struck camp with his forces on September 23-24, and marched towards Warsaw which had been captured by Augustus II of Poland. He soon caught up with the Saxon forces, under Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, at the Battle of Punitz. SourcesNotesReferencesBibliography= * *Fryxell, Anders (1861).

He was a professor of the national economy of the local law faculty and in 1921‚Äì1922 and 1925‚Äì1926 also its dean. He founded his own teleological school of economics, dealing with the assessment of the purposefulness of the behavior of all economic entities. His merits in the field of national economy were awarded for membership in the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, became an extraordinary member on March 19, 1927, a full member on April 9, 1946.Members of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts 1890‚Äì1952, p. 69. Since its inception in 1929, he was also a member of the Czechoslovak statistical companies. It is little known that after the Munich Agreement (October 1, 1938) he succeeded in initiating the transport of the remains of Karel Hynek M√°cha from Litomƒõ≈ôice, which was to fall to Germany, to Prague.MED, Jaroslav.

After the coup d'√©tat in February 1948, he abdicated all his university positions and forcibly withdrew from public life. In August 1952, he had to move out of Prague on the basis of administrative persecution, but he managed to obtain the consent of the authorities so that he could return to his native Hrabynƒõ.VENCOVSK√ù, Franti≈°ek.

He faced the persistent bullying of the communist totalitarian power, which consisted mainly in constant house searches and also in the fact that his originally very high pension was drastically reduced several times to the absolute minimum. Even in these difficult conditions, he was able to devote himself to his scientific work. He focused mainly on logic, the national economy, the controversies of the two previous disciplines and the writing of memories. Most of it remained only in manuscripts, and even after 1989 only a few titles from that period were published.ƒåechura, Jaroslav. Countess tusculum of Karel Engli≈°.

He died after years of hardship in very modest conditions with only the support of family and close friends. Family life  On June 5, 1906, he married Maria Gr√∂grov√° (1880‚Äì1953), the daughter of a tax inspector from Uhersk√Ω Brod, in Prague.Register of Devotees, Church of St. Ludmila, 1906‚Äì1908, slide 35.Opava Weekly, 20 June 1906, p. 4 (available online in the National Library of the Czech Republic).

He gradually became the most important theorist of interwar Czechoslovakia. Unlike other economic theorists, he had the opportunity to verify his scientific conclusions in practice and then possibly revise them. As a teacher, he influenced two generations of Czech economists and was the founder of the so-called Brno School of Economics. He began his scientific work before the First World War in the field of social policy. His work at the university led him to the need for theoretical mastery of all economics and the development of the concept of economic cognition. It was based on the theory of marginal utility against the then prevailing causal interpretation of economic issues. He was inspired by the method of economic cognition, the so-called teleological theory, from the Vienna School of Economics, of which he was (similarly to Ra≈°√≠n under the influence of A. Br√°f) a follower. According to Karel Engli≈°, economics is a science of order, where individuals and entire nations try to take care of maintaining and improving their lives. Order in the economy is based on purposeful thinking. The peak of his theoretical activity isSystem of national economy. In this extensive two-volume work (he has a total of about 1,700 pages) he summarized his economic teachings. In his theoretical work, he was influenced mainly by neo-Kantianism and was inspired by the normative theory of Hans Kelsen. He analyzed the teleological way of cognition and thinking, because man's action is always held for a purpose.Dictionary of Czech Philosophers - Karel Engli≈° [online]. Brno: Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University [cit. 2014-07-25]. Available online. In any economic system, all subjects always try to achieve an improvement in their existence, so also in the economy he rejected simple causality. However, while in individualistic (capitalist) systems everyone decides on the satisfaction of their needs, in solidarity (socialist) it is the care of another, foreign entity, which can therefore no longer have such a good overview. In practice, however, there are always mixed systems. Engli≈° himself was not a supporter of a controlled economy, he saw its justification only in cases of temporary critical situations. Although he worked closely with Ra≈°√≠n, in many respects he differed significantly from him. He criticized his deflationary policy, his persistent efforts to strengthen the Czech currency and his insistence on the gold standard. He had good reasons for this: already between 1921 and 1923, the price level fell by 43%, but exports fell by 53% and unemployment rose from 72 to 207 thousand people. Although the deflationary policy was revoked by the parliament in 1925, the leadership of the National Bank continued to insist on it, even though during the economic crisis the price of gold rose sharply, and with it the exchange rate of the koruna. Between 1930 and 1933, the price level decreased by 19%, but exports fell by 64% and unemployment rose from 105 to 736 thousand people. It was not until 1934 that Engli≈° was able to enforce the devaluation of the crown by 16%, which was not enough.Koderov√° et al., Theory of Money, p. 260n. Engli≈° was originally a perfectionist who mastered complex verbal theoretical constructions. He is characterized by extensive controversies with opponents, where he exhaustively discusses all arguments and counter-arguments. As a lecturer, he enriched his speeches with deep practical excursions. In 1991, President V√°clav Havel awarded him the Order of Tomas Garrigu Masaryk III in memoriam. class for outstanding merits for democracy and human rights.Karel Engli≈° and Hrabynƒõ, p. 98.

The battle was part of a larger Swedish military operation aiming to destroy the Russian Baltic Fleet, anchored deeper into the Vyborg Bay, at Vysotsk (north of the Uransari island). For this task, Gustav III of Sweden ordered three divisions of the Swedish Navy and Archipelago fleet to penetrate the narrow passages, which were guarded by Russian coastal batteries. William Sidney Smith, an Englishman, commanded the right Swedish division which encountered a battery at the edge of the Uransari island, called Kachis Capel. The Swedish forces consisted of the yacht Aurora, four gun longboats, 38 gun sloops and yawls,Sill√©n (2020), m/d.

After about an hour of artillery duel the Russian coastal battery exploded, by which time the Swedish guards landed on the island. After a short struggle the Russian guards retreated, with a loss of four men killed and 26-28 captured.

The battle had no strategic effect as the other Swedish divisions had not sailed out accordingly due to bad weather, and Smith, being unsupported, was soon driven off the island by the Russians. The operation was later cancelled all together by the Swedish king in preparation to break out the Russian blockage. Some days later the Russians made an unsuccessful attempt at destroying the Swedish Archipelago fleet in the Battle of Bj√∂rk√∂sund.Winberg (2020), pp. 33‚Äì34 The Swedes managed to break out and escape at the Battle of Vyborg Bay the day after, but with heavy losses.

Richmond was the first city in the Southeastern United States to see rioting over Floyd's death. Richmond, formerly the capital of the short-lived Confederate States of America, saw much arson and vandalism to monuments connected with that polity, particularly along Monument Avenue. Protests began in late May 2020 and by mid-August 2020 had gradually subsided. Given the city's Confederate roots, many of the areas of attack by protesters were the statues along Monument Avenue, near The Fan neighborhood of Richmond. During the first wave of Floyd protests, all major monuments (except the Arthur Ashe Monunent) were defaced and sprayed with graffiti. Five statues were toppled by protesters. Some of the statues toppled included the Jefferson Davis Memorial, to the Confederacy's first and only president. Additionally, statues of Christopher Columbus and Confederate General Williams Carter Wickham were toppled. Additionally, the Howitzer Monument and the Sons of Virginia statue, were toppled by protesters. Background On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during an arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit bill. Floyd was apprehended by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer (since fired) who knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed. While Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, Floyd was begging for his life and repeatedly saying \\"I can't breathe\\". Chauvin was on patrol with three other Minneapolis Police officers: J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao. Kueng, Lane, and Thao further restrained Floyd, while also preventing bystanders from intervening on the arrest. During the final three minutes Floyd was motionless and had no pulse while Chauvin ignored onlookers' pleas to remove his knee, which he did not do until medics told him to. The next day, May 26, when videos made by witnesses and security cameras became public, all four officers were fired. Two autopsies found Floyd's death to be a homicide. Initially, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, to which was later added second-degree murder by Minnesota Attorney General, Keith Ellison; the three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Floyd's death triggered demonstrations and protests in many U.S. cities and around the world against police brutality, income inequality, capitalism, institutional racism, and lack of police accountability. Protests reached the Richmond area about three days after Floyd's killing. Demonstrations A protester by the vandalized J.E.B. Stuart Monument following protests. A Virginia State Trooper guarding the Virginia Daughters of the Confederacy Building after the interior was burnt down. = May = The first organized protest in the city began on the evening of May 29 and went on into the early morning hours of May 30. Protesters organized at Monroe Park and marched down Franklin Street through the Monroe Ward neighborhood. There, they were confronted by the Richmond Police Department (RPD), VCU Police, and the Virginia Division of Capitol Police. Protesters set two police cruisers on fire, both of which were destroyed: one VCU cruiser and one RPD cruiser. Additionally, protesters vandalized a GRTC Pulse rapid transit bus and set it on fire, destroying it. On the evening of May 30 into the early morning hours of May 31, several hundred protesters organized around the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University and marched down Monument Avenue. The street is well known as being the home of several prominent statues depicting Confederate generals in a positive and honorable light. These statues have, especially in recent years, been subject to vandalism, even prior to the Floyd protests. The first statue defaced was the J.E.B. Stuart Monument located at the intersection of Lombardy Street and Monument Ave. Protesters spray painted the statue and destroyed the fencing around the statue. Subsequently, protesters tagged the Robert E. Lee Monument with various slogans, including \\"Black Lives Matter\\", \\"Lynch Trump\\", \\"All Cops Are Bastards\\", and \\"Fuck Capitalism\\". The Jefferson Davis Memorial, and the Stonewall Jackson Monument were also damaged, although none of the statues were toppled. The interior of the Memorial to the Women of the Confederacy was set on fire. Initially, the Richmond Fire Department reported that just the exterior was damaged. Later on it was noted that the building's interior caught fire, destroying artifacts within the building. Protesters also defaced the sign for the Virginia Museum of History and Culture to re-read \\"Virginia Museum of Bullshit and Cultists\\". The Rumors of War statue by the Museum was left unharmed. Damage was also reported at the Whole Foods Market near the Allison Street transit station. Protests went on until 3 or 4:00 a.m. on the morning of May 31. Numerous community members reorganized around the Lee Monument around 10:00 a.m. the next morning, with smaller groups organizing around the Stuart, Jackson, and Davis monuments. The statues along Monument Avenue were further defaced and spray painted. Skateboarders skated on the JEB Stuart monument. =June = Despite the city-wide curfew, protests continued into the early morning hours of June 1. Approximately 100 to 200 protesters were arrested. Police reports indicated that there was less damage sustained than previous nights. It was reported that several dumpsters, cars, and additional buildings were set on fire. Throughout the day there were small gatherings of peaceful protests around the Lee and Stuart monuments. Around 5:30 to 6:00 p.m., several hundred protesters gathered near the city's Central Office District blocking streets. Around 7:20 p.m., about forty minutes prior to curfew, Richmond police tear gassed a group of about 500 or 600 protestors that had gathered near the Stuart and Lee monuments. At the time of the tear gassing, the protesters were peaceful and kneeling, while chanting \\"Why are we here? LOVE!\\".https://twitter.com/ptaffs/status/1267667898044203010 Conversely, drone footage showed the police standing in a diamond formation, with two officers in the center who threw or fired the first tear gas canisters. This posture and formation of officers indicated that this was a premeditated action, and not a response to being separated from their group as initially tweeted by the police department.https://twitter.com/RichmondPolice/status/1267609063224938499 Later, the Police Department tweeted that protesters were attempting to topple the statues. Following the tear gassing, the Police issued an apology for tear gassing peaceful protesters, although it was met with harsh criticism. On the morning of June 2, mayor Stoney addressed the press and citizens at Richmond City Hall regarding the police actions on civilians on June 1. He publicly apologized for the actions of the Police department. Citizens called on Stoney to fire and arrest the police officers involved in the tear gassing, some calling on Stoney to resign as mayor. Stoney joined protesters in their June 2 march as part of a promise to listen to the concerns and demands of protesters. Following the news of the statue removal, protests continued throughout the city, although they were largely peaceful. A vigil for Breonna Taylor was held at Maymont Park on June 7, in celebration of what would have been her 27th birthday. Since June 3 an open plaza has been set up on the grounds of the Lee Monument to serve as a DIY cultural center. Also on June 2, a group of officers were filmed as one of them appeared to repeatedly spit at a woman in handcuffs. On the night of June 6, protesters toppled a statue of Williams Carter Wickham, a Confederate general, located in Monroe Park. The statue was erected in 1891, and descendents of Wickham had previous urged to remove the statue as early as 2017. Three days later, on the night of June 9, protesters went to the Christopher Columbus statue in Byrd Park, set it on fire, toppled the statue, and threw the statue into Fountain Lake on the Byrd Park grounds, making it the second toppled statue in a week in the city. The following evening, on June 10 around 11:00 p.m. local time, protesters tore down the Jefferson Davis statue on Monument Avenue, making it the third statue toppled in the city. On Saturday, June 13, a march was held on Monument Avenue called the \\"5,000 Man March.\\" Following this incident, Mayor Stoney asked the Commonwealth's Attorney for the City of Richmond, to investigate the incident. The RPD also announced their own internal investigation. During the early morning hours of June 15, a peaceful protest was held outside of the Richmond Police Headquarters in protest of police brutality exhibited by the Police over the last two weeks. Police shot protesters with non-lethal bullets and tear gas. The next day, June 16, Chief William Smith of the Richmond Police resigned at the request of Stoney. On June 17, a fourth statue was toppled in Richmond, and the third Confederate-related statue. The statue, the Confederate Howitzer Statue, was located on the Monroe Park campus of Virginia Commonwealth University, and was unveiled in 1892. The Howitzer Statue celebrated a Confederate artillery unit. On June 19, various Juneteenth celebrations were held across the region. Around this time, a sign was placed by the Lee Monument proclaiming the area as \\"Marcus-David Peters Circle\\", honoring the late Peters, who died while in custody of Richmond Police. On June 20, in the nearby The Fan neighborhood of Richmond, protesters tore down the First Virginia Regiment Monument, which was a statue honoring Revolutionary War veterans. On June 22, protesters rallied outside of Richmond City Hall during a City Council meeting. There, protesters spoke to City Council demanding the abolition of Richmond City Police, the creation of a Citizens Review Board with subpoena power, and a \\"Marcus Alert System\\", which would send trained social workers to a mental health crisis instead of police. That evening, protesters rallied out of the Richmond City Police Headquarters in protest of police brutality. Protesters were attacked by City Police with rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray. On June 26, interim Police Chief, Jody Blackwell, stepped down as Police Chief. The same day Levar Stoney announced Deputy Chief Gerald Smith of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Police Department as the new Chief of Richmond Police. Smith would begin duties on July 1. = July = The Stonewall Jackson Monument was partially deconstructed by the city on July 1, 2020 On July 1, construction crews removed the Stonewall Jackson Statue at the corner of Arthur Ashe Boulevard and Monument Avenue, making it the first statue the city government had removed. On July 2, unofficial historical markers, in the same style as the Virginia Historical Society signs were placed near the Stuart and Lee statues, contextualizing the motive of the status being erected. On July 7, construction crews removed the J.E.B. Stuart Statue at the corner of Monument Avenue and Lombardy Street, making it the second statue the city government had removed. On July 25, a dump truck was set on fire during a Solidarity with Portland protest in south Richmond. An unlawful assembly was declared at 11 pm but later Mayor Levar Stoney and Police Chief Gerald Smith jointly announced that white supremacists had been \\"marching under the banner of Black Lives Matter, an attempt to undermine an otherwise overwhelmingly peaceful movement .\\" = August = Throughout August, more efforts were made by the Richmond Police Department and the mayor's office to quell the ongoing protests, which had been occurring for nearly two months. On August 7, the Police Department actively disassembled camping area around the Lee Monument site following a chain of complaints from nearby residents. On August 11, the unofficial historic markers were removed by city officials, and active efforts went underway to prohibit overnight camping on the site. On August 13, the ongoing protests coincided with student activist groups at nearby Virginia Commonwealth University to defund and abolish the VCU Police Department. Demands included release the department's line-item budget for the last five fiscal years, the university to sever ties with the Richmond Police Department, to redirect all police monies to mental health services, and to actively ban the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from entering the campus. On August 16, the sign marking the name \\"Marcus-David Peters Circle\\" was removed, although the Richmond Police claimed they had no responsibility. Since the sign removal and clearing of the Lee Monument area, the protests focusing on George Floyd have largely receded. Government response On May 31, Mayor Levar Stoney issued a city-wide curfew from 8:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. for non-essential workers in the wake of the ongoing protests. The curfew went into effect on May 31 and is to be lifted on June 3. Additionally, Virginia governor Ralph Northam issued a state of emergency. On June 1, the Richmond, Virginia chapter of Our Revolution called for Stoney and Chief William C. Smith to resign in regards to their handling of the protests. Several statewide politicians condemned the use of the Richmond Police using tear gas on civilians including Jennifer McClellan, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. A majority of members of Richmond City Council express support for there to be a Citizen's Review Board and Mental Health Alert service for the Richmond Police Department. On June 3, Stoney announced his intention to introduce an ordinance to remove the Confederate statues on Monument Avenue. It was announced on June 4, that Governor Ralph Northam will announce plans to remove the Lee monument. That same day a press conference attended by Northam and Stoney confirmed the removal of the monument. Speaking of the removal, Northam said \\"You see, in Virginia, we no longer preach a false version of history. One that pretends the Civil War was about ‚Äòstate rights‚Äô and not the evils of slavery. No one believes that any longer\\". On June 5, all nine members of the Richmond City Council backed the removal of all five Confederate monuments in the city limits. Reva Trammell, who represents the 8th district in the city stated that \\"while many citizens support putting the Confederate statues in a museum, some oppose it. After giving this much thought, I will vote to take them down. I feel it is the right thing to do. I never thought I would live to see the kind of damage and destruction that has been inflicted on Richmond, and we need to end this now.\\" On June 16, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said he did not support the protesters demands to defund state police, and offered additional reforms instead. On June 17, the Republican Party of Virginia called for Stoney to resign as the Mayor of Richmond, Virginia. Stoney never responded to the statement. On June 23, rapper and Virginia native Trey Songz called for Stoney to resign due to his appointment of Jody Blackwell as interim Police Chief.

Biography  Wells served in the military during World War I. He married and had a son, who had autism. In the 1950s, his family lived in a remote part of eastern Maryland. One of his colleagues, Richard L. Riley, described him as \\"an eccentric genius.\\" In the late 1950s, Wells collapsed, paralyzed from the waist down. After his initial hospitalization, he was transferred to the VA Hospital in Baltimore where he had been overseeing a long-term tuberculosis study. He experienced periods of psychosis but continued to advise on research when lucid. He died in 1963.  Research  The Wells curve demonstrates that respiratory droplets rapidly dry out or fall to the ground after being exhaled. = Droplet nuclei = German bacteriologist Carl Fl√ºgge in 1899 was the first to show that microorganisms in droplets expelled from the respiratory tract are a means of disease transmission. The term Fl√ºgge droplet was sometimes used for particles that are large enough to not completely dry out. Fl√ºgge's concept of droplets as primary source and vector for respiratory transmission of diseases prevailed into the 1930s until Wells differentiated between large and small droplets. Wells' major contribution was to show that the nuclei of evaporated droplets can remain in the air for long enough for others to breathe them in and become infected. He developed the Wells curve, which describes how the size of respiratory droplets influences their fate and thus their ability to transmit disease. With Richard L. Riley, he also developed the Wells-Riley equation \\"to express the mass balance of transmission factors under steady state conditions.\\" In 1935, Wells demonstrated that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), which had been used to kill microorganisms on surfaces and in liquids, could also be used to kill airborne infectious organisms. This experiment proved that he had been correct that droplet nuclei could be infectious, and also suggested a route for prevention. In 1935, Wells helped develop UVGI barriers for the Infants' and Children's Hospital in Boston, using cubicle-like rooms subjected to high- intensity UV light to reduce cross-contamination. From 1937 to 1941, Wells implemented a long-term study using upper-room UVGI, that is, UVGI which only sterilized the area above people's heads, allowing the room to be occupied at the time but relying on vertical ventilation to ensure the occupants breathe sterilized air. This study installed upper-room UVGI in suburban Philadelphia schools to prevent the spread of measles. Wells' 1955 book Air Contagion and Air Hygiene has been described as the authoritative book on the subject and a \\"landmark monograph on air hygiene.\\" = Tuberculosis = Wells first proposed the idea of droplet nucleus transmission of tuberculosis in the 1930s. He demonstrated that rabbits could be infected with bovine TB through droplets. In 1954, Wells began a long-term experiment to demonstrate that tuberculosis could be transmitted through air. At the VA Hospital in Baltimore, collaborating with Riley, John Barnwell, and Cretyl C. Mills, he built a chamber for 150 guinea pigs to be exposed to air from infectious patients in a nearby TB ward. After two years, they found that an average of three guinea pigs a month were indeed infected. Although this was exactly the rate Wells had predicted, skeptics complained that other methods of transmission (such as the animals' food and water) had not been conclusively ruled out. A second long-term study was begun, this time with a second chamber for an additional 150 guinea pigs, whose air was sterilized with UVGI. The animals in the second room did not become ill, proving that the only transmission vector in the first room was the air from the tuberculosis ward. The study was completed in 1961, and published in 1962, though Wells did not see the final paper.

He was recognized for his work during an incredibly tumultuous time in United States history, as life proved difficult amidst the Vietnam War. While controversial, his presidency was among several fleeting terms held by other University presidents during this time. He served at Illinois State University between 1967 and 1970, a mere three years. The average term of presidency at the University during this time was only five years, as many presidents sought to develop their professional achievements elsewhere.  Early life  Samuel Edward Braden was born on June 6, 1914, to two missionary parents in Hoihow, Hainan, China. He and his family later relocated to the United States. In 1937, he married wife Beth Black, who he remained married to for the remainder of his life. The couple had four kids: Mary Beth, Stephen, John, and David Braden. His family would remain fundamental to his support system throughout his professional career.  Education  After graduating high school, Braden attended the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma, pursuing a double major in economics and political science. After graduating, he went on to pursue a PhD in economics and law at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin. After receiving his doctorate in 1941, Braden worked as an economist in Washington for the entirety of World War II, until he decided to serve four years in the Air Force.  Leadership  Besides his time with the Air Force, Samuel Braden's work was mainly focused on education. He worked as the associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University in 1954. Five years later, in 1959, he was re-assigned as vice president and dean of the school's Undergraduate Development committee. This experience greatly prepared him to work in developing liberal arts colleges, where teachers were becoming increasingly qualified and further educated. After working at Indiana University, Braden decided to move to Illinois State University, where he'd later become beloved president Robert Gehlmann Bone's successor. During Braden's first year as the tenth Illinois State University president (1967-1968), he sought to utilize the forty percent increase in funding that was granted to the school, as well as follow along the predetermined plan of previous University presidents. During his first year, the school had 850 staff members, of which a quarter had arrived around that time. With such an overwhelming staff, the school was receiving comparatively low funding against other schools, including Northern Illinois University. This was, in part, due to the ongoing unrest occurring during the Vietnam War. Education- especially at Illinois State- seemed to be on the Federal back-burner. This provided Braden some difficulty with effectively expanding the University's academic capabilities. With the funding they did receive, however, Braden's presidency established new master's programs in Western European Studies, as well as Physics, Economics, Sociology, and Political Science. This allowed for a wider diversity of educational fields as more students were expected to enroll. During Braden's presidency, Illinois State University expected anywhere from 21,000 to 28,000 new students to enroll within the coming years. This prompted a construction of several on-campus buildings to accommodate the increasing number of students. Alongside a new Psychology building (Degarmo Hall) and a new auditorium, Braden's presidency required the planning of a South Mall Art Building and a Graduate Study Center, later dubbed the Center for the Visual Arts and University Galleries, respectively. An Administrative Services Building and another service building, the Nelson-Smith building, were also commissioned as well. These structures were among many on the prospective list of University developments. To tackle all of these ideas, Braden created the University Planning Committee, a group that would track the achievements of academic and aesthetic endeavors in the coming years. The Committee was also instructed to ask each academic department what developments they needed, and the manpower and resources required to obtain them. The end plan envisioned seventeen new Undergraduate programs, as well as fourteen new Master's and Doctoral programs. By 1969, PhD programs in Geography, History, and English were approved. Despite the progression towards an academic and structural ideal, Illinois State University faced great strife in student contentment. While previous president Robert Bone had already dropped the campus alcohol ban, students were still unhappy with the restrictive rules placed on them. In 1967, after several student protests, women's dormitories no longer held curfew. Likewise, the Student Senate had establish course and teacher evaluations, where students could evaluate the quality and effectiveness of their class experience. However, some students on campus still did not feel that they had enough power over their student life. An on-campus organization against American involvement in the Vietnam War, titled Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), were restricted in their abilities to protest on- campus. They were only allowed to show films and distribute leaflets, but not much more. This was due to the overwhelming discomfort of the surrounding community. During Braden's presidency, he attempted to appeal to the community for open housing, to diminish the need for strictly on-campus living. This would lessen the blow of the incoming freshman class, which University housing may not have been able to accommodate. However, the city of Bloomington-Normal denied these requests until March 4th, 1968, when referendum voters favored open housing by a small majority. While students were able to live more comfortably, these occurrences during Braden's presidency seemed to show the growing hindrance that the University was placing on the city. Students also became increasingly discontent when it came to racial disparity on-campus during this era. On May 15, 1968, Braden appointed a Task Force on Inter-Group Relations, which had composed recommendations for improving campus diversity. Upon their suggestion, Braden had accepted forty-seven students into the University who were fit for his High Potential Students Program, an initiative which allowed students with academic troubles to be admitted into the school. By the end of the year, three-hundred new African-American students enrolled at ISU, two-thirds of them from the new program. Braden was confident in his ability to handle such topics in a safe, effective way. However, for the next year of his presidency (1968-1969), civil rights protests and outbreaks damaged the school's reputation with local authorities. While on-campus activist groups were taking a stand against nationwide racial injustices, a heavy weight was placed on Braden's shoulders to make decisions on adjusting racial representation. Campus' Black Student Association demanded several things from Braden, including mandatory air time on the school's radio station, as well as representation in the school newspaper. They were granted these wishes, and president Braden created an organization consisting of black students, who would determine what African-American idol the East Gate building would be renamed after. After these requests were settled, many more riots took place. Braden had, on one occasion, requested that students not leave their dormitories, for fear of being hurt in community rioting. This year, dubbed the \\"Year of Disruption\\", polarized the Illinois State University community to an extent never seen before. Samuel E. Braden resigned from his presidency on June 12, 1969. He described his leave as \\"neither hasty nor capricious,\\" and felt that he no longer wanted to grapple with the issues that faced University presidents at that time. He was more of a pacifist himself, and the violence and trouble ensuing throughout the country left him feeling incapable of serving the school further.  Death  Samuel Edward Braden passed away August 13, 2003, at 89 years old. He died in Bloomington, Indiana, and was buried at the Indiana Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Madison. = Legacy = Samuel Braden became recognized and respected in the Illinois State University community for generations after his presidency. He was renowned for his ability to consider both sides of a situation and try to deal with concerns effectively. He endured one of the most eventful, tumultuous presidencies known to the school at that time. He faced many social and financial difficulties regarding the University, and was able to grind through them with all the vigor he could muster. In his honor, the school's Braden Auditorium was renamed after him. Today, the space is used for organization gatherings and large school events. Braden helped to carry on developmental plans established before his term, and helped the plans get translated into the hands of his successors.

It and another Selig release, The Way of the Eskimo, were produced at the same time in the same location in the United States, in Escanaba, Michigan. Both \\"Arctic\\" stories were filmed there in less than two weeks during the early winter months of 1911, staged along the frozen shoreline of Little Bay de Noc that connects to Lake Michigan. Released in September 1911, this 820-foot film was distributed on a \\"split-reel\\", attached on the same 1000-foot reel to an unrelated 180-foot \\"topical\\" short titled Noted Men. That accompanying film, which had a running time less than three minutes, offered \\"intimate views\\" of the vice president of the United States at that time as well as four other prominent national politicians.

The motion picture, according to reviews and plot descriptions in those publications, opened with snow-covered scenes of a group of Eskimos on a seasonal tribal hunt for game. Soon they discover a teenage orphan girl (Columbia Eneutseak) living alone in a hut. Very sick and without food, she has little chance of survival, so the tribal members refuse to adopt her into their community. They instead invoke the Eskimos' \\"unwritten law\\" that imposes a death sentence on anyone who is judged to be \\"too ill or too aged to participate in the annual hunt\\".Image of Selig promotional flyer for Lost in the Arctic, image \\"File:Release flier for LOST IN THE ARCTIC, 1911.jpg\\", Wikipedia Commons. Retrieved May 29, 2020. In accordance with that law, the orphan is allowed to choose one of two means of death: she may either wander into the surrounding wilderness and be devoured by wolves and bears, or she may be set adrift in an umiak or open canoe without any supplies. She chooses the latter. After conducting a solemn \\"'Ceremony of the Walrus Skull'\\", calling upon the spirits to guide the teenager on her \\"journey into darkness\\", tribal members place her into the canoe and launch her into open water bordered by immense fields of solid ice.\\"'Lost in the Arctic' (Selig)\\", The Moving Picture World (New York, N.Y.), September 16, 1911, p. 822.

He is the lone survivor of a \\"lost polar expedition\\", and as he continues his hunt, he suddenly realizes that the large section of ice on which he is standing has broken off from the ice field and is drifting out to sea. Seemingly doomed, Davis is later elated to sight the orphan's canoe, which has miraculously drifted toward his ice floe. Davis manages to join the girl, whose weak condition has only worsened. Captain John Smith (J. C. Smith), another Arctic explorer, is out searching for the lost expedition across the ice-strewn sea. Overcoming his own \\"trials and suffering\\" in the search, Smith finally locates his colleague and saves him as well as his sick Eskimo companion.

That publication and Selig itself continued to promote Lost in the Arctic as an adventure that was actually filmed there or at least along the northern coast of Labrador. It was instead one of two films shot on location at the same time in the United States, in Escanaba, Michigan, located approximately 300 miles north of Chicago. Situated next to the Little Bay de Noc linked to Lake Michigan, Escanaba offered a winter environment that on screen proved to be a convincing alternative to Canada's northern frontier. Today, nearly a dozen photographs documenting the filming of Lost in the Arctic and The Way of the Eskimo are preserved in Escanaba by the Delta County Historical Society.\\"Little Bay de Noc: 'The Way of the Eskimo'\\", photographic series A-1958.96.03-15, archives of the Delta County Historical Society, Escanaba, Michigan.

The actress portraying the wife of the chief was Columbia Eneutseak's biological mother, Esther Eneutseak Smith. To enhance the \\"Arctic\\" realism of filming in Michigan, Monk staged and filmed a hunting expedition and the killing of a nonindigenous polar bear in Escabana, an event documented among the photographs held by the noted historical society.\\"Death of the polar bear\\", photograph A-1956.96.08; \\"Cast from the Eskimo movie\\" (including the dead polar bear), A-1956.96.07; online images from archives of the Delta County Historical Society, Escanaba, Michigan.

Most likely, the company shipped to Escanaba one of those bears from its large studio \\"plant\\" in Chicago or possibly from the company's newer, rapidly expanding \\"Pacific Coast\\" facilities in Edendale, Los Angeles. A live walrus was apparently shipped as well to Escanaba for the same purposes. In its July 1911 issue, the Chicago-based trade journal Motography states, \\"A valuable polar bear is slain in one of these far north plays and an Eskimo is seen killing the wary walrus by his primitive methods.\\"Motography, July 1911, p. 14. Internet Archive. Retrieved May 18, 2020. The telling word regarding the bear in that report is \\"valuable\\", a strong implication that the animal was from Selig's menagerie, one its more expensive purchased specimens. While it is possible that some footage of the bear roaming on the ice or its killing was also used in The Way of the Eskimo, it is more likely the footage was used entirely in Lost in the Arctic. Selig advertisements and trade reviews for the latter production refer specifically to the \\"harpooning\\" and \\"thrilling\\" death of the polar bear. In addition, cast member \\"Zachariah\\" (Zacharias Zad) is credited in 1911 publications as \\"The Bear Hunter\\" in this film. Release and reception Upon its release in September 1911, the film generally received positive reviews like The Way of the Eskimo, which had been distributed by Selig two months earlier. The correspondent for the trade journal Motion Picture News reviewed Lost in the Arctic among a series of other recent releases and reported that he enjoyed it \\"immensely\\".\\"From Our Western Correspondent\\", Moving Picture News (New York, N.Y.), September 30, 1911, p. 26.

The Moving Picture World was equally impressed with the film, predicting that it would \\"outrival\\" The Way of the Eskimo, describing it as \\"one of the season's notable offerings\\". Two weeks later, The Moving Picture World continued to compliment the production and in another concise review highly recommended it to theater owners as an educational offering with solid box-office potential: \\"Lost\\" film status No copy of this one-reel Selig production is preserved in Library of Congress, the UCLA Film Archives, in the Department of Film at the Museum of Modern Art, the George Eastman Museum, the Library and Archives Canada (LAC), or in other major film repositories in the United States, Canada, or Europe.

Early life and career  Stuart Matlins was born in 1940 in New York City to Louis and Lillian Matlins. He attended London School of Economics from 1958 to 1959 and received a BS in 1960 from the University of Wisconsin, then a MA from Princeton University in 1962, followed by postgraduate studies. Matlins worked for the U.S. Department of Commerce, before going to work for Booz Allen & Hamilton, where he was eventually named vice president and managing officer. He then started his own consulting firm, Stuart Matlins Associates, in 1974.  Interfaith work  During the late 1970s, Matlins began writing and speaking on religion with a focus on interfaith. Matlins had grown up in a Jewish home, but through his marriage had been exposed to a wide verity of various Christian traditions. He wanted to better understand how to act while visiting those denominations and realized others may be in similar situations. He told the LA Times: ‚ÄúWe all have relatives of different faiths. It is increasingly common for people we know, and people we work with, to invite us to their life cycle events. We all want to do what is expected of us.‚Äù In 1996, he wrote How to Be a Perfect Stranger: The Essential Religious Etiquette Handbook with Arthur J. Magida to help \\"well-meaning guest[s] to feel comfortable, participate to the fullest extent possible, and avoid violating anyone's religious principles-while enriching their own spiritual understanding.\\" His books were called \\"important tools to help people avoid many pitfalls as they wander across the spiritual landscape.\\" Matlins became editor-in-chief and publisher at Jewish Lights Publishing and SkyLight Paths Publishing. His book How to Be a Perfect Stranger: The Essential Religious Etiquette Handbook went through multiple editions, with a second volume being added and then later combined into the original. The book has been reviewed by New York Times, Chicago Sun-Times, Midwest Book Review, and more. He also wrote books focusing on marriage and funeral aspects of different religious practices, as well as books focusing on the Jewish faith. Matlins co-founded an \\"innovative\\" synagogue in rural Vermont with his wife, and served as its lay leader for nineteen years. He also served on the Board of Governors of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion for almost twenty years and was chair of the school's Board of Overseers. He was also a member of the First Catholic/Jewish Lay Conference at the Vatican in October 2007. Matlins believed \\"There's no such thing as being too respectful of other people's traditions\\" he told The Salt Lake Tribune.

She led the female gospel group, The Little Lucy Smith Singers, and was a vocalist and accompanist for the Roberta Martin Singers. The granddaughter of Holiness preacher Elder Lucy Smith, she began playing organ at the All Nations Pentecostal Church at age twelve. Among her more well-known compositions are \\"Oh My Lord, What a Time\\", \\"What a Blessing in Jesus,\\" and \\"He's my Light,\\" which became a hit for the Roberta Martin Singers. Early Years Lucy Smith was born in Chicago in 1925. Her mother, Viola, passed away when she was two years old, and thereafter, she was raised by her father, Rev. James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. To distinguish her from her grandmother, she was called \\"Little Lucy Smith\\" as a child, a nickname that she would continue to use during her gospel career. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer. In two years she had become a skilled gospel accompanist, and at the request of her grandmother, she began playing the organ at her church and directing the music program. Elder Smith, a highly successful preacher and healer, had founded the All Nations Pentecostal Church, the first church ever established in Chicago by a woman pastor. Little Lucy's skill as an organist helped draw more worshippers to the already popular church. In 1933, the church began broadcasting its worship services on the radio through their \\"Glorious Church of the Air\\" program, becoming one of the first black churches to broadcast its services. Through the radio program, Little Lucy Smith's music was heard by people far beyond the Chicago area. Recording career In 1948, Smith published her first original gospel song, ‚ÄúWhat a Blessing in Jesus I‚Äôve Found.\\" In her teens, she formed the Lucy Smith Trio, which later became the Little Lucy Smith Singers. She was joined by Catherine Campbell, Gladys Beamon Gregory and Sarah McKissick Simmons. By the mid-1950s, they had gained a significant following; their version of \\"Somebody Bigger Than You and I\\" was one of their most popular recordings. They also recorded ‚ÄúCome Unto Me,‚Äù ‚ÄúJesus, Lover of My Soul‚Äù and ‚ÄúDown on My Knees.‚Äù In the late 1950s, Little Lucy Smith joined the Roberta Martin Singers. She arranged much of their music, in addition to singing and playing piano and organ. Her organ playing was very popular and in 1962, she released a solo record of gospel tunes, entitled \\"Little Lucy Smith at the Organ.\\" She suffered a stroke in her 50s, which ended her professional career as an accompanist. She continued to sing however. In 1981, the Smithsonian Institute held a ceremony to honor the Roberta Martin Singers, and many of her gospel songs were acquired by the Smithsonian. Death and Legacy She passed away in 2010, at the age of 85. In her obituary, gospel music producer Anthony Heilbut is quoted as saying, \\"She is one of the most influential gospel pianists who ever played.\\" James Cleveland and Richard Smallwood, among others, were influenced by her style of playing. Her music is featured on several compilations of music, including \\"The Great Gospel Women,\\" published in 1993 by Shanachie Records.

The organization houses around 750 inmates, providing them food, shelter and healthcare. Raja is a recipient of a number of awards including the NDTV Man of The Year Award, the CNN-IBN Real Heroes Award and the Namma Bengaluru Award.  Biography  Thomas Raja was born in 1967 in Vaniyambadi, a village in Tirupattur district in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. His father, who worked as a lineman with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, moved to Bengaluru with family when Raja was young. He dropped out of school at third standard and when his father kicked him out from home, went to Chennai with the money obtained by selling some goods stolen from his own home. He started drinking and gambling, slept on pavements and had to spent time in Chennai Central Prison after getting caught by the police. There, he fell ill and after recovering from the illness, he was released from jail and was taken back to Bengaluru by his family. The life in the prison is said to have changed Raja's life who started driving an auto- rickshaw for a living. However, he continued his ruffian ways and even worked as a henchman to the secretary of the auto-rickshaw drivers' union. It was during his several trips along the Bengaluru streets that he came across the people who lived in the streets. He brought one such person, a destitute woman, home and sheltered her in the parking space of his auto-rickshaw. Later, he rented a small house and started looking after destitute people, initially with 13 inmates. Subsequently, with funds collected from the public, he bought a half-acre plot of land in Doddagubbi Village near the city, where he constructed a 2000 sq. ft building which served as the base for New Ark Mission of India, a non-governmental organization when he started it in 1997. The home, named Home of Hope, has since grown to manage one centre in Chikkagubbi village for men and two centres for women in Doddagubbi, housing around 750 inmates and also runs an ambulance service. Raja is married and the couple has three children.  Awards and honors  CNN-IBN selected Raja for the Real Heroes Award in 2010. He received the NDTV Man of The Year the next year; the same he was chosen for the Namma Bengaluru Award. A recipient of the Individual H. Honnaiah Samaja Seva Prashasti Award in 2001, Raja delivered a speech at TEDx Talks in 2012.

Of contested legitimacy, it was headquartered in the town of Vichy in occupied France, but it initially took shape in Paris under Mar√©chal Philippe Petain as the successor to the French Third Republic in June 1940. P√©tain spent four years in Vichy and after the Allied invasion of France, fled into exile to Germany in September 1944 with the rest of the French cabinet. It operated as a government-in-exile until April 1945, when the Sigmaringen enclave was taken by Free French forces. P√©tain was brought back to France, by then under control of the Provisional French Republic, and put on trial for treason.  Background  France under German occupation A hero of World War I, known for applying the lessons of the Second Battle of Champagne to minimize casualties in the Battle of Verdun, P√©tain became commander of French forces in 1917. He came to power in World War II as a reaction to the stunning defeat of France in early 1940. P√©tain blamed a lack of men and material for the defeat, but had himself participated in the egregious miscalculations that led to the Maginot Line, and the belief that the Ardennes were impenetrable. Nonetheless P√©tain's cautious and defensive tactics at Verdun had won him acclaim from a devastated military, and poet Paul Val√©ry called him \\"the champion of France.\\" He became Vice-Premier under Paul Reynaud in May 1940, when the only question was whether the French Army should surrender or the French government sue for an armistice. After President Albert Lebrun appointed P√©tain prime minister on 16 June, the government signed an armistice with Germany on 22 June 1940. With France fallen to the Germans, the British judged the risk was too high of the French Navy falling into German hands, and a few days later, in the attack on Mers-el-K√©bir on 3 July 1940, they sank one battleship and damaged five others, also killing 1,297 French servicemen. P√©tain severed diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 8 July. The next day the National Assembly voted to revise the constitution, and the following day, 10 July, the National Assembly granted absolute power to P√©tain, thus ending the French Third Republic.Loi constitutionnelle du 10 juillet 1940 (Constitutional Law of 10 July 1940). \\"...Fait √† Vichy, le 10 juillet 1940 Par le pr√©sident de la R√©publique, Albert Lebrun...\\" In retaliation for the attack at Mers el K√©bir, French aircraft raided Gibraltar on 18 July but did little damage. P√©tain established an authoritarian government at Vichy, with central planning a key feature, as well as tight government control. French conventional wisdom, particularly in the administration of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, long held that the French government under Petain had merely sought be make the best of a bad situation. While Vichy policy towards the Germans was at least in part founded in concern for the 1.8 million French prisoners of war, as President Jacques Chirac subsequently acknowledged, even Mussolini stood up to Hitler and in so doing saved the lives of thousands of Jews, many of them French. Antisemitism in France did not begin under P√©tain, but it certainly became a key characteristic of his time in power as manifested in Vichy anti-Jewish legislation. = Third Republic = L√©on Gambetta proclaiming the Republic of France, 4 September 1870. Until the invasion, the French Third Republic had been the government of France since the defeat of Napoleon III and the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. It was dissolved by the French Constitutional Law of 1940 which gave P√©tain the power to write a new constitution. He interpreted this to mean that the previous constitution, outlined in the French Constitutional Laws of 1875, no longer constrained him. In the wake of the Battle of France that culminated in the disaster at Dunkirk, the French government declared Paris an open city and relocated to Bordeaux on 10 June 1940 in order to avoid capture. On 22 June, France and Germany signed the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne. The Vichy government led by P√©tain replaced the Third Republic. It administered the zone libre in the south of France until November 1942, when Germans and Italians occupied the zone under Case Anton following the Allied landings in North Africa under Operation Torch. Germany occupied northern France and the Atlantic coast, and the Italians, a small territory in the southeast. = Transition to the French State = The H√¥tel du Parc, home and office of Philippe P√©tain and Pierre Laval from 1940 to 1944. At the time of the armistice the French and the Germans both thought Britain would come to terms any day, so only it included only temporary arrangements. France agreed to its soldiers remaining prisoners of war until hostilities ceased. The terms of the armistice sketch out a \\"French State\\" (√âtat fran√ßais), whose sovereignty and authority in practice were limited to the zone libre, although in theory it administered all of France. The military administration of the occupied zone was in fact a Nazi dictatorship. However, the fiction of French independence was so important to Laval in particular that he agreed to requisition French workers for Germany to prevent the Germans from doing it unilaterally for the zone occup√©e alone. The Vichy r√©gime considered itself the legitimate government of France, but Charles de Gaulle, who had escaped to England, declared a government in exile in London, and broadcast appeals to French citizens to resist the occupying forces. Britain shortly thereafter recognized his Empire Defence Council as the legitimate French government. Under the terms of the armistice France was allowed a small army to defend itself and to administer its colonies. Most of these colonies simply recognized the shift in power, but their allegiance to Vichy shifted once the Allies invaded North Africa in Operation Torch. Britain however outraged the French by bombing their fleet because the British were unwilling to risk it falling into Axis hands. Alsace-Lorraine, which France and Germany had long disputed, was simply annexed. When Allied forces landed in North Africa under Operation Torch, the Nazis annexed the free zone in Case Anton, Germany's response. = P√©tain administration under Third Republic= The Philippe P√©tain administration was the last administration of the French Third Republic, succeeding on 16 June 1940 to Paul Reynaud's cabinet. It formed in the middle of the Battle of France debacle, when the Third Reich invaded France at the beginning of the Second World War. It was led until 10 July 1940 by Philippe P√©tain, and favored the armistice, unlike General de Gaulle, who favored fighting on in the Empire Defense Council It was followed by the fifth administration of Pierre Laval, the first administration of the Vichy France regime.  Formation  Philippe P√©tain, official photo, 1941. Paul Reynaud, who had been the French President of the Council since 22 March 1940, resigned early on the evening of 16 June, and President Albert Lebrun called for P√©tain to form a new government. P√©tain recruited Adrien Marquet for Interior and Pierre Laval for Justice. Laval wanted an offer of Justice. On the advice of Fran√ßois Charles-Roux, the Secretary-General for Foreign Affairs, and with the support of Maxime Weygand and Lebrun, P√©tain stood firm, which led Laval to withdraw, followed by Marquet in solidarity. After the armistice, Rapha√´l Alibert convinced P√©tain of the need to rely on Laval, and the two rejoined the government. P√©tain obtained the participation of the SFIO by bringing back Albert Rivi√®re and with the agreement of L√©on Blum.  End of administration  On 10 July 1940, the French National Assembly Assembl√©e nationale met in Vichy and voted to give absolute power to P√©tain in the Constitutional Law of 1940, effectively dissolving itself, and ending the Third Republic. The Vichy regime began.  Vichy governments P√©tain and the French State= In the French State under P√©tain, French authorities willingly enacted and enforced antisemitic laws, unprompted by Berlin. His collaborationist government helped send 75,721 Jewish refugees and French citizens to Nazi death camps. = First Laval administration (1940) = The fifth government formed by Pierre Laval was the first administration formed by P√©tain under the Vichy regime after the vote of 10 July 1940 ceded full constituent powers to P√©tain. The government ended on 13 December 1940 with Laval's dismissal. This administration was not recognized as legitimate by the Empire Defense Council of the government of Free France, which the British Government had quickly recognized as the legitimate government of France following De Gaulle's radio appeals to the French public.  Formation  The government of Philippe P√©tain signed the armistice with Germany on 22 June 1940, put an end to the Third Republic on by a vote conveying full powers to P√©tain and followed up with three on 11 July. Meanwhile, on 11 July General de Gaulle created the Empire Defense Council, which was recognized by the British Government as the legitimate successor of the Third Republic, which had allied itself with Great Britain in the war against the Nazis. First Vichy government in July 1940. On 12 July 1940 P√©tain named Pierre Laval, second Minister of State of the last government of the Third Republic under Philippe P√©tain as vice-president of the Council., while P√©tain remained simultaneously head of state and head of government. Constitutional Act #4 made Laval next in the line of succession should something happen to P√©tain. On 16 July, P√©tain formed the first government of the Vichy r√©gime and kept Pierre Laval on as vice-president of the Council. Laval's administration more or less coincides with the arrival in France of , tasked by Hitler with procuring qualified manpower. Until then, fewer than 100 000 French workers had voluntarily travelled to Germany to workCointet 1993, p. 378-380 Refusal to send 150 000 skilled workers had been one of the causes of the fall of Darlan. Sauckel demanded 250,000 additional workers before the end of July 1942. Laval fell back on his favorite tactic of negotiating, stalling for time, and seeking reciprocation. He proposed the rel√®ve, in which a prisoner of war would be freed for every three workers sent to Germany, and announced it 22 June 1942, after the same day, in a letter to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German minister of foreign affairs, Laval framing the rel√®ve policy as French participation, by providing workers, in the German war effort. \\"They give their blood. Give your labour to save Europe from Bolshevism\\".

To Sauckel, the rel√®ve had failed, since fewer than 60 000 French workers had gone to Germany by the end of August. He threatened to issue an ordonnance to requisition male and female manpower. This ordonnance would only have had effect in the occupied zone. Laval negotiated a French law covering both zones instead.Cointet 1993, p. 393-394 Laval put workplace inspection, the police and the gendarmerie at the service of forced impressments of labor, and tracking Service du travail obligatoire scofflaws.Rapha√´l Spina, \\"Impacts du STO sur le travail des entreprises\\", in Christian Chevandier and Jean- Claude Daumas, Actes du colloque Travailler dans les entreprises sous l'occupation, Presses universitaires de Franche-Comt√©, 2007 Forced impressments of workers, guarded by gendarmes until they boarded a train, drew hostile reactions. On 13 October 1942 the Oullins incidents broke out in the suburbs of Lyon, where workers at the railway station went on strike. Someone wrote \\"Laval assassin!\\" (Laval murderer) on the trains. The government was forced to back away; on 1 December 1942 only 2,500 requisitioned workers had left the southern zone. On 1 January 1943, Sauckel demanded, in addition to the 240,000 workers already sent to Germany, a new contingent of 250,000 men, before mid-MarchH. Roderick Kedward, STO et Maquis, in Jean-Pierre Az√©ma and Fran√ßois B√©darida (eds.), La France des ann√©es noires, v. II, √©ditions du Seuil, 1993 To meet these objectives, German forces organised ineffectively brutal raids, which led Laval to propose to the Council of Ministers on 5 February 1943 legislation creating the STO, under which youth born in 1920-1922 were requisitioned for work service in GermanyKupferman 2006, p. 467-468 Laval mitigated his legislation with many exceptions. In all, 600 000 men left between June 1942 and August 1943Cointet 1993, p. 433-434, despite what Sauckel denounced in a letter to Hitler as \\"pure and simple sabotage\\", after meeting more than seven hours on 6 August 1943 with Laval, who again attempted to minimize the number of requisitioned workers and refused to his demand for 50 000 workers for Germany before the end of 1943.Kupferman 2006, p. 479-480 On 15 September 1943, Reich minister for Armament and War Production Albert Speer reached an agreement with Laval minister Jean BichelonneKupferman 2006, p. 492 ‚Äî an agreement Laval was counting on to \\"block the deportation machine\\". Many businesses working for Germany were removed from Sauckel's requisition. Individuals were protected but the French economy as a whole was integrated into that of Germany. In November 1943, Sauckel demanded, without much success, 900 000 additional workers. On orders from Berlin, French workers stopped leaving for Germany on 7 June 1944, after Allied landings in Normandy.Kupferman 2006, p. 514-515 In the end, the STO caused thousands of young r√©fractaires to embrace the Resistance, which created the maquis.H.

In exchange Darlan wanted the Germans to reduce the constraints under the armistice, free French prisoners, and eliminate the ligne de d√©marcation. This irritated the Germans. On 9 March 1942, Hitler signed a decree giving France a chief of the SS and police leader (HSSPF) tasked with organizing the \\"Final Solution\\", following the Wannsee Conference with the French police. The Germans demanded the return of Laval to power, and broke off contact. The Americans intervened on March 30 to prevent another Laval administration.

The Germans wanted to maintain a \\"French government\\" in the hope of stabilizing the front in Eastern France and in case they could reconquer it.Jean-Paul Cointet, Sigmaringen, op. cit., p. 53 The same day, in Vichy, Cecil von Renthe-Fink, the German minister-delegate, asked P√©tain to travel to the northern zone, but he refused and asked for this instruction to be made in writing.Robert Aron, Grands dossiers de l'histoire contemporaine, op. cit., p. 41‚Äì42. *August 18, von Renthe-Fink asks twice more. *August 19, at 11:30 AM, von Renthe-Fink returned to the h√¥tel du Parc, r√©sidence of the Mar√©chal, accompanied by General von Neubroon, who said he had \\"formal orders from Berlin\\". Written instructions were given to Petain: \\"The government of the Reich orders the transfer of the head of state, even against his will\\". When the mar√©chal refused again, the Germans threatened to have the Wehrmacht bomb Vichy. After asking the Swiss ambassador, , to witness the blackmail to which he was subjected, P√©tain surrendered and ended the Laval administration. *20 August 1944, the Germans took P√©tain, against his will,¬´ Philippe P√©tain (1856-1951) ¬ª [archive], at cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr. from Vichy to the ch√¢teau de Morvillars near Belfort.Robert Aron, Grands dossiers de l'histoire contemporaine, √©d.

And this was done. [...] \\" = Second Laval administration (1942-1944) = After two years at the head of the Vichy regime, Fran√ßois Darlan's government was unpopular, a victim of the fool's bargain he had made with the Germans. Darlan committed Vichy into further collaboration with Germany as the least bad solution for him, giving up much ground: at Bizerte and Dakar, an air base in (Aleppo (Syria), vehicles, artillery and ammunition in North Africa, Tunisia, not to mention the delivery of arms to Iraq. In exchange, Darlan asked the Germans for a quid pro quo (reduction of the constraints of the armistice: release of French prisoners, elimination of the demarcation line and fuel oil for the French fleet), which irritated them. On 9 March 1942, Hitler signed the decree endowing France with a \\"Higher SS and police leader\\" (HSSPf) responsible for organizing the Final Solution after the Wannsee Conference with the French Police. The Germans then demanded that Pierre Laval return to power, and in the meantime they broke off all contact. On 30 March 1942, the Americans intervened in Vichy against Laval's return to power.

Vichy head of state Marshal Philippe P√©tain was conducted against his will to Belfort on 20 August 1944. A governmental commission directed by Fernand de Brinon was proclaimed on 6 September. On 7 September, they were taken ahead of the advancing Allied Forces out of France to the town of Sigmaringen, where they arrived on the 8th, where other Vichy officials were already present. Rather than resign his post, P√©tain wrote in a letter to the French \\"I am, and remain morally, your leader\\", but this was a fiction. Hitler requisitioned the Sigmaringen Castle for use by top officials. This was then occupied and used by the Vichy government-in-exile from September 1944 to April 1945. P√©tain resided at the Castle, but refused to cooperate, and kept mostly to himself, and ex-Prime Minister Pierre Laval also refused. Despite the efforts of the collaborationists and the Germans, P√©tain never recognized the Sigmaringen Commission. The Germans, wanting to present a facade of legality, enlisted other Vichy officials such as Fernand de Brinon as president, along with Joseph Darnand, Jean Luchaire, Eug√®ne Bridoux, and Marcel D√©at. On 7 September 1944, fleeing the advance of Allied troops into France, while Germany was in flames and the Vichy regime ceased to exist, a thousand French collaborators (including a hundred officials of the Vichy regime, a few hundred members of the French Militia, collaborationist party militants, and the editorial staff of the newspaper Je suis partout) but also waiting-game opportunists also went into exile in Sigmaringen. The commission had its own radio station (Radio- patrie, Ici la France) and official press (, Le Petit Parisien), and hosted the embassies of the Axis powers: Germany, Italy and Japan. The population of the enclave was about 6,000, including known collaborationist journalists, the writers Louis-Ferdinand C√©line and Lucien Rebatet, the actor Robert Le Vigan, and their families, as well as 500 soldiers, 700 French SS, prisoners of war and French civilian forced laborers. Inadequate housing, insufficient food, promiscuity among the paramilitaries, and lack of hygiene facilitated the spread of numerous illnesses including flu and tuberculosis) and a high mortality rate among children, ailments that were treated as best they could by the only two French doctors, Doctor Destouches, alias Louis-Ferdinand C√©line and Bernard M√©n√©trel. On 21 April 1945 General de Lattre ordered his forces to take Sigmaringen. The end came within days. By the 26th, P√©tain was in the hands of French authorities in Switzerland, and Laval had fled to Spain. Brinon, Luchaire, and Darnand were captured, tried, and executed by 1947. Other members escaped to Italy or Spain. = Transition = The liberation of France in 1944 dissolved the Vichy government. The requested representation, leading to the Provisional Government of the French Republic (French: Gouvernement provisoire de la R√©publique fran√ßaise, GPRF), also known as the French Committee of National Liberation. Past collaborators were discredited and Gaullism and communism became political forces. De Gaulle led the GPRF 1944-1946 while negotiations took place for a new constitution, to be put to a referendum. De Gaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called \\"the parties system\\". He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by Felix Gouin of the French Section of the Workers' International (Section fran√ßaise de l'Internationale ouvri√®re, SFIO). Only the French Communist Party (Parti communiste fran√ßais, PCF) and the socialist SFIO supported the draft constitution, which envisaged a form of unicameralism. This constitution was rejected in the 5 May 1946 referendum. French voters adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.  Other  After the fall of France on 25 June 1940 many French colonies were initially loyal to Vichy. But eventually the overseas empire helped liberate France; 300,000 North African Arabs fought in the ranks of the Free French.Robert Gildea, France since 1945 (1996) p 17 French Somaliland, an exception, got a governor loyal to Vichy on 25 July. It surrendered to Free French forces on 26 December 1942. The length and extent of each colony's collaboration with Vichy ran a gamut however; anti-semitic meansures met an enthusiastic reception in Algeria, for example. Operation Torch on 8 November landed Allied troops at Oran and Algiers (Operation Terminal) as well as at Casablanca in Morocco, to attack Vichy territories in North Africa‚ÄîMorocco, Algeria and Tunisia‚Äîthen take Axis forces in the Western Desert in their rear from the east.Playfair, I.

History of the Second World War United Kingdom Military Series. IV. Uckfield: Naval & Military Press. . Allied shipping had needed to supply troops in Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, so the Mediterranean ports were strategically valuable. The Battle of Dakar against the Free French Forces in September 1940 followed the Fall of France. Authorities in West Africa declared allegiance to the Vichy regime, as did the colony of French Gabon in French Equatorial Africa (AEF). Gabon fell to Free France after the Battle of Gabon in November 1940, but West Africa remained under Vichy control until the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942. Jurisdiction and effectivenessCollaboration with Germany= The German military administration cooperated closely with the Gestapo, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the intelligence service of the SS, and the Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo), its security police. It also drew support from the French authorities and police, who had to cooperate under the armistice, to round up Jews, anti- fascists and other dissidents, and from collaborationist auxiliaries like the Milice, the Franc-Gardes and the Legionary Order Service. The Milice helped Klaus Barbie seize members of the resistance and minorities including Jews for detention. The two main collaborationist political parties, the French Popular Party (PPF) and the National Popular Rally (RNP), each had 20,000 to 30,000 members. Collaborationists were fascists and Nazi sympathisers who collaborated for ideological reasons, unlike \\"collaborators\\", people who cooperated out of self-interest. A principal motivation and ideological foundation among collaborationists was anti-communism. Examples of these are PPF leader Jacques Doriot, writer Robert Brasillach and Marcel D√©at (founder of the RNP). Some Frenchmen also volunteered to fight for Germany or against Bolsheviks, such as the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism. Volunteers from this and other outfits later constituted the cadre of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French).  Foreign relations  The French State was quickly recognized by the Allies, as well as by the Soviet Union, until 30 June 1941 and Operation Barbarossa. However France broke with the United Kingdom after the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir. The United States took the position that Vichy should do nothing adverse to US interests that was not specifically required by the terms of the armistice. Canada maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy until the occupation of southern France in Case Anton by Germany and Italy in November 1942. In 1941, the Free French Forces fought with British troops against the Italians in Italian East Africa during the East African Campaign, and expanded operations north into Italian Libya. In February 1941, Free French Forces invaded Cyrenaica, led by Leclerc, and captured the Italian fort at the oasis of Kufra. In 1942, Leclerc's forces and soldiers from the British Long Range Desert Group captured parts of the province of Fezzan. At the end of 1942, Leclerc moved his forces into Tripolitania to join British Commonwealth and other FFF forces in the Run for Tunis.Keegan, John. Six Armies in Normandy. New York: Penguin Books, 1994. p300 French India under Louis Bonvin announced after the fall of France that they would join the British and the French under Charles de Gaulle. Nearly 300,000 French Jews, 80% of those remaining, moved to the Italian zone of occupation to escape the Nazis.Salvatore Orlando, La presenza ed il ruolo della IV Armata italiana in Francia meridionale prima e dopo l‚Äô8 settembre 1943, Ufficio Storico dello Stato Maggiore dell‚ÄôEsercito Italiano, Roma (in Italian) The Italian Jewish banker Angelo Donati had convinced the Italian civil and military authorities to protect the Jews from French persecution.From the French Shoah memorial : Angelo Donati‚Äôs report on the steps taken by the Italians to save the Jews in Italian-occupied France In January 1943 the Italians refused to cooperate with Nazi roundups of Jews living under their control and in March prevented them from deporting Jews from their zone. German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop complained to Mussolini that \\"Italian military circles... lack a proper understanding of the Jewish question.\\"Italy and the Jews ‚Äì Timeline by Elizabeth D. Malissa However, when the Italians signed the armistice with the Allies, German troops invaded the former Italian zone on 8 September 1943 and Alois Brunner, the SS official for Jewish affairs, formed units to search out Jews. Within five months, 5,000 Jews were caught and deported.  Legitimacy  left Given full constituent powers in the law of 10 July 1940, P√©tain never promulgated a new constitution. A draft was written in 1941 and signed by P√©tain in 1944, but never submitted nor ratified. The United States gave Vichy full diplomatic recognition, and sent Admiral William D. Leahy as ambassador.President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull hoped to encourage elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. The Americans also wanted Vichy to resist German demands for its naval fleet or air bases in French-mandated Syria or to move war supplies through French territories in North Africa. Americans held that France should take no action not explicitly required by the terms of the armistice that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. The Americans ended relations with Vichy when Germany occupied the zone libre of France in late 1942. The USSR maintained relations with Vichy until 30 June 1941, after the Nazis invaded Russia in Operation Barbarossa. France for a long time took the position that the republic had been disbanded when power was turned over to P√©tain, but officially admitted in 1995 complicity in the deportation of 76,000 Jews during WW II. President Jacques Chirac, speaking at the site of the V√©lodrome d'Hiver, where 13,000 Jews were rounded up for deportation to death camps in July 1942, said: \\"France, on that day [16 July 1942], committed the irreparable. Breaking its word, it handed those who were under its protection over to their executioners,\\" he said. Those responsible for the roundup were \\"450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis..... the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state\\". The police under Bousquet collaborated to the point where they themselves compiled the lists of Jewish residents, gave them yellow stars, and even requisitioned buses and SNCF trains to transport them to camps such as Drancy. The French themselves distinguish between collaborators, and collaborationists, who agreed with Nazi ideology and actively worked to further their domestic policies, as opposed to the majority of collaborators who worked with the Nazis reluctantly, and in order to avoid consequences to themselves. The international tribunal at Nuremberg called Vichy r√©gime agreements with the Nazis for deportation of citizens and residents void ab initio due to their \\"immoral content\\".

It was released as the ninth track on Scott-Heron's debut album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox. It tells of medical debt and poverty experienced during the Apollo Moon landings. The poem critiques the resources spent on the space program while Black Americans were experiencing marginalization. \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" was prominently featured in the 2018 biographical film about Neil Armstrong, First Man. It was also featured in the second episode of HBO‚Äôs Lovecraft Country. Background, recording, and content Gil Scott-Heron in 1986 Gil Scott-Heron stated that he was inspired to write \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" by a statement from writer and activist Eldridge Cleaver, who argued that the space program was distracting the US from internal problems. Scott-Heron wrote the poem the summer before it was released. Scott-Heron's mother suggested the refrain and the closing line. \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" was released as the ninth track on Scott-Heron's 1970 debut album, Small Talk at 125th and Lenox. Scott- Heron speaks the poem, alongside a drum accompaniment of a sort that was common in street poetry. It is just under two minutes long. Though the album has been frequently described as being recorded live in a nightclub in New York City, it was in fact recorded in a studio, with an audience present to simulate a live crowd. \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" narrates the story of Scott- Heron's \\"sister Nell,\\" who is bitten by a rat while Neil Armstrong lands on the Moon. It then talks of medical debt that is incurred for her treatment, and rising costs of basic necessities as a result of the Moon landings. It ends with the sarcastic promise that when the next bills arrive, Scott-Heron would send them by \\"air mail special to Whitey on the moon\\". The first lines of the poem run as follows: Analysis, reception, and reuse \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" has been described as exemplifying afrofuturism, or \\"Black social thought concerning 'culture, technology, and things to come'.\\" The poem critiques the US space program, by connecting its use of government funds to the marginalization of Black Americans. The poem identifies neglect by the government as the reason for poverty, an argument also made by Marvin Gaye's 1971 song \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\", and questioned who benefited from the space program. The connection that Scott-Heron implies between capitalism in the US and poverty, environmental destruction, and militarism were themes that were found in many other of his works. During the 1970s, the view that the country was spending too much on its space program was widespread in the US, and was shared by politicians including President Richard Nixon. This criticism of the space program has been described as reaching its epitome in \\"Whitey on the Moon.\\" Writing for The Atlantic after Scott-Heron's death in 2011, Alexis Madrigal stated that \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" had taken spaceflight out of the \\"abstract, universal realm in which we like to place our technical achievements.\\" Madrigal added that the poem raised questions about \\"which America\\" got the \\"glory of the moon landing\\", and of what the costs of putting \\"whitey on the moon\\" were. A 2014 biography of Scott-Heron described \\"Whitey on the Moon\\" as a \\"gem of a prose poem\\" that was well-received critically, and that it was a strong counterpoint to \\"reverent coverage\\" of the Moon landings. The 2018 film First Man, a biographical film about Neil Armstrong, prominently features \\"Whitey on the Moon.\\" Director Damien Chazelle and writer Josh Singer sought to portray the \\"passionate feelings\\" of those opposed to the cost of the program: Singer stated he was interested in \\"pulling the veneer off\\" of what had been a \\"pretty sugarcoated story.\\" In the film, the poem is read over footage of the Apollo 1 disaster and of people protesting the space program. It was performed by Leon Bridges, and included on the movie's soundtrack album. The poem is also used prominently in the second episode of HBO's series Lovecraft Country. The episode, which is titled \\"Whitey's on the Moon\\", debuted on August 23, 2020.

He was also involved in crime schemes, being sentenced to six months of prison in 1876 for his role in Chicago's segment of the Whiskey Ring. Rehm later was involved in building and operating streetcars on the city's North Side. Early life Rehm was born December 7, 1828 in Gerstheim, located in the Alsace region of France. In 1840, at the age of twelve, he immigrated with his parents to Chicago. Career In 1855, Rehm was appointed Chicago's street commissioner. Rehm was appointed the Chicago Police Department's first deputy superintendent in 1855. He also became the Police Captain of the North Side. In 1857, Rehm briefly served as First Lieutenant. In 1858, he became the City Hall Police Captain. From March 1, 1859 through March 5, 1860, Rehm served as City Marshall, the head of the Chicago Police Department. After resigning from the police force in 1860, he worked with a brewery. On March 27, 1861, Rehm was appointed by the newly- established police board as Deputy Superintendent of Police. This came after the department had ended the position of City Marshall, but before they had yet to appoint a General Superintendent of Police to be the new head of police. This put Rehm as a de facto head of the police force. On April 6th, the board appointed Cyrus P. Bradley to assist Rehm in supervising the police force. They, effectively, jointly headed the police force until April 23, when the board appointed Bradley the General Superintendent of Police. Rehm worked with Bradley to create a more effective police force, aiming to create a professional force with a standardized image. Together, they introduced physical requirements for all men hired for the force. They also reintroduced police uniforms, creating uniforms copied after those of the New York City Metropolitan Police. They put into place rules about what facial hair policemen would be permitted to sport. Rehm and Bradley also acquired reputations for severely disciplining their men. Rehm succeeded Bradley as the General Superintendent of Police, serving from February 20, 1863 until July 3, 1863. After this, he became involved with a brewery again. In 1865, he founded a brewery baring his name. After William Turtle resigned in November 1865, Rehm was appointed General Superintendent of Police again. He served until 1871. He was serving on an interim basis from November 1865 until January 13, 1866, when he was appointed permanent General Superintendent of Police. During this 1865‚Äì1871 tenure, in 1867, a major labor strike occurred in Chicago over demands for an eight-hour day, and Rehm was tasked with keeping the peace. On February 8, 1869, he was also appointed to serve a five-year term as an inaugural commissioner of Lincoln Park. Beginning in 1871, Rehm served on the Chicago Police Board, retiring from it in May of the following year. He was replaced on the board by Ernest Klokke. In the 1871 municipal elections, he was involved with the \\"Fireproof\\" ticket, which elected Joseph Medill in the mayoral race. In 1872, Rehm, then a sergeant, was forced to resign from the police force after improperly releasing a prisoner. He later rejoined as a sergeant, but was fired in 1873 for obeying the police commissioners over embattled General Superintendent Elmer Washburn. For the 1873 election cycle, Rehm was politically involved with the People's Party. The party's mayoral candidate that year, Harvey D. Colvin, was successful. At the request of Michael C. McDonald, a crime boss influential in Chicago politics who was friendly with Rehm, newly-elected mayor Colvin appointed Rehm to again as General Superintendent of Police. Rehm was appointed after Elmer Washburn resigned. During this tenure, in exchange for $30,000, Rehm provided McDonald access to confidential police records. McDonald and Rehm also collaborated as part of the Whiskey Ring, in which they would siphon federal tax dollars from alcohol tax and would funnel the money into Rehm's personal bank accounts, as well as bank accounts of Anton C. Hesing and other political allies of McDonald. Rehm resigned as General Superintendent of Police on October 4, 1875. He resigned in scandal. Rehm served six months of prison time and paid a $10,000 fine for his role in the Whiskey Ring. His sentencing came on July 7, 1876. Rehm was involved with the construction of the North Side streetcars. Among the streetcar companies he was invested in were the North Chicago City Railway and the North Division Railway Company. He was also involved in the leadership of such companies. In 1891, Rehm built an August Fiedler-designed mansion in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. Later life Rehm died March 6, 1915 of paralysis.

Gray is a researcher in the study of the biological basis of Huntington's Disease (HD). In her postdoctoral work, she developed a transgenic mouse line, BACHD, that is now used worldwide in the study of HD. Gray's research now focuses on the role of glial cells in HD. In 2020 Gray was named one of the 100 Inspiring Black Scientists in America by CellPress.  Early life and education  Gray was born in West Central Alabama, and was raised in a rural community. Her rural upbringing instilled in her a love of animal life and inspired her to pursue her undergraduate degree in the biological sciences. In 1993, Gray began college at Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama. Through several National Institutes of Health funded programs, Gray got involved in research both at ASU and during the summer at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Her research experiences undergrad, supported by the Minority Biomedical Research Support grant and the Minority Access to Research Careers program, allowed her to confirm that academic was her calling. After graduating with a Bachelors of Science in 1997, Gray followed her passion for research by pursuing graduate training at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Gray trained under the mentorship of Christine Beattie in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, studying nervous system development in zebrafish. She was the first graduate student in the lab and was funded by and F31 National Institutes of Health Grant. She explored the supernumary development of Mauthner neurons due to mutations in the deadly seven/notch1a gene. She found that the extra neurons that form as a result of the mutation are incorporated into the neural circuit critical for escape behavior in zebrafish. Since the neurons divide their territory, this suggest that plasticity or expansion of ancient escape response neural circuits may have paved the way for larger more complex escape neural circuits in mammals. Following completion of her PhD in 2003, Gray moved to California to complete her postdoctoral work at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under the mentorship of X. William Yang, Gray switched her focus of study to neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Huntington's Disease. Gray pioneered the development of a novel mouse model for HD that is now the predominant mouse model for HD used worldwide. One of Gray's first projects in the lab was working with a team to develop a novel method for sorting and identifying genetically defined cell populations. She applied fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to genetically labelled neurons and then characterized their gene expression profiles. They identified a new set of differentially expressed genes in two subtypes of basal neurons, and found that expression of Ebf1 is critical to the differentiation of striatonigral neurons which are implicated in HD. In 2008, Gray published a first author paper in the Journal of Neuroscience highlighting a novel transgenic mouse model for HD that she developed. She achieved expression of the mutant huntingtin protein in mice using insertion of a bacterial artificial chromosome expressing the full- length human mutant huntingtin gene. The BACHD mice exhibited HD phenotypes, both behaviorally and neuropathologically, and it became a robust in vivo paradigm with which to study HD pathogenesis and treatment efficacy.  Career and research  In 2008, Gray joined the University of Alabama Birmingham Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics (CNET) in the Department of Neurology. She became the Dixon Scholar and was an instructor in Neurology for two years before her promotion to tenure-track Assistant Professor in 2010. Gray is also affiliated with the Center for Glial Biology in Medicine, The Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, and the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center at UAB. In addition to her research roles, Gray co-directs the School of Medicine's Summer in Biomedical Sciences (SIBS) Undergraduate Research Program and she is on the Board of Trustees for the Huntington's Disease Society of America. Gray in the Principal Investigator of a lab focused on exploring the role of astrocytes in HD. She decided to transition her research focus to glial biology to understand the role of glial cells in HD. HD research had predominantly focused on medium spiny neurons, yet the majority of brain cells are glia and they have been increasingly recognized as contributors to neurodegeneration and disease processes in the brain. Gray used the mouse model that she pioneered in her postdoctoral work to achieve cell-type specific expression of the mutant huntingtin protein to dissect which cell type are playing which roles in disease pathogenesis and further dissect the mechanisms through which neurodegeneration occur in specifically striatal medium spiny neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. She also explores the potential of modifying gliotransmitters to ameliorate the symptoms of HD. = Astrocytes in Huntington‚Äôs Disease = In 2013, shortly after Gray began her lab at UAB, she discovered that astrocytes in BACHD models of HD in mice exhibit aberrant glutamate release. Since glutamate- mediated excitotoxicity is known to injure neurons, this finding pointed to astrocytes playing a potential role in HD pathogenesis. Explore the mechanisms of the aberrant glutamate release in BACHD astrocytes, Gray and her team found that they have increased levels of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate carboxylase yet no changes in the enzyme that converts glutamate to glutamine in the cell. Gray then explored if expression of mutant huntingtin is necessary in astrocytes for expression of HD symptoms. They used a conditional knock out to selectively prevent expression of mutant huntingtin in astrocytes. They found that removal of mutant huntingtin in astrocytes led to significant improvements in motor movement and psychiatric symptoms, suggesting that astrocytes contribute to disease pathology in HD. Since Gray's lab had established an obvious role for astrocytes in HD pathogenesis, they then explored the potential mechanisms underlying the role of astrocytes in HD. They first looked to gliotransmission and inhibited the SNARE complex in astrocytes to prevent exocytosis of gliotransmitters from astrocytes. They found an overall decrease in behavioral performance in certain tasks when the SNARE complex in astrocytes was inhibited, though the rotarod performance improved by 12 months of age suggestion that a region specific approach might highlight the role of specific astrocyte populations in the pathogenesis of HD.

It was written by mathematician Anne Penfold Street and her daughter, statistician Deborah Street, and published in 1987 by the Oxford University Press under their Clarendon Press imprint. Topics The book has 15 chapters. Its introductory chapter covers the history and applications of experimental designs, it has five chapters on balanced incomplete block designs and their existence, and three on Latin squares and mutually orthogonal Latin squares. Other chapters cover resolvable block designs, finite geometry, symmetric and asymmetric factorial designs, and partially balanced incomplete block designs. After this standard material, the remaining two chapters cover less-standard material. The penultimate chapter covers miscellaneous types of designs including circular block designs, incomplete Latin squares, and serially balanced sequences. The final chapter describes specialized designs for agricultural applications. The coverage of the topics in the book includes examples, clearly written proofs, historical references, and exercises for students. Audience and reception Although intended as an advanced undergraduate textbook, this book can also be used as a graduate text, or as a reference for researchers. Its main prerequisites are some knowledge of linear algebra and linear models, but some topics touch on abstract algebra and number theory as well. Although disappointed by the omission of some topics, reviewer D. V. Chopra writes that the book \\"succeeds remarkably well\\" in connecting the separate worlds of combinatorics and statistics. And Marshall Hall, reviewing the book, called it \\"very readable\\" and \\"very satisfying\\". Related books Other books on the combinatorics of experimental design include Statistical Design and Analysis of Experiments (John, 1971), Constructions and Combinatorial Problems in Design of Experiments (Rao, 1971), Design Theory (Beth, Jungnickel, and Lenz, 1985), and Combinatorial Theory and Statistical Design (Constantine, 1987). Compared to these, Combinatorics of Experimental Design makes the combinatorial aspects of the subjects more accessible to statisticians, and its last two chapters contain material not covered by the other books. However, it omits several other topics that were included in Rao's more comprehensive text.

Due to circumstances young Rukayya (Saba Qamar) ends up being mother to her infant cousin sister (sajal aly) and names her Pari. Pari's mother Husna (also played by Sajal Aly) runs away and marries Babban against wishes of her parents. When she elopes, her only elder brother dies while in search for and her father dies as he could not see his son's death. The family now was left only with Apa Bi (Husna's mother), Salma (Husna,s widow elder sister), Rukayya (salma's Daughter) and Naseeban (Family maid). While giving birth to Pari, Husna ( lived outside her house as Apa Bi didn't let her inside Haveli) dies and Apa Bi disowns Pari and decides to hand her to her father, Babban who might sell her as well. But young Rukayya is very attached with Pari and resents. Years pass by and young Rukayya gets mature at a very young age. With help of Naseeban, she grows up Pari. In their childhood they meet their cousin Aazam (Danish Taimoor) who is younger than Rukayya. Aazam's father, Ashfaq is the brother of Apa Bi and who after death of her husband managed their business and manages their expenses as well. During their first visit young Pari fights with Aazam and Aazam‚Äô mother Nafisa ( second wife of Ashfaq) scolds Pari and leaves. Apa Bi hates pari and called her Dayan( witch) who will eat up the whole house. In background there are past lives of Naseeban being shown where she falls in love with a tree. Show takes a leap, Now Pari is grown up teenager while Rukayya has crossed 30 and is too old to get married. Aazam now grown up visits the Haveli frequently and Pari who is extremely possessive for Rukayya hates him as she thinks he might marry Rukayya and take her away from her. Aazam develops a liking for Rukayya. He visits again and distances herself from Rukayya and gets close to Pari. Meanwhile, Pari suffers from attacks and Rukayya takes her to Mosque and Hakim for her treatment. At mosque she meets Shauki, a beggar who stares/stalks Pari. Aazam visits again and due to situations Pari gets attack again, Rukayya calls hakim and Aazam doesn't like his way of treatment and takes Rukayya and Pari to his home for pari's treatment. Pari suffers from Epilepsy and personality disorder. There he confesses to Rukayya that he loves Pari only because she is so important to her. He asks her to marry him to which she refuses as she is much older to him. Rukayya returns to their Haveli along with Pari and Aazam writes her lot of letters. Later after lot of problems Rukayya and Aazam get married. During their marriage Pari dressed up as bribe and starts calling herself Rukayya. Rukayya and Aazam ignore this and take her together at Aazam's home. Pari tried to get close to Aazam and Aazam decided to send her back to Haveli. She is ill-treated at Haveli and she runs away with Shauki in search of her father. Shauki's past life story runs in background. Rukayya and Aazam call police, but Pari was untraceable. Shauki finds Babban in city, but old and ill Babban refuses to identify himself to them. Shauki leaves Pari at a peer ao that she is safe there. Meanwhile, police kill Shauki and beat up Babban to know where is Pari. But he doesn't say anything. He asks her friend Neelam to search for Pari. Pari starts to live with Babban. Babban realises his mistakes and realises that he might die. He takes Pari to Husna's grave and dies there. Meanwhile, Rukayya and Aazam go for a body's identification as it might be Pari. In the process Rukayya suffers a miscarriage. Aazam comes to know that she will never be able to bear child but doesn't tell Rukayya. Neelam goes to Haveli to meet Apa Bi who is paralysed. She reads a letter written by Husna and returns Husna's earring. Looking at Apa Bi's cold behaviour Neelam goes away. After 3 years, Rukayya finds Pari at a rehab where they deal with split personality disorders patients. Rukayya brings her to her house. Later Rukayya discovers that she will not be able to bear child. She asks Aazam to marry Pari. After arguments he marries Pari and Pari due to her disorder pretends to be Rukayya. Pari becomes pregnant and asks Rukayya to leave Aazam or she will kill their child as she believes Aazam and Rukayya only want a child and they don't love her. Rukayya goes back to Haveli. Angey Aazam visits and scolds Rukayya and asks her to stop playing with her emotions. Next day, Pari says sorry to Rukayya and asks for forgiveness. Rukayya asks why is she saying so. She pushes Rukayya from the stairs and she is hospitalised. Her heartbeat stops. Aazam is heartbroken and comes to Haveli and sees Pari sitting below a tree where she was born. He shouts at her that she got what she wanted, Rukayya is no more. He said I will always hate you and you will never be able to become Rukayya who is the only love of his life. Pari dies ( saying Rukayya will die as she feels she is Rukayya). Meanwhile, in hospital Rukayya gets her heartbeats again and opens her eyes. The drama closes that everyone accused Pari to take away everything from Rukayya, her childhood, her toys, her life, her husband and now she took away Rukayya's death as well.

The activity of chlorotonil A has been attributed to the gem-dichloro-1,3-dione moiety, which is a unique functionality in polyketides. In addition to its unique halogenation, the structure of chlorotonil A has also garnered interest due to its similarity to anthracimycin, a polyketide natural product with antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Biosynthesis Chlorotonil A is synthesized from a type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS). This gene cluster does not have any acyltransferase (AT) domains, indicating that it is a trans-AT PKS; in these systems, there is a tandem-AT domain that loads the extender subunits onto the acyl carrier protein (ACP) and checks the intermediates, rather than individual AT domains in each module. The gene cluster of chlorotonil A is organized so that the initiator, acetyl-CoA, is loaded onto the tandem-AT domain, then is iteratively elongated with malonyl-CoA units to construct the macrolactone backbone. At modules 3 and 7, a double bond shift occurs in the elongation module to allow for the Œ≤,Œ≥-unsaturation and Œ±-methylation. There is a spontaneous, non-enzymatic intramolecular Diels-Alder-like [4+2] cycloaddition at module 8 to furnish the decalin motif. Following macrolactonization by the thioesterase domain of module 10, the premature chlorotonil A core is chlorinated twice by CtoA, a flavin-dependent halogenase. The halogenated core is then methylated by the standalone SAM- dependent methyltransferase CtoF to yield chlorotonil A. PKS architecture of chlorotonil A.

All links are connected to each other by five joints in series forming a loop. One of the links is the ground or base.Dong, Dianbiao, et al. \\"Design and optimization of a powered ankle-foot prosthesis using a geared five-bar spring mechanism\\". International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems 14.3 (2017): 1729881417704545. p. 3. This configuration is also called a pantograph, Campion, Gianni. \\"The Pantograph Mk-II: a haptic instrument.\\" The Synthesis of Three Dimensional Haptic Textures: Geometry, Control, and Psychophysics. Springer, London, 2005. 45-58. however, it is not to be confused with the parallelogram copying linkage pantograph. The linkage can be a single degree- of-freedom mechanism if two gears are attached to two links and are meshed together, forming a geared five-bar mechanism. Animation of a five-bar mechanism angle sweep over its workspace, done on MATLAB. The red arrow indicates the velocity direction of the end-effector due to unit speed input at the left motor and its length is proportional to its speed. Robotic Configuration When controlled motors actuate the linkage, the whole system (a mechanism and its actuators) becomes a robot.He, Dong; Zhihong Sun; and W. J. Zhang. \\"A note on inverse kinematics of hybrid actuation robots for path design problems\\". ASME 2011 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition. American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection, 2011. This is usually done by placing two Servomotors (to control the two degrees of freedom) at the joints A and B, controlling the angle of the links L2 and L5. L1 is the grounded link. In this configuration, the controlled endpoint or end-effector is the point D, where the objective is to control its x and y coordinates in the plane in which the linkage resides. This robotic configuration is a parallel manipulator. It is a parallel configuration robot as it is composed of two controlled Serial manipulators connected to the endpoint. Unlike a Serial manipulator, this configuration has the advantage of having both motors grounded at the base link. As the motor can be quite massive, this significantly decreases the total moment of inertia of the linkage and improves backdrivability for haptic feedback applications. On the other hand, workspace reached by the endpoint is usually significantly smaller than that of a serial manipulator. Velocity ellipses of a five-bar linkage robot. =Kinematics and Dynamics= Both the forward and inverse kinematics of this robotic configuration can be found in closed-form equations through geometric relationships. Different methods of finding both have been done by Campion and Hayward. Dynamic modeling of this robotic configuration has been done by Khalil and Abu Seif, forming an equations of motion relating the torques applied at motor with the angles at the joints. The model assumes all links are rigid with center of gravity at their centers, and zero-stiffness at all joints.  Applications  This robotic linkage is used in many different fields ranging from prosthetics to haptic feedback. This design has been explored in several haptic feedback devices for general force feedback. It has also been used in the automatic drawing toy WeDraw.

Biography  His father was a theatre mechanic and his uncle was a concertmaster. All of his siblings became involved in the theatre in some creative capacity. At the age of five, his family moved to Vienna , where he later studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. Before and during that time, he also studied the construction of theatrical machinery with his father, and set painting with ; among others. He began working as a decorator and engineering assistant to his father in 1821. The following year, he became Chief Engineer at the Theater in der Josefstadt. After leaving that post, around 1830, he worked at theatres throughout Germany and Austria; also travelling to England, Scotland, and France. While in Berlin, he worked with the architect and designer, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who would have a lasting influence on his work.Biography @ the Mariinsky Theatre In 1833, he was invited to St. Petersburg to become a decorator and Chief Engineer for the Imperial Theatres: a position he would hold until 1879, when illness forced him to resign. During those years, he designed some of the most significant productions in his adopted country, including the premier of A Life for the Tsar, by Mikhail Glinka, one of the first Russian operas, at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. His technical contributions included the introduction of moving scenery and the so-called \\"ruin effect\\", where the stage set appears to collapse. In 1862, he created a version of La Forza del Destino, by Verdi, with thunder and the illusion of rain. He was eventually involved in over 200 plays, operas and ballets, as well as producing over a thousand tableaux vivants. He also painted curtains and created a panorama of the city of Palermo that was displayed near the Mikhailovsky Manezh, but was destroyed by fire a mere two years later, in 1852. Several reconstruction projects made use of his expertise; notably those at the Winter Palace (1836) and the Hermitage (1856). That same year, he was named a Professor of perspective at the Imperial Academy. He became a Russian citizen in 1873.

He is Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Professor of Water Diplomacy at Tufts University. He serves as the Director of Water Diplomacy. He is also the Founding Editor of the Water Diplomacy Series. Islam's work has been focused on availability, access and allocation of water within the context of climate challenges, health, and diplomacy. His work has been significant in the creation of the area of Water diplomacy. He has written over 100 scientific articles and four books. In 2016, Islam received the Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water.  Early life and education  Islam was born in Bangladesh on 24 May 1960. He received his Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) with Honors. He taught in BUET for a year before moving to the United States. In the United States, he received his Master of Science in Environmental Engineering from the University of Maine. Islam received his Doctor of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. He worked with Rafael L. Bras and Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe from hydrology and Edward Lorenz and Kerry Emanuel from meteorology to examine predictability of precipitation for his doctoral dissertation.  Career  Islam joined University of Cincinnati as an Assistant Professor in 1991, becoming Associate Professor in 1997 and Full Professor in 2001. He served as the Founding Director of Cincinnati Earth Systems Sciences Program from 1995 to 2004 and as the Director Graduate Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from 2000 to 2004. In 2004, Islam left University of Cincinnati and joined Tufts University. There he served as the Associate Dean of Engineering for Research from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, he was appointed the Director of Water Diplomacy Program. In 2012, Islam became the Founding Editor of Water Diplomacy Series. Islam's research has been covered in several media outlets including BBC World Service, New York Times, Boston Globe, World Bank, Vox, The Hague Department of Justice, The Daily Star, and Yale Environment 360.  Research and work  Water diplomacy = In his early career, Islam took two complementary areas of geoscience research: scale issues and remote sensing within the context of climate challenges and water borne diseases to solve scientific problems. Between 1990 and 2000, he focused on a research strategy that integrated issues of scales with another area: growing availability of multi- sensor data from remote sensing. Later, Islam started focusing on water science and engineering for actionable societal impact. Islam addressed the problem of water science for societal impact in his first book Water diplomacy: A Negotiated Approach to Managing Complex Water Networks where he suggested that \\"the solution space for these complex problems - involving interdependent variables, processes, actors, and institutions - can't be pre- stated. Consequently, one can't know what will or can happen with any reasonable certainty. To address these persistent water problems, one needs to start by acknowledging the limits of our knowing to act and the contingent nature of our action. When neither the certainty of scientific solutions nor the consensus of what solutions to implement exists, what we need is Water Diplomacy.\\" In an NSF funded project, Islam initiated the Water Diplomacy Program. In another NSF funded project, Islam helped to create a Water Diplomacy Research Coordination Network with over 400 water scholars and professionals from 70 countries. To put the theory of Water Diplomacy Framework into practice, Islam initiated Water Diplomacy Workshop in Boston. His second book Water Diplomacy in Action: Contingent Approaches to Managing Complex Water Problems came out in 2017, followed by Complexity of Transboundary Water Conflicts: Enabling Conditions for Negotiating Contingent Resolutions in 2018. In 2019, he wrote Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Water Diplomacy: A Principled and Pragmatic Approach. = Climate and Health= Islam's research group has also looked at the apparently disconnected water problems of cholera and water conflict to provide synthesis of theory and practice of science for measurable societal outcomes. Islam in collaboration Rita Colwell provided an approach to develop a satellite-based cholera prediction model.

She is a Professor emeritus of Maastricht University. Meijer was born in Eindhoven in 1949, and gained her doctorate cum laude from Utrecht University in 1988 with a thesis entitled De lust tot reading. She argued that women poets had been overlooked and that a less technical review of their work was required. She then worked for ten years at the same university, where she led the post graduate women's studies doctoral students. From 1997 to 1999, as endowed professor, she was the first professor of the Opzij chair at Maastricht University. She taught Gender, Representation and Power. In 1972 Meijer was one of the founders of the lesbian feminist action group Purple September, a spin-off from Dolle Mina. In 1979 the Lesbian beautiful book was edited by Meijer. She was a columnist for the lesbian magazine Diva and was in the first editorial of the lesbian magazine Lust en Gratie . In 1998 she published \\"The Defiant Muse\\" and she became a full professor of gender studies at the Center for Gender and Diversity at Maastricht University. Her book \\"The Defiant Muse\\" dealt with the history of \\"Dutch and Flemish Feminist Poems from the Middle Ages to the Present\\" and it included extracts of poetry as well as biographies of the poets. The book was bi-lingual including both Dutch and English translations. She is an advocate for women poets who are better but not as well known as some male poets. Meijer was a contributor of biographies to the Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture published in 2006. She worked on poetry theory and culture studies. In 2011 she published a biography of M. Vasalis. Maijer created the Vasalis biography with the help of her descendants, but it was said to be with done with caution as Vasalis had always protected her identity and her privacy during her lifetime, but Maijer noted that she had kept documents carefully and destyroyed some indicating that she had been aware that they would in time be read. She retired in 2014, but she continued to research, write and talk. In 2018 she published a biography of the Dutch poet and illustrator Fritzi Harmsen van Beek. The book followed interviews with people who knew her and it was nominated for a literature prize.

Three types of axons enter the ciliary ganglion but only the preganglionic parasympathetic axons synapse there. The entering axons are arranged into three roots of the ciliary ganglion, which join enter the posterior surface of the ganglion. Sympathetic root The sympathetic root of ciliary ganglion is one of three roots of the ciliary ganglion. It contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers whose cell bodies are located in the superior cervical ganglion. Their axons ascend with the internal carotid artery as a plexus of nerves, the carotid plexus. Sympathetic fibers supplying the eye separate from the carotid plexus within the cavernous sinus. They run forward through the superior orbital fissure and merge with the long ciliary nerves (branches of the nasociliary nerve) and the short ciliary nerves (from the ciliary ganglion). Sympathetic fibers in the short ciliary nerves pass through the ciliary ganglion without forming synapses. Preganglionic sympathetic fibers originate from neurons in the intermediolateral column of the thoracic spinal cord, at the level of thoracic spinal nerve 1 (T1) and thoracic spinal nerve 2 (T2). They form synapses in the superior cervical ganglion. The ratio of incoming to outgoing fibers (the ‚Äúconvergence‚Äù) in this ganglion is approximately 100:1. Sympathetic motor neurons in the spinal cord are controlled by supranuclear pathways that descend through the brainstem and spinal cord. Interruption of the sympathetic chain at any level (from the brainstem to the ciliary ganglion) will produce pupillary constriction (miosis) and eyelid droop (ptosis) ‚Äì the classic signs of Horner's syndrome. Sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion innervate blood vessels (vasoconstriction), sweat glands, and 4 eye muscles: the dilator pupillae, the superior tarsal muscle, the inferior tarsal muscle and the orbitalis. The dilator pupillae dilates the pupil; its action is antagonistic to the sphincter pupillae. Pupil size is therefore under the dual control of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Postsynaptic sympathetic signals that originate in the superior cervical ganglion are carried by the nasociliary nerve or directly extend from the internal carotid plexus and pass through the ciliary ganglion. The superior tarsal muscle elevates the upper eyelid. The levator palpebrae superioris, which is supplied by a branch of the oculomotor nerve, also elevates the upper eyelid. Eyelid elevation is therefore under both voluntary and involuntary control. Interruption of either pathway will result in eyelid droop (ptosis). The other two eye muscles with sympathetic supply (the inferior tarsal muscle and the orbitalis) are vestigial in humans. They are variable and often incompletely developed. Sensory root Sensory fibers from the eyeball (the cornea, iris, and ciliary body) run posteriorly through the short ciliary nerves and pass through the ciliary ganglion without forming synapses. They leave the ciliary ganglion in the sensory root of ciliary ganglion, which joins the nasociliary nerve‚Äîa branch of the ophthalmic nerve. From there, the signal travels back through the ophthalmic nerve to the trigeminal nerve and back into specific nuclei in the thalamus where they are relayed to areas in the cerebral cortex. The exact distribution of sensory fibers, like the distribution of sympathetic fibers, is anatomically variable. There are other pathways to the eye for both sympathetic and sensory fibers, and the precise anatomy varies from person to person. Since the result is the same regardless of how the fibers reach the eye, the presence of sympathetic and sensory fibers in the ciliary ganglion (the contributions of the ‚Äúsensory‚Äù and ‚Äúsympathetic‚Äù roots) is of no functional significance. Parasympathetic root The parasympathetic root of ciliary ganglion provides parasympathetic supply to the ciliary ganglion. The ciliary ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion. Incoming parasympathetic nerve fibers form synapses with the dendrites of nerve cells within the ganglion. However, the ciliary ganglion is not simply a relay station connecting preganglionic to postganglionic nerve fibers. There are roughly twice as many incoming parasympathetic fibers as outgoing parasympathetic fibers. Neural processing occurs as incoming signals converge onto target neurons. Presynaptic parasympathetic fibers originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the parasympathetic motor nucleus associated with the oculomotor nucleus in the brainstem. Axons from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and the oculomotor nucleus run together in the brainstem and exit together as the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve passes through the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. It divides into branches that innervate the levator palpebrae superioris and four of the six extraocular muscles. Parasympathetic fibers initially run in the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve. They exit as one or two short ‚Äúmotor roots‚Äù that synapse in the ciliary ganglion. Postsynaptic parasympathetic fibers leave the ciliary ganglion in multiple (six to ten) short ciliary nerves. These nerves enter the posterior aspect of the eyeball to supply the sphincter pupillae and ciliaris muscles. The sphincter pupillae constricts the iris. The ciliaris muscle changes the shape of the lens, allowing the eye to focus on nearby objects (accommodation). Neither of these muscles is under voluntary control.

He was the inventor of the first working typewriters sold to the public. He was born in South Carolina and lived in Alabama, making him a Confederate, which put him at a disadvantage initially in obtaining US patents. He temporarily lived in England, where he developed his typewriter invention and received British patent rights. He sold some of his typewriters in England as early as 1867, which were the first typewriters bought by the public. Pratt's typing innovation was initially presented to London societies of engineers and scientists. Subsequently, it was reported in British and American magazines and journals. This was the inspiration for Christopher Sholes's typewriter, the Remington typewriter, and the Hammond Typewriter. Historians have given Pratt the designation of being the \\"grandfather\\" of the typewriter.  Early life  John Jonathon Pratt was born at Union, South Carolina, on April 14, 1831. His father was a lawyer and a judge for over thirty years in South Carolina. His maternal grandfather was also in the legal profession. Pratt attended local public schools and graduated from Cokesbury college in 1849.  Mid life  Pratt's first job in the early 1850s was as part-owner in the National Democrat newspaper in Centre, Alabama, where he worked as a printer's devil and reporter. In the late 1850s he served as the editor for the Gadsden Times newspaper. He also worked as a historian of Cherokee County, Alabama, during this time and became a victim of writer's cramp. This inspired him to see if he could make a mechanical device to replace the labor of handwriting. Pratt put together a crude apparatus as early as 1860 for a device that would print letters on a piece of paper. This was done with a set of knitting needles that had wooden blocks attached to them, with a metal type letter attached to each of the blocks. The inked type letter would imprint onto a piece of paper when the knitting needles were manipulated accordingly. He developed this into a practical typewriter model in the spring of 1863 that would print letters automatically upon hitting keys. Pratt had developed his early-version typing device into a rotating print wheel that hit the proper letter with a hammer when a certain piano-like key was struck by a person's finger. The metal wheel employed a small plate of rows bearing letter fonts. This was supported vertically and placed behind a sheet of paper. It provided the means whereby a small hammer struck the selected letter and left an imprint on the paper. The mechanism then moved the paper to make room for the next letter to be printed. Pratt was a Confederate, being a citizen of Alabama and not capable of getting a patent for various reasons, including legal and financial. He decided to move to Glasgow and sold his slaves and property to finance the trip. With his wife he sailed to England in 1864 where he spent most of his spare time perfecting his typewriter. He called his typewriter the Pterotype, meaning winged type. Pratt's machine was given provisional protection by the British government in February 1864. He received English patent number 3,163 on December 1, 1866. With his invention of a practical and portable typewriter came the end of the experimental stage of typewriting machines. Pratt exhibited his typewriter in London in 1867 to the Royal Society of Arts, the Society of United Kingdom Engineers, and the Royal Society of Great Britain. He had two working models that he displayed in front of scientists and engineers. One of those models is in the British Museum. A descriptive paper was read by the inventor before the Society of Arts explaining its construction and usefulness. The article was published in 1867 in the London Engineering journal associated with the society. English periodicals at the time published reports about Pratt's typewriter. Pratt's description was reprinted in the American popular science magazine Scientific American on July 6, 1867. It was further described in another Scientific American article on August 10, 1872. The 1867 Scientific American Pratt article describes in detail the function and process of Pratt's finger- operated machine. It goes on to say that typing would be one of the aspects of a future society. It points out that the advantages of such a device indicate that laborious pen writing and poor penmanship would soon become a thing of the past, and legible, crisply printed letters would become the general rule with the use of his machine. The machine also allows a person to record his thoughts twice as fast as writing them down using pen and ink. The article predicts that publishing would undergo a revolution as remarkable as that which happened by the global spread of the printing press. It goes on to predict that the weary process of learning penmanship in schools would be reduced to just the skill of knowing how to write one's own signature. Students would learn the talent of typing instead, like that of learning how to play the piano. 1892 Hammond typewriter Pratt was the first to make practical working typewriters and sell them to the public. He sold several of his typewriters in 1867 in London. The first English ones sold for $15. Among his purchasers were the English scientist Charles Wheatstone and English physician Henry Bence Jones. Pratt returned to the United States in 1868 and obtained patent US81,000 for his typewriter. He sold his US version for $125. That was considered expensive, as a horse-drawn carriage cost $40 to $70 at the time. The first U.S. typewriters that came into mass production by other companies were not available until after 1870. The Remington Typewriter Company's Sholes & Glidden typewriters with the QWERTY keyboard (Remington model No. 1 based on Pratt's typewriter) started to be produced in 1874. Pratt obtained a second patent, US267367A, in 1882 that became a Hammond Typewriter model. He sold those rights to James B. Hammond for a lump sum of cash and a $2,500 life annuity. Later in the 1890s, when he was in his sixties, he became an advisor and superintendent for their factory that manufactured these in Brooklyn, New York. The patent as recorded at the United States Patent Office describes the machine as having three rows of 36 different type letter symbols each letter character selected then accordingly to be printed. The paper that was being typed had a carbon sheet between it and the type letter selected from the type wheel that provided the necessary ink. Typewriter description Remington foot treadle Pratt was the first inventor of a typewriter in which a type wheel moved by levers manipulated the correct key to print the letter. He has been credited as the first to apply escapement to feed motion and trip-hammer action in a wheel or plate mechanism for a typewriter. He is also the first to use compound motion, thus utilizing several types on a wheel for printing action on a typewriter. Thomas Edison took Pratt's wheel idea a step further in technology and applied electricity to the movement of the wheel ‚Äì the electric printing wheel of the stock market ticker tape machine. Pratt claimed four essential mechanical operations that he devised that made his typewriter function properly. First, it was necessary to bring forward any one of a number of letters at the will of the operator in arbitrary succession to a common point, to be able to print with ink of some kind a colored legible character at that common printing point. Second, it was necessary to feed the paper across that common predesignated point so as to make proper intervals between the letters and words. Third, it was necessary to make the mechanical linkage bring the paper back to its start position in a quick, smooth fashion, which was done with a foot treadle. Fourth, these mechanics of returning to the start position also had to enter in a line space at the same time. Pratt's machine, which he labeled the Pterotype, had other names besides type-writer. These later labels were \\"Patent Printer\\", \\"Mechanical Chirographer\\", \\"An Improvement in Printing Instruments for the Blind\\", \\"An Improved Hand Printing Device or Mechanical Typographer\\", and \\"A Machine for writing with type of printing on paper or other substance\\", among others. The name typewriter came from the 1867 Scientific American article that described Pratt's original English version as a \\"typewriting machine\\". Christopher Latham Sholes is the one who often used the word type-writer for his typewriting contraption, and that shorter version was the one that English-speaking users have accepted to call Pratt's machine.  Grandfather of the typewriter  According to a booklet published by the Remington Standard Typewriter company, Sholes only talked over with his associates the idea of making a typewriter in 1868. They had not gone beyond making a machine that printed just page numbers. Carlos Glidden suggested to Sholes to make a machine that would also print letters and pointed out Pratt's 1867 typewriter as a possible way to do it. Sholes has been called the father of the typewriter, but Pratt's previous typewriter invention is generally credited as the inspiration for Sholes's machine. However, historian Beverly Crider asserts that since Pratt helped inspire Sholes to develop his typewriting machine in 1868, Pratt should be called the grandfather of the typewriter. Professors Louise Pettus and Ron Chepesiuk of Winthrop College report that it was Pratt's technical ingenuity that made possible the modern typewriter and therefore he should be designated grandfather of the typewriter. Both Encyclopedia Britannica and Scientific American give Pratt the credit for being the inventor of the typewriter and producing the first ones. National Cyclopedia says that if Sholes is called the 'father of the typewriter' then Pratt should be given the title of 'grandfather of the typewriter'.  Personal life  In 1852, at the age of 21, Pratt married Julia Porter, the 21-year-old daughter of Judge Benjamin F. Porter of Alabama. They had two daughters, Stella and Juliet. Pratt moved from Brooklyn to Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1902. He died of acute indigestion and a weak heart at the age of 74 on June 24, 1905. He is buried at Pratt Cemetery in the Pine Knoll family plot that is located near Centre, Alabama. His wife was previously buried at the family plot in 1897. Both their daughters are also buried there.  Legacy Pratt's typewriters can be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum of London and in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. A Pratt Memorial Scholarship Fund was created by the Alabama State Federation of Business and Professional Women's Club in 1922. A memorial marker for Pratt was erected at his birth city in Union County, South Carolina, in 1913. A letter typed at London in 1867 on one of Pratt's English typewriters is held in the office of the United States Commissioner of Patents. Letters from Pratt to his American family written while he was still living in England in 1867, talking about his typewriter's success there, and other personal letters and samples of Pratt's typewriter history memorabilia are held by the Alabama Department of Archives and History.

Description This species has an average shell height of ca. 1.5 mm and an average shell width of ca. 1.2 mm. It is larger, wider and less elongated compared to other Zospeum species. The shell is transparent, when fresh, and chalky white with age. It has a turbinate-conical shape with approximately 5 1/2 regularly coiled, convex, rounded whorls. The last whorl is large, tumid and encompasses ca. 2/3 of the shell height. The opening (aperture) of the shell is crescent-shaped. Zospesum zaldivarae seems to be polymorphic regarding the presence/absence of the apertural barriers. Some individuals show an apertural dentition, some not. The apertural dentition (if any) consists of a small, short lamella on the parietal wall and a tooth on the parietal-columellar corner of the peristome. The columellar and palatal- basal lip are narrowly reflected. The umbilicus is closed, and the umbilical depression is deep. The teleoconch possess irregular axial striae or blunt growth lines, which are often crossed by a spiral element. In a small area immediately behind the palatal-basal lip some axial ribbing were observed. The peristome is higher than wide, taking up about half of the shell height. It is closely adhering to the spire and has an angular shape with a straight palatal-columellar callus. Discovery Zospeum zaldivarae was discovered in the Cueva de Las Pa√∫les in the Sierra Salvada in the Province Burgos in Northern Spain by the biologist and speleologist Pilar Zald√≠var in the 1980s. Taxonomy Zospeum zaldivarae is named after Pilar Zald√≠var, who is part of the Niphargus Speleoloical Team and discovered the species. Distribution This species is only known from the type locality, Cueva de Las Pa√∫les in the Sierra Salvada in the Province Burgos in Northern Spain. Ecology Zospeum zaldivarae was identified on moist, muddy walls in a karst cave at an altitude of ca. 840 m. They were found embedded in a muddy sediment matrix, interspersed with a yellow- and white-coloured fungal aggregation. Conservation Currently, Zospeum zaldivarae is known to inhabit only one locality. This locality is relatively easily accessible to the public and thereby threatened. Due to the limitation of the species to one locality and according to the Guidelines of the IUCN Red List, it is a vulnerable, narrow range endemic.

Definition The term was introduced in 2015 by Curtis Marean as \\"extremely cooperative behavior with unrelated individuals, often for the benefit of others or society without expectation of payoff\\".Marean, Curtis W. \\"An evolutionary anthropological perspective on modern human origins.\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 44 (2015): P.541 Although originating from an evolutionary anthropological perspective, hyperprosociality has been utilized in modern pedagogy and psychology.  Perspectives  Archeological and anthropological perspective = The high level of cooperation utilized by modern Homo sapiens is unique to our species.Bowles & Gintis 2011, Fehr & fischbacher 2013, Fehr & G√§chter 2002, Henrich 2004, Henrich et all. 2001 It has been argued that this must have evolutionary origins. Explanations for our level of hyperprosociality vary, from food and hunting Hill K. 2002. Altruistic cooperation during foraging by the Ache, and the evolved human predisposition to cooperate. Hum. Nat. 13:105‚Äì28to cooperative breeding. To keep a gene pool diverse, interchanges between human tribes must have taken place, requiring stronger relationships. Similarly, warfare had the potential to unite some groups and create far-reaching social bonds that connected tribes. Apart from uniting to be able to stand stronger against other enemies, strategies and culture were shared as well. ‚Äòwillingness to take mortal risks as a fighter is not the only form of altruism that contributes to prevailing in intergroup contests; more altruistic and hence more cooperative groups may be more productive and sustain healthier, stronger, or more numerous members, for example, or make more effective use of information.‚ÄôBowles, Samuel. \\"Did warfare among ancestral hunter-gatherers affect the evolution of human social behaviors?.\\" Science 324.5932 (2009): 1293-1298. It remains unclear whether one of the mentioned origins is the driving one. It is clear, however, that extreme social behaviors are from other kinds of different cultures. Hyperprosociality does not make groups interwoven to a set extend. It can come in many degrees, depending on the setting. The only clear distinction that can be made is the difference between basic sociality and far-reaching hyperprosociality, sometimes altruistic behavior. At the most basic level of sociality, we take care of our sick, injured, old, and share food. However, these tight family groups are unable to function solely on their own. It was necessary to form more complex social relationships, also known as ethnolinguistic groups, which function to organize outgroup marriages, warfare, trade, etc. Ultimately these higher hyperprosocial relationships provide greater security.Marean, Curtis W. \\"An evolutionary anthropological perspective on modern human origins.\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 44 (2015): P. 546 = Pedagogical perspective = The idea of hyperprosociality has also been mentioned in the scientific domain of pedagogy. Namely, Atkinson and Shvidkos argue that learning a second language is more than ‚Äòobservation, imitation, and trial-and-error alone‚ÄôAtkinson, Dwight, and Elena Shvidko. \\"Natural Pedagogy in Second Language Learning and Teaching.\\" TESOL Quarterly 53.4 (2019): 1083-1114.. Thus, this cannot merely be done in a classroom. The complexity in cultural-language is also found in its physical movements, mimics, and gestures. Even though Spanish, for example, is spoken in many different countries, different cultures carry different movements that enhance communication. These gestures often reach further than languages and form connections between tribes. Learning to understand each other was a mutual conversation and a dynamic teaching-learning experience forgotten in our modern-day classrooms. = Psychological perspective = The term hyperprosociality does not occur often in the field of psychology, but it is still of great importance. The foundational work by Roy F. BaumeisterBaumeister, Roy F. The cultural animal: Human nature, meaning, and social life. Oxford University Press, 2005. gives an overview of the different reasons why humans have developed a complex culture and communication. Psychologists are divided; some accept that culture and brain development are evolutionary by-products while others point at our human nature. If one sees humans as brutal by nature, society is a corruption created by the need. If one sees human nature based in fear due to the consciousness of our mortality, culture has the function to distract us and gives us a sense of security.Becker E. (1973) the denial of death. New York free press Psychologists see culture as the basis of hypersocial behavior; we help others because we can connect through culture. However, Anthropologists see culture as a factor of influence to the extent of hyper-social behavior. Culture is a by-effect of the willingness of humans to help others.

Forming as the twenty-seventh named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season, Toraji developed as a tropical depression to the southeast of Vietnam on November 16. Quickly organising, the system strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. Toraji rapidly weakened thereafter early on November 18, when the storm made landfall over southeastern Vietnam, later dissipating. The storm's remnants moved into the Gulf of Thailand when Toraji re-organised back into a tropical depression on November 20. However Toraji quickly deteriorated on the same day as it moved closer to the Malay Peninsula. Despite being a weak storm, Toraji brought heavy rainfall which lead to flash flooding and landslides, mostly in the southern provinces of Vietnam. This resulted in a total of 32 people dead, with the majority of them being in the Khanh Hoa province. Damages were toppled up to ‚Ç´1.24 billion (US$53.9 million). Meteorological history On November 15, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring on a tropical disturbance that had developed about 835 km (519 mi) to the east of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.https://www.webcitation.org/73yeicR0v After being located in an area of favourable environments with very low vertical wind shear, the tropical disturbance gradually intensified, which prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start classifying it as a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA).http://www.webcitation.org/73zeuJZN4 By November 17, under the influence of high sea-surface temperatures and good upper-level outflow, the JMA immediately initiated advisories and upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Toraji. On 15:00 UTC of the same day, satellite imagery had depicted a large cluster of deep convection persisting near the system's low- level circulation center. This prompted the JTWC to begin issuing advisories as a tropical depression, with the designation of 32W. Six hours after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the deep convection located near the storm's center became displaced and sheared. At this point, the JTWC no longer expects Toraji to intensify into a tropical storm, and hence, Toraji reached its 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) with a barometric pressure of 1004 mbar (29.65 inHg). At around 00:00 UTC of November 18, Toraji made landfall over the southeastern coast of Vietnam, about 28 km (17 mi) south of Cam Ranh Bay. Six hours later, Toraji began to weaken and the JMA downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. The JTWC followed suit three hours later when the system's center became elongated and the deep convection became disorganised. However, the JMA tracked Toraji until 12:00 UTC of the same day as it moved further over land. The remnants of Toraji meandered over the southern portion of Vietnam for a couple of days until it turned toward the southwest and entering the Gulf of Thailand. By 09:00 UTC of November 20, satellite imagery showed a new burst of convection along convective banding wrapping into the system's center. This prompted the JTWC to re-issue advisories on Toraji. However, Toraji's convective signature did not last long within the JTWC's next advisory. Therefore, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Toraji on 21:00 UTC of the same day, while making landfall in the Malay Peninsula. Preparations and impact Toraji is the eighth tropical system to affect Vietnam in 2018, hence the local designation of C∆°n b√£o s·ªë 8. Local authorities are preparing to evacuate vulnerable residents to safety. Fishing boats and ships were banned on setting sail in nearby areas of the Can Gio District. The National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting forecast that provinces over in the southern portion of Vietnam would experience rainfall of about 70‚Äì150 mm (2.8‚Äì5.9 in), along with heavy and scattered thunderstorms from November 17 through to 19. Any areas near rivers in the south and central regions were expected to have a higher-risk of flooding, with Binh Dinh and Phu Yen under Disaster Alert Level 1, while the rivers in Khanh Hoa and Binh Thuan were under Disaster Alert Level 2. Risks of landslides were more greater‚Äìwith mountainous, low-lying and even urban communities in the central regions getting the risk. After the passage of the storm, Vietnam's southern provinces experienced vast areas of flash flooding. In the province of Khanh Hoa, a two-day rainfall from November 17‚Äì18 were measured to up to 200 mm (7.9 in). The city of Nha Trang experienced a rain total of 380 mm (15 in). Low-lying communities saw houses being submerged by more than one meter. To ensure the safety of the students from the damages, schools were closed on November 19, where an estimated total of 90,000 students were forced to stay at home. Villages over mountainous areas experiences landslides that buried homes. The main highway that linked Northern and Southern Vietnam was temporarily blocked along with interruptions of rail service due to heavy debris, where 400 train passengers have remained stranded. At least 17 people have perished from the storm in Nha Trang alone. The city's chairman criticised the local authorities for \\"late responses\\" to the damages caused, and the areas where landslides have killed people weren't included in the list of landslide-prone areas given to city authorities. A report a few months after the storm stated that a total of 20 people have died, with total damages measured at ‚Ç´1.24 billion (US$53.9 million).
