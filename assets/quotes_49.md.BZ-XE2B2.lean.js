History  TWRF grew out of the Taiwanese non-profit women's organization, the Awakening Foundation. In 1988, with the help of lawyers, scholars and social workers, it was established as Taipei Women‚Äôs Rescue Foundation, an anti-human trafficking mission to fight on the behalf of girls forced into prostitution. Through protest activities and public awareness campaigns, TWRF sensitized the Taiwanese public and led a \\"social movement for justice for the disenfranchised in Taiwan\\". Since 1992 the foundation has worked on the issue, women and girls who served as sex slaves to Japanese soldiers during World War II. TWRF has provided legal counsel and psychological support for these aging victims and has championed their cause by petitioning governments and courts both in Taiwan and in Japan. Comfort women Immediately after the first Korean comfort women spoke out publicly for the first time in 1992, TWRF organized a hotline for former sex slaves from Taiwan to call and make themselves known, as well as investigative teams and research projects, thus spearheading a movement highlighting the plight of the former sex slaves and seeking justice and compensation for them. The foundation coordinated in establishment of \\"Taiwan comfort women ad hoc committee\\" at the ministry level and formed an alliance with other countries to urge the Japanese government to issue a formal apology and to provide compensation to the victims. The main activities of TWRF regarding the issue are to: * help build societal awareness of comfort women * provide social and emotional support for the victims in e.g. helping them to apply for government subsidies * provide social and legal services and therapy * help victims to take legal actions against Japanese government * push to have the issue included in school textbooks. TWRF established an online memorial museum about the subject, created exhibitions and publication and in 2014, produced a related documentary; its English title is Song of the Reed.

She was a noted member of the London art scene during the time and her life is commemorated in an eponymous award for innovating printmaking. Early life and studies Ski√∂ld was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1923. She studied furniture design at the Tekniska Skolan (now Konstfack - University College of Arts, Crafts and Design) in Stockholm and moved to London in 1948. Here she studied at the Anglo-French Art Centre, making connections with artists Francis Bacon, Eduardo Paolozzi and curator/writer David Sylvester. She was inspired to try printmaking following a lithographic exhibition featuring Max Ernst and Oskar Kokoschka. She studied this with Henry Trivick and etching (with Richard Beer) at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster). She completed her studies in Paris at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in 1954. The Print Workshop On returning from Paris, Ski√∂ld set up a print making workshop in George Street Marylebone with a lithographic press and stones acquired from Vanessa Bell and previously used by Edward Ardizzone. Feeling the need to expand and collaborate, Ski√∂ld set up the Print Workshop in the basement of Adrian and Corinne Heath's house in Charlotte Street, Fitzrovia. The workshop's ethos was inspired by Stanley William Hayter‚Äôs Atelier 17 in Paris and partly by Myfanwy Piper's comments on BBC Radio that London needed \\"an atelier where artists and professional engravers can inspire each other.‚Äù. The setup process began in 1956 and the presses were transferred to Charlotte Street in May 1958. Artists sought out the Print Workshop to use the facilities, share knowledge and learn from Ski√∂ld. These included Michael Ayrton, Fionnuala Boyd, Kathan Brown, Jim Dine, David Hockney, Allen Jones, Eduardo Paolozzi, Tom Phillips, Dieter Roth, Michael Rothenstein, William Tillyer, Joe Tilson and William G. Tucker. It was unusual for a woman to be running such a prominent establishment at this time but Ski√∂ld's personality and connections led to a space she described as: ‚ÄúNot a business, not a college, not a gallery, simply an idea which has worked.‚Äù, her husband Peter Bird, director of Bradford City Art Galleries and Museums described it as having \\"a lively and industrious atmosphere, when it was at its best, and a little chaotic on a bad day.\\" Students at The Royal College of Art, Central School of Art and Chelsea School of Art, amongst others, benefitted from her printmaking lectures, and she taught workshops in universities in the US, Sweden and Japan. Robert Erskine, who ran the St George‚Äôs Gallery at 7 Cork Street, and who was to be influential in encouraging Stanley Jones to set up the Curwen Press, another operation with Fitzrovia connections through the Curwen Gallery in Windmill Street, was a generous supporter of Ski√∂ld‚Äôs vision. They were to organise several exhibitions of Print Workshop artists together over the coming years. Work Ski√∂ld was a pioneer in championing the status of printmaking as art, and experimenting with techniques including embossing, mixed media, Xerox printing and collage. She was also an early exponent of the livre d‚Äôartiste, working on occasion with texts by other famous Fitzrovia residents, past and present. Her first artist‚Äôs book incorporated texts by the pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who was born at No.38 Charlotte Street and later lived at No.50, and at 37 Fitzroy Square. A shared love of Japan led her to produce three bookworks with poet and travel writer James Kirkup. The first, Scenes from Sesshu was published in 1977, the same year that the charge of blasphemous libel was resurrected and used for the first time in 50 years to prosecute Gay News for publishing the Kirkup poem, The love that dares to speak its name. Kirkup was a well known fixture in the pubs and clubs of Fitzrovia, and was renting a room above a shoe shop at 77A Tottenham Court Road from 1948. Her papers are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Selected works Kargman appears as a satirical version of herself in a Bravo scripted comedy television show called Odd Mom Out. The show is written by her and based on her novel Momzillas (Dutton, 2007). The show is based on Kargman's life and portrays the outrageous lifestyles of extremely wealthy mothers who live in the Upper East Side. Time Magazine named Odd Mom Out one of \\"2015's Top 10 TV Shows\\" stating, \\"It's the smartest piece of anthropology on cable - and something to make TV fans grateful that something so specific and deeply thought-through can exist in the shallow end of cable's pool.\\"http://time.com/4130167/top-10-tv-shows-2/ In the book Kargman describes \\"momzillas\\" as mothers who are \\"negligent, domineering, competitive, preachy, and sad\\". Kirkus Reviews described Momzillas as \\"a decent effort that debunks the myth of the perfect mommy\\". The Ex-Mrs. Hedgefund was published in April 2009. Kirkus Reviews described the book as \\"funny, but in the current economic context ill-timed\\" due to its 2009 publication during the Great Recession.

The film follows Jack Clyde, a young man who lives a vain and idle life in the city with his rich friends. His wealthy uncle decides to test the morale character and has his lawyers announce his death and giving his fortune to charity. When Jack learns of his death, he is left penniless and is shunned by his friends, but assisted by the poor. Jack struggles to survive, but decides to host a Thanksgiving dinner for those poorer than himself. His uncle sees Jack has learned his lesson and secretly prepares a feast set while Jack sleeps. After the guest arrives, the uncle reveals himself and all ends well. The film was released on November 22, 1910, and was met with favorable reviews. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 26, 1910. It states: \\"Jack Clyde is a rich young fellow who has been brought up by his wealthy uncle in a small Western town. Jack decides that he wants to move to New York and is indulged in this whim by his uncle, who sends with the lad as valet a faithful old servant, who has his welfare at heart. In the city Jack rents expensive apartments, and leads a vain, idle life. Jack's uncle hears of his conduct and devises a scheme whereby he can make a thorough test of the boy. He instructs his lawyers to announce his death, that the entire fortune has gone to charity, and Jack has been left penniless. Jack is turned out of his rooms and shunned by his rich friends. Among the very poor, whom he formerly despised, he is treated as a comrade. They share with him their last crust, and he ends by marrying them, and falling in love with a humble little flower girl. Jack finally secures a situation as a porter in a hotel. His uncle discovers that he is planning to give a Thanksgiving dinner to all those poorer than himself and decides that Jack has learned his lesson. Jack brings to his poor room a few meager provisions that his week's salary has permitted him to buy. While waiting for his guests to arrive Jack goes to sleep. His uncle and the old servant who have been watching him closely, seize upon this opportunity to enter Jack's room and substitute for his poor meal a real Thanksgiving feast. The guests arrive, their host awakes, uncle returns, and Jack is assured that his prosperity is real and not a dream.\\"  Cast  *Marie Eline likely as the newspaper boy. *Frances Gibson is claimed to be the flower girl, but this is disputed. *William Russell  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Marie Eline was cast in the film, likely as the newspaper boy. Eline had previously played a newspaper boy in Not Guilty. The role of the flower girl has been claimed to be Frances Gibson by an answer column in Motion Picture Story Magazine. This is disputable because Gibson is known only to have a single credit with the Thanhouser Company, in the 1912 release of Nicholas Nickleby. Around this time Gibson was appearing in Solax Studios productions. Both immediate before and after her only Thanhouser credit, Gibson was employed by Solax, leading Bowers to speculate that her appearance in that one film may have been as a special project. A different film still shows William Russell and opens the possibility of identifying the other actors. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 22, 1910. The drama film was sometimes labeled as a comedy by advertisers. The film had a wide national release and was shown in theaters in North Carolina, South Dakota, Washington, Kansas, Pennsylvania, California,. Though Hawaii was not yet a state, it was also shown as a new release in July 1912. The film was positively reviewed by critics. Walton of The Moving Picture News affirmed, stating that the film was a \\"...well-staged, naturally acted story with a lesson. There is pathos and stern reality mixed in with fidelity and anxiety, the whole making a story of entrancing and edifying power.\\" The Moving Picture World summarized the film and remarked, \\"The contrasts in the delineation of human nature constitute the principal points of interest, and they are worked out with full appreciation of dramatic varieties. The implied false friends have a good many counterparts, and the way they are depicted here is too graphic to be misunderstood.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror took a swipe at Bison Pictures of the New York Motion Picture Company and the Powers Picture Plays by praising the camera posing of the film and acknowledging the acting of the flower girl to be well-portrayed.

The story is about a thief known as \\"Wolaiye\\" (ÊàëÊù•‰πü; literally \\"Here I Come\\") who stole from many wealthy households in the capital during the Southern Song dynasty. In this series, \\"Wolaiye\\" is the alter ego of a constable, who teams up a magistrate to fight injustice in the county. Both of them also become love rivals because they both fall in love with a lady boss of a restaurant. The series was produced by MediaCorp and starred Li Nanxing, Bobby Au-yeung and Fann Wong in the lead roles. It was first aired on MediaCorp Channel 8 in Singapore in 2001. Plot The main character in the series is a masked thief called \\"Wolaiye\\" (literally \\"Here I Come\\") who steals from corrupt officials in a city, Zhencheng, to help the poor. The citizens regard him as their hero. Wolaiye is actually the alter ego of Song Dou, a constable who works in Zhencheng's administrative office. Song Dou aspires to serve his country but feels disappointed when he sees that the government is dominated by corrupt officials, so he decided to become a vigilante while pretending to be a constable at the same time. Feng Pobu is an official famous for his literary talent and unyielding personality. The Chancellor, who dislikes him, slanders him in front of the Emperor and causes him to be demoted and sent out of the capital to serve as an adviser to the magistrate of Zhencheng. When Feng Pobu discovers that the magistrate has been stealing national treasures and selling them to foreigners, he teams up with Song Dou and Prince Kang to stop the magistrate and expose his misdeeds. The magistrate is sacked and Feng Pobu replaces him as the new magistrate of Zhencheng. Feng Pobu continues to work together with Song Dou to bring peace to the citizens in Zhencheng. Song Dou and Feng Pobu gradually develop a love rivalry because they fall in love with the same woman: Liu Feiyan, the lady boss of a famous restaurant. Feng Pobu is attracted to her fiery personality and wants to marry her. However, she already has a crush on Wolaiye. Song Dou also has romantic feelings for Liu Feiyan, but is hesitant to reveal his identity as Wolaiye to her. The evil Chancellor is aware that the Emperor, who is childless, has the intention of abdicating the throne to his brother Prince Kang. He comes up with a scheme to turn the Emperor and Prince Kang against each other in the hope that they will destroy each other so that he can become the next emperor. At the same time, he also discovers that Song Dou's foster son, Doudou, is actually the Emperor's son because the Emperor had a secret affair with a commoner. He then sends his henchmen to kill Doudou. The Emperor falls for the Chancellor's ruse, mistakenly believes that Prince Kang is plotting against him, and orders his brother's execution. On the execution day, Song Dou, Feng Pobu, Liu Feiyan and their friends show up and manage to convince the Emperor that Prince Kang is innocent. They also bring along Doudou, who has survived the attack by the Chancellor's henchmen. The Emperor realises his folly so he removes the Chancellor from office, pardons Prince Kang and passes the throne to him. The newly enthroned Prince Kang intends to reward Song Dou and Feng Pobu by granting them titles and honours, but they reject his offers because they are only interested in winning Liu Feiyan's hand-in-marriage. The story ends with Liu Feiyan undecided on whether she should marry Song Dou or Feng Pobu while the two men debate on who can bring happiness to her.

Early career  Born in the United Kingdom in 1943, Kendall completed his undergraduate medical training at University College Hospital Medical School in 1968 before spending a year as Senior House Officer at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. In 1972 he moved to Toronto, working in general practice at the Hassle Free Clinic. Over the next two decades, Kendall moved back and forth between the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. He moved to Vancouver in 1974 to work for the Vancouver Health Department's Pine Free Clinic and East Health Unit while acquiring a master's degree in Health Care Planning and Epidemiology and a Fellowship in Community Medicine. He then returned to Ontario in 1984 to work as a manager with the Ontario Ministry of Health until 1987, when he returned to British Columbia as Medical Officer of Health for the Capital Regional District, in which capacity he opened one of Canada's first needle exchange programs. In 1989 he started a six-year career as Medical Officer of Health for the City of Toronto government where he pioneered programs for HIV/AIDS and drug abuse prevention, established Harm Reduction as the official City policy for substance abuse, and city tobacco control by-laws.

Shuvinai Ashoona. Retrieved 8 March 2015 She is known for her detailed pen and pencil drawings depicting northern landscapes and contemporary Inuit life. Biography Ashoona was born in 1961 in Cape Dorset (Kinngait), Nunavut to a family of celebrated artists. Her father Kiugak Ashoona was a sculptor, her mother Sorosilooto Ashoona was a graphic-artist and her grandmother Pitseolak Ashoona was one of the most acclaimed Inuit artists of her generation. She is also related to artists Napachie Pootoogook, her aunt, and Annie Pootoogook, her cousin, with whom she was selected to participate in Oh, Canada a showcase of contemporary Canadian artists curated by Denise Markonish and held at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in May 2012. Ashoona attended high school in Iqaluit, but soon returned to the Cape Dorset region with her daughter, living with her family at outposts like Luna Bay and Kangiqsualujjuaq. This experience informs her detailed, animate drawings of Inuit Nunangat. The Ashoona family returned to town in the late 1980s, which is when Shuvinai began visiting Kinngait Studios. There her style was influenced by her aunts and fellow studio members Napachie Pootoogook and Mayoreak Ashoona, as well as Kenojuak Ashevak. Artistic career Shoveling Worlds acquired by the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2013 Ashoona's drawings are sometimes rooted in nature, but other times drawn from imagination, creating a claustrophobic, dense effect. Recurring images include the egg shape; the kudlik, a stone oil lamp; and the ulu; historical images or events occasionally appear, like the Nascopie, a supply ship which brought goods and people to Cape Dorset until its sinking in 1947.Time Interrupted exhibition catalogue, 4‚Äì25 November 2006. Toronto: Feheley Fine Arts, 2006. Setting Ashoona's work apart from the Inuit artists before her is a reflection of the blending of modern and traditional life in Nunavut. Her first drawings in the Kinngait Studios archives ‚Äî the internationally renowned printmaking studio founded by the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative in 1959 ‚Äî date from around 1993. Her early works were small, detailed, monochromatic landscape drawings, often depicting rocky, sparsely populated terrains from aerial perspectives. Ashoona's monochromes are densely rendered, stunningly intricate compositions in ink and black fineliner. These landscapes were partly realistic in depicting detailed topography around Cape Dorset (Kinngait) and partly fantasy, for example, elements such as stairs that emerge as land formations yet lead nowhere. In sharp contrast to the work of other Cape Dorset artists, these landscape views were largely devoid of human activity and were also unusual in their introspective quality, seemingly to mirror an interior world while illustrating an exterior one.Christine Lalonde, Acquisition Proposal for Shuvinai Ashoona's Untitled (Eden), accession #42917, Curatorial File, National Gallery of Canada. Because of her painstaking drawing process, it took several years to develop a body of work substantial enough for exhibition. Although two small etchings were included in the 1997 annual Cape Dorset print collection, her first major exhibition was Three Women, Three Generations: Drawings by Pitseolak Ashoona, Napatchie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. One of six works from this period acquired by the National Gallery of Canada, Rock Landscape was also featured in the CBC radio series All in a Day (One Treasure at a Time) in 2003. She began using colour in her drawings in the early 2000s, portraying human figures, their shelters, and tools within graphic, imposing topographies, like in the work Composition (Sewage Truck) (2007-8) in the Samuel and Esther Sarick Collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. Throughout her career the internal cosmology of her works has become more pronounced, with eggs, card suits, globes, and snatches of text surfacing over and over. Her collaborative work (with John Noestheden), Earth and Sky is a gigantic banner that debuted at Art Basel in 2009 in an installation complex called Stadthimmel (\\"Citysky\\"). It was also exhibited at the 2012 Biennale of Sydney \\"All Our Relations,\\" and at the Justina M. Barnicke Gallery at the University of Toronto, paired with the Toronto-based artist Shary Boyle. Boyle and Ashoona went on to collaborate on the 2015 travelling exhibition Universal Cobra, building collaborative fantasy worlds, sharing space on the paper. In roughly 2009 Ashoona began working with a motif of worlds, drawing human, animal, and hybrid figures interacting with blue and green planets within fantastical settings, as exhibited in Shuvinai's World(s) at Feheley Fine Arts in Toronto, September 2012.Milroy, Sarah. \\"Inuit Feminism Goes Global.\\" The Globe and Mail. 8 September 2012.

Career Silver's singing career began in 1965, when she was thirteen and recorded an a cappella version of Brian Hyland‚Äôs \\"Sealed With A Kiss\\" at a DIY singing booth in Woolworths in Oxford Street London. The song attracted the attention of Pye Records, who signed her for a two-record deal. For her first single Silver released \\"Lost Summer Love\\", a song previously sung by Shelley Fabares. The single was produced by Tony Reeves and arranged by Johnny Harris and featured Klaus Voorman on bass guitar. Another Shelley Fabares cover, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôll be there‚Äù, was recorded for the B-side. Her second single was an original song ‚Äùthe Happy Faces‚Äù with a cover version of The Supremes ‚ÄúWhen the Love Light Starts Shining Thru His Eyes‚Äù on the B-side. Neither single sold well and Silver's contract was not renewed. Although the original recordings did not chart, Silver's version of \\"Lost Summer Love\\" would later go on to become massively popular within the Northern Soul movement at the Wigan Casino in the 1970s. The single was reissued on the Casino Classics label, selling in excess of 30,000 copies. Silver, however, remained largely unaware of the song's popularity and her fame within the Northern Soul scene until 1988. All four original recordings have been released on numerous Northern Soul compilation CDs and she also was featured in the best-selling biography of Dusty Springfield written by Lucy O'Brien entitled ‚ÄòDusty‚Äô.O'Brien, Lucy (1989) Dusty, p.48.

It was founded in 2009 by Chaya Soggot and Or Ben Naftali, entrepreneurs in the field of Digital Marketing and Advertising. Through its three divisions of operation: Apps & Games, Video Advertising and Media Solutions, Woobi's offering spans across programmatic video advertising (SSP & RTB), branded video distribution, app monetization, user acquisition and media management. The company's technology platforms are based on advanced algorithms integrated into free-to-play based games, enabling to monetize non-paying users through value-exchange advertising, integrated into gameplay. History Woobi was founded in 2009 under the name \\"TokenAds\\". Its first product was a monetization solution for Facebook Apps, through an ‚Äúoffer-wall‚Äù. The company HQ is located in Tel Aviv. Early in 2014 Woobi opened its UK office based in London, and in 2016 in NYC. Since its incorporation, the company had focused on IGA (In Game Advertising), rather than a wider social/entertainment application, and has released several technological advancements developed in- house over the years, aimed at monetizing non-paying players without compromising their gaming experience through targeted value-exchange in-game ads: In 2009 TokenAds launched both the \\"Glocalization\\" concept, enabling local brands to advertise to local audiences, on a global basis, as well as real-time Optimization technologies based on Game Traits. In 2011 TokenAds introduced in-play ad formats, integrated into gameplay (rather than into the game's payment section as was commonly used by game developers and publishers at the time). In 2012 the company launched its cross-game tracking technology, aimed at improving user targeting capabilities, leading to its investment in developing wider user profiling technologies, and the release of its cross- data user profiling based platform in 2013. In 2014 the company submitted a patent for its Dynamic Mindset Advertising technology, which is based on an algorithm integrated into free-to-play game loops and the user's gameplay, and which, unlike standard digital media monetization, which is statically displayed in pre-determined media slots, the DMA based monetization aims to identify the exact moment a user is in a receptive mindset to engaging with a brand before displaying the ad. Tuesday, January 28, 2020 In September 2014, TokenAds rebranded as \\"Woobi\\" With the development of programmatic advertising, and its shift towards branded video ads, in 2016 Woobi launched its own in-game SSP (Supply Side Platform), and the RTB (Real-Time Bidding) Exchange. The company also leveraged its buyer-side platform to serve as an easy programmatic gateway for brand advertisers into the world of gaming. In January 2017, Woobi won the Digiday Video Awards for \\"Best Video Distribution Platform\\", and was nominated for the Digiday Europe Awards for \\"Best Video Adtech Innovation\\" In April 2017, Woobi was nominated for the Drum Digital Trading Awards for Best Overall Technology for Programmatic Trading, and won the White Bull Awards2017 Bully Awards for the 2nd year in a row.

It is a sister-genre to the chiptune-influenced rock subgenre nintendocore and related to other branches of nerd music such as hip hop's nerdcore and contemporary folk's nerd-folk. Geek rock is characterised by the standard instruments of rock music often combined with electronic and unusual instruments; references to geek culture and specialised, yet often mundane, interests; and an element of humour. Specific subgenres of geek rock range from those related to elements of geek culture, such as the Harry Potter-based wizard rock, and those related to elements of rock music, such as the punk rock variant called nerd punk. Characteristics Geek rock is characterised by strong use of both electronic instruments and more atypical musical instruments, such as accordions or ukuleles. Lyrically, the genre is generally characterised by subject matter that covers topics such as geek media pop culture (including science fiction, comic books and video games), academia, technology and related topics. Kyle Stevens of Kirby Krackle expands this to include any passionate interest, saying in a 2013 interview: \\"To us now, what we consider or genre of 'nerd' or 'geek' rock means anything we are really passionate about, whether that be traditionally geeky subject matter or a song about how we‚Äôre really into tacos. In essence, they‚Äôre love songs directed to whatever we‚Äôre really passionate about.\\" Irony, self-deprecation and humour are major elements. While mainstream rock music tends to be aspirational, representing things the average male audience member wants or wants to be, geek rock celebrates the mundane, common things that its audience members would find familiar. History The Doubleclicks ‚Äì Aubrey Turner and Laser Malena-Webber ‚Äì performing onstage at JoCo Cruise Crazy 3 The first band to describe themselves as \\"geek rock\\" is believed to be Nerf Herder. The success of They Might Be Giants' 1990 album Flood may have begun making geek culture and geek rock more mainstream. Billboard has referred to They Might Be Giants as \\"Nerd- Rock Kings\\". Similarly, Weird Al Yankovic has been called the king of nerd rock. The label \\"proto-geek rock\\" covers both similar musicians performing before the term was established and those that were adopted by geek culture but were not strictly part of it themselves. Alex DiBlasi contends that Frank Zappa is the archetypical geek rocker and antecedent of geek rock. Earlier filk music was based around fans performing at science fiction conventions. Geek rock, however, is not necessarily connected to conventions in the same way and, while often still connected to fandom, is more adjacent to the fan community than an out-growth of it. Geek rock musicians are professional rather than amateur and band members need not be fans themselves. For example, Chicago Doctor Who-based band Time Crash was started by Doctor Who fan Ronen Kohn but the band's drummer, Andy Rice, had not seen the TV series until some time after the band started. This was made possible by equipment becoming more affordable and the growth of the internet. The term \\"nerd rock\\" was previously used as the title of a 1977 sketch on the American sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, named by writer Anne Beatts after Elvis Costello appeared as the musical guest star. She is on record as thinking, while watching his performance, \\"this isn't punk rock; this is nerd rock.\\" The sketch was the first in their \\"The Nerds\\" series following the same \\"nerd\\" characters. Geek rock, and related genres, have grown large enough to support music festivals such as Rock Comic Con. Derivative forms Some subgenres and derivative forms of geek rock are focused around specific parts of geek culture and fandoms. Others are based on subgenres of rock music. =Nerd punk= Nerd punk is a fusion of nerd music and punk rock. It shares the characteristics of geek rock with the fast-paced songs, hard-edged melodies and singing styles of punk. Bands include Thundering Asteroids! =Twi-rock= Twi-rock (or twirock) developed from Twilight fandom with bands such as the Bella Cullen Project. While initially successful, and entering into a rivalry with wizard rock, the twi-rock genre turned out to be short lived. =Time Lord rock= Time Lord rock (or trock) was developed by British band Chameleon Circuit in 2008. It was directly inspired by the existence of wizard rock. Time Lord rock was initially dominated by British and Australian bands but the genre has spread to the United States with groups such as Time Crash, Legs Nose Robinson and singer Allegra Rosenberg. =Wizard rock= Wizard rock (or wrock) developed from Harry Potter fandom in the United States with Harry and the Potters in the early 2000s. The subgenre has since expanded internationally with hundreds of bands and established its own music festival, called Wrockstock.

The player advances through eleven different rooms by interacting with each level's environmental objects. It was developed by Patrick Smith, an artist who taught himself to animate and program the game in Adobe Flash. He was inspired by a variety of painters and artists. The game was first released for Windows, OS X, and web browsers in 2009, and was later ported to the iPad (running iOS) in 2011, with several added features. The game received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers noted the game's especially short duration, memorability, art style, and emphasis on exploration over problem solving. Windosill has influenced games such as Alto's Adventure, Blek, Donut County, and Monument Valley.  Gameplay  In Windosill, the player solves logic puzzles to progress through eleven successive rooms. Everything on-screen is interactive. The player experiments with the environmental objects in each room to find a hidden cube, which unlocks the door to the next level, through which the player guides a toy car. Responsive objects in each room include light switches, piles of leaves, clocks, \\"a squishy thing with an eye on top\\", a building that grows legs when spun, a box that grows hair when touched, and a smokestack that can be squeezed to make clouds. Interactions with these objects reveal subsequent objects and possible interactions.  Development  Patrick Smith, a Brooklyn-based artist, drew, animated, and programmed Windosill by himself for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, web browser, and iPad (iOS) platforms. His collection of interactive animations and games, which he began around 2001, are released under the name \\"Vectorpark\\". Although Edge previously covered and praised Smith's prior work, they wrote that he \\"is notable for never having made the jump to the mainstream\\". Smith first sketched Windosill level ideas in pencil, and transferred his favorites into Adobe Illustrator, where he added detail, \\"shapes and colors\\". He then animated and programmed the scenes in Adobe Flash, and incorporated sounds from Freesound. While Smith studied painting at Washington University, he learned to animate and program on his own. He developed his own 3D and physics code instead of using existing software libraries, as he prefers to use code he fully understands. When Smith built the game, he considered the \\"aesthetic and functional aspects holistically\\". Smith's main inspirations when creating Windosill were mainly artists and not games: surrealists Ren√© Magritte and Joan Mir√≥, metaphysical painter Giorgio de Chirico, animators Max and Dave Fleischer of Fleischer Studios, cartoonists Chris Ware and Jim Woodring, sculptor Alexander Calder, and Italian Renaissance painters Paolo Uccello and Piero della Francesca. Smith credits the latter painters for his use of flat shapes as 3D forms. Windosill was not designed for a specific audiencein fact, Smith designed them for his own enjoymentbut he noted that its \\"toy-like\\" qualities and emphasis on discovery were intentional. Windosill was originally released in 2009 as a downloadable Flash game for Microsoft Windows and OS X. In this version, the first half of Windosill was free-to-play and its second half could be unlocked with payment. Smith was satisfied with its sales, but said \\"it will take a long time to fund itself\\". An iOS (iPad-only) port was released on December 15, 2011, and added two features: Complex Gravity (which adds \\"tilt controls\\") and See-Thru (which makes the room's elements transparent). It also includes a 20-piece collection of concept art. The game was included in the April 2012, Amanita Design Humble Bundle.  Reception  The game received \\"universal acclaim\\", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers noted the game's especially short duration, memorability, and emphasis on exploration over problem solving. Multiple reviewers praised the game's art style. Nissa Campbell of TouchArcade described the style as \\"surreal\\", and Tim Rattray of Slide to Play wrote that Windosill is \\"serious\\" in its attempt to \\"be 'art. Critics described Windosill as not just a game but \\"a toy\\" in itself. GameSetWatch selected the game for their \\"Best of Indie Games\\" the week of May 2, 2009. Windosill inspired indie mobile games such as the 2013 puzzle game Blek (pictured). Campbell of TouchArcade wrote that the iOS port was \\"always meant to be\\" due to the tactility of the game's puzzles. Campbell added that iOS multitouch changed how players could interact with the puzzles, though it did not change any of the solutions. The reviewer wrote that the controls were intuitive and designed for experimenting, as there is no tutorial. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku similarly wrote that the game helped him remember \\"how wonderfully tactile the iPad can be\\". Rattray of Slide to Play described Windosill as \\"an interactive abstract mosaic\\" and \\"absolute thrill ride\\". He described the puzzle design and production value as \\"brilliant\\", and praised the \\"fitting\\" sound effects, \\"smooth\\" controls, and \\"perfect\\" frame rate. 148Apps Dan Lee also called the puzzles \\"brilliant\\", and described them as \\"so abstract\\" as to require unconventional thinking. Anthony Burch of Destructoid added that the puzzles were designed such that players would not become \\"frustrated or bored\\". Lee and Rattray said there was little reason to return to the game after playing through, apart from a few minutes to experiment with the added iOS features. While Lee considered this a \\"niggle\\", Rattray praised its brevity. Windosill has influenced games including Alto's Adventure, Blek, Donut County, and Monument Valley. Smith later made the 2015 interactive alphabet game Metamorphabet.

She was an art instructor in and around Seattle for three decades as well as a prolific jewelry artist. Biography Ramona Lorraine Solberg was born 10 May 1921, in Watertown, South Dakota, but her family relocated to Seattle, Washington before Solberg's second birthday. She enlisted in the Women‚Äôs Army Corps in 1943 during the Second World War and served until 1950. Using her G.I. Bill benefits, she went to Mexico where she studied jewelry and textile design at the University de Michoacan in Morelia and textiles at the Belias Artes in San Miguel de Allende.Curriculum Vitae, Ramona Solberg She then studied in Oslo, Norway at Statens Kunst og Handverk Skole and worked with jewelry and enameling. Upon returning to the United States, she completed both a Bachelor's of Arts and a Master's of Fine Arts degree at the University of Washington and also studied with Ruth Pennington. From 1951 to 1956 Solberg taught at James Monroe Jr. High School, and then worked until 1967 as an associate professor at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. From that time until her 1983 retirement, Solberg was an art professor at the University of Washington. Solberg is often associated with Pacific Northwest artists and jewelers she taught like Laurie Hall, Ron Ho, Kiff Slemmons, and Nancy Worden. Artwork Though Solberg made some jewelry in her studies, she did not create her first piece of jewelry using beads and found objects until 1956, while at Central Washington State College. Her jewelry was large, rather than typical delicate, precious jewelry. She created her jewelry to be worn and to be worn by large women. In the 1960s, she began traveling. Her first round-the-world trip included visits to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Nepal, picking up beads at every stop. When she returned, she published a book Inventive Jewelry Making in 1972. Solberg and a Seattle group called Friends of the Crafts began making annual travels through Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa and even one trip to Antarctica to both study crafts in other areas and obtain artifacts that could be used in their own works. Solberg was honored as a Fellow of the Council by the American Craft Council for leadership and ability as an artist and/or teacher.American Craft Council College of Fellows Craft historian Vicki Halper curated a 2001-2002 major traveling exhibition, and wrote a comprehensive, illustrated accompanying publication, after conducting an extensive (35 page transcribed) oral history. Solberg was worked on jewelry right up to her death. She died 13 June 2005 in Seattle, Washington.

He is best known for his scores to the television series NCIS, Tour of Duty and Simon & Simon, and to feature films Spiders 3D and Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia. Conlan is also known for integrating electronic music textures with conventional orchestration. He has received several awards and nominations.  Film & Television Scoring  Conlan's earliest notable television credits are Simon & Simon, Tour of Duty, The Equalizer and V: The Final Battle. Recent feature scores include Toolbox Murders and Mortuary (for legendary film director Tobe Hooper), Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia (dir.: Tim Matheson), Spiders 3D (dir.: Tibor Tak√°cs), and for television, the series NCIS. Most recently Conlan wrote the romantic-comedy scores to the feature films Sanctuary for director Len Colin and The Callback Queen for Film Venture London and director Graham Cantwell. Conlan has been nominated for two EMMY awards, one for Mortal Sins (starring Christopher Reeve) and another for Miracle Run (starring Aidan Quinn & Zac Efron). Conlan has also won Best Score at The Underground Cinema Awards (2010) for his score to the short film No Justice (directed by Dublin director Alan Walsh) and won Best Song at the Rome International Film Festival (2004) for the title song \\"Finding Home\\" (lyric by Holly Conlan). Conlan has dual citizenship with the U.S. and Ireland (EU). He is represented by Brice Gaeta at ICM in Los Angeles.  Early Years & Influences  Born in Brooklyn NY, a fortuitous move at the age of five brought Conlan and his family to Los Angeles to set down new roots. At the age of eight, a tortuous, stilted regimen of piano lessons began, but by age eleven a new, younger teacher had opened Conlan's eyes to the more theoretical dimensions of music and the magic of chords. Conlan began to hone his craft as early as high school, writing music for various ensembles and choirs. But it was not until a friend introduced him to Earle Hagen's seminal book, Scoring for Film, that Conlan realized how he should apply his passion. After a few years of writing commercial jingles for Santa Barbara radio stations, Conlan began to work for Hagen on the TV series Eight Is Enough. This introduction to television led him to work with composers Mark Snow on Starsky & Hutch and Hart to Hart and Hoyt Curtin on Hanna-Barbera's Smurfs and Popeye. Conlan's first screen credit soon followed when Barry De Vorzon brought him on to write the score for the new series Simon & Simon. Conlan's musical influences reach from Lennon/McCartney and James Taylor to Claude Debussy and Aaron Copland, to Tom Scott, Radiohead, The Chemical Brothers and Irish folk music. His film scores are just as eclectic, ranging from dark psychological thrillers to romantic comedies, from conventional orchestral arrangements to electronic and more experimental instrumentation. Along with his strong sense of theme and rhythmic texture, the technique of combining conventional instrumentation with manipulated, twisted and textural sound design elements that he has created, allows Conlan to produce a distinctive score for each project.

The company developed into a large industrial concern with furnaces, ironworks and mines. Under James Foster, John Bradley's half brother, it was instrumental in bringing the first commercial steam locomotive into the Midlands area in 1829. The firm stayed under family control until the early years of the 20th century when first the mining (1913) and then the ironworks (1919) were sold off. Part of the business continued to trade under the name John Bradley & Co. (Stourbridge) Ltd until after the Second World War. History =Founding and early years= John Bradley (1769-1816) was the son of Gabriel and Mary Bradley (n√©e Haden) of the town of Stourbridge, where they ran an iron business including Stourbridge Forge on the River Stour. After Gabriel's death in 1771, Mary married Henry Foster and had seven further children, six of whom survived infancy. The youngest of their sons was James Foster. Henry Foster died in 1793. Murray's Hypocycloidal Engine, a steam engine, was installed at John Bradley's in 1805 John Bradley founded his firm in 1800 in Stourbridge with the financial assistance of Thomas Jukes Collier, a wine merchant from Wellington. Bradley leased land by the Stourbridge Canal. where he set up a forge, a furnace and a rolling and slitting mill. The company produced wrought iron using the puddling process. In 1802 the company was set up as a partnership divided into three: one third held by John Bradley, one third by Thomas Jukes Collier and a third held in trust for the children of the late Henry Foster (John Bradley's six half-brothers and sisters). A steam engine owned by the company, Murray's Hypocycloidal Engine, built in 1805, has been preserved and is now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. It is the world's third-oldest working steam engine. At this stage the company didn't make iron from ore but bought in pig iron to be turned into wrought iron at the Stourbridge Ironworks. By 1807 the Foster family share of the company was concentrated in the hands of the brothers James and William Foster. In 1809 the company acquired Eardinton Forge near the River Severn to the south of Bridgenorth. William Foster left the partnership in 1813, subsequently running the Stourbridge Forge as an independent business, and, as Thomas Jukes Collier had already sold his share of the company to the other partners, this meant that the company was co-owned by John Bradley and James Foster after this date. John Bradley died 1816. =The company under James Foster= Agenoria, an early steam locomotive owned and operated by John Bradley & Co, now at the National Railway Museum, York After his half-brother's death, James Foster took control of the enterprise, which included the Stourbridge Iron Works. He was not the sole owner at this stage, however, since a proportion of the company was held in trust for the Bradley children. In 1823 John Bradley & Co., took a lease of land at Shut End, Kingswinford from J.H.H. Foley with the aim of exploiting the coal and other minerals found there as well as building furnaces. An agreement to construct a rail line to link the Shut End area to a purpose-built canal basin at Ashwood on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal was signed in 1827 by James Foster and Francis Downing, the mineral agent of John William Ward, the 4th Viscount Dudley and Ward. The locomotive that ran on this line Agenoria was constructed by Foster, Rastrick and Company which was a partnership between James Foster and the engineer John Urpeth Rastrick. Agenoria was housed on a siding at Shut End and remained the property of John Bradley & Co. The Foster, Rastrick & Co business was wound up by mutual consent on 20 June 1831, its assets being absorbed into John Bradley & Co. A guide to Stourbridge and its vicinity published in 1832 gave the following description of the company: \\"on the left bank of the canal, occupying a space intervening between its channel and that of the Stour, being the south side of the wharf; stands the vast range of buildings denominated Stourbridge Iron Works, conducted under the firm of John Bradley and Co. This extensive concern, generally considered as belonging to James Foster, Esq. comprehends all the various parts of the iron processes with the exception of the incipient one of smelting the ore, the pigs being obtained from distant localities.\\" The same source reported: \\"every species of requisite machinery, from the potent Leviathan of the mechanic arts, to the minutest instrument, is here in full operation, and the multiform articles demanded by the artisan, are completely prepared and supplied. Under the same firm, large works in the county of Salop and elsewhere are carried on; as also extensive collieries at Shutt-end, Kingswinford, and in the vicinity of Dudley.\\" By 1835 Foster had constructed furnaces and developed a colliery at Shut End. John Bradley & Co. had also an ironworks at Brockmoor by this date. On 27 February 1836, Henry Bradley, John's only surviving son decided to leave the business (he had been involved in the company since 1827) and sold his share to Foster. The four daughters of John Bradley had already sold their own shares in the company and so James Foster became sole owner of John Bradley & Co. At this time the company was described as having premises at: Stourbridge, Eardington, Hampton's Load, Shutt End, Brettell Lane, Baptist End, Scott's Green, and Brockmoor in the counties of Worcestershire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire. In 1840, the 2-mile long Stourbridge Extension Canal opened, linking Bradley's Shut End works with the canal network. In a Parliamentary report from 1843, Foster was described as a 'large proprietor of iron-works and collieries, employing about 5000 hands'. On James Foster's death in 1853, John Bradley & Co. passed to James's nephew William Orme Foster. He was the son of William Foster, who had left the Bradley partnership in 1813, and Charlotte Foster (n√©e Orme). =William Orme Foster as owner= Stourbridge Town Clock, donated to the town by William Orme Foster in 1857, was designed and constructed at John Bradley & Co.'s Stourbridge Iron Works The company continued to be a very large industrial concern under William, although its profits came under pressure as steel manufacturers competed with the traditional iron products of John Bradley & Co. In the mid-1860s an agreement was reached between the company and the Earl of Dudley's estate to upgrade the railway track between Shut End and the Ashwood Basin and to re-align the steep incline at the canal end of the line such that it could be worked by a locomotive instead of a stationary engine. As part of the agreement, John Bradley & Co. undertook to purchase a new locomotive to replace the outdated Agenoria. In 1865 the company bought the locomotive Prince of Wales from the Leeds firm Manning Wardle followed by Queen (1867) and Princess of Wales (1879) from the same manufacturer. The 1860s were good years for the company. In 1869 the company was valued at around ¬£250,000 (an increase from around ¬£150,00 on James Foster's death). It was operating 95 wrought iron-producing puddling furnaces at this time. However, the subsequent fortunes of the company were less bright as the iron trade declined generally in the 1870s. By 1882 the number of wrought iron-producing furnaces had reduced to 29. In 1884, William Orme Foster attempted but failed to sell the company. In 1885 some of the original land leases obtained by James Foster in order to build the Kingswinford Railway were set to expire. It was decided that the link to the Ashwood Basin was no longer necessary for Bradley's Shut End works, which were by then connected to the canal and mainline rail network. It was then arranged for the Dudley Estate to take over the leases, which included the Ashwood Basin itself. During the final years of the nineteenth century, William Orme Foster contracted the company. At the end of the century just the Shut End and Stourbridge industries remained active, although the furnaces at Shut End had closed in the 1890s. On William Orme's death on 29 September 1899, his son, William Henry Foster, inherited John Bradley & Co. =Final years= The Shut End collieries were sold to H.S. Pitt & Company in 1913. The collieries were worked using the railway network built by John Bradley & Co until around 1937. The land now forms part of the Pensnett Trading Estate. In 1919 the Stourbridge Iron Works were sold to a company owned by Edward J. Taylor, which ran the business under the name John Bradley & Co. (Stourbridge) Ltd. In the interwar period, N. Hingley & Sons Ltd acquired John Bradley & Co. (Stourbridge) Ltd but it still continued to trade under that name until 1963. The company was finally wound up in 1966 although the Stourbridge Ironworks continued as a rolling mill within the F.H. Lloyd Group until 1982. One of the last firms to operate on the site was Sidney Smith & Sons (Stourbridge) Ltd. The works became derelict by 2005. The main surviving building on the site is the New Foundry of 1821, originally built for the Foster, Rastrick and Company partnership but part of John Bradley & Co. after 1831. This building has been converted into a medical centre known as Lion Health.

It was constructed in the 16th century by the Order of Saint John, on or near the site of an Ottoman battery from the Great Siege of Malta. The battery forms the lower tier of St. Peter & Paul Bastion of the Valletta Land Front, located below the Upper Barrakka Gardens and overlooking Fort St. Angelo and the rest of the Grand Harbour. The Saluting Battery was mainly used for firing ceremonial gun salutes and signals, but it also saw military use during the blockade of 1798‚Äì1800 and World War II. The battery remained an active military installation until its guns were removed by the British in 1954. It was restored and opened to the public in the early 21st century, and it is now equipped with eight working replicas of SBBL 32-pounders which fire gun signals daily at 1200 and 1600. History =Hospitaller rule= Detail from a map of the Grand Harbour during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, showing the Order's strongholds of Birgu and Senglea and various Ottoman batteries. The battery at the top left of the image, overlooking Fort St. Angelo and flying a blue standard, stood roughly on the site of the Saluting Battery. The origins of the Saluting Battery go back to the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. During the siege, Ottoman forces mounted cannon on the Sciberras Peninsula (now occupied by Valletta and Floriana) to bombard the Order of Saint John in Fort St. Angelo. One of the siege batteries was located close to where the Saluting Battery is now, since the area is on high ground and has clear views of St. Angelo and the rest of the Grand Harbour. In 1566, after the siege was lifted, the city of Valletta was founded. St. Peter & Paul Bastion began to be built in the same year, and was finished in 1570. The bastion has a multi- tiered artillery platform, from which guns could be mounted to command the full length and depth of the Grand Harbour. The Saluting Battery was built on the lower platform, while a loggia and a private garden were built on the upper part in the early 17th century. During the order's rule in Malta, the battery was used for both military and ceremonial purposes. By the late 18th century, the battery was armed with sixteen 12-pounder bronze cannon that fired stone spherical shots. During the French occupation of Malta and the siege of Valletta by Maltese insurgents, the armament of the Saluting Battery remained unchanged, but the guns' elevations were increased to be able to bombarded insurgent positions on Corradino Heights across the harbour. =British rule= Soon after the British occupied Malta in 1800, the three daily gun signals (at sunrise, noon and sunset) began to be fired from the Saluting Battery instead of Saint James Cavalier, as they had been during the order's rule. When the battery was undergoing maintenance, the shots were fired from Fort St Angelo on the opposite side of the harbour. In 1803, two 24-pounder carronades and some 24-pounder cannon, which had been captured from the French during the French Revolutionary Wars, were added to the armament of the battery, and these remained in place until 1825. In 1824, the loggia and garden on the platform above the Saluting Battery were opened to the public as the Upper Barrakka Gardens. By 1848, the battery was armed with four 12-pounder guns. Over the next few years, the armament was significantly increased. By 1852, the battery was armed with ten 24-pounders on the main parapet, four 32-pounders on the right flank, three 8-inch howitzers on the left flank, two 13-inch mortars at the back of the parapet, and two 56-pounder carronades at the salient angles. In 1854, Lascaris Battery was built adjoining St. Peter & Paul Bastion, below the Saluting Battery. Henry Anderson Morshead (died 1831) was buried on the site of the battery. In the 1860s, another 24-pounder was added, bringing the salute guns to eleven. In 1886, howitzers were replaced by RML 64-pounder guns, while the 32-pounders were removed. In the 1890s, all the armament was replaced with eleven 32-pounder Muzzle Loaders, which were used for saluting purposes only. In the early 20th century, the armament consisted of eight SBBL 32 pounders. The gun signals were not fired throughout World War I to conserve gunpowder, and they began to be fired again on Armistice Day in 1918. During the 1920s, the civilian authorities began pressing the government to cede the Saluting Battery in order to extend the Upper Barrakka. A second entrance to the battery was opened in 1924, linking it to the gardens. That same year, the armament was reduced to one SBBL 32-pounder, and four Ordnance QF 18-pounders. Part of the battery was given up to the public, and the guns were fenced off. Bofors 40 mm gun at the Saluting Battery in 1942 In 1939, just before the beginning of World War II, the guns were all removed to be deployed for coastal defence. A single Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun was placed on the right salient of the battery to protect the Malta Dockyard. The battery was manned by the 3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Malta Artillery. The Upper Barrakka and the Saluting Battery were significantly damaged by aerial bombardment. During the war, the Lascaris War Rooms were built in tunnels dug under the battery and gardens. After the war, the damage to the battery and gardens was repaired. Its armament was briefly replaced by four 25-pounder QF Mk I guns. These were removed a few years later in 1954, when the battery was shut down and transferred to the Royal Navy as part of its complex in Fort Lascaris. In 1965, the part of the battery that was still military property was handed over to the civil government and the whole area was turned into a garden. =Restoration= One of the guns at the battery firing a salute Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna, the Malta Heritage Trust, acquired the battery in 2004 and began to restore it to its late 19th century configuration. It now has working cannon, artillery stores, a gunpowder magazine, a collection of historic ordinance and a small museum. After restoration, the battery was initially equipped with eight original 24-pounder Blomefield cannon made between 1790 and 1810, but these were transferred to a museum and replaced with eight working replicas of SBBL 32-pounders in 2011. During restoration works in 2011, about a hundred stone cannonballs were found at the site. The battery is now open daily, and guided tours are available. Gun salutes are fired every day at 1200 and 1600, and cruise liners visiting the Grand Harbour can also commission six-gun salutes.

It is located in Casbeno, in Via Gianluigi Zucchi. History The IPSIA of Varese was born between 1960 and 1961 with the courses for the mechanical, electrical and ceramic in Laveno Mombello. Closed the headquarters of Laveno, the headquarters moved to the company Mazzucchelli in Castiglione Olona. In 2007, ITIS and IPSIA become a single multi-purpose center.Official web site https://www.isisvarese.edu.it/ Courses Mechanical, mechatronics and energy; Chemistry, materials and biotechnology; Fashion System; Electronics and Electrical Engineering; Mechanical operator; Industrial production and craft; Maintenance and technical assistance; Services for agriculture and rural development; Evening course in Information and Communication Technology; Evening course in Mechanics and Mechatronics; Evening Course Maintenance and Technical Support  References  Category:Schools in Varese Category:Secondary schools in Italy ","title":"Statal Institute of Higher Education Isaac Newton"},{"id":"45618964","text":"Pitaloosie Saila (born 1942) is a Canadian Inuk artist who specialises in Inuit art.  Biography  Saila was born in Cape Dorset in what was then Northwest Territories (now Nunavut) in Canada, but spent much of her childhood in hospitals in Quebec and Ontario. She learned English through her hospital stays, and often served as translator for her neighbours. Her mother died when she was two years old while her father was away on a walrus hunt, and she was raised by her grandmother. She has stated that it was difficult for her to relearn Inuktitut once she returned to Baffin Island in 1957, at the age of 15. A graphic artist widely known for her 113 stunning images featured in Cape Dorset print collections since 1968, Pitaloosie Saila comes from a family of extremely successful artists. Her husband Pauta Saila was a highly respected sculptor, and her stepmother, Mary Pudlat, has been a regular contributor to Cape Dorset print collections. Pitaloosie's two uncles, Pudlo Pudlat and Osoochiak Pudlat, have both gained considerable attention for their graphic works, and her father's famous cousin, Peter Pitseolak, was one of the first South Baffin Inuit to produce a sustained body of artistic work over an extended period of years. Saila began to draw in the early 1960s and immediately developed a personal style. She has participated in an annual engraving collection in Cape Dorset since 1968. However, she began to draw completely on her own initiative in the early 1960s during the time that James Archibald Houston was at Cape Dorset, and her style is distinctively her own. She tends towards images of strong, nurturing women or women and children, and frequently draws birds and mythical Taleelayu (or Sedna) figures as well. Pitaloosie Saila has had numerous opportunities to travel in southern Canada and abroad in connection with her art. With Pauta Saila, she spent the summer of 1967 in Toronto with their family while Pauta executed a carving for the International Sculpture Symposium. In 1974, Pitaloosie attend the opening of her first solo exhibition in Hamilton, Ontario, and subsequent showings of her work have taken her to major cities in southern Canada, the United States and Europe.  Recognition  In 1977, in recognition of the contribution of Inuit art to the cultural heritage of Canada, Canada Post used her 1971 print, Fisherman's Dream, as one of a series of four illustrated postage stamps. Her 1980 print, Arctic Madonna, was selected for a UNICEF greeting card in 1983. Saila's works are included in some of the most important Inuit art collections, including those of the National Gallery of Canada, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA), the Winnipeg Art Gallery, and the Canadian Museum of History. In 2002, she was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.List of members References External links * National Gallery of Canada: Pitaloosie Saila Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Inuit artists Category:Inuit printmakers Category:Artists from Nunavut Category:20th-century Canadian women artists Category:Women printmakers Category:Canadian Inuit women Category:20th-century printmakers Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:Inuit from Nunavut Category:21st-century Canadian women artists Category:People from Kinngait ","title":"Pitaloosie Saila"},{"id":"45618967","text":"This is a list of Knights Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire from 1887 until 1947, when the order ceased to be awarded.

It is halfway along an ideal route that runs along the axis of the walled and terraced vegetable gardens, climbing from the Municipal Park, near the river Fusandola, towards the Arechi Castle. History The \\"viridarium\\" was owned by the Silvatico family from the 12th century, as recorded by a parchment conserved in the Badia archives in Cava de' Tirreni. Later on, in the first twenty years of the 14th century, Matteo Silvatico created a garden of simples here, a forerunner of all future botanical gardens in Europe. The garden In this area of extraordinary cultural value, which can now be identified in the area of the Minerva's Garden, he cultivated some of the plants used to produce the active ingredients employed for therapeutic purposes. Matteo Silvatico also taught here, showing the plants to the scholars at the School of Medicine and providing their names and characteristics. During a recent archaeological dig, the mediaeval garden was found at a depth of around two metres under the current ground level. The last owner was Giovanni Capasso who, thanks to the interest of the lawyer Gaetano Nunziante, chairman of the Asilo di Mendicit√†, donated the whole property to this charitable institution immediately after the Second World War. In November 1991 a project was presented for the creation of a botanical garden dedicated to Silvatico and his garden of simples. This project was funded and developed in 2000 by the Municipal Council, using funds from the European Urban programme. Now that the restoration work has been completed, visitors to the garden can see an interesting series of elements dating back to the 17th and 18th century. One of the most attractive is the long flight of steps, marked by cruciform pillars, which support a wooden pergola. Botanical species The fountain with the Colocasia Minerva's Garden is not a traditional botanical garden, but follows specific themes in various zones. The most important educational element of the theme linked to Salerno's botanical tradition is the illustration, in the largest terrace in the garden, of the ancient plant classification system. In all the other flower beds in the garden, the plants are arranged on the basis of landscaping. All the species are identified with a label that refers to the ideal position of the simple in a design representing the positioning of the elements, superimposed over the concentric subdivision of the grades. After the 2001 restoration, several rare species were planted, mostly chosen among those quoted in the Opus Pandectarum Medicinae, which were used as medicines in the Middle Age. =List of the species= ;A * Acanthus mollis * Achillea millefolium * Aconitum napellus * Acorus calamus * Adiantum capillus-veneris * Agrimonia eupatoria * Ajuga reptans * Alisma plantago-aquatica * Aloe vera * Allium schoenoprasum * Allium ursinum * Alpinia zerumbet * Althaea officinalis * Ammi visnaga * Anchusa officinalis * Anethum graveolens * Anthemis cotula * Anthriscus cerefolium * Arbutus unedo * Arctium lappa * Aristolochia clematitis * Armoracia rusticana * Artemisia abrotanum * Artemisia absinthium * Artemisia dracunculus * Arum italicum * Asarum europaeum * Asparagus acutifolius * Asphodelus albus * Asplenium ceterach * Asplenium scolopendrium * Athyrium filix-femina * Atropa belladonna ;B * Berberis vulgaris * Borago officinalis * Calamintha nepeta ;C * Calendula officinalis * Campanula medium * Capparis spinosa * Carthamus tinctorius * Carum carvi * Cassia fistula * Centranthus ruber * Ceratonia siliqua * Chamaemelum nobile * Chelidonium majus * Cinnamomum camphora * Cistus creticus * Cistus ladanifer * Cistus monspeliensis * Citrus limon * Citrus medica * Citrus reticulata * Citrus sinensis * Colocasia esculenta * Conium maculatum * Coriandrum sativum * Cornus mas * Crataegus azarolus * Crithmum maritimum * Crocus sativus * Cucumis sativus * Cupressus sempervirens * Cyclamen hederifolium * Cydonia oblonga * Cyperus papyrus * Cytinus hypocistis ;D * Dactylorhiza maculata * Diplotaxis tenuifolia * Dipsacus fullonum * Doronicum pardalianches * Dracaena draco ;E * Elettaria cardamomum * Euphorbia cyparissias ;F * Ficus carica * Filipendula ulmaria * Filipendula vulgaris * Foeniculum vulgare * Fragaria vesca * Fraxinus ornus ;G * Galega officinalis * Galium verum * Gladiolus italicus * Glaucium flavum * Glycyrrhiza glabra * Gossypium herbaceum ;H * Hedera helix * Helichrysum italicum * Helichrysum stoechas * Helleborus viridis * Hippophae rhamnoides * Hyoscyamus albus * Hyoscyamus niger * Hypericum perforatum * Hyssopus officinalis ;I * Inula helenium * Iris florentina * Isatis tinctoria ;J * Jasminum officinale * Jasminum sambac * Juniperus communis ;K * Kickxia elatine ;L * Lablab purpureus * Laurus nobilis * Lavandula angustifolia * Lavandula dentata * Levisticum officinale * Lilium martagon * Linum usitatissimum * Lithospermum officinale * Lonicera caprifolium * Lycopus europaeus * Lysimachia vulgaris * Lythrum salicaria ;M * Malva sylvestris * Mandragora autumnalis * Matricaria recutita * Melilotus officinalis * Melissa officinalis * Mentha aquatica * Mentha longifolia * Mentha suaveolens * Meum athamanticum * Myriophyllum aquaticum * Miriofillo * Myrtus communis * Myrtus communis ;N * Narcissus tazetta * Nasturtium microphyllum * Nepeta cataria * Nerium oleander * Nigella damascena * Nuphar lutea * Nymphaea alba ;O * Ocimum tenuiflorum * Olea europaea * Ononis spinosa * Origanum majorana * Origanum vulgare * Osmunda regalis ;P * Paeonia officinalis * Pastinaca sativa * Petroselinum crispum * Petroselinum sativum * Phoenix dactylifera * Physalis alkekengi * Pimpinella anisum * Piper nigrum * Pistacia lentiscus * Pistacia vera * Plantago major * Polygonatum odoratum *Polypodium vulgare * Portulaca oleracea * Potentilla erecta * Prunus armeniaca * Prunus avium * Prunus cerasus * Prunus domestica * Psyllium afrum * Punica granatum * Pyrus communis ;R * Rhamnus catharticus * Rheum rhabarbarum * Ricinus communis * Rosa gallica * Rosa canina * Rosa sempervirens * Rosmarinus officinalis * Rubia tinctorum * Rubus idaeus * Rubus ulmifolius * Rumex acetosa * Ruscus aculeatus * Ruscus hypoglossum * Ruta graveolens ;S * Saccharum officinarum * Salix alba * Salvia officinalis * Sambucus nigra * Santolina chamaecyparissus * Saponaria officinalis *Satureja hortensis * Satureja montana * Scrophularia nodosa * Sempervivum tectorum * Sesamum indicum * Silene coronaria *Silybum marianum * Sinapis alba * Smilax aspera * Sorbus domestica * Spartium junceum * Stachys officinalis * Symphytum officinale ;T * Tanacetum balsamita * Tanacetum parthenium * Tanacetum vulgare * Taraxacum officinale * Taxus baccata * Teucrium chamaedrys * Thalictrum flavum *Thymus vulgaris * Thymus serpyllum * Trigonella foenum-graecum ;U * Umbilicus rupestris * Urginea maritima ;V * Valeriana officinalis * Verbascum thapsus * Verbena officinalis * Viola odorata * Vitex agnus-castus * Vitis vinifera ;W * Withania somnifera ;Z * Ziziphus jujuba External links * Official website See also * Salerno * List of botanical gardens in Italy Category:Botanical gardens in Italy ","title":"Minerva's Garden (Salerno)"},{"id":"45618985","text":"Newland Road Site, also known as The Nine Foot Brick Road, is a historic archaeological site located near Morgan's Corner, Pasquotank County, North Carolina.

Demographics As of 2019, \\"Copts are generally understood to make up approximately 10 percent of Egypt's population,\\"Michael Wahid Hanna, Excluded and Unequal: Copts on the Margins of the Egyptian Security State, The Century Foundation (May 9, 2019). with an estimated population of 9.5 million (figure cited in the Wall Street Journal, 2017) or 10 million (figure cited in the Associated Press, 2019). Smaller or larger figures have also been cited, in the range of \\"somewhere between 6% and 18% of the population,\\" with the Egyptian government estimating lower numbers and the Coptic Orthodox Church estimating much higher numbers. A lack of definite, reliable demographic data renders all estimates uncertain. History The early church historian, Eusebius, states in his Chronicle that Mark arrived in Egypt in the third year of Emperor Claudius (43 A.D.), marking the beginning of Christianity in Egypt. By 641 C.E., the Arab forces take over Egypt, marking the beginning of the Arab-Muslim period in Egypt.President Nasser welcomes a delegation of Coptic bishops (1965) Coptic flag. Under Muslim rule, the ethnic Copts were cut off from the mainstream of Christianity, and were compelled to adhere to the Pact of Umar covenant, thus assigned to Dhimmi status. Their position improved dramatically under the rule of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century. He abolished the Jizya (a tax on non-Muslims) and allowed ethnic Copts to enroll in the army. Pope Cyril IV, 1854‚Äì61, reformed the church and encouraged broader Coptic participation in Egyptian affairs. Khedive Isma'il Pasha, in power 1863‚Äì79, further promoted the Copts. He appointed them judges to Egyptian courts and awarded them political rights and representation in government. They flourished in business affairs.Todros, ch 3‚Äì4. Some ethnic Copts participated in the Egyptian national movement for independence and occupied many influential positions. Two significant cultural achievements include the founding of the Coptic Museum in 1910 and the Higher Institute of Coptic Studies in 1954. Some prominent Coptic thinkers from this period are Salama Moussa, Louis Awad and Secretary General of the Wafd Party Makram Ebeid. In 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser led some army officers in a coup d'√©tat against King Farouk, which overthrew the Kingdom of Egypt and established a republic. Nasser's mainstream policy was pan-Arab nationalism and socialism. The ethnic Copts were severely affected by Nasser's nationalization policies, though they represented about 10‚Äì20% of the population. In addition, Nasser's pan-Arab policies undermined the Copts' strong attachment to and sense of identity about their Egyptian pre-Arab, and certainly non-Arab identity which resulted in permits to construct churches to be delayed along with Christian religious courts to be closed. =Pharaonism= Many Coptic intellectuals hold to \\"Pharaonism,\\" which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre- Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. However, some Western scholars today argue that Pharaonism was a late development shaped primarily by Orientalism, and doubt its validity.. Persecution and discrimination in Egypt Religious freedom in Egypt is hampered to varying degrees by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Coptic Christians, being the largest religious minority in Egypt, are also negatively affected. Copts have faced increasing marginalization after the 1952 coup d'√©tat led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Until recently, Christians were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches. Although the law was eased in 2005 by handing down the authority of approval to the governors, Copts continue to face many obstacles and restrictions in building new churches. These restrictions do not apply for building mosques.WorldWide Religious News. Church Building Regulations Eased . December 13, 2005.Compass Direct News. Church Building Regulations Eased. December 13, 2005. The Coptic community has been targeted with hate crimes by Islamic extremists. The most significant was the 2000‚Äì01 El Kosheh attacks, in which Muslims and Christians were involved in bloody inter-religious clashes following a dispute between a Muslim and a Christian. \\"Twenty Christians and one Muslim were killed after violence broke out in the town of el-Kosheh, south of Cairo\\". International Christian Concern reported that in February 2001, Muslims burned a new Egyptian church and the homes of 35 Christians, and that in April 2001 a 14-year-old Egyptian Christian girl was kidnapped because her parents were believed to be harboring a person who had converted from Islam to Christianity. In 2006, one person attacked three churches in Alexandria, killing one person and injuring 5‚Äì16. The attacker was not linked to any organisation and described as \\"psychologically disturbed\\" by the Ministry of Interior.BBC. Egypt church attacks spark anger, April 15, 2006. In May 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported increasing waves of mob attacks by Muslims against ethnic Copts. Despite frantic calls for help, the police typically arrived after the violence was over. The police also coerced the Copts to accept \\"reconciliation\\" with their attackers to avoid prosecuting them, with no Muslims convicted for any of the attacks.http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/resources/ar2010/egypt2010.pdf In Marsa Matrouh, a Bedouin mob of 3,000 Muslims tried to attack the city's Coptic population, with 400 Copts having to barricade themselves in their church while the mob destroyed 18 homes, 23 shops and 16 cars. Journalist John R.

Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.97 Members of U.S. Congress have expressed concern about \\"human trafficking\\" of Coptic women and girls who are victims of abductions, forced conversion to Islam, sexual exploitation and forced marriage to Muslim men. Boutros Boutros- Ghali was a Copt who served as Egypt's foreign minister under President Anwar Sadat. During Mubarak regime, there were two Copts serving on Egypt's governmental cabinet: Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali and Environment Minister Magued George. There was also one Coptic governor out of 25, that of the upper Egyptian governorate of Qena, and the first Coptic governor in a few decades. In addition, Naguib Sawiris, an extremely successful businessman, is a Copt who lived in Egypt during that era.

Official and unofficial discrimination against Copts occurs in forms such as disadvantages in education and the judicial system, violence from Islamic militants, and restrictions on religious activity and expression. While freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution, according to Human Rights Watch, \\"Egyptians are able to convert to Islam generally without difficulty, but Muslims who convert to Christianity face difficulties in getting new identity papers and some have been arrested for allegedly forging such documents.\\"Human Rights Watch. World report 2007: Egypt . The Coptic community, however, takes pains to prevent conversions from Christianity to Islam due to the ease with which Christians can often become Muslim. Public officials, being conservative themselves, intensify the complexity of the legal procedures required to recognize the religion change as required by law. Security agencies will sometimes claim that such conversions from Islam to Christianity (or occasionally vice versa) may stir social unrest, and thereby justify themselves in wrongfully detaining the subjects, insisting that they are simply taking steps to prevent likely social troubles from happening.Egypt: Egypt Arrests 22 Muslim converts to Christianity.

The Egyptian Census of 1986 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 6.1% (5.7% Christians, 0% Jews). The decline in the Jewish representation is interpreted through the creation of the state of Israel, and the subsequent emigration of the Egyptian Jews. There is no explanation for a 55% decline in the percentage of Christians in Egypt. It has been suggested that Egyptian censuses held after 1952 have been politicized to under-represent the Christian population. In August 2013, following the 3 July 2013 Coup and clashes between the military and Morsi supporters, there were widespread attacks on Coptic churches and institutions in Egypt by Morsi supports. According to at least one Egyptian scholar (Samuel Tadros), the attacks are the worst violence against the Coptic Church since the 14th century. USA Today reported that \\"forty churches have been looted and torched, while 23 others have been attacked and heavily damaged\\". The Facebook page of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party was \\"rife with false accusations meant to foment hatred against Copts\\", according to journalist Kirsten Powers. The Party's page claimed that the Coptic Church had declared \\"war against Islam and Muslims\\" and that \\"The Pope of the Church is involved in the removal of the first elected Islamist president. The Pope of the Church alleges Islamic Sharia is backwards, stubborn, and reactionary.\\" On August 15, nine Egyptian human rights groups under the umbrella group \\"Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights\\", released a statement saying, > In December ‚Ä¶ Brotherhood leaders began fomenting anti-Christian sectarian > incitement.

Events related to Copts  An Egyptian court on February 25, 2016 convicted four Coptic Christian teenagers for contempt of Islam, after they appeared in a video mocking Muslim prayers.

History Como Lake Park, named after the Lake Como tourist resort in Italy, was originally established by the village of Lancaster in 1923 and acquired by Erie County in 1926 as the result of a special village election. The park at that time was in size, and grew to its current extent through land acquisitions in the years that followed. Many of the park's facilities and stone structures were built or improved by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. The park originally featured a small zoo and a toboggan run. Both of these attractions have since been removed.

Early life and education Vale was born in llford, Essex, England. She immigrated to Toronto with her family when she was two years old. A piano-maker and musician, Florence's father taught her to play piano at a young age and entertained the family with toys and puzzles he created himself. Florence's mother was a music-hall musician. Vale had no formal art training; her formal schooling ended at the age of eleven with grade seven, after which she held a series of jobs in Toronto's garment district. When she was eighteen she met Dutch-born artist Albert Franck, a swimming instructor at the Oakwood pool who was teaching her brothers to dive. They were married two years later and had two children, Trudy (who died as an infant) and Anneke. Career Vale was introduced to the world of visual art by her husband, Dutch-born artist Albert Jacques Franck, who painted views of Toronto backyards and houses. In the late 1940s, Vale began to experiment with her husband's paints and brushes. In contrast to Franck's paintings of urban scenes, Vale's subjects were often imaginative and even imaginary. Together, Franck and Vale were a part of the Gerrard Street bohemian circle and their Victorian home on Hazelton Avenue in Toronto became a centre for young artists, CBC personalities, writers, musicians, and critics.\\"Two Artists at Home: Albert Franck and Florence Vale\\", Ontario Homes & Living Magazine September 1965, 12-13. Vale was thus exposed to a wide variety of artistic influences. After Franck's death in 1973, Vale continued to create oil paintings, collages, and ink drawings, also included her own poetry in some of her works. Many of her works, most prominently after the death of her husband, were erotic, while still viewed by critics as keeping a whimsical, innocent tone. A series of her drawings was published as The Amorous Unicorn. Her art appeared in exhibitions in Ontario, Quebec, and New York City, U.S.A. She was associated with the Gadatsy Gallery in Toronto and Julie and Stephen Gadacsy were among her most devoted friends. They helped organize a major retrospective of her work, The Art of FLORENCE VALE at the Art Gallery of Peel in Brampton, Ontario in 2010. Vale's small 1965 pen and ink drawing Pyramid of Roses was the inspiration for Harold Town‚Äôs series of Vale Variations as well as Christopher Chapman and Gordon McLennan's short film celebrating both Town's Variations and the original Vale drawing.

She was married to Tikituk Quinnuayuak as a teenager, which was arranged. Her husband Tikituk was a sculptor and graphic artist. They continued living a traditional hunting lifestyle, moving around the Foxe Peninsula and within various camps such as the Shapujuak, Ittiliakjuk, Igalallik, and Kangia. Artistic career Qinnuayuak began drawing in the late 1950s and was one of the first to respond to James Archibald Houston request for Inuit printmaking. Her work was first included in the Cape Dorset print collection in 1961, and by the time of her death in 1982, 136 of her prints were published in the collection. Qinnuayuak worked primarily in graphite and colored pencils, but did more experimenting in the 1970s‚Äì80s with watercolor and acrylic paints. In the final two decades of her life, she created thousands of images of the stylized birds and scenes depicting women's roles in the traditional Inuit culture. Known for her renderings of arctic birds, Qinnuayuak's work has exhibited extensively in and outside of Canada. One of her designs was used in promotional banners for the 1976 Summer Olympics and her stone cut We all have something to do is part of the Senate of Canada's Aboriginal art collection. Qinnuayuak's work has been exhibited in more than eighty group and solo shows including The Inuit Print exhibition, organized by the Department of Indian Affairs and Canadian Museum of Civilization, that toured internationally from 1977 to 1982.

Copts in Sudan may refer to people born in or residing in Sudan of full or partial Coptic origin. Sudan has a native Coptic minority, although many Copts in Sudan are descended from more recent Coptic immigrants from Egypt. Copts in Sudan live mostly in northern cities, including Al Obeid, Atbara, Dongola, Khartoum, Omdurman, Port Sudan, and Wad Medani. They number up to 500,000, or slightly over 1% of the Sudanese population. Due to their advanced education, their role in the life of the country has been more significant than their numbers suggest. They have occasionally faced forced conversion to Islam, resulting in their emigration and decrease in number. Modern immigration of Copts to Sudan peaked in the early 19th century, and they generally received a tolerant welcome there. However, this was interrupted by a decade of persecution under Mahdist rule at the end of the 19th century. As a result of this persecution, many were forced to relinquish their faith, adopt Islam, and intermarry with the native Sudanese. The Anglo-Egyptian invasion in 1898 allowed Copts greater religious and economic freedom, and they extended their original roles as artisans and merchants into trading, banking, engineering, medicine, and the civil service. Proficiency in business and administration made them a privileged minority. However, the return of militant Islam in the mid-1960s and subsequent demands by radicals for an Islamic constitution prompted Copts to join in public opposition to religious rule. Gaafar Nimeiry's introduction of Islamic Sharia law in 1983 began a new phase of oppressive treatment of Copts, among other non-Muslims. After the overthrow of Nimeiry, Coptic leaders supported a secular candidate in the 1986 elections. However, when the National Islamic Front overthrew the elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi with the help of the military, discrimination against Copts returned in earnest. Hundreds of Copts were dismissed from the civil service and judiciary. In February 1991, a Coptic pilot working for Sudan Airways was executed for illegal possession of foreign currency.The Copts Before his execution, he had been offered amnesty and money if he converted to Islam, but he refused. Thousands attended his funeral, and the execution was taken as a warning by many Copts, who began to flee the country. Restrictions on the Copts' rights to Sudanese nationality followed, and it became difficult for them to obtain Sudanese nationality by birth or by naturalization, resulting in problems when attempting to travel abroad. The confiscation of Christian schools and the imposition of an Arab- Islamic emphasis in language and history teaching were accompanied by harassment of Christian children and the introduction of hijab dress laws. A Coptic child was flogged for failing to recite a Koranic verse. In contrast with the extensive media broadcasting of the Muslim Friday prayers, the radio ceased coverage of the Christian Sunday service. As the civil war raged throughout the 1990s, the government focused its religious fervour on the south. Although experiencing discrimination, the Copts and other long- established Christian groups in the north had fewer restrictions than other types of Christians in the south. Today, the Coptic Church in Sudan is officially registered with the government, and is exempt from property tax. In 2005, the Sudanese government of National Unity (GNU) named a Coptic Orthodox priest to a government position. After the Sudanese Revolution of 2019, a Coptic Orthodox priest led the inauguration of the new Prime Minister of Sudan, Abdalla Hamdok. A Coptic Christian woman was also appointed to serve in Sudan's new Transitional Council.  Genetics  Hollfelder et al. (2017) analysed various populations in Sudan and observed that Egyptians and Copts showed low levels of genetic differentiation and lower levels of genetic diversity compared to other northeast African groups, including Arab and Middle Eastern groups that share ancestry with the Copts and Egyptians.

Nenana, located in Central Alaska, has a large Native population, according to the 2010 census it's populated by 378 people. Her mother lived in a mostly white town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Lord's father was an activist in the Indian movement. Her personal experience perpetually moving between various geographic places inspires her work's interest in themes of displacement, cultural identity and cultural limbo. She received a B.A. in liberal arts and studio arts from Carleton College in 2001 and completed her M.F.A. in sculpture and photography at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006.  Identity  Lord describes herself as having become an emigrant through her six families and defines her history as the Native diaspora. That same diaspora is what motivates her art. It‚Äôs for her to explore a new way of demonstrating true cultural identity. She hopes that her art helps her audience redefine their selves, communities, and beliefs.  Career  Erica Lord has exhibited her work in solo exhibitions at the DeVos Museum of Art (Marquette, MI) and the Alaska Native Arts Foundation Gallery (Anchorage, AK), as well as in group exhibitions such as the Havana Biennial and the Museum of Contemporary Native American Art. = Notable exhibitions = * 2010, Dry Ice, Museum of Contemporary Native American Art, Santa Fe, NM * 2009, BadLand, Institute of American Indian Arts Museum, Santa Fe, NM: An installation of prayer bundles made from the red cloth of the United States' Star Spangled Banner. * 2007, Off the Map: Landscape and the Native Imagination, Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian, New York, NY  Selected Works  = Un/Defined Self-Portrait Series (2005), C-prints of variable dimension = = Untitled (Tattooed Arms) (2007), Digital Photographs = Erica Lord photographs two tattoos: one on the inner side of her left forearm titled ‚ÄúEnrollment number‚Äù and one on her right forearm titled ‚ÄúBlood Quantum‚Äù. These two tattoos criticize the Native American image created by modern society. Lord‚Äôs tattoo titled ‚ÄúBlood Quantum‚Äù, after the blood quantum laws, is a visual criticism on the United States government control on all Native American heritage. The tattoo ‚ÄúEnrollment Number‚Äù is the number given to Erica Lord, and all Native Americans, by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Placing this number on her arm, Erica Lord draws direct comparison to Holocaust survivors and their experiences to the United States expansion and relocation of Native Americans. = The Tanning Project: I Tan To Look More Native (2006), Digital Inkjet, variable dimensions = Common Native Art typically showcases Indian land and where they come from. However, this specific image has little to do with land because the photo has a black backdrop and the shot is from her waist up, focusing solely on her body. She boldly refers to this tanning ritual as white beautification: tanning or browning of the skin. Using such words is a very straight forward way to a political call to action. The words I Tan to Look More Native are scripted onto her back with sunscreen to show the contrast effect after tanning. The inscription is to challenge Native identity through the contrast being used, which to viewers start to become unrecognizable. It challenges what an \\"Indian\\" really looks like and what people thought they looked like. She uses her own body to show her struggles through becoming an emigrant. She is photographed nude with her back facing the camera in an erotic pin-up pose. She poses this way to give a duplicitous meaning to the word pose to expose those who have unrealistic expectations of what a Native person is supposed to look like. = Artifact Piece, Revisited, (2009), performance and mixed media installation = On April 3, 2008 Erica Lord arrived at the George Gustav Heye Center, the National Museum of the American Indian, at the Smithsonian Museum in New York, for a performance/installation titled Artifact Piece, Revisited. This piece was a reenactment of American artist James Luna's Artifact Piece, that he first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987. When Lord entered the gallery, she lay down in a case, closed her eyes, and allowed museum visitors to examine her over the next few hours. Captions placed throughout the display identified parts of her, such as her painted toenails. There were two glass cases on either side of the box where Lord laid, that contained clothing and her personal possessions. One side contained Alaskan Native dress, and the other contained modern clothing. This first performance of Artifact Piece, Revisited was followed by lectures and a discussion with Lord herself. The artist returned to the museum to perform the piece again twice over the next two days. Using her body as a conversation piece, Lord critiqued the displaying of Native people in museum exhibits and the display of women's bodies.

The first woman to receive an MD from the University of Edinburgh, she helped found the Elsie Inglis Hospital for Women, was the first president of the Edinburgh Women's Citizen Association, a staff physician and later senior physician at the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children, and co-edited the Encyclopaedia Medica with her husband, Douglas Chalmers Watson. At the time of her death in 1936, she was president of the Medical Women's Federation, having been elected May 1935. Early life and education Alexandra Mary Campbell Geddes was born in India on 31 May 1872, a daughter of Auckland Campbell Geddes (1831‚Äì1908), a civil engineer, and Christina Helen MacLeod Geddes (n√©e Anderson; 1850‚Äì1914). Chalmers Watson was the eldest of five children in the Geddes family; among her siblings were Eric Geddes and Auckland Geddes, 1st Baron Geddes. From 1888 to 1890 she was educated at St Leonard's School in St Andrews, Scotland. When she turned her focus towards the study of medicine, it was the latest in a lengthy familial interest in the profession: her mother supported Christian Guthrie Wright and Louisa Stevenson in the foundation of the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy (later Queen Margaret University), and been an early campaigner on behalf of the cause of medical education for women. Through her mother Chalmers Watson also claimed kinship to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England, and her maternal aunt, Mary Marshall (n√©e Anderson) had been one of the original women admitted to study medicine alongside Sophia Jex-Blake at the University of Edinburgh in 1871, later qualifying in Paris. Chalmers Watson began her medical education in 1891 at the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women, which had been established by Elsie Inglis, later a noted suffragist, and her father John Inglis. She graduated MB CM from the University of Edinburgh in 1896. Career After her graduation, she spent a year in London working as a physician at the Maternity District Association at Plaistow; she also spent six months working at Dr Barnardo's Homes in Kent. Her experience working in Plaistow, where her record consisted of more than 1000 confinements with a mortality rate of just over 1 per 1000, informed the topic of her MD thesis when she returned to Edinburgh the following year. Chalmers Watson obtained her MD on 30 July 1898 from the University of Edinburgh's Medical College, the first woman to do so; fellow University of Edinburgh alumna Jessie MacLaren MacGregor did not receive her MD until 1899. The same day that she received her M.D., Mona Geddes became Dr Mona Chalmers Watson, marrying Dr Douglas Chalmers Watson that afternoon; she had delayed the wedding until she could write MD after her name. Together they had two sons, Rupert and Irvine. After their marriage, Douglas and Mona set up a private practice together in Edinburgh at 11 Walker St, which they shared until 1914. The Chalmers Watsons edited the Encyclopaedia Medica, a 15 volume work, the first edition of which appeared in 1900. As well as helping edit the encyclopaedia, she had contributed an article on the feeding of invalids. She published a further two books with her husband, Food and Feeding in Health and Disease (1910) and The Book of Diet (1913). While the couple ran their practice, Chalmers Watson also worked at the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children. which later became Bruntsfield Hospital; she had been appointed to the medical staff in 1900, eventually becoming a senior physician. =Women's Army Auxiliary Corps= The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in France during the First World War. From the beginning of the First World War, women in Scotland typically worked in the nursing or munitions industries, occasionally running field hospitals and soup canteens or driving ambulances with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, which was established in 1907. By 1916, Chalmers Watson advocated for the creation of a corps of women volunteers who could undertake additional ancillary, non-combatant duties. At this time, Chalmers Watson's brother, Brigadier-General Sir Auckland Geddes, was the Director of Recruiting at the War Office, and he arranged for Chalmers Watson to meet with Sir Nevil Macready, the adjutant-general, to set out her proposal for the formation of the corp. On 7 July 1917, the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was formally instituted; Macready had requested that Chalmers Watson be its first Chief Controller and senior officer some months earlier, in February 1917. Selecting as her deputy Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, Chalmers Watson raised a corps of 40,850 women, of whom some 17,000 served overseas (although never more than 8,777 at a time). She regarded the creation of the WAAC as \\"an advance of the women's movement and... a national advance\\" and noted that for the first time, \\"women [had] a direct and officially recognised share in the task of our armies both at home and overseas.\\" In a recruiting pamphlet she wrote that \\"this is the great opportunity for every strong, healthy and active woman not already employed on work of national importance to offer her services to her country.\\" Although Chalmers Watson had to resign from the head of the WAAC in 1918 when one of her sons fell ill after an appendectomy, her efforts had already set a precedent that would be followed ‚Äì and expanded upon ‚Äì during the Second World War, laying the foundation for the Auxiliary Territorial Service, which became the Women's Royal Army Corps in 1949. Her work organising the WAAC was recognised by the award of a CBE in 1917, and her portrait was included in the National War Museum, London (now the Imperial War Museum), at the time of her death. =Politics= WAACs marching in London, 1918 Chalmers Watson was a noted suffragette, and while her own involvement did not include the militant actions of some of her peers, her support was not passive. During the establishment of the WAAC, she had concentrated on improving the levels of pay offered to the women taking over men's jobs. She would also serve as a doctor for the suffragette prisoners in Perth and had been a director of the Time and Tide Publishing Company. When the Representation of the People Act, 1918 gave the vote to 8.4 million women, Chalmers Watson became the first president of the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association. She was closely involved in the establishment of the Women's United Services Club in Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh, and at the time of her death in 1936, she was its president. Chalmers Watson was also one of the founders of the Child Assault Protest Committee (1920). In The Scotsman's obituary notice, published 8 August 1936, the response to her death was said to be a \\"stunned reaction\\" characterised by \\"the inevitable thought ‚Äì What are all the women's organisations in Edinburgh going to do without her? Societies, hospitals, Queen's Nurses Boards were upheld by her support and inspired by her practical energy.\\" =Later career= In her later career, Chalmers Watson became a member of the Advisory Committee on Nutrition and was an expert member on the Scottish Board of Health's Consultative Councils throughout the 1920s She was also a member of the Standing Committee on Scottish Health Sciences, having been appointed by the Department of Health for Scotland in 1933. The Cathcart Report issued by the Committee on Scottish Health Services has been seen as a model for post- war British medical services and helped lay the foundation for a unique Scottish health system. In June 1935, she was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee on Diet by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland; the aim of this committee was described as being \\"to inquire into the facts, quantitative and qualitative, in relation to the diet of the people, and report as to any changes therein which appear desirable in the light of modern advances in the knowledge of nutrition.\\" Her political desire to further the cause of women in medicine saw her take on a number of prominent positions towards the end of her life, and she was president of both the Scottish Women's Medical Association and the British Women's Medical Federation, having been elected to the latter some months before her death. =Fenton Barns= In 1923, Chalmers Watson and her husband inherited the Fenton Barns farm in North Berwick, East Lothian, where they began breeding a herd of tuberculin-tested cattle. Eventually, they established a model dairy which was responsible for the production of certified milk. The farm became renowned across Europe for its pioneering experiments focused specifically on improving the quality of milk and the production and distribution of certified milk for the safer feeding of children; these included issues surrounding the irradiation of milk, its feeding to premature infants, and the production of milk with a more digestible curd. Death and legacy Chalmers Watson died at the home of her brother, Sir Auckland Geddes, in Frensham, Rolvenden, Kent, on 7 August 1936; she was staying with her brother to recuperate from an illness with which she had been coping for some time. Some months after her death, the relative absence of any commemoration was commented on in a letter to The Scotsman by a T.M. Chapman, who asked, > There now exists, to her and to our unceasing honour, a worthy and > beneficent memorial to Dr. Elsie Inglis, which will always keep her name > fragrant to numberless sufferers. Why should not something on at least > similar lines be devised to commemorate the admittedly grand labours of Mona > Geddes? Why not, even should a hospital or a ward be beyond reach, establish > one or more beds in her honour‚Äîshe was on the Board of Management of the > Royal Infirmary‚Äîor else a bursary or research scholarship for women medical > students? So would her memory be kept green and her indomitable courage be a > constant inspiration to many earnest workers who‚Äîlike me‚Äîmight have very > little chance of ever seeing a bronze plaque in a club hall Three years later, this oversight was to some extent redressed when Chalmers Watson's co-Chief Controller at the WAAC, Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, formally opened a gateway to the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital commemorating Chalmers Watson's life and services to medicine and her country. A Scotsman article about the opening ceremony noted that immediately after the ribbon was cut, the gateway was \\"consecrated\\" by the birth of a baby during an air raid warning; the article quoted Gwynne-Vaughan as saying, \\"In the old days, a new building was consecrated by the building in of a human being who had therefore died. This was consecrated yesterday by the birth of a baby!\\" References Category:1872 births Category:1936 deaths Category:19th-century Scottish medical doctors Category:20th-century Scottish medical doctors Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Scottish suffragists Category:History of medicine in the United Kingdom Category:Disease-related deaths in England Category:Presidents of the Medical Women's Federation Category:Scottish women medical doctors Category:Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps officers Category:20th-century women physicians Category:19th-century women physicians ","title":"Mona Chalmers Watson"},{"id":"45619169","text":"Rafael Ferrer may refer to: * Rafael Ferrer (artist) (born 1933), Puerto Rican artist * Rafael Ferrer (Jesuit) (1570‚Äì1611), Spanish Jesuit missionary and explorer ","title":"Rafael Ferrer"},{"id":"45619178","text":"Kista may refer to: * Kista, a district in Stockholm, Sweden * Kista borough, a borough in Stockholm, Sweden * Kista metro station in Stockholm, Sweden * Kista Galleria, a shopping mall in Stockholm, Sweden * Kista Science Tower, a skyscraper in Stockholm, Sweden * Kista Torn, a pair of apartment buildings in Stockholm, Sweden * Kista Nunatak in Antarctica * Kista Rock, an island off the Antarctic coast * Kista Strait, a strait in Mac.

Early years  In 1915 Hess exhibited his first works - drawings, tempera and engravings - at the \\"Turn und Taxishof Galerie\\" in Innsbruck. During World War One Hess fought on the French front at the Somme and Ardennes. After the war, from 1919 to 1924 he attended the Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Munich, in the class of Prof. C. Becker-Gundhal. In 1920 Hess attended the first collective exhibition \\"Ausstellung Junger M√ºnchner - Graphische Kunstwerkst√§tten\\" in Munich presented by George Jacob Wolf. In the following 1921 exhibition \\"Ausstellung Junger M√ºnchner\\" at the Gem√§lde Galerie Sct. Martinus, also in Munich, he exhibited works alongside pieces by Florian Bosch, Adolf Hartmann, Siegfried K√ºhnel, Georg Liebhardt, Josef Nickl, Eugen Siegler, Bernhard Therhorst and the sculptors Lothar Dietz and Benno Miller. After his sister Emma moved to Sicily in 1924, Hess made frequent trips to Italy, drawing inspiration from the colour and mediterranean light that he poured into his art.  Christian Hess and the Juryfreie  In 1928 he became close to Max Beckmann until his exile. Hess participated in the \\"Sommer Ausstellung des Deutschen K√ºnstler Verbandes AUFBAU - E. V.\\" in Munich and some of his paintings were shown in Berlin. In 1929 he joined the \\"Juryfreie\\" movement, becoming its leader until his ban in 1933 by the National Socialist regime. In \\"Aus meinem K√ºnstnotizbuch\\", the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein wrote: \\"Juryfreie reveals itself as a prominent artistic group... I notice Christian Hess, Josef Scharl, Fritz Burkhardt, Grassmann, Panizza and sculptors such as Spengler and Zeh\\". Art magazines published Hess's works: the Lipsian \\"Cicerone\\" published the painting \\"Am Strand\\" (On the beach); the Munich magazine \\"Jugend\\", official voice of the \\"Jugendstil\\" movement, published on the cover of the April 1930 issue the oil painting \\"Fischer mit roter Weste\\" (Fisherman with red jacket), central part of a triptych shown at the Secession exhibition. In the same year the catalogue \\"Zweijahrbuch\\" (1929‚Äì30) presented by the critic Hans Eckstein, with essays by Franz Rho, Oskar Maria Graf and Wolfgang Petzet, published the paintings \\"Neptun\\" and \\"Matrosen\\" produced in Messina. Hess frescoed the thermal bath in Oeynhausen (Westphalia). \\"Jugend\\" reproduced \\"Am Wasser\\", the central part of a triptych shown at the June Secession exhibition. On June 6, 1931, in the Munich Glaspalast fire, works by Hess and other artists were burnt. For the \\"Juryfreie\\" artists an extraordinary exhibition was organised in the German Museum. In the same year Hess was in Rome with his friend Karl Hofer. Back in Germany there began a movement of painters, sculptors and architects and in the exhibition \\"Bildhauer Maler Architekt\\" Hess presented cartoons for the frescoes of a cinema with sound in Breslau. 1932 was still a year of great artistic vitality. With the \\"Juryfreien\\" Hess exhibited the painting \\"Wartesaal III Klasse in Bologna\\" (Monspreis London - Opus 30) and sculptures in the Munich \\"Lenbach Galerie\\" and in D√ºsseldorf. A season of exhibitions followed with the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund in Berlin, Nuremberg, Koenigsberg, Danzig and Rostock.  The years of exile  The artistic ostracism practised by Nazism moved Hess to a voluntary exile. In 1933, after the dissolution of Jurifreie, regarded by the regime as a \\"Bolshevik cultural union\\", he moved to Sicily. The following year he married the Swiss citizen Cecile Faesy with whom he left for Switzerland. There he had to work in difficult conditions because since 1935 Germans were not welcome. He ran some theatre direction, scenography and made some puppet engravings. Through some friends he was able to sell some unsigned paintings but in 1936 went back to Sicily with the wife that he divorced some months later. From friends still in Germany and Austria he knew that the political situation was worsening. He studied new techniques but depression brought him to the edge of suicide. Supported by his sister Emma he found the energy to go back north. In 1938 he was in Switzerland again, in Liestal, in the house of his close friend Jurg Spiller but he did not receive a residence permit. Then he moved to Germany where the cultural and artistic life was under the strict control of the regime. In 1939 he was hosted in Chiemsee by his friend Franz Saverius Gebhardt-Westerbuchberg. There he was able to paint and model sculptures. In Oberw√∂ssen, Bavaria, he frescoed the walls of a restaurant owned by the widow of his friend, the sculptor Oskar Zeh, who had committed suicide in 1935 in Munich. His health worsened. Seriously ill, he spent 1941 in Schwabing Hospital, then in Planegg Asylum. Once he was discharged, he went to the Tyrol, first to Axams and Innsbruck, then to Grinzens and to Zirl, where he painted frescos in the municipal offices. In 1942 he was back in Innsbruck. The Tyrolean Artistic Union (\\"Der Landsleiter der Reichskammer der Bildenden K√ºnste beim Landskulturwalter Gau Tirol Voralberg\\") provided him with an atelier. After his last hospitalization he died on November 26, 1944, during an air raid on Innsbruck, where he is buried, in the Westfriedhof.

With her research in the Rotterdam study, Breteler identified a link between life-style factors, vascular and brain diseases, and has been highly successful at identifying links between epidemiological data and brain scan information. At the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Breteler is establishing the Rhineland Study, a prospective cohort study of 30,000 individuals that aims to identify causes and preclinical multimodal biomarker profiles of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases and to investigate normal and pathological brain structure and function over the adult life course. Honours and awards In 1998 Breteler received a fellowship of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences for her work on vascular factors in Alzheimer's disease, and in 2003 a prestigious VICI grant of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research for her prospective population-based neuro-imaging studies. In July 2012 Breteler received the \\"2012 Bengt Winblad Lifetime Achievement Award\\", which is presented annually by the US-American Alzheimer's Association at the \\"Alzheimer‚Äôs Association International Conference\\" to honor researchers who have made extraordinary contributions to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease research. In 2012 Breteler spoke at the Falling Walls conference in Berlin, according to the official Falling Walls organization to \\"focus attention on a new age of health research aimed at optimizing brain function and quality of life throughout the entire life span\\". She has also taken up various roles to advice on public health policy, e.g. as speaker at the 2014 \\"The future of Europe is science\\" conference organized by the European Commission and opened by Jos√© Manuel Barroso. In 2015 Breteler became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Coptic people are an ethnoreligious group that form the largest Christian group in Libya, the Coptic Orthodox Church in the country having an estimated 60,000 adherents. The Coptic Church is known to have historical roots in Libya long before the Arabs (and Islam) advanced westward from Egypt into Libya. A part of the community is made up of immigrants from Egypt (see Copts in Egypt). Population The Coptic population is estimated to number 60,000. The Copts are the largest Christian denomination, followed by 40,000 Roman Catholics and a small number of Anglicans. They are present in all three major regions. History =Early history= Historically speaking, Christianity spread to the Pentapolis in North Africa from Egypt; Synesius of Cyrene (370-414), bishop of Ptolemais, received his instruction at Alexandria in both the Catechetical School and the Museion, and he entertained a great deal of reverence and affection for Neoplatonist Hypatia, whose classes he had attended. Synesius was consecrated by Theophilus of Alexandria in 410. Since the Council of Nicaea in 325, Cyrenaica had been recognized as an ecclesiastical province of the See of Alexandria, in accordance with the ruling of the Nicaean Fathers. The Pope of Alexandria to this day includes the Pentapolis in his title as an area within his jurisdiction. The Coptic congregations in several countries were under the ancient Eparchy of the Western Pentapolis, which was part of the Coptic Orthodox Church for centuries until the 13th century.History of the Coptic Church, by Father Menassa Youhanna =Modern= In 1971 Pope Shenouda III reinstated it as part of the Eparchy of Metropolitan Bishop Pachomius, Metropolitan of the Holy Metropolis of Beheira (Thmuis & Hermopolis Parva), (Buto), Mariout (Mareotis), Marsa Matruh (Paraetonium), (Apis), Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Metropolis of Libya: (Livis, Marmarica, Darnis & Tripolitania) & Titular Metropolitan Archbishop of the Great and Ancient Metropolis of Pentapolis: (Cyren), (Appollonia), (Ptolemais), (Berenice) and (Arsinoe). This was one among a chain of many restructuring of several eparchies by Pope Shenouda III, while some of them were incorporated into the jurisdiction of others, especially those who were within an uncovered region or which were part of a Metropolis that became extinct, or by dividing large eparchies into smaller more manageable eparchies. This was also a part of the restructuring of the Church as a whole. Churches They are currently three Coptic Orthodox Churches in Libya: one in Tripoli, Libya (Saint Mark's), one in Benghazi, Libya (Saint Antonios ‚Äî two priests), and one in Misrata, Libya (Saint Mary and Saint George).Coptic Orthodox Church Listings for Libya, p. 136 Anti-Coptic sentiment In February 2014, seven Coptic Christians were dragged out of their houses in the middle of the night, then murdered on a beach, east of Benghazi. A group of Copts were kidnapped on separate occasions in December 2014 and January 2015, then murdered by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

This site provided the initial space for her son Coxsone Dodd to begin playing music for customers, a practice that eventually led to his founding Studio One and becoming one of the island's key musical forces. When her son was away buying records to play on the sound system, Darlington set up and ran the sound system herself, and thus can be named one of Jamaica's first sound system operators, and a force in the development of ska, rocksteady and reggae music. Darlington also ran a record store in Jamaica, was often present at Studio One recording studios and involved in producing music in the early 1960s. Darlington was nicknamed \\"Nanny\\" after the famed female leader Nanny of the Maroons. Biography Darlington was a descendant of the Jamaican Maroons, communities descended from escaped Africans who fought for and established free communities in the Jamaican interior. In the 1950s she owned a food shop whose customers were interested in hearing the latest R&B; tunes from the US. Her son Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd began to meet this need with a turntable, an amplified sound system and a collection of records, and eventually the space expanded into a bar with a canteen in the back at which Darlington would cook. However, whenever Dodd went on trips to purchase music, he would leave Nanny in charge of the show, running the technical and creative side of the Downbeat sound system. This made her \\"the first female sound system operator\\". Dodd later said of her contribution to music that \\"She is the founding mother of everything, for without her nothing would‚Äôve happened\\".Heather Augustyn.

MIT Museum calls her \\"one of the most important female architects in the Northeast during the 1960s and 1970s\\". Early life and education Born in New York City to an affluent family descended from leading figures in the American Revolution, Stevens attended Smith College, where she received a degree in philosophy in 1949. She was active in the civil rights movement during her undergraduate years, presaging a lifelong commitment to social and civic activism. In 1950, she married William Vaughn Moody Fawcett. Stevens entered the architecture program at MIT in 1953, graduating with an SBArch in 1956. Influences at MIT included Alvar Aalto, Eero Saarinen, Kevin Lynch, and Buckminster Fuller, who was also a family friend. Other influences included the historian Samuel Eliot Morison, a relative and father figure.  Work  Stevens worked for The Architects' Collaborative (TAC) before launching a practice with MIT faculty member Thomas McNulty in 1956, whom she married after her 1958 divorce. Stevens and McNulty practiced together until 1969, when they founded i Press Inc., a publisher of books on architecture and urban theory, which Stevens directed until its dissolution in 1978. Stevens also founded Design Guild in 1975, a collaborative architecture practice focusing on adaptive reuse and sustainability.  Significant projects  Stevens is best known for the Lincoln House (1965), which she designed with Tom McNulty for their own family on a rural site in Lincoln, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. The curvilinear concrete structure, which is often called the first exposed-concrete and glass house in the United States, won international attention. Stevens lived in the house until 1978, when she and McNulty sold it to Sarah Caldwell, the renowned opera director. Stevens and McNulty divorced soon after. The house was widely published, but was demolished in 2001 after Caldwell sold the property.

Later life  After the death of Jesse Fillman in 1991, a lawyer whom she married in 1978, Stevens disbanded Design Guild to pursue studies in music composition at Longy School of Music. In 2007, she donated her archives to MIT.

Cao's work, which includes video, performance, and digital media, examines the daily life of Chinese citizens born after the Cultural Revolution. Some of her work is owned and displayed by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Her work explores China's widespread internet culture as well as the borders between dreams and reality. Cao has captured the rapid social and cultural transformation of contemporary China, highlighting the impact of foreign influences from the USA and Japan.  Career  = Early years = Cao received her B.F.A. from Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in 2001. During her time there, Cao presented her first performance work, The Little Spark (1998), set in the affiliated Middle School of Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. She then created her first film, Imbalance 257 (1999), which displayed the current generation‚Äôs penchant for rejecting deep-rooted Chinese traditions. One year later, Cao produced another video work, Chain Reaction (2000). She described the film as \\"a view of schizophrenia\\", analyzing \\"the power of evil in human nature.\\" After graduating in 2001, Cao produced several notable works, including Burners (2003), a two-minute video focusing on the theme of human desire. The artist noted that the short film \\"demonstrates the presence of privacy in soft porn and parodies the notion of male narcissism.\\" Cao focused on the modern paradox of China‚Äôs rapid economic growth and social marginalization, producing the 2003 experimental documentary San Yuan Li (‰∏âÂÖÉÈáå) with Ou Ning. Shot in a rural village nestled in the industrial skyline of Guangzhou, the film examines the effects of development on traditional agrarian lifestyles. The work was commissioned for and exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 2013. In the photo series and video work COSPlayers (2004), Cao depicts Chinese teenagers cosplaying as anime characters in the industrial landscape of Guangzhou. The Internet‚Äôs power to create subcultures across China influenced the artist greatly. In 2006, Cao produced her Hip Hop series (2006), an expos√© of the underground influence of American hip hop in China. = Whose Utopia (2006) = The 2006 film Whose Utopia is one of Cao's most pivotal works. It explores the contrast between the everyday experiences and the aspirations of assembly line workers at a light bulb factory in the Pearl River Delta region of China. The film opens with shifting views of an automated production line factory workers performing menial tasks. The artist interviews various workers, asking them their reasons for working at the plant. These conversations then introduce a series of performances. Each performance is a chance for the individual to showcase their dreams, fantasies and talents apart from their everyday life. Cao Fei explains, the film is \\"not about expos√© and not about political correctness.\\" Rather, she aims to look at the lives of workers from multiple perspectives. For the worker, the performance is an opportunity to escape and reinvent oneself against the conformist backdrop of the factory. Cao likens the practice to creating an avatar. By using montage, music and imagery, she presents a thorough understanding of contemporary Chinese society. In recent years, Chinese migrant workers have flocked to factories to take part in the hastily growing economy. Whose Utopia suggests a perpetual disparity between the confinement of an industrial lifestyle and the individual utopia.\\"EPISODE: 'Fantasy'\\" PBS. 2009. This work is currently owned by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. = Later work = Cao's art has extended to the virtual world in her three-part video i.Mirror (2007), where she documented the life of her avatar, China Tracy, and her romantic engagement with another avatar, Hug Yue in the virtual world Second Life. The videos feature China Tracy and Hug Yue in both realistic and fantastic locations, conversational excerpts, and the revelation of \\"First Life\\" identities. In 2007, Cao planned and developed RMB City, a virtual city in Second Life. Launched in 2008, and open to the public since January 2009, RMB City is a platform for experimental creative activities, one in which Cao and her collaborators use different mediums to test the boundaries between virtual and physical existence. Collaborators were for example Uli Sigg, wo received a virtual city hall or Rem Koolhaas. Within this virtual city art institutions could organize online biennales or similar virtual gatherings. RMB: A Second Life Planning By China Tracy was acquired by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for its contemporary art collection in 2008. From 2009 to 2015, Cao produced the works RMB City Opera (2009), East Wind (2011), Haze and Fog (2013), and Rumba II: Nomad (2015). In 2014, Cao presented a show and film entitled La Town at Lombard Fried Gallery. The show included the film and photographs from the set of the filming of La Town: The New Desert. The film depicts a world disrupted by industrialization. It begins in an elaborate, handmade, miniature city with a post-apocalyptic scene of a destroyed McDonald's restaurant on top of a small apartment building while figurines mill about in the rubble of wrecked cars and buildings. In 2018, Cao filmed Prison Architect in Tai Kwun, Hong Kong, formerly a colonial police and prison complex and now a non-profit art centre. The film was inspired by the novelist and curator Hu Fang's short story The Consolation of Imprisonment, which led her to contemplate \\"how we live with the notion of 'imprisonment'‚Äîimprisonment in a physical cell, 'non-prison' prisons, and a prison transformed into a cultural centre\\".

This case, along with the GAL case, greatly contributed to the defeat of the PSOE in the 1996 general election. Upon initiation of prosecution for his criminal activities, Luis Rold√°n escaped from Spain in 1994. He surrendered in 1995 at the airport in Bangkok. Between 1996 and 1998 he was tried in a court of Madrid. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison for embezzlement, bribery, tax evasion and fraud, the Supreme Court increased to 31 years. He was from February 1995 in the female prison of Brieva (√Åvila) In 2005 he was allowed out of prison to work in an intermediate regime between the second and third degree. Political career A long time of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and of the Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores trade-union, Rold√°n presented himself as he holding a BSc (Industrial Engineering) from the University of Zaragoza. journalistic research proved that this degree was a fake. After the socialist victory in the 1982 general elections Rold√°n was named he was Govennment's Delegate in Navarre. Position he held until 1986 when, he became the first civilian to command the Civil Guard, (Spain's gendarmerie force).

Under his direction the Civil Guard saw the appearance of an internal protest movement, composed mostly of enlisted personnel and NCOs, seeking to better the working conditions and the de-militarisation and democratisation of the Corps, forming a clandestine union of Civil Guardsmen. =Corruption= While he was director, defective Filipino-made bullets of 9 mm Parabellum were purchased which injured military personnel. In 1993 the newspaper Diario 16 published the first suspicions concerning excessive increase of the heritage of Luis Rold√°n, which eventually led to his dismissal on December 3 of that year. Rold√°n fled the country in early 1994 when it was discovered that he had used his office to amass a fortune through fraudulent means, resulting in the resignation of Interior Minister Antoni Asunci√≥n, responsible for monitoring Rold√°n, as a consequence.Antonio Asunci√≥n, el ministro que supo dimitir en el 'felipismo' in elmundo.es During his time missing, Rold√°n sent letters admitting partial guilt and accusing other Interior Ministry high-ranking members of having received extra money from the fondos reservados (Spanish for reserved funds) theoretically destined to finance the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. Among those he accused was former minister Jos√© Luis Corcuera, but also PM Gonz√°lez of 'being aware of everything'.

In 2005 he was allowed out of prison to work. Judges have successfully raised 1,646,845 euros in civil procedure seizure of bank accounts and the auction of some of their properties seized in Spain.

In the same survey, 16,255 Canadians said they belonged to the Coptic Orthodox church. Of this number, 12,645 were immigrants and 3,365 were born in Canada.

A Fellow and Past President of the American Society of Landscape Architects, she has completed a wide range of national and international projects in the US, Europe, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and Bolivia. Her work includes national and local public parks, urban open spaces and master plans, cultural landscapes, college and institutional campuses, public art installations, corporate landscapes, and ecological master plans. Barton has received an Individual Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rome Prize in Landscape Architecture from the American Academy in Rome. She was featured in the 2012 documentary, Women in the Dirt.  Early life and training  Cheryl Barton grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania. She received a bachelor's degree from Bucknell University in Fine Arts and Geology, and studied architecture and photography at the Boston Architectural Center. She received a master's degree in Landscape Architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  Design Influences & Philosophy  Barton cites witnessing the devastation of Lake Erie as a young child as influential in her decision to pursue landscape architecture. While on a Charles Eliot Traveling Fellowship from Harvard University, Barton visited Temple of the Sun in Incayllacta, Bolivia; there she realized that the landscape \\"is a powerful medium of expression, a medium that can transform place and bridge cultures, and in so doing it can transform human values.\\" Barton also discusses the influence of the gardens of 17th century French landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre, of which she says: 'To see something deliberate and controlled juxtaposed with the unmanicured enhances the perception‚Äîand, I think, the appreciation or \\"seeing\\" of each. That is an experience I use constantly in my work: strong juxtapositions of the \\"natural\\" with \\"cultural interventions,\\" which make people see, appreciate and, hopefully, care for their environments.' Barton develops her philosophy of the integration of design and ecology and \\"landscape urbanism\\" further in a Boston Globe op-ed published in 2003 while she was a juror for the Rose Kennedy Greenway design competition: \\"Parks can be instrumental in solving larger urban and ecological or infrastructure problems, such as storm drainage, air quality, water supply, and the demolition (or construction) of expressways. If grounded in a regional ecology, parks can simultaneously accomplish social and environmental goals‚Ä¶ Parks are expected to be much more than they have been at any time in the past. They are layered in meaning and richly stratified in function‚Äîsomething more than that experienced only through our eyes. They are powerful vehicles for reconnecting us to the land and to each other, and for enriching our very urban existence.\\" In an interview with the Landscape Architecture Foundation, Barton outlines two intentions driving her recent work: a campaign Barton calls \\"Dirt is the New Water,\\" which focuses on the \\"critical interrelationship between the soil and water that support the visible landscape\\"; and a concept for the long-term management of a site that Barton has called \\"Site Commissioning.\\"  Career  One of Barton's early jobs was in the office of modernist landscape architect Dan Kiley, whom she cites as influential in the development of her design philosophy and use of landscape intervention to heighten environmental awareness. Later positions Barton filled included Director of Landscape Architecture at Gresham Smith & Partners in Nashville, TN, from 1980‚Äì1985, and Principal and Design Studio Director of EDAW in San Francisco (now owned by AECOM) from 1986-1993.  Office of Cheryl Barton  In 1994 Barton founded her own firm, Office of Cheryl Barton in San Francisco, CA. Some of the firm's more well-known projects include landscapes at the Stanford Law School, The Gap Headquarters in San Francisco, the Rosie the Riveter Memorial, and Cavallo Point, a renovation of Fort Baker in Marin County, CA. The firm has increasingly become known for its focus on green infrastructure and landscape urbanism. In its Cavallo Point project, for example, the firm employed a nontraditional approach to planting design through harvesting seeds from the site which were then propagated in a local nursery, and planted as part of a landscape restoration plan. Barton has often collaborated with artists including Elyn Zimmerman, Susan Schwartzenberg, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje Van Bruggen, Bruce Beasley, and Mark Mennin.  Professional Civic Engagement  Barton has been involved in professional and civic organizations and initiatives focused on green urbanism. She is a fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) and served as the Society's president from 1987 to 1988. She has taught Sustainable Site Planning and Landscape Design workshops at the Pacific Energy Center in San Francisco. In 2003, Barton served on the design jury for the Rose Kennedy Greenway competition in Boston, MA. Barton also serves on the Design Review Board of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Barton has been invited to speak nationally on her landscape architectural practice, with lectures at the Nevada Museum of Art and the NASA Research Park, as well as a wide range of academic institutions, including Stanford University, Pennsylvania State University, the University of San Francisco, and the University of Oregon.

She was the first woman to graduate from the McGill University School of Architecture. Her professional career was spent largely in Vancouver, where she was a senior designer with the firm Sharp, Thompson, Berwick, Pratt (later Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners). She taught at the University of British Columbia school of architecture. Biography Catherine Mary Wisnicki was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1919. She graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts in History in 1939. She then went on to obtain her Bachelor of Architecture, becoming the first woman to graduate from architecture at McGill in 1943. Early in her career, Wisnicki worked with A.J.C. Paine and Lawson & Betts. She also participated in the planning of Arvida, Qu√©bec, for the Aluminum Company of Canada (now Alcan). Right after World War II, she undertook a study of prefabricated housing for the Canadian Wooden Aircraft Company in Toronto. As an outcome of the research, she co-authored a major article on the subject of \\"prefab\\" houses with city planner E.G. Faludi in 1945. In 1945, Wisnicki registered with the Ontario Association of Architects, becoming their fourth woman member. That same year, she married Paul Wisnicki, a former aeronautical structural engineer in the Polish Air Force. In 1946, they moved to Vancouver, where she became the second female member to register with the Architectural Institute of British Columbia. Wisnicki spent most of her career in Vancouver, where she became a senior designer with firm Sharp, Thompson, Berwick, Pratt (later Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners. She worked closely with partner Ned Pratt, participating in the design of the Brooks, Saba, Gregg and Mathers residences, all considered icons of Canadian West Coast Modernism. She also worked briefly in partnership with architect John C.H. Porter to design the Daniels and Nemetz houses on the University of British Columbia Endowment Lands, which are also considered iconic. In 1963, Wisnicki began teaching part-time at the University of British Columbia's school of architecture. She joined the faculty full-time in 1969. After retiring in 1986, Wisnicki and her husband moved to Naramata, British Columbia where they designed and built an innovative passive solar house. Influence Wisnicki is a trailblazing woman in a field dominated by men. She was the first woman to graduate from McGill University's school of architecture, the fourth female member of the Ontario Association of Architects, and the second female member of the Architectural Institute of British Columbia. Along with Porter and others, Wisnicki was among a group that brought Modernist ideas to the West Coast in the postwar period. She contributed to the regional style known as West Coast Modernism or BC Modernism, characterized by a clear expression of structure (often with large wood or concrete members), and generous connections between indoor and outdoor spaces.

The province exited Iraqi government control during ISIL's Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014) when large swathes of the north of the country were captured by the militant group with the Iraqi national army quickly disintegrating in the path of its advance. In light of the sweeping gains of the militants, Nouri Al-Maliki, the Prime Minister of Iraq at that time, attempted to declare a state of emergency though the Iraqi Parliament blocked his efforts to do so. The cities of Baiji and Tikrit (Saddam Hussein's birthplace and stronghold) fell to ISIS and the group even reached the city of Samarra itself but could not wrest control of it due to the resistance it encountered by the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the Shi'ite paramilitaries. Both the United States and Iran intervened in order to stem the tide against ISIS and were relatively successful in the breaking of the Siege of Amirli in which both parties played a significant role (however they did not and still do not officially cooperate or coordinate their respective efforts with one another). Although in the First Battle of Tikrit ISIS consolidated their control over the city and strongly repulsed any attempts at its recapture by Iraqi security forces and militia contingents. After months of preparatory maneuvers and intelligence gathering, a force of over 23,000 allied fighters including the Iraqi armed forces, Shi'ite private militias and Sunni tribal militias began an offensive in early March to encircle ISIL and entrap their fighters in Tikrit and its environs in the Second Battle of Tikrit. The operation met with decisive success, with all the ISIL militants being encircled and subsequently killed or captured in Tikrit.  ISIL gains in 2014  In the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq back in 2003 the insurgency in the Sunni areas of the country took on a distinct Islamist nature of their own. After the departure of the U.S. from Iraq the insurgency gained some long-lost momentum and the casualty statistics started to increase once again. However it was not until the advent of the Syrian Civil War that the instability created in a neighbouring country provided the fertile ground for the group formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq to blossom into a formidable and distinct rebel-faction strong enough to eventually turn on the lesser rebel groups and easily expel them from eastern Syria and soon establish a state with a de facto capital in Raqqah. This enabled it to launch a formidable assault on what would prove to be an irresolute and demoralised Iraqi army from a secure base across the Syrian-Iraqi border. The result was a devastating collapse in the military infrastructure of the Iraqi government with entire divisions throwing down their weapons and fleeing ISIS without a fight as happened in the Fall of Mosul.  Allied progress  Despite recapturing both Baiji (only temporarily) and Amirli from ISIS, the Iraqi government was still struggling to drive out the militants who seized large swathes of the country in the face of the crumbling Iraqi Army. The most recent concerted effort is the Second Battle of Tikrit where the combined forces of the allies (with extensive military & intelligence support from Iran) are attempting to encircle the Jihadists in Tikrit by capturing Al-Dour and Al-Alam in the south and the north respectively, in order to cut them off and begin a siege against ISIS-occupied Tikrit. According to numerous sources the city of Al-Dour has already fallen and operation have commenced against Al-Alam in the north. ISIS has sent reinforcements to Tikrit from other parts of its self-proclaimed caliphate further north, where it came under attack on Monday from Kurdish forces around the oil-rich-city of Kirkuk. The advance against ISIS however has been quite slow due to the extensive use of asymmetric tactics such as planting IEDs along routes of advance, the use of suicide bombers, tactically placed snipers etc. all of which has prompted the Iraqi officers to progress with particular caution against the enemy in order to minimise casualties as well as to guard against unnecessary civilian deaths as Isis fighters are said to be holding \\"an unspecified number of civilians as human shields\\" in Tikrit and other cities. An indication of the intensity and volume to which these tactics are being utilised by ISIS is given by the report mentioning over 382 IEDs by 11 of March. An Iraqi major general has been quoted as saying \\"We don't want to be rushed because we want to avoid casualties. Tikrit is sealed off from all sides.\\" At least 50 ISIS fighters have turned themselves into the allied forces' hands in the town of Al-Dour on 8 March. On the following day, 9 March, the town of al-Alam was captured by the allied forces and completely secured, in effect completing the encirclement of ISIS in Tikrit. On March 11, ISIL was driven from Tikrit hospital complex in the south of the city. Despite ISIS' efforts to forestall the rapid advance of the allies on the east of the Tigris river by blowing up the bridge leading to the city over the Tigris, the allies managed to mount an aggressive push across the river and establish a bridgehead, subsequently advancing into Tikrit via the east. ISIS has been suffering heavy casualties, with reports of their dead littering the streets and with only 2,000 to 3,000 militants left to make a last stand in the city of Tikrit itself. On 25 March, the allied forces were supposed to resume their offensive, as the American-led coalition launched its first airstrikes on ISIL targets in Tikrit. That night, US aircraft carried out 17 airstrikes in the center of Tikrit, which struck an ISIL building, two bridges, three checkpoints, two staging areas, two berms, a roadblock, and a command and control facility. As a result of the US entry into the battle, most of the Shi'ite militias present pulled out of the battle on 27 March, with the exception of the Badr Organisation. On 31 March, the Iraqi security forces advanced into the city center, seizing the Salaheddin provincial government headquarters and the Tikrit hospital, as they moved towards the presidential complex. By On 2 April, the allied forces had secured nearly all of central Tikrit. where a few hundred ISIL fighters were still present. On 4 April, Iraqi forces had recaptured most of Tikrit city; however, on 5 April, it was reported that 500 ISIL fighters were still holed up in the northern Qadisiya District, with resistance from the remaining ISIL fighters persisting for another week. On 12 April 2015, the Iraqi Government declared that Tikrit was free of ISIL forces, although continued resistance would persist until 17 April, when the last 130 ISIL sleeper agents in the city were killed. Cleanup and defusing operations in the city continued, but Iraqi officials predicted that it would take at least several months to remove the estimated 5,000‚Äì10,000 IEDs left behind by ISIL in Tikrit.  Asymmetric blow- back  The continuing success of the allied forces (which are composed of mostly Shi'ite paramilitary groups, though they also contain a significant Sunni contingent), particularly in Sunni areas such as Tikrit, where ISIS has been losing a series of conventional battles, has prompted them to utilise more guerilla-like stratagems such as sending out coordinated teams of suicide-bombers to Baghdad, the capital and political nerve centre of the Iraqi government, in order to bring some pressure to bear on the allies. The strategic logic of these operations was explicated by an Iraq expert & security analyst Sajad Jiyad; \\"It's keeping the ISF on their toes. It's to let them know that they can strike anywhere, to force them to spread their forces thin. By letting off such a large series of explosions, it's sending a message that they are going to have to put their forces everywhere. It shows that ISIS can carry out these attacks at will and the ISF cannot relax its guard.\\" See also *Anbar campaign (2013‚Äì14) *Fall of Mosul *Operation Ashura *Anbar offensive (2015) *Military of ISIL *Quds Force *List of wars and battles involving ISIL *Timeline of ISIL related events References External links *How Tikrit has Changed the War - Counteroffensive in Tikrit March 2015 *Operation Inherent Resolve airstrike updates Category:Responsibility to protect Category:Conflicts in 2014 Category:Conflicts in 2015 Category:Conflicts in 2016 Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War in 2014 Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War in 2015 Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving Hezbollah Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving the United States Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving Quds Force Category:Military operations of the Iraqi Civil War involving Canada ","title":"Salahuddin campaign"},{"id":"45619601","text":"Monica Tap (born 1962 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian painter, artist and academic.

The matches between them are known as West Midlands derbies. Their stadiums, Villa Park and The Hawthorns respectively, are four miles away from each other. Both clubs have bigger rivals‚ÄîBirmingham City for the former in the Second City derby, and Wolverhampton Wanderers for the latter in the Black Country derby. A 2010 article in The Daily Telegraph ranked the rivalry between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion as the third most fierce in the region, behind the two aforementioned derbies. To a lesser extent, all of the Birmingham based teams, and Wolverhampton Wanderers have played heated matches with the other large club to the east of the Second City based within the West Midlands, Coventry City. History =Early history= Aston Villa were founded in 1874, and West Bromwich Albion four years later. The two first met on 9 December 1882, in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup: Villa hosted a 3‚Äì3 draw in front of 13,900 fans, while in the replay West Bromwich Albion won by a single goal with an attendance of 10,500. It is possible that this is the first recorded incident of football violence with Albion fans being pelted with soil from home supporters before scuffles broke out between the two sets of fans. On 3 January 1885 they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup: a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 3‚Äì0 victory for them away at Aston Villa. The first FA Cup Final between the two was in 1887, which Villa won 2‚Äì0 at Kennington Oval with goals from Archie Hunter and Dennis Hodgetts for their first FA Cup. The following year, both teams became founder members of The Football League. They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889, Villa winning 2‚Äì0 at home, and again the next week in a 3‚Äì3 draw. The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century, a 3‚Äì0 win for West Bromwich Albion in 1892 and a 1‚Äì0 win for Aston Villa in 1895. =1970s and 1980s= Tony Morley played for Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion during the 1970s and 1980s. As a Villa player, he considered matches against Albion to be vital, due to the strength of the opposition. The rivalry between the two clubs reached an intensity in the late 1970s and early 1980s: after Albion returned to the top flight under the management of Johnny Giles in 1976, both clubs regularly challenged for the league title, culminating in Villa winning the league in 1980‚Äì81. In the 10 league meetings between Albion's promotion and Villa winning the league, Albion only won once, and Villa won five times. West Bromwich Albion's Ally Robertson said that the rivalry with Villa was more important than that with Wolverhampton Wanderers at this time, as the Wolves were a comparatively weak team. Winger Tony Morley, who represented Villa and Albion in this period, said in 2013 ‚ÄúThe biggest game for Villa fans will probably always be against Blues [Birmingham City] but for us players West Brom was always the massive game...When I was at Villa both Blues and West Brom were huge games, but for the players it was probably more vital to beat West Brom because they were such a good side\\". Cyrille Regis, who also represented the two during that era, contrasted the scale of the rivalry with that of the Black Country derby: ‚ÄúThey are both big games for different reasons. Albion and Wolves are the only two teams in the Black Country so that really is a local derby with local bragging rights at stake. But, in our day, Albion versus Villa was always about being the best team in the Midlands.‚Äù =Modern= Birmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later, leaving Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion as the only West Midlands teams in England's top division and without their respective main rivals. On 7 March 2015, Aston Villa defeated West Bromwich Albion 2‚Äì0 in an FA Cup quarter-final at Villa Park, prompting a pitch invasion which was criticised by representatives of both clubs. Aston Villa were relegated in 2016, and West Bromwich Albion two years later. Both qualified for the EFL Championship play- offs in 2019, with Villa winning the semi-final on penalties after a 2‚Äì2 aggregate draw. Crossing the divide Tony Morley represented Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion in the 1970s and 1980s, winning the league and the European Cup with the former. Cyrille Regis played for both clubs in the same era, in addition to a third team in the region, Wolverhampton Wanderers. More recent players to have represented both teams include Riccardo Scimeca, James Chester, Sam Johnstone and Kevin Phillips, who left Villa for Albion in 2006 and later played for Birmingham City, and Liam Ridgewell, who also played for all three teams.

Early life and career McGill grew up in Denver, Colorado. She began playing guitar after her father witnessed her pretending to play guitar with a pool stick. He enrolled her in private lessons at age 12. In an interview with the Denver Post, McGill's mom recalled her playing guitar in the style of blues musician B. B. King. Her parents gave her the nickname of BB when she was born. When she started playing guitar, everyone kept calling her BB Queen but she didn't like the name so she changed the spelling to Bibi McGill. She played for the jazz band in school, her own punk band and the Denver Citywide Marching Band. She graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in music scoring and arranging. When she saw that there were limited opportunities in the music scene in Denver, McGill moved to Los Angeles and began playing gigs in small clubs such as the Whiskey and The Viper Room. In the late 1980s, McGill was a part of a Christian metal band called Ezra. In 1988, they released a demo titled The Choice. The band was very well known in the Denver area. Before getting the gig with Pink, she auditioned for Courtney Love and was waiting for Mick Jagger to return to the United States because he was looking for a female guitarist. She recalls in an interview with Ebony Magazine getting a call from Pink's team to perform with her on Saturday Night Live based on her notoriety from her performances in clubs around Los Angeles. She has also done modeling on the side and appeared in commercials for Heineken, Motorola and Nike.  Pink, Paulina Rubio, and La Ley (2001‚Äì2005)  In 2001, she was hired by Pink for her promotional tour and appeared with her on Saturday Night Live, Total Request Live, the Billboard Music Awards, The Tonight Show and Top of the Pops. Along with appearing in Pink's music video for Don't Let Me Get Me, she performed with her on Dick Clark's New Years Rockin' Eve to ring in the year 2002. In 2002, she went on tour with Paulina Rubio's band on Enrique Iglesias's tour that year. She also performed with her on the 1st annual Los Premios MTV Latinoamerica previously known as the MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamerica where she performed a cover of the KISS song, \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" with Rubio. From 2003-2005, McGill toured with the Chilean Rock group La Ley. She performed the songs Hombre and Aqui at the Vina del Mar International Song Festival in 2005.  Beyonc√© and Suga Mamas (2006‚Äì2014)  After getting tired of the physical demands of touring, she decided to give it up and commit to living a peaceful life. In 2006, pop recording artist Beyonc√© was looking for an all -female band to empower women. A member of Beyonce's team called McGill's father who was a barber at the time and has cut his hair for years. He called her to encourage her to go to the audition. The team member heard about McGill through her father and recommended her when Beyonc√© did a worldwide press release for auditions. McGill first told her dad no but then regretted the decision and decided to go to tell him that she went. McGill got the gig during a call back after the first audition for Beyonc√©'s 10-piece, all-female band, the Suga Mamas in 2006 as lead guitarist, later becoming musical director for the Beyonc√© Experience and I Am...World Tour. With Beyonc√©'s band she has toured around the world in four of Beyonc√©'s tours, The Beyonc√© Experience (2007), The I Am...World Tour (2009-2010), Mrs. Carter World Tour (2013-2014), and the On The Run Tour (2014) with Beyonc√© and Jay-Z. She also played in three specials: I Am...Yours live at the Wynn Las Vegas (2009), Live At Roseland Ballroom (2011) and Beyonce Live in Atlantic City (2012). While playing for Beyonce, she performed at various awards shows, TV shows and variety shows such as Good Morning America, the Today show, the Grammys, American Music Awards, World Music Awards, The Oprah Winfrey Show and the BET Awards. McGill has also performed with Beyonce at the White House for President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party and also played at various festivals such as the Glastonbury Festival in 2011. McGill's has had some of her most memorable solos during the Beyonce era. On the Beyonc√© Experience and I Am...World Tour, she performed a solo during Freakum Dress and was known for the phrase \\"Bibi Take Me Higher\\" after Beyonc√© shouted it before her solo. McGill's Freakum dress solo is known for its Randy Rhoads style. She has also done solos for If I Were A Boy and I Care. In 2013, at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2013, Bibi performed a \\"pyrotechnic guitar solo\\" where fireworks shot out of her Randy Rhoads signature Jackson guitar. The pyrotechnic stunt was performed during the song Crazy In Love. The solo went on to become the greatest and most notable solo of McGill's career and was praised by many including Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone Magazine calling the performance a \\"ready-made obligatory-Slash cameo guitar solo. Along with the Beyonc√© gig itself, the Super Bowl also gave McGill even more mainstream attention. Beyonc√©'s halftime show became the fourth most watched halftime show with 110.8 million viewers after Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime show which was watched by 112.5 million viewers, Bruno Mars' Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show with 115.3 million viewers and Katy Perry's Super Bowl XLIX halftime show with 118.5 million viewers. McGill received a lot of positive attention from both social media and music critics for the solo. McGill reprised her pyrotechnic solo on Beyonc√©'s Mrs. Carter Show World Tour that same year.  Style, influences and instruments  McGill is known for her aggressive, funky and soulful rock style of guitar playing that has been often compared to Jimi Hendrix and Randy Rhoads. She grew up listening to Earth, Wind, and Fire and The Isley Brothers and went to see both bands in concert with her family. Once she branched out into rock, she listened to Led Zeppelin, Heart, The Eagles, Black Sabbath, and Iron Maiden. McGill has listed Randy Rhoads as her main influence for her style and is her all-time favorite guitarist. Along with her guitar playing style, McGill is also known for her signature Afro and tattoos which has made her stand out in her performances. The look also helped her get a lot more gigs because she stood out and brought attention. McGill stated in an interview with Curlynikki that first became inspired to wear an afro when she wanted something lower maintenance and less costly. McGill takes a lot of pride in her natural hair. She said that it makes her feel free and it feels good to know that it is her own texture. She said that her fro has also raised her confidence. Her artistic interests inspired her to get tattoos. McGill got her first tattoo at age 17 and continued from there. McGill described her tattoos as very personal. They include a Chinese Dragon, a scorpion for her zodiac sign of Scorpio, a female samurai which represents strength, a Japanese coy fish which represents peace and tranquility. One arm is in full color and has Japanese imagery and the other is black and white with Polynesian tribal tattoos. McGill stated in an interview with Curlynikki that they are inspired by creativity, art, images, and ideas that she thought were beautiful and meaningful. McGill has been sponsored by Gibson guitars and has used Gibson Les Pauls throughout her career from 2001-2013. She is also known for playing a Gibson SG standard with a Stetsbar Tremolo system while playing for Pink, and Flying V. In 2013, she played a Randy Rhoads Jackson signature at both the Super Bowl and Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. Currently, McGill uses Japanese FGN, Fender, and ESP guitars. She also uses Line 6 mod amps live and Quilter Amps and analog pedals in the studio. In 2017, McGill began a sponsorship by D'Angelico guitars.  Bibi Kale Chips  In 2011, McGill was inspired to start her own line of organic, gluten free, vegan Kale Chips when growing her own food in her garden. She had a hard time finding kale chips in her area and decided to make her own but the recipes that she came by were not interesting to her. Her recipe included cashews, red peppers, and spices. Her method of preparing the chips included dehydration to keep the nutritional value and ingredients. She shared them with her friends and Beyonc√© bandmates and they loved it. She booked a commercial kitchen and started selling them in local Portland stores and online. McGill is the CEO of Bibi Food Enterprises .  Yoga, wellness, music and business ventures (2015‚Äìpresent)  After McGill's last tour with Beyonc√©, the On The Run Tour in 2014, McGill's contract with her ended and she decided to officially end her gig with Beyonc√© to focus on other things that she is passionate about. One of those passions is teaching yoga. McGill discovered yoga in 1996. In an interview with Curlynikki, McGill stated that she was always drawn to a holistic lifestyle since she was young. She always had an interest in living in a more natural way and eat healthier than how she ate growing up. After taking her first yoga class, McGill knew that it was something that she wanted to incorporate into her lifestyle. She became certified to teach yoga in 2004 in Koh Samui, Thailand with Paul Dallaghan, an Ashtangi from Ireland, and studied meditation, Sanskrit, history and philosophy. In between touring with Beyonc√©, McGill has been teaching yoga at Root Whole Body in Portland, Oregon since moving there in 2007 when she wanted a more peaceful environment. McGill loved the outdoor beauty, laid-back people and consciousness of the city and that is what encouraged her to move there. McGill also performs as a DJ and teaches both yoga and performs DJ sets at various festivals such as the Wanderlust Festival and Arise Festival in Loveland, Colorado. Along with Yoga and DJing, McGill has also hosted tea ceremonies. McGill's interest in nature and plants has drawn her to tea. She was inspired to host her own tea ceremonies after attending them in Portland. She was drawn to the medicinal properties of tea and the fact that it can heal different aspects of your biological and physical body, digestion and energy. She has also been playing with different Kirtan artists such as Simirit Kaur, Gurunam Singh Shantala who are local Portland artists. McGill is also a producer. She has produced Gurunam Singh's 2015 single \\"Gobinday\\" and a \\"Believe\\" a song featuring the students of Open School North in Portland during her artist residency. McGill can also be heard on composer Carol Duboc's 2016 album \\"Open The Curtains\\" featuring other well known female musicians such as Sheila E., Patrice Rushen, Mindi Abair, Rhonda Smith and Jennifer Batten and Venzella Joy's \\"Orange Moon EP\\" who was a fellow Beyonc√© bandmate.  Impact  McGill has become one of the most notable and popular female guitarists of all time and in 2017, Guitar Player Magazine has named her one of the 50 most sensational female guitarists of all time. In 2015, she made the cover of \\"She Shreds\\", a magazine that celebrates female guitarists.

Built in 2016 by Arctech Helsinki Shipyard, she is the most powerful icebreaker ever to fly the Finnish flag and the first icebreaker in the world to feature environmentally friendly dual- fuel engines capable of using both low-sulfur marine diesel oil (LSMDO) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Polaris was initially ordered by the Finnish Transport Agency, but the ownership was transferred to the state-owned icebreaker operator Arctia after delivery.  Background  While the history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the strengthened sleigh-boats used to carry mail from Finland to Sweden in the 17th century, the annual \\"ice blockade\\" that closed the Finnish ports for the winter months and stopped nearly all foreign trade was not broken until 1890 when the Finnish Board of Navigation commissioned one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. Despite her shortcomings, Murtaja proved that year-round shipping was possible in the Baltic Sea and the first Finnish icebreaker was soon followed by bigger and more powerful vessels with only one purpose: to keep the shipping lanes open and escort merchant ships to and from the Finnish ports through the winter. In the late 1930s, steam gave way to diesel when the first Finnish diesel-electric icebreaker, Sisu, entered service in 1939. While all Finnish state-owned icebreakers survived the war, Finland had to hand over its newest and most powerful steam-powered icebreakers to the Soviet Union as war reparations. The rebuilding of the icebreaker fleet began in the early 1950s with the commissioning of the diesel-electric Voima, the first icebreaker in the world to feature two bow propellers, in 1954. She was followed by two more icebreakers before the end of the decade to replace the steam-powered pre-war icebreakers now deemed obsolete, four in the 1960s to answer to the demands of the growing foreign trade, and finally three in the 1970s to keep all Finnish ports open through the winter. In the early 1980s, the Finnish National Board of Navigation began looking for a replacement for the three 1950s icebreakers which were small and, despite their size, expensive to operate as they required a relatively large crew of 53. They were replaced by two large icebreakers, Otso and Kontio, featuring extensive automation, alternating current propulsion motors with cycloconverter drive, and a sleek hull form perfected in a model basin, but for the first time since the late 1800s no bow propellers. Around the same time, the National Board of Navigation also began looking for secondary uses for the icebreakers which were traditionally employed only for three to five months per year and spent the summer months moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. When the next class of post-war icebreakers was approaching the end of its economic life, it was decided to replace them with multipurpose vessels that could be chartered to support commercial offshore operations in oil fields when they were not needed in the Finnish waters. Three such multipurpose icebreakers were built in the 1990s: Fennica (1993), Nordica (1994), and Botnica (1998). The vessels, which were the first large icebreakers to utilize azimuth thrusters for propulsion, were sometimes criticized for their lower icebreaking performance and higher operational costs when compared to traditional icebreakers.Voelker, R. Trip Report to Northern Europe for National Science Foundation project. US Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration, April 22, 2003. Botnica, which had not been used for icebreaking in Finland for some years, was sold to Estonia in 2012.Botnica-j√§√§nmurtaja myytiin Viroon 50 miljoonalla. Helsingin Sanomat, 24 October 2012. Although the topic of ordering a new icebreaker surfaced from time to time, funding for the vessel projected to cost 100 to 120 million euro was not included in the budget until 2012 when 125 million euro was allocated for a new vessel with a design lifetime of 50 years.Liikenne- ja viestint√§ministeri√∂n budjettiehdotus 2,9 miljardia euroa. Liikenne- ja viestint√§ministeri√∂, 8 August 2012. Of this, 25 million euro would come from the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) program of the European Union.70\\\\. J√§√§nmurtajan hankinta (siirtom√§√§r√§raha 3 v). Talousarvioesitys 2013. Valtiovarainministeri√∂. Initially, the new icebreaker was supposed to replace the 1954-built Voima, the oldest and smallest icebreaker in the Finnish state-owned fleet as well as technically the oldest icebreaker in the world still in active service. However, when the new icebreaker was ordered, it was stated that the new vessel would primarily replace the Atle-class icebreaker Frej that the Finnish government has chartered from Sweden while Voima would remain in limited service.  Development and construction  The technical requirements were outlined in a tender specification published by the Finnish Transport Agency on 11 February 2013. According to the specification, the new icebreaker would have to be at least equivalent to the most powerful Finnish icebreakers in service at the time ‚Äî the 16.2-megawatt quad-screw Urho-class icebreakers ‚Äî in terms of icebreaking capability. Optimized for escort icebreaker operations in the northern Baltic Sea, the vessel would have to be powerful enough to operate without becoming immobilized in all prevailing ice conditions, including compressive pressure ridge fields, and maintain an average escort speed of through the winter. The bollard pull and propulsion power would have to be sufficient to allow continuous operation in level ice with a thickness of and snow cover as well as make the vessel capable of opening a channel through uniform ice field at a speed of . The specification also called for excellent maneuverability, demonstrated by the ability to turn 180 degrees in 3 minutes within two ship's lengths in the aforementioned ice conditions.Hankintailmoitus: Liikennevirasto: Liikenneviraston j√§√§nmurtajan konseptisuunnittelu sek√§ telakkakilpailutuksen teknisen materiaalin valmistelu mallikokeineen.

Although designed primarily for icebreaking, the new Finnish icebreaker would have a secondary task as an oil spill response vessel during the summer months as a response to the increasing traffic and oil transportation in the Baltic Sea. For this purpose, the vessel would be fitted with equipment for mechanical recovery of spilled oil in both open water and ice conditions. Since icebreakers traditionally have poor seakeeping characteristics due to their rounded hull form, the technical specification stressed the vessel's ability to carry out oil spill response and emergency towing operations in 95% of the prevailing wind and wave conditions in the Baltic Sea. On 16 April 2013, the Finnish Transport Agency awarded the contract for the design of the new icebreaker to two Finnish engineering companies specializing in the design of icebreaking ships. The vessel would be designed by Aker Arctic Technology Inc in co-operation with ILS Oy. In addition to conceptual design, which included comparing two concept alternatives ‚Äî a conventional icebreaker with two azimuth thrusters and a new concept with three propulsion units ‚Äî in terms of performance and cost, the companies would prepare the technical material needed to arrange the tender for the construction of the vessel and assist the Finnish Transport Agency in negotiations with shipyards.Aker Arctic to design new icebreaker for the Finnish government.

Controversies  Until the 1990s, the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet was operational only for three to five months per year and the icebreakers, designed solely for escorting merchant ships in ice-infested waters, spent the summer months moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. In the mid-1980s, the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build as a replacement for some of the oldest icebreakers. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the overall economics of the state-owned fleet.Tellefsen, T.P. Development of multipurpose icebreaker and offshore construction vessel. Design and Operation of Ships and Offshore Structures - Proceedings of the 1st International Conference Vol 1, pp. 221-231.

Design and Operation of Ships and Offshore Structures - Proceedings of the 1st International Conference Vol 1, pp. 233-240. WIT Press, 1993. As a result, three multipurpose icebreakers were built in Finland in the 1990s: Fennica (1993), Nordica (1994) and Botnica (1998). Over the years, the multipurpose icebreakers have been heavily criticized for the financial losses from the offshore business, where they were not competitive against purpose-built platform supply vessels, as well as lower icebreaking capability when compared to traditional icebreakers from the 1970s and 1980s.15.11.2010 MOT: Italialaista j√§√§nmurtoa, toimittaja Magnus Berglund.

When the funding for the construction of the new icebreaker was accepted in the state budget proposal in 2012, there was a public debate about the type of the future Finnish icebreakers. Arctia, the state-owned shipping company that owns and operates the Finnish icebreaker fleet, called for a multi-role vessel that could be employed year-round instead of just the winter navigation season. Previously, the company had chartered Fennica and Nordica to support Shell Oil's exploration drilling operations in the Arctic waters off Alaska and was looking for more profitable business outside the Baltic Sea during the summer months. However, the Finnish Minister of Transport Merja Kyll√∂nen (Left Alliance) voiced her opposition to a ship that would be 50% more expensive to build than a traditional icebreaker.Ministeri ja varustamo eri linjoilla uudesta j√§√§nmurtajasta. YLE, 2 April 2012. Friction over new icebreaker plan. YLE, 2 April 2012. Other politicians also opposed the idea and Osmo Soininvaara (Green League) even proposed that instead of purchasing a new icebreaker to replace Voima, Finland should try to manage with a smaller icebreaker fleet and accept that some ports would likely be closed during the coldest winters.Hyvi√§ s√§√§st√∂kohteita: j√§√§nmurtaja. Osmo Soininvaara, 11 December 2011. In October 2013, the Minister for International Development to the Finnish government, Heidi Hautala (Green League), was accused for influencing Minister Kyll√∂nen's decision to order a conventional single-role icebreaker for the Finnish Transport Agency instead of a multipurpose vessel for Arctia. According to the Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, these decisions were made in order to guarantee that the new icebreaker, which would now be employed only for about 100 days per year, would not head out to the Arctic waters.Hautalaa syytet√§√§n kalliista tempusta: Uusi murtaja seisoo toimettomana. Ilta-Sanomat, 11 October 2013. As the minister responsible for ownership steering in the Prime Minister's Office, Hautala had also instructed Arctia to withdraw criminal charges against Greenpeace whose activists had boarded the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers in 2012 as a protest against Arctic oil drilling. After providing conflicting accounts of the incident, Minister Hautala announced her resignation on 11 October 2013.Hautala aims sights at Europarliament. YLE, 12 October 2013. Timonen admits threatening icebreaker bosses. YLE, 11 October 2013. While the existing Finnish icebreaker fleet was owned and operated solely by Arctia, the new icebreaker was initially intended to be owned by the Finnish Transport Agency and the operator would be selected through public tendering process. The new model was adopted from Sweden where the operation of state-owned icebreakers has been open for competition for years. Arctia, which practically has a monopoly in the icebreaker business in Finland, has been criticized for higher prices when compared to Swedish icebreakers as well as potentially subsidizing unprofitable offshore operations by charging premium charter from the Finnish Transport Agency for the multipurpose vessels.Yle: V√§yl√§j√§√§nmurto avataan kilpailulle.

Ministry of Transport and Communications, 5 March 2015. On 25 November 2014, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy published a statement regarding the future of the state-owned shipping company, Arctia, and its fleet of aging icebreakers. According to the statement, the company's existing conventional and multipurpose icebreakers would require replacement by 2029 at an overall cost of about 1 billion euro. In order to keep the cost of icebreaking services in the Baltic Sea at a reasonable level, the shipping company should improve the annual utilization rate of its icebreakers by investing in multi- role vessels that could be improved elsewhere during the summer months. While more expensive to build, such multipurpose icebreakers would result in savings ranging from 20 to 30 million euro over the 30-year lifetime of the vessel.Valtio-omistaja linjasi Arctia Shippingin tulevaisuutta.

Like the multipurpose icebreakers built in the 1990s, Polaris has an asymmetric bridge to maximize visibility to all directions from the main steering position on the starboard side. The propulsion units can be steered individually using three joystick-like controllers instead of a traditional wheel and telegraph. After satellite imaging replaced helicopters as the primary means to get up-to-date information about ice conditions in the Baltic Sea, the helicopter facilities in the older Finnish icebreakers have become largely obsolete. For this reason, the Polaris has only a small winching area in the bow. However, the platform is dimensioned so that it is still possible to land a helicopter on it in case of emergency. Polaris is classified by Lloyd's Register.LR classed LNG-powered icebreaker for Finland . Gas Technology, Lloyd's Register, March 2014. Although the icebreaker is stationed in the Baltic Sea where there is only seasonal ice cover, she is designed according to the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements for Polar Class Ships. Her ice class, Polar Class 4, is intended for vessels operating year-round in thick first- year ice which may include old ice inclusions. However, since the vessel also has a class notation Icebreaker(+) and operates as an escort icebreaker in difficult ice conditions, she has additional structural strengthening in critical areas.Requirements concerning POLAR CLASS . International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), 2011. Like all Finnish icebreakers since the 1980s, Polaris also features an unpainted stainless steel ice belt to reduce friction and protect the hull against ice abrasion and corrosion.Press Images. Arctech Helsinki Shipyard. While Polaris is designed primarily for icebreaking duties, she has a secondary role as an oil spill response vessel. The new icebreaker is fitted with equipment for mechanical recovery of spilled oil from the sea in both open water and ice conditions. The permanently installed advancing system and the stern-mounted brush skimmers are similar to the recovery systems fitted on latest Finnish oil spill response vessels such as the 2011-built pollution control vessel Louhi and 2014-built offshore patrol vessel Turva. The recovery tanks have a total capacity of . The coloring scheme follows that of the other Finnish icebreakers, with dark blue hull and white superstructure with blue details. The underwater parts, including the propulsion units, are painted white. In 2017, the fore bulkhead is adorned with \\"Finland 100\\" logo to celebrate Finland's 100 years of independence. = Power and propulsion = Like all Finnish post-war icebreakers, Polaris has a diesel-electric power plant and propulsion system. However, she is the first icebreaker in the world to be powered by dual-fuel engines capable of using both low-sulfur marine diesel oil (LSMDO) as well as liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel. The dual-fuel power plant reduces exhaust emissions and complies with both IMO Tier III emission limits as well as the special requirements of the Baltic Sea Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA).NB 510. Arctech Helsinki Shipyard. In average winter conditions, the vessel has an autonomy time of 10 days when operating on liquefied natural gas, which is stored in two vertical tanks with a total volume of . Fuel oil, stored in separate tanks with a combined volume of , provides additional 20 days of endurance in similar ice conditions. The power plant, located amidships at the main deck level, consists of two 9-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 9L34DF and two 12-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 12V34DF four-stroke medium-speed dual-fuel generating sets fitted with exhaust gas economizers. The smaller straight engines are rated at each while the bigger Vee engines have an output of each. In addition, the vessel has one 8-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 8L20DF auxiliary engine, rated at , that can be used to produce electricity when the ship is at port.W√§rtsil√§lt√§ j√§√§nmurtajan lng-moottori. Kauppalehti, 10 June 2014. The combined output of the electrical power plant, which can produce power for all shipboard consumers with any combination of generating sets depending on the power demand, is about 22.5MW. There is also a separate emergency diesel generator. Polaris features a novel propulsion system consisting of three electrically driven ABB Azipod propulsion units, one of which is located in the bow of the vessel. The stern propulsion units are rated at 6.5megawatts each while the azimuth thruster in the bow has propulsion power of 6megawatts. Each ice-strengthened Azipod unit has a four-bladed stainless steel propeller with removable blades and weighs 135 tons. This new type of propulsion system was selected to fulfill the strict operational capability requirements set by the Finnish Transport Agency particularly in ridged ice fields. ABB to supply electric power plant and propulsion units for a Finnish icebreaker. ABB Group, 12 May 2014. The combined propulsion power of the three propulsion units, , makes Polaris the most powerful icebreaker ever to fly the Finnish flag as well as the most powerful icebreaker built specifically for escort operations in the Baltic Sea. Based on ice model tests carried out before the vessel is delivered, Polaris is capable of continuously breaking level ice with a thickness of at and maintain a speed of in unbroken ice. While the ice in the northern parts of the Gulf of Bothnia does not get thicker than about even during the hardest winters, the high icebreaking capability allows the vessel to operate efficiently in all prevailing ice conditions, particularly heavily ridged ice fields, and maintain a high average escort speed through the winter. In open water, the vessel has a trial speed of . The icebreaker, which has a bollard pull of about 214 metric tons, can also be utilized for emergency towing of stricken vessels.

She is a contemporary of Lois Andison, Simone Jones, Diane Landry and Daniel Olson. Hlady's works are generally sculptural works and installations composed of everyday materials activated by electronic and mechanical systems, often reflecting the social systems that created them. Her works tend to follow a system-based approach to composition. Her major works include \\"Drumming Displaced into Different Sized Jam Jars\\", a large series of sculpture in the collection of The Art Gallery of Ontario, and \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", a kinetic sculpture that has exhibited extensively. She has an MFA in sculpture (York University, 1990) and a BFA (1987) from University of Victoria. Artistic career Hlady first gained notice for her kinetic installation \\"neutralized feelings of apprehension,\\" at G76 in Toronto, which was enthusiastically reviewed by Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail. Her solo installation \\"Beauty\\" at the Koffler Gallery in Toronto, was curated by John Massier in 1992. After exhibiting her kinetic work \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" at Peregrine Gallery, which was reviewed by Gillian MacKay of the Globe and Mail, she had group and solo exhibitions at The Power Plant in Toronto. Her work \\"Drumming Displaced into Different Sized Jam Jars\\" was purchased by the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1999. In 2012 she had a major solo exhibition at Hallwalls in Buffalo, New York. Hlady describes her studio practice as a play between content, form, functionality, and material, where material stands to mean as much what is heard as what is seen. Hlady is interested in the various relationships inherent in her work, from the relationships between the work, the space it occupies, and the ways the viewer interacts with the work in the space. Awards In 2002, she was nominated for the Sobey Art Award. Major collections Hlady's work is in the public collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario and the National Gallery of Canada.

She has exhibited nationally and internationally, particularly concerning the subject of Canadian Identity. Early life Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Turner immigrated to Canada when she was nine, first to Sarnia, and then Hamilton, Ontario. Her childhood experience of living in Canada was marked by a feeling of otherness; other children's racial taunts created a sense that she didn't belong. Turner has said, \\"no matter how long I live in Canada, no matter that I've lived here most of my life, when will I ever be Canadian? The feeling of otherness is so common.\\" Simultaneously, Canada was the place where she and her mother and sister became reunited with her father, a boilermaker who made his living working in Hamilton's steel industry. Turner notes, \\"for me, my father was always somewhere else. And so home was always this mythical place that was going to happen when he would get settled. Then he would send for us, and we would be a family together. That's why a lot of the work that I do is about belonging and home, because it has always been this thing that was out there.\\" Education Turner is a graduate of the Ontario College of Art, and has also attended McMaster University and Sheridan College. She earned a Master of Environmental Studies from York University. Currently, Turner is a PHD Candidate in Environmental Studies with York University. Artistic career Turner's work investigates diasporic identity and intercultural exchange through interventions, installations, performances, media works, and public engagements, and her most recent work investigates hidden or erased histories through place-based exploration. She is best known for her glamorous alter-ego Miss Canadiana, a hometown beauty queen on an ambassadorial Red, White, and Beautiful Tour, who has been calling out contradictions since 2002 of the Canadian mythology of multiculturalism across the globe. Frequently employing new media art and mobile technologies in her interactive performance projects, several of Turner's projects imagine black futures through afrofuturistic narratives. A series of performances‚ÄîThe Final Frontier (2010),Jacques, M. (2007). Afrofuturism and Canadian Art History meet in The Final Frontier. Toronto, ON: WARC Gallery (Women's Art Resource Centre). TimeWarp (2013), and The Afronautic Research Lab (2016)‚Äîproposes the return of a group of space travelers, the Afronauts, descendants of the Dogon people of West Africa who have come home after 10,000 years to save the planet. Using the detailed iconography of [science fictionScience fiction], Turner investigates the mythic Canadian landscape. Not letting Canadians sit comfortably with the self-satisfied narrative that their country was often at the end of the Underground Railroad, The Afronauts most recently confronted the country's amnesia around its own histories of slavery by inviting visitors to pore over ads posted in 18th-century newspapers by Canadian slave owners. Through these performances, Turner builds on stories of the Dogon's extensive astronomical knowledge dating back to 3200 BC - in regards to this research and creation, Turner has said \\"You know, to cavort with the ghosts is what I think about, because these things haunt the present, and sci-fi is a great language for connecting with the ghosts.\\" Turner was Artist-in-Residence at the Art Gallery of Mississauga, 2012‚Äì2014. In 2013-14, she held a residency through the Neighbourhood Spaces Program of the Broken City Lab artist-run centre in Windsor, Ontario. In the summer of 2015, her interactive project \\"Big Up Barton\\" focused on a neglected neighbourhood in Hamilton, Ontario. Mounted in a neglected store front on Barton Street, the work presented recorded audio narratives of local residents' memories and invited visitors to share written responses. Turner's project Wanted, a collaboration with Camal Pirbhai, took the form of contemporary photo portraits paired with notices of runaway slaves from eighteenth-century Canada. During the summer of 2017, elements of the work were installed as billboards in prominent locations in Toronto.

She also attended √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, in Paris, France. Crowner lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Work Crowner creates paintings by sewing together angular pieces of already painted canvas and linen. This method emerged from her impatience with the medium. In an interview from an article from the New York Observer, Crowner states that \\"sewing made sense at first because it was a way of cutting up, collaging, reorganizing and re-constructing in a practical way.\\" She also creates small ceramic works in neutral color palettes and that have more organic shapes. Career In October 2012, she published her first widely distributed book, Format, through the non-profit publisher, Primary Information. Her most recent publication, Sarah Crowner: Patterns' (April, 2018) is her second project with Brooklyn-based, non-profit publisher, Primary Information.

Shechet has said of her work, \\"Everybody wants to be able to tell a quick story, but I do not want to make something that fits into a few sentences. I don‚Äôt want it to have a punchline.‚Äù Shechet's early work was influenced by Buddhism, evident in the way it exhibited states of transformation and Buddhist subject matter. In the early 1990s, Shechet made a series of plaster sculptures. The lumpy works, supported by industrial and found objects, and incorporating Buddhist iconography, evolved into a family of Buddhas. In 1996 Shechet was invited to work at the Dieu Donn√© Papermill in New York.

Her recent body of colorful paper works, completed in 2012, reveal her commitment to materials and the mold. Her fascination with materials extends to clay, for which she is primarily know and has received wide recognition. Over the last decade, Shechet has worked prolifically with clay, creating an impressive body of work and pushing the boundaries of the material. From 2012 to 2013, Shechet held a residency at the Meissen Porcelain Manufactory in Germany, where she made experimental sculptures alongside factory employees making traditional porcelain work. Her time there yielded a new body of work which was installed by Shechet at the RISD Museum, Providence in 2014. In 2013 for The New York Times, Roberta Smith described Shechet's work as combining painting and sculpture \\"with exuberant polymorphous, often comic results\\", and noted the variety of glazed surfaces on the vessels in her exhibition Slip, at Sikkema Jenkins & Co.

Her work is centered on printmaking and painting, particularly around the theme of \\"energia de mujeres\\", or \\"women's energy\\".  Early life and education  Arroyo was born in 1951 in Guayama, Puerto Rico and attended the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico as an honors student in 1966. She graduated in 1967 and enrolled at the Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas de Puerto Rico where she studied under Frank Cerbonie, Rafael Tufi√±o, Luis Hern√°ndez Cruz and Susana Herero. After the death of her mother in 1973, Arroyo moved to New York and studied at the Pratt Institute, graduating in 1977 with a B.F.A. and then studying at the printmaking department at Yale University's School of Art, where she was a student of Gabor Peterdi, Winefred Lutz, Greta Campbell, Elizabeth Murray and Samia Halaby.  Career  Following her graduation from Yale, Arroyo moved to New York University where she worked in printmaking with Krishna Reddy. She was awarded a Ford Foundation Teaching Grant in the same year, and an Artist Project Grant by the Connecticut Commission on the Arts in 1980. In 1982 she began exploring the theme of \\"energia de mujeres\\", or \\"women's energy\\", inspired by her experience of women within her family and heritage; this continues to be her primary artistic theme. From 1996 to 1993, Arroyo served as Commissioner of the Commission of Cultural Affairs of New Haven, and was a Women in Leadership Honoree. In 1987, she was awarded the Merit Award of South Central Community College, and in 1994, the Professional Development Award of Eastern Connecticut State University, where she's currently a Professor of Art and chairs the Visual Arts Department. In 1990 Arroyo completed her series Moving Through the Spiral, a collection of paintings and lithographs influenced by her visits to Mexico and New Mexico. Other prominent exhibitions and series include Time, Movement and Symbolism at the Akus Gallery and Charter Oak Cultural Center in 1995, and participation in a group exhibit at the 14th General Assembly and Congress of the UNESCO International Association of Art, also in 1995. In 2000 she created Voices of Water with Lillian Pitt, Gail Tremblay and Betsy Damon; this was then exhibited at the CESTA Festival. The same year, she collaborated with Arto Lindsay on Santuario para les animas Africanas (Sanctuary for the [Tortured] African Souls), which was exhibited in the ruins of the Iglesia Santo Domingo in Panama City. In 2011 Arroyo served as the Master Artist-in-Residence at Spelman College. In 2012 she was awarded the Outstanding Latino Cultural Award from the American Association of Hispanics in Higher Education. Her most recent exhibition was \\"Ancestors of the Passage\\" at the University of Connecticut. The exhibition consisted of an installation \\"composed of 27 terracotta ceramic figures, each extending their hands out to the audience from a sea of acrylic canvases and silk fabric. According to the artist, these figures represent the African ancestors who died in the Middle Passage, where millions of people were forcibly transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the New World.\\" \\"The figures are surrounded by 47 black and white collagraphs which feature two-dimensional images similar to the sculptures and a projected video titled ‚ÄúTrail of Bones.‚Äù Finally, there is an altar to pay tribute to the ancestors and allow audience members to write on small prints to their ancestors.Through the variety of media, Arroyo works not to simply condemn historical oppressors, but to express her own identity and honor those who made her life possible through their struggles.\\" \\"Arroyo called her work ‚Äútimely‚Äù because of how it intertwined historical, political, social, environmental and even personal issues into one conversation. She mentions how climate change is impacting sea levels and then she connects it to Puerto Rico, where people have been living for months with inadequate resources including a lack of potable water. She took these broad issues and used them in her work to discuss deeper issues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs concerned about not only what‚Äôs happening with the environment, but also the displacement of people from their places, refugees. We might not want to acknowledge that we have refugees dealing with climate change and that‚Äôs one of our realities of our time,‚Äù Arroyo said. Arroyo also stressed the importance of exchange in her work. Through the physical set-up of the piece and the interaction altar, she emphasizes the importance of the exchange and of conversation. However, firsthand experience is crucial to conveying this authentically.\\"  Personal life  While living in Puerto Rico, Arroyo married Tito Efrain Mattei and had two daughters, Isis and Swahili. She left her husband before moving to the United States, but later remarried him and they had a third child, a son.

Photo: Howard Ursuliak Jamelie Hassan (born 1948) is a Canadian multidisciplinary artist, lecturer, writer and independent curator.  Early life and education  Hassan was born in London, Ontario to a Lebanese immigrant family and grew up in an Arabic speaking household with ten siblings. Her maternal grandfather and her father travelled from mountain villages in Lebanon to North America in the early 1900s, fleeing Turkish military conscription and World War I. After completing her high school studies, Hassan travelled to Rome in 1967 and to Beirut in 1968, where she studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Rome and then the Acad√©mie libanaise des beaux-arts, Beirut. This trip to Lebanon confirmed her Lebanese cultural background. Upon her return to Canada, she established an artist's studio and became active in the cultural community of London, Ontario. She sold her first work of art in 1971. Hassan is a Graduate of the University of Windsor in Windsor, Ontario. In 1978-79, she travelled to Baghdad, Iraq, and studied Arabic at Al-Mustansiriya University. Extensive travel continues to enrich her work, which often reflects this artist's respect for popular, traditional and indigenous art forms. Themes  In 1976‚Äì1977, Hassan was politicized by encountering postcolonial cultures during her travels in Central and South America. Hassan started exhibiting ceramics or fiberglass objects called 'actualizations'. Her installation-based art practice spans over thirty years and is both personal and political. It addresses worldwide concerns on racism, the subjection of women, cultural interactions, colonialism and political conflicts. Hassan often works with traditional or contemporary cultural artifacts, to make cross-cultural references, such as cultural displacement, Argentinian dictatorship (Los Desaparecidos, 1981), or the narratives of intersecting cultures (Boutros Al Armenian / Mediterranean Modern, 1997). A survey exhibition in 2009 at Museum London in London Ontario, combined elements of photography, text, ceramics, neon light and video to tie in language and the politics of place that connects Hassan as a Canadian artist to her Arabic background. In 1983, Hassan co-founded the London artist cooperative, Embassy Cultural House, serving on its board from 1985 to 1990.  Projects and collaborations  Among the projects in which Hassan has taken part are: * curating the Havana/London Exchange in 1988 * Indian Summer, an exhibition shown in several locations in London and Brantford in 1990. * a collaborative bookwork titled Jamelie-Jamila Project with Jamila Ismail in 1992. * Trespassers and Captives in 1999, an examination of colonialism through the collections of the historic Eldon House in London, Ontario, that included an interdisciplinary writing project published as its catalogue.

She is also the director of the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation in Toronto, Canada. A graduate of the University of Toronto, the New School of Art and the Toronto Art Therapy Institute, Hendeles earned her PhD, cum laude, from the Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis at the University of Amsterdam. In 2009, Hendeles donated 32 works of International and Canadian contemporary art to the Art Gallery of Ontario. This donation represented the most significant single gift of contemporary art in the gallery's history. Career =The Ydessa Gallery= In 1980, Hendeles established The Ydessa Gallery in Toronto, a commercial space devoted to the presentation of Canadian contemporary art. The gallery represented such artists as Kim Adams, Shelagh Alexander, Tony Brown, FASTW√úRMS, Andreas Gehr, Rodney Graham, Noel Harding, Nancy Johnson, Ken Lum, Liz Magor, John Massey, John McEwen, Peter Hill, Sandra Meigs, Jana Sterbak, Jeff Wall and Krzysztof Wodiczko. Hendeles closed The Ydessa Gallery in 1988. =Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation= In October 1987, Hendeles announced that she would establish a not-for-profit art foundation and that she purchased a two-storey building located at 778 King Street West in downtown Toronto as the future site of the foundation's exhibition programme. In November 1988, after extensive renovations, the 14,000-square-foot former uniforms factory became home of the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation, Canada's first privately supported contemporary-art exhibition space. Hendeles launched her exhibition programme in December 1987 with Katharina Fritsch: Madonna of Lourdes, presented at the Toronto Eaton Centre (the city's most popular shopping mall). For the week leading up to Christmas, Hendeles installed Fritsch's sculpture of a small Madonna icon statue, enlarged to adult-size and rendered in bright yellow-painted Duroplast, in the middle of the pedestrian mall at the peak of its busiest shopping season. Hendeles positioned the sculpture so that it could be viewed against the background of the Church of the Holy Trinity, a historic Anglican Church around which the western side of the Toronto Eaton Centre was built. The Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation was formally established in 1988 with a mandate to provide a programme of contemporary-art exhibitions from a developing collection. In November 1988, the gallery space opened its inaugural show Christian Boltanski, a five- gallery exhibition of the French artist's work, including the site-specific commission Canada (1988). In 1996, Maclean's magazine published a profile by Sharon Doyle Driedger on Hendeles and her exhibition programme at the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation. In this article, Driedger noted Hendeles‚Äôs influence on the art world: > Hendeles has managed to pique the interest of the art world by collecting > and showing works by such luminaries as British photographer Eadweard > Muybridge and American sculptor Louise Bourgeois. ‚ÄúThese works are sought > after by any great institution in the world,‚Äù says Marcel Brisebois, > director of the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art. ‚ÄúShe has a great eye. > When she buys something, we look at her and say, ‚ÄòOh, why is she doing so?‚Äô‚Äù > Her bold aesthetic vision led ARTNews, a respected U.S. journal, to twice > include her in its list of ‚Äúthe art world‚Äôs 50 most influential people‚Äù in > 1993 and 1995‚Äîthe only Canadian and one of just a handful of women. ‚ÄúEvery > museum curator who is not asleep knows about her,‚Äù says Robert Storr, a > curator at New York City‚Äôs renowned Museum of Modern Art. Storr adds that > for exhibitions of videos, films, photography and installations, ‚Äúthere is > absolutely no better place in the world‚Äù than Hendeles‚Äôs foundation. In the book Private Spaces for Contemporary Art (2010), Peter Doroshenko described the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation as functioning \\"more like an intellectual visual arts laboratory than an art centre or private collection space,\\" and declared its gallery \\"one of the most important contemporary spaces in North America.\\" Over a span of 25 years Hendeles curated more than 30 exhibitions at the Toronto space. Though the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation closed its gallery doors in 2012, it continues to function as a not-for-profit organization but now its mission and mandate are pursued ‚Äúwithout walls.‚Äù =Exhibitions= In 2003, Hendeles guest-curated Partners, a 16-gallery exhibition for the Haus der Kunst, Munich, at the invitation of then-incoming director Chris Dercon and the new chief curator, Thomas Weski. For Partners Hendeles combined work by Diane Arbus, Maurizio Cattelan, James Coleman, Hanne Darboven, Walker Evans, Luciano Fabro, On Kawara, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Nauman, Giulio Paolini, Jeff Wall and Lawrence Weiner, together with series of photojournalistic images, anonymous vernacular photographs and antique vernacular objects. This exhibition also included Hendeles's own artwork Partners (The Teddy Bear Project), 2002, a large-scale installation built around an archive of family-album photographs, each including the image of a teddy bear (see external link below). Partners (The Teddy Bear Project) was first shown in the group exhibition sameDIFFERENCE at the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation in Toronto (2002).

This piece comes in the form of a giant bronze frog and narwhal tusk/unicorn's horn, a pair called Monoceros. According to FASTW√úRMS the work is \\"based on the Tetraploid Treefrog (Hyla versicolor) and the took or 'tusk' of the Narwhal (Monodon monoceros). In medieval Europe, rare and valuable Narwhal tusks were accepted as proof positive for the existence of the magical Unicorn. The Unicorn and the Frog are both powerful icons from traditional and popular culture. They promise protection, good health, prosperity and wealth. Invest in natural wealth and the health of Narwhals and Frogs, tryst with reciprocal coexistence, and the Monoceros gyre of good fortune and good luck is yours to share.\\" Monoceros' tusk is 37 feet high, and has an 11-foot diameter 'moon disc'. Along the Narwhal's tusk, a groove filled with crushed stone, detailed polliwogs, and tadpoles develops into frogs swimming upstream through a river of ancient coins, symbolic of health and wealth.

Created in 1984, this non-profit organization encourages and supports the intellectual and creative development of women in the visual arts by providing an ongoing forum for education and critical dialogue. Monthly MAWA programming includes lectures, artist talks, skills based workshops, professional practices workshops, critical reading groups, studio visits, an artist-mothers group, screenings and field trips. Visiting artists and curators have included Lucy Lippard (Albuquerque, New Mexico), Deborah Kelly (Sydney, Australia), Sara Riel (Reykjavik, Iceland), Rosalie Favell (Ottawa), Allyson Mitchell (Toronto), Yolanda Paulsen (Mexico City) and Huma Mulji (Lahore, Pakistan). MAWA provides a platform for critical writing as well, by commissioning text that appears in their newsletter and on their website. Although MAWA's mentorship programs are for women-identifying artists, recognizing historical and present-day inequalities, the majority of their programs are open to people of all genders, and are offered at low or no cost. MAWA has over 300 paid members, of whom approximately 80% reside in Winnipeg. An additional 10% are located throughout Manitoba and an additional 10% throughout the rest of Canada. Well over 350 volunteers contribute to MAWA each year.  History  MAWA was founded as the Manitoba Artists for Women's Art by Diane Whitehouse, Sheila Butler and others, to address gender inequality in the visual arts by giving opportunities to women. It was created in response to the findings of a research committee based at Plug In Institute of Contemporary Art.  Mentorship  MAWA works to sustain art in the community through mentorship programs. Senior artists share their experience and expertise with developing artists in a peer-support learning environment that empowers women to build their practices. Through mentorship, MAWA has created a vibrant, skilled community, serving women artists in all phases of their careers. = Foundation Mentorship Program = The Foundation Mentorship Program has been MAWA‚Äôs core activity since 1985. It is a year-long program in which established artists share their experience with developing artists. It is designed to help women in the visual arts develop skills and define their decision-making philosophies, and to provide access to the information, resources and support they need to realize their goals. In addition to a one- on-one relationship with a mentor, the program provides a peer group for the mentees through group meetings. = Mentors and Mentees = Mentors have included Sheila Butler, Aganetha Dyck, Diana Thorneycroft, Eleanor Bond, Bev Pike, Grace Nickel, Sigrid Dahle, Shawna Dempsey, KC Adams, and many more.

After 1952, the rate of Coptic immigration from Egypt to the United States increased. The first Coptic church in the United States is St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church, which was established in the late 1960s in Jersey City ( dibaki jersi). As of 2013, researchers estimated that there were about 350,000 Copts who settled in the United States before the Egyptian revolution of 2011, with up to 100,000 additional Copts who settled in the U.S. after the revolution, fleeing instability and violence in Egypt. Many came to the U.S. on grants of asylum. The new post-2011 migrants to the United States included both educated middle-class Copts and poorer, more rural Copts.

The channel shut down on October 5, 2017, and Bloomberg subsequently partnered with established Canadian competitor Business News Network (BNN) in 2018 instead. As a result of the partnership, BNN rebranded to BNN Bloomberg. History On February 26, 2015, Channel Zero announced it had reached an agreement with Bloomberg L.P. to launch a localized Canadian business news channel as an offshoot of its original American Bloomberg Television channel which was currently being distributed in Canada for several years at the time.

Originally launched as an exempt discretionary service that did not require a CRTC-granted television licence as it did not at launch have the required 200,000 subscribers, the channel was granted a CRTC licence on August 17, 2017 after reaching that subscriber level in 2016.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2017-288, CRTC, 08-17-17 On the same day Channel Zero was granted its licence for Bloomberg TV Canada by the CRTC, Channel Zero announced in a statement that it would be cancelling all Canadian original productions for the channel and laying off 22 members of its staff relating to those productions, leading to speculation of how Channel Zero would maintain its required Canadian content quotas with no original Canadian productions. The statement referred to September 1, 2017 as the date the channel will be \\"changing the focus\\" of its programming, however, still maintaining that the channel will focus on business news and information, with reporting from Bloomberg studios in Canada and around the world, suggesting the channel will remain in operation.Bloomberg TV Canada slashes its two original shows, GlobeInvestor.com, 08-18-17 However, on October 5, 2017, the channel was discontinued and replaced with the American Bloomberg Television service,Oct 5  Bloomberg TV Canada rebrands to Bloomberg TV, Shaw Support, 10-04-17 the channel Bloomberg TV Canada replaced at its launch in 2015.

Location  The village was situated approximately north of Altenbrunslar, on the eastern bank of the River Eder. It was on a small plateau, about above sea level, within the forest.  History  In 1319 the village was called Brecholdisdorf, in the years 1418 und 1419 as Brekelstorff, Brechtoldistorf and Brechelsdorf, and in 1360 it was known as Frekolsdorf. It is probable that the village was abandoned during the 1346‚Äì1353 outbreak of the Black Death pandemic in middle Europe. By 1410, the village had been registered as abandoned. In the Salbuch of Breitenau, written in the year 1579, the village is described as a ruined farm with farmyard, which is used by the people of Altenbrunslar. In 1848, an urn of ashes was found on the site. A field was still named Breckelsdorf (in local dialect as Br√§chelsdorf) in 1930's.

A two-time recipient of the National Endowment of the Arts grant (1979 and 1989), Murphy has received numerous awards and honors for her work, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (1982) and most recently the Robert De Niro, Sr. Prize in 2013. She was a Senior Critic at Yale University Graduate School of Art for 22 years and is currently the Tepper Family Endowed Chair in Visual Arts at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers. Murphy lives and works in Poughkeepsie, New York. She is married to artist Harry Roseman. Biography As a young girl, Catherine Murphy was always drawn to making art. In the third grade, her teacher allowed her to paint, paste and also draw on the blackboard in the back of the classroom. In interviews she recounts a moment in church when she was about 12. A visiting cardinal asked the children of the congregation if anyone had a vocation. Young Catherine raised her hand and said, \\"I'm going to be an artist when I grow up.\\" Growing up in Lexington, Massachusetts, Murphy had little exposure to art and visited an art museum for the first time during high school. In interviews Murphy often mentions how drawing and painting were a means to seek control over her world. Murphy studied at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in 1967, where she was later awarded an honorary doctorate degree in 2006. Artistic practice Murphy's drawings, prints and oil paintings, created solely through direct observation, are highly detailed depictions of people, objects and spaces. Using natural light, her meticulously composed setups are often rendered at a scale larger than the original subject. One painting can take several years to complete. Murphy has said of her work that she is trying to \\"slow things down\\" in her paintings, that \\"my paintings are not about that one moment of seeing. My paintings are about time passing. Time is depicted in a very different way than most people even think about time- which is cinematically, and through the camera's eye.\\" With regard to the formal qualities of her work, Hilton Kramer wrote in 1975 that Murphy, not yet 30 years old, was in possession of a \\"firm pictorial mind\\", exhibiting a profound awareness of Modernism and Cubism while carrying \\"the realist impulse into a terrain all her own\\".

The architecturally vernacular house was built beginning in 1947 by the authors Ruth Moore and Eleanor Mayo, who lived and wrote there until their respective deaths in 1989 and 1981. Moore in particular has been cited as a major mid-20th century writer of Maine culture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Moore-Mayo House is set on the west side of Lighthouse Road, on a property which extends down to the shore. The main house is set near the road, sheltered from it by a lilac hedge. Overgrown fields extend down to the shore, where there is a small wood-frame \\"camp\\" cabin with deck. The main house is a single-story vernacular wood frame structure, which grew organically over time as the two women expanded it. It has a main square component at its center, with wings added to the west and south sides. These sections are each covered by a gable roof whose rafter ends are exposed. The core of the house was built in 1947 by Ruth Moore and Eleanor Mayo, with help from Mayo's father Frederick. Architectural elements of the house were recycled from an old Civilian Conservation Corps camp site, second-hand materials, and beach-combed lumber. The structure was fitted with plumbing and electricity in 1948, and the two wings were added over the following years. The floors and walls are finished in pine, and there are builtin pine cabinets in the kitchen and bedrooms. The camp at the shore was built in 1962. Ruth Moore (1903‚Äì89) and Eleanor Mayo (1920-81) were both born in the area, and met in 1940. Moore had already been published by then, but her major critical success followed. She was lauded critically by contemporaries and later commentators for her social commentary, wit and language in writing, and her depictions of rural Maine, following in some degree the trail blazed by Sarah Orne Jewett and others. Mayo published five novels before becoming involved in local politics; she was the first woman to serve on the Tremont board of selectmen.

David Johnson. Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, September 12, 2012. Web. March 8, 2015.At the beginning of her career, Collins had to pass as a white woman to be able to assist photographers., Kolb, Karolyn, \\"Developing Images\\", New Orleans Magazine, July 2008. Collins eventually opened her own studio, catering to African-American families. She gained a loyal following and had success, due to both her photography and marketing skills. Out of 101 African-American women who identified themselves as photographers in the 1920 U.S. Census, Collins was the only one listed in New Orleans . She advertised in newspapers, playing up the sentimentality of a well-done photograph. Collins also included her photograph in the ads to appeal to customers who thought a female photographer might take better pictures of babies and children. Collins'first husband, Eilert Bertrand, believed that women should not have careers and tried to restrain her public appearances. Collins died in 1988.  Legacy  According to the Encyclopedia of Louisiana, Collins' career \\"mirrored a complicated interplay of gender, racial and class expectations\\". .\\"The history of black liberation in the United States could be characterized as a struggle over images as much as it has also been a struggle over rights,\\" according to bell hooks. Collins' photographs are representative of that. By taking pictures of black women and children in domestic settings, she challenged the pervasive stereotypes of the time about black women. Collins was featured in the 2014 documentary, Through A Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People. Collins' work was included in exhibitions in New Orleans in the late 1900s and early 2000s, such as Women Artists in Louisiana, 1825‚Äì1965: A Place of Their Own,\\"NOMA and THNOC Present Women Artists in Louisiana, 1825‚Äì1965: A Place of Their Own\\", New Orleans Museum of Art.

The first tour began in March 1956 and lasted for ten weeks. The 18-piece band was led by Gillespie and performed in Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece. An American ambassador reported back that \\"Maybe we could have built a new tank for the cost of this tour, but you can't get as much goodwill out of a tank as you can out of Dizzy Gillespie's band.\\" \\"A few years later, when Louis Armstrong arrived in the Congo as part of a tour through Africa, drummers and dancers paraded him through the streets on a throne.

He and his wife Iola Brubeck later wrote a musical, The Real Ambassadors, based on his experiences. Since then, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in the US State Department has sponsored the Jazz Ambassadors in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Alongside performances, they also conduct master classes and lecture-recitals for local musicians in addition to performing public concerts.

She was known for her work's clean lines and distinctive glazes, as well as for her line of tableware created under her family-run company Irving Place Studio. Also a muralist working with tile, De Larios was noted for her style, which reflects mythological and pan-cultural themes. Early life and education Born in Los Angeles to Mexican immigrant parents, De Larios grew up in downtown Los Angeles near Silver Lake, where she was surrounded by Mexican and Nisei Japanese immigrants. This diverse community, as well as her childhood trips to the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a in Mexico City, inspired her to create artwork that blended influences from ancient American and Japanese ceramics. She studied with potters Otto and Vivika Heino and Susan Peterson at the University of Southern California. Her professors exposed her to the work of radical ceramic artists, notably Peter Voulkos, whose abstract work encouraged her to explore non- functional forms in clay. She graduated in 1957 with a major in ceramics and a minor in sculpture. Career Upon graduation, De Larios set up an independent studio in Los Angeles and sold her work through venues that included Gump's in San Francisco. In her figural sculptures, she developed a distinct style that derived from traditional Japanese Haniwa. In the 1960s, artist and impresario Millard Sheets hired De Larios, along with other notable ceramists including Harrison McIntosh and Jerry Rothman, to design tiles for the Franciscan Ceramics division of Interpace in Los Angeles. Beginning in the late 1960s, she began experimenting with bronze, creating sculptures based on her personal experiences. Inspired by her participation in the Mask Festival at the Craft and Folk Art Museum, De Larios began experimenting with the mask form in the 1980s, drawing on religious and spiritual traditions from around the world. She has stated that she \\"loves working on large things\\" in public spaces: \\"I think that I can reach more people, and I think that part of what is for me is a healing process. It has always been enticing for me. It reaches you somewhere that has nothing to do with money. It replenishes the spirit. I like having my art in a public space because you never know who you're going to help.\\" For the majority of her career, De Larios was not represented by galleries, instead selling her work through regular studio sales. On January 28, 2018, Dora De Larios died in Culver City, California at the age of 84 after a four-year battle with ovarian cancer. Selected Exhibitions De Larios's work has been featured in a number of solo and group exhibitions across Southern California, including the M.O.A. Gallery in West Hollywood (1988 and 1990), Marsha Rodell Gallery in Brentwood (1982), Bakersfield College (1982) Anhalt Gallery in Los Angeles (1967, 1969 and 1974) and Zora Gallery in Los Angeles (1964). In 2009, the Craft and Folk Art Museum hosted Sue√±os / Yume: Fifty Years of the Art of Dora De Larios a retrospective of De Larios's work, curated by Elaine Levin. In 2011, she was prominently featured in Art Along the Hyphen: The Mexican-American Generation at Autry Museum of the American West. The same year, she was included in Common Ground, Ceramics in Southern California 1945‚Äì1975' at the American Museum of Ceramic Art. Both exhibitions were organized as part of the Getty Foundation's Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. initiative. In 2017, two of De Larios's sculptures were included in the exhibition Found in Translation: Design in California and Mexico, 1915-1985 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The exhibition highlighted the artist's deep connections to ancient Mexican art. That year, the artist donated her Goddess totems (2009) to the museum's permanent collection. In 2018, the Main Museum in downtown Los Angeles organized a retrospective of her work, Dora De Larios: Other Worlds. Craig Krull Gallery in Santa Monica organized exhibitions of her work in 2017 and 2019. The 2017 exhibition featured De Larios along with three other Mexican American artists, Gilbert Luj√°n, Carlos Almarez, and Elsa Flores Almaraz. The 2019 exhibition The Studio is My Church featured paintings on paper from the last year of the artist's life, along with ceramic sculptures. Major Commissions In 1970‚Äì1971, De Larios created, as a lead artist through the Franciscan Ceramics division of Interpace, the Grand Canyon Concourse fourth floor lobby mural in the Disney World Contemporary Resort in Orlando. The 18,000 square foot mural, designed by Mary Blair, was executed on 12\\" square ceramic tiles. In 1977, De Larios was one of fourteen artists commissioned to make a dinnerware set for the Senate Wives Luncheon at the White House. The series was later exhibited at the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery. Other public commissions include: * Life Force in Laguna Beach, 2003 * Koi Goddesses at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, 1997 * Tree of Life in Culver City, 1997 *Homage to Quetzalcoatl at Villa-Park Community Center in Pasadena, 1992 * The Elements in Los Angeles, 1989 * The World According to Dora at the Hilton Anaheim, 1984 * Exterior murals for public libraries in Compton (1973), Lynwood (1977), Norwood (1977) and Rowland Heights (1978).

History  = Education and Early Career = Immigrating to Canada in 1965, Shim worked collaboratively with her husband, Howard Sutcliffe, since the beginning of her career. The couple met at the University of Waterloo, where they both obtained a Bachelor of Environmental Studies in 1981 and a Bachelor of Architecture in 1983. Concurrently in 1981, Shim began an apprenticeship under Arthur Erickson Architects, an acclaimed designer in Vancouver. She moved to Toronto to join Baird / Sampson Architects from 1983 to 1987, and concurrently started teaching at the University of Toronto's John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture in 1988. During her professorship, she designed several pieces of furniture with Howard Sutcliffe; she described this collaboration as her ‚Äúway to explore ideas and source materials.‚Äù In 1989, Shim married Sutcliffe and the couple started to expand their portfolio. = Career = The works of Shim are inseparable from her husband, Howard Sutcliffe. Some of their earliest collaborations include an architectural garden in Don Mills in 1989, a remote lakefront house in Haliburton, Ontario in 1991 and their own house in 1993. All three projects won awards from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the two residential projects also won awards from the Canada Wood Council. A milestone for the establishment of Shim-Sutcliffe in 1994 was the couple's own house. A small residential project on a laneway property in Toronto, it is rich in detail and has been described as a built manifesto for their work. Shim and her husband both share an appreciation towards landscape, and an admiration for craft and culture. They draw inspiration from architects such as Carlo Scarpa, Alvar Aalto, and the De Stijl Group, as well as from traditional Japanese architecture. They have said that Charles and Ray Eames are role models for their joy during the design process. Shim explains that they ‚Äúlook like they have a lot of fun. A lot of people do good design, but don‚Äôt have a life.‚Äù From 1997 to 2002, Shim- Sutcliffe designed some of the most recognized projects in Ontario: Craven Road House in Toronto (1997), Ledbury Park in Toronto (1999), the dining hall for Moorelands Camp at Lake Kawagama (2002), and a boathouse on Lake Muskoka (2004). In the following years, Shim and her firm continued to expand their portfolio to include further institutional, gallery and religious buildings. These projects include a library and chapel at Massey College (2006), the Corkin Gallery (2010), the Frum Collection of African Art at the Art Gallery of Ontario (2008) and the Bet Ha'am Synagogue in Portland, Maine (2008). One of the firm's most notable buildings, the Integral House in Toronto was designed in 2009. = Professorship = Shim joined the University of Toronto's John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture in 1988. Currently, she is a tenured professor at the University of Toronto. Shim is also a visiting lecturer at institutions including Harvard and Yale. Her courses are associated with her practice and expertise, including core design studios, advanced design studios, and History and Theory of Landscape Architecture. * Visiting Critics Studio at Carleton University of Architecture (1990) * Visiting Professor for the Thesis Program at McGill University School of Architecture (1992) * Visiting professorship at Harvard University Graduate School of Design (1996 and 1993) * Henry Bishop Visiting Chair (2001) * Visiting Bicentennial Professor in Canadian Studies (2001) at Yale School of Architecture * Held the invited international visiting professorship at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (2002) * 2014, 2010, and 2005 Eero Saarinen Visiting Professor at Yale School of Architecture * Martell Distinguished Visiting Critic at the University at Buffaloof Architecture and Planning (2006) * Martell Distinguished Visiting Critic at the University of Buffalo‚Äôs School of Architecture and Planning (2006) * Shim was the William B. and Charlotte Shepherd Davenport Visiting Professor (2008) * Somerville Visiting Lecturer at the University of Calgary's Faculty of Environmental Design (2013) * Portman Visiting Critic at Georgia Institute of Technology College of Design (2016)  Design Philosophy and Style  Shim highly values the interlocking of architecture and nature. She is known to heighten the importance of landscape in architectural design and tries to ensure that the architecture fits its circumstances. Her interest in nature especially shows in her use of water. She has described how water extends our experience of a public space, garden or house. Shim has asserted that small-scale houses are a preferred typology to work with when being experimental. Her works are known to be modest in output, but with high levels of creativity and functionality. As one critic, Kelvin Browne wrote: ‚ÄúTheir work is poised between what I think of as art ‚Äî beautiful, pure sculptural moments ‚Äî and spaces that smartly respond to functional imperatives.‚Äù Her pursuit for the high level of completeness in details derives from her interests in interrelated scales of architecture. Shim and Sutcliffe have been collaborating on furniture designs since the beginning of their career. Their designs have been produced by the furnishing company, Nienkamper. In her office, she prefers to stay small in staff and projects in order to work out every detail of the project. Currently, Shim- Sutcliffe Architects is composed of just over 10 architects. Shim and her colleagues annually design one or two projects, to establish a deep and mutual connection with the client. She says of the studio's work style: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pretty efficient. We can crank out more work in a short time than a lot of larger outfits.‚Äù  Notable projects  = Laneway House (Toronto, 1993) = Laneway House is one of the earliest works that demonstrates Shim's experimental mindset in her architectural career. Shim and Howard are the client and the architect themselves, entirely designing for what they appreciate in a dwelling. The fundamental question that started this project was, ‚Äúcan a laneway housing work in Toronto?‚Äù The concept derived from the rapid and messy advancements in Toronto from 1870 to 1930. The deficiency and unordered developments led to establishments in laneways. However, the problems arise from the essences in dwelling. A laneway house's issues with privacy, noise and smells suggest many potential ruins to the quality of life. Shim and Howard initiated the project by buying a junker lot, near Queen and Leslie, shoved with abandoned cars. Consequently, three more lots were purchased to stitch them into a regular sized lot. The approval process required many devotes as the City of Toronto refused the permission. However, the proposal was taken to the Ontario Municipal Board, which allowed the progression of the concept, ‚Äòlaneway suites‚Äô in Toronto. The inexpensive apartment on top of a garage has a modest appearance. Arranged with concrete walls, the living contains two bedrooms, one bathroom and a small office on the second floor. The stacked volumes are pierced by the naturally lit staircase that is aligned with a shining Venetian plastered wall. All the studies that accompanied the Laneway Housing designs are thoughtfully documented to ‚ÄòSite Unseen‚Äô by Shim and Donald Chong, her colleague, in 2003. = Moorelands Camp Dining Hall (Dorset, 2000) = Moorelands Camp Dining Hall is one of Shim‚Äôs works that best showcases her appreciation towards nature. Only accessible by boat, the project sits in the middle of Northern Ontario, surrounded by rocky peninsulas, pine forests and lakes. Its functionality is to provide a camp with wilderness experience for children who are underprivileged due to financial constraints. The Dining Hall takes the form of a barn and tries to blur the boundary between outside and inside. The combination of twelve glulam trusses, small dimension lumbers, and light steel elements compose a wooden tent-like structure. At its center, the motorized greenhouse glazing system shines natural light along the roof ridge and floods the space, creating a spiritual impression. All these merge to create mindful fabrication details that Shim always pursues. A jury from Governor General‚Äôs Medals in Architecture describes Moorelands Camp Dining Hall as ‚Äúa modest project that exhibits a very strong spatial and tectonic idea.‚Äù Integral House = Integral House (Toronto, 2009) = The project demonstrates the connection with the client that Shim strongly values as an architect. Having a multi-faceted client, Dr. James Stewart, was the biggest factor in creating a unique residence that can host intimate or public musical concerts. He is an acclaimed mathematician, a philanthropist, and a professional violinist. His affection towards curves are transferred to provide both the start and the end point of the design. Integral House is a private residence, situated in the middle of Toronto‚Äôs Rosedale Ravine. It is a collective facility that includes a residence of five floors with four bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a concert hall that can host over 150 people. The Integral House tries to create a smooth transition from the bottom of the ravine slope to the top of tree bushes. From its exterior, the Integral House reads as two volumes, a wooden base on the ground, and a translucent glass volume that floats on top. The wooden base is solidly cladded with oak, dissolving into oak fins and curved glass above. The sun shading and acoustically isolating vertical fins gently forms the perimeter of the house, resonating the undulation throughout the river valley. The materiality throughout the building demonstrates Shim‚Äôs attempt to connect with nature. The inside features sensuous details such as the hand blown laminated glass staircase, which is a collaborated artwork with a glass artist, Mimi Gellman. As the cast bronze clips and stainless steel cables support the staircase, it tries to resemble warmth in nature. The project not only pursues natural beauty but also sustainability. Geothermal pipes are buried below the driveway for heating and cooling of all programs and the green roof above adds to the effect by reducing the heat island effect. = Other Notable Projects = * Garden Pavilion and Reflecting Pool (Don Mills, 1992) * Muskoka Boathouse (Lake Muskoka, 1999) * Weathering Steel House (Toronto, 2001) * Corkin Gallery (Toronto, 2004) * Craven Road Studio (Toronto, 2006) * House on the Ravine Edge (Toronto, 2011)  Awards  All of the projects to date honored Shim many renowned awards such as fourteen Governor General‚Äôs Medals for architecture, Wood Design Honor Awards, and American Institute of Architects National Honor Awards. Currently, Shim is an invested officer of ‚ÄòThe Order of Canada‚Äô \\"for her contributions as an architect, designing structures that enrich the public realm\\". Not only was she awarded many honors over the years, but she was also a part of the jury for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2007.

Wookey holds a B.F.A. in Dance from Ohio State University and an M.F.A. in Dance from UCLA. Her practice explores social and spatial approaches to dance and choreography. Choreography Wookey established herself as a young choreographer in the Netherlands where she was based between 1996-2006. There she was supported by grants from the Netherlands Funds for the Performing Arts and Amsterdam Funds for the Arts, among others. Danswerkplaats Amsterdam (now Dansmakers), a dance house, administered her projects. She created over a dozen evening-length dance works that toured in Europe and North America. Her solo work \\"Disappearing Acts & Resurfacing Subjects: Concerns of (a) Dance Artist(s)\\" (2014) premiered at the New Museum, NYC as part of the Performance Archiving Performance program. Civic Art Projects in Los Angeles From 2008-2014 Wookey worked as an artist in Los Angeles, California. She worked on several collaborative projects namely Being Pedestrian with artist Sara Daleiden. From 2012-2014 Wookey was a consultant with the Creative Services Department at LA Metro where she designed Metro Art Moves You artist-led tours of public art along Los Angeles's light rail lines. There she taught at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and initiated a partnership between CalArts and the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles where art students proposed creative civic projects to urban planners and stakeholders in downtown Los Angeles. Museum Projects Wookey has been engaged with museums since the late 1990s presenting her work, engaging in learning programs and lecturing. Notable commissions include: \\"Performing Navigations: (Re)Mapping the Museum\\" (2010) at the Hammer Museum and \\"Punt.Point\\" (2014) at van Abbe Museum in the Netherlands. Yvonne Rainer Wookey has worked closely with choreographer Yvonne Rainer since the 2010. She is one of five dance artists certified by Rainer to teach and perform her iconic work Trio A (1966). Rainer's other works: Chair Pillow 1969, Diagonal (part of Terrain) 1963; and Talking Solo (part of Terrain) 1963 are also taught and performed by Wookey. Much of Wookey's own practice is closely connected to her work in the Netherlands in the 1990s, American Post-Modern dance and European contexts for dance. Her practice is closely connected to ideas of transmission, value and language. In \\"Disappearing Acts & Resurfacing Subjects: Concerns of (a) Dance Artist(s) (2014) Wookey meditated on dance as an ephemeral dance form and questioned what this meant for institutions as well as for the dancer's themselves. In the work, Wookey referenced her own previous chreographies, her work with Rainer, direct address, use of props and video to create an independent performance work. Her 2013 project, reDance, featured re-enacted works and processes of renowned choreographers of the Judson Dance Theater. Activism Wookey actively advocates for the rights of dance artists. In 2011 she auditioned for Marina Abramoviƒá's An Artist's LIfe's Manifesto\\"‚Äîa group performance work created by Abramovic for the 2011 Annual Gala at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

The architect is attributed to either or both Giorgio di GiovanniGuida d'Italia.and/or Baldassare Peruzzi. In 1554 the site was occupied by the besieging forces of Cosimo di Medici, as a stone inscription on the walls recalls, and his son Giangiacomo dei Medici reinstated the site as a fortress. In the 19th century, the Camaiori family refurbished the villa in a neo-Renaissance style, with gardens and courtyards, with the designs of Serafino Belli and Giuseppe Partini. The grounds have a private chapel with frescoes, all enclosed by fortress walls.Giardini e ville nella Provincia di Siena - Guida, entry on Castel Belcaro, dated 25/03/2014.

For 13 years she taught part-time at Brock and officially became full-time in 2006, teaching acting, directing and voice. Her vocal work includes directing all the voices for the last 76 episodes of Sailor Moon that were dubbed into English. She has directed Ring Round the Moon, Marat/Sade, A Little Night Music, Phedre, Orpheus Descending, and The Blue Room for mainstage DART productions. She has worked professionally with Opera In Concert, Toronto Operetta Theatre and Tapestry New Opera. Reh was founding co-director of Script Lab, developing plays, musicals and film scripts. She was artistic director of the Gryphon Theatre. For many years Reh was acting coach and production manager to the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus. In 1994, Reh received the Theatre Ontario's Maggie Bassett award for outstanding contribution to theatre in Ontario. Reh organized a national conference, Lyric Canada 2010, bringing together the creators and scholars of Canadian music theatre and opera. Reh was an Ontario councillor for the Canadian Actors' Equity Association and secretary/treasurer of the executive through 2012. In the course of nine years at Brock she directed seven main stage. Early life Reh began acting at a young age with the Emerson Players, a community theatre company based out of the unitarian church which she participated in with her parents in New York. She attended the University of Berkeley as a French major but soon transitioned to Dramatic Arts major after her first audition. In her studies at Berkeley, it was required for her to take directing courses for her masters, which then lead her to the Scholar Director PHD program. She dropped out of the PHD program so that she could pursue acting in a small theatre company in California. The company did not have enough directors, so she volunteered. She started directing seriously in the early 1980s, at a time when a movement of women playwrights and directors was beginning. Selected Theatre Work: Acting * Richard III: Queen Margaret/Edward IV.

The district contains 678 contributing properties covering 160 acres (65 ha) that represent the growth of the town from its founding in the 1880s through the 1950s. The town of Sheffield was founded in 1883, on the former site of a town known as York Bluff. Montgomery banker Alfred Moses founded the Sheffield Land, Iron, and Coal Company and began laying out streets in a north-south grid. Soon after the initial land sale in the town, five iron blast furnaces were built, along with landings and docks along the Tennessee River. Other industries and commercial businesses followed. The upper classes built large Victorian houses along the bluff overlooking the river, while more restrained Victorian cottages were built closer to the industrial district. A two-story commercial district, several churches, and a school were also built in the late 1880s. The town's economy suffered during the Panic of 1893, revived only in 1898 when the Southern Railway Company located its headquarters in Sheffield. Other industrial and commercial development followed through the 1900s, however residential construction did not resume in earnest until the mid-1900s. Development was spurred again in 1916, with the construction of Wilson Dam and two ammonium nitrate plants. Several apartment buildings (including one in Pueblo Revival style), as well as numerous bungalows and Colonial Revival houses were built to house the influx of people.

This care is provided to all permanent residents of the United Kingdom, free at the point of use and paid for from general taxation from a variety of hospitals, clinics and other public care settings, with private and voluntary services operating and funded independently. The ‚ÄúGreater Manchester Model‚Äù of NHS health care is a system uniquely devolved within England, by way of close integration with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and local authorities,https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/media/1676/greater- manchester-model.pdf with a vision led by the Mayor of Greater Manchester. As of 2015, ten clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) - one for each of Greater Manchester's metropolitan boroughs ‚Äì organise the delivery of NHS services within Greater Manchester. The chief executive of the corresponding local authorities are to take over the CCG accountable officer role on a phased dual basis, forming a ‚Äúsingle commissioning function‚Äù integrated with local government. History The Manchester Joint Hospitals Advisory Board was created in 1935 and reconstituted as the Manchester, Salford, and Stretford Joint Hospitals Advisory Board in 1942. It included representatives of the Public Health Committee, the Hospital Council, Manchester University and the Medical Officer of Health.Harry Platt pioneered the development of Orthopedic surgery in Manchester in the 1930s and the joint board built a new orthopaedic block at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1936 which was seen as a national example for effective coordination between the voluntary and statutory sectors. The North West Emergency Medical Service was run on a regional basis, which was not the case in other areas. From 1947 to 1974 NHS services in Greater Manchester (which did not then exist) were managed by the Manchester Regional Hospital Board, which also covered the boroughs of Buxton and Glossop and the urban districts of New Mills and Whaley Bridge. The first chair of the Board was Sir John Stopford, then Vice Chancellor of Manchester University. In 1974 the Boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The whole of the newly created Greater Manchester (and Glossop) came under the North Western RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Greater Manchester came under the North West Regional Health Authority. Greater Manchester from 1974 had 12 district health authorities, one for each of the smaller boroughs and three (North, South and Central) covering Manchester itself. The district health authorities took over responsibility for many of the health services previously managed by local authorities including vaccination, health centres, family planning, school health, health visiting and home nursing. In 1994 four new district health authorities were established covering Bury and Rochdale, Manchester, West Pennine, Salford and Trafford, while Wigan was unchanged. 12 primary care trusts were established covering the whole of the county in 2002: Ashton, Leigh and Wigan; Bolton; Bury; Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale; Manchester North, South and Central; Oldham; Salford; Stockport; Tameside and Glossop; Trafford. They were managed by the Greater Manchester Strategic Health Authority until 2006 and then by the North West SHA from 2002 until 2013. Commissioning The CCGs took on the responsibilities of the former PCTs on 1 April 2013. The three clinical commissioning groups for Manchester decided in September 2016 that they would merge in April 2017. The North West Commissioning support unit's work was transferred to Greater Manchester Support Services, hosted by Oldham Clinical Commissioning Group in 2016. Greater Manchester was one of the 4 areas chosen to trial the integration of specialised commissioning, previously run by NHS England centrally, in September 2016. In 2017 Trafford, Wigan, Rochdale and Oldham agreed to effective mergers with the council‚Äôs social care departments. Although they will still exist as statutory bodies the council chief executives will take over the CCG accountable officer role. This has already happened in Tameside. Manchester Health and Care Commissioning has been established through a partnership agreement between Manchester City Council and the CCG, although it has its own accountable officer. Geography The Tameside CCG still includes Glossop which is not, as far as local government is concerned, in Greater Manchester, but has been part of the Manchester health economy since 1947. The decision made in July 2015 about acute surgery in Greater Manchester taken by the 12 CCGs with the support of the 10 local authorities was explicitly determined by the interests of patients in High Peak. Primary and community care Oldham Integrated Care Centre There were 486 general practices in Greater Manchester in 2018. About 3 million patients are registered. Hope Citadel Healthcare in Oldham was found to be outstanding by the Care Quality Commission in 2016. There are more than 700 community pharmacies. Out-of-hours services are provided by GO To DOC in Manchester, Tameside and Oldham, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust in Salford, Bolton NHS Foundation Trust in Bolton, Bardoc in Bury and Rochdale, Mastercall in Stockport and Trafford and Bridgewater Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in Wigan. Community care is provided by the hospital trusts in Manchester, and Tameside Bridgewater Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Hospice care is provided by St Ann's Hospice. A programme which provided more than 50,000 extra GP appointments in central Manchester, Bury and Heywood and Middleton in 2014 brought a 3% reduction in accident and emergency activity and is to be rolled out across the conurbation. An investment of ¬£41 million over 4 years was announced in February 2017 which promised access to a GP seven days a week across the conurbation. Healthwatch Healthwatch was set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to act as a voice for patients. There is a Healthwatch for each of the ten boroughs. Mental health J Lancelot Burn was appointed Medical Officer of Health for Salford in 1941. Mental health was one of his priorities and he was unusual in his view that the community, rather than an institution, was the natural care environment. He developed community resources including a therapeutic social club, a women‚Äôs day centre and collaboration with the University of Manchester‚Äôs Department of Social and Preventive Medicine. He appointed Mervyn Susser to be head of Salford City Council's mental health department in 1957. Susser organised Mental Welfare Officers around GP practices so that each GP had a known officer and sent copies of patients‚Äô progress reports to their GP. He appointed Hugh Freeman as a consultant psychiatrist with responsibilities across general and mental hospitals, out-patient clinics, and local authority services in 1961. By 1968 Salford was recognized for ‚Äòexcellent programmes‚Äô distinguished by their being driven by the local authority rather than the hospital. NHS mental health and learning disability services in the county are now provided by North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Calderstones Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, and Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. Mental health patients from Manchester were transferred to private clinics, many in remote locations, more than 670 times between 2013 and 2015. Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust paid more than ¬£7 million to private providers over this period. Between 2010 and 2015 there was a 5.9% cut in the number of mental health beds from 1,491 to 1,403. During the same period the number of people admitted by the three mental health trusts in the conurbation has increased by 23% from 8,327 to 10,246. Hospital and acute care NHS hospital services are provided by Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust, and Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. From April 2015 all new onset suspected stroke cases in the conurbation will be treated at one of three specialist ‚Äúhyperacute centres‚Äù at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust or Stockport NHS Foundation Trust where patients can get access to emergency ‚Äúclot busting‚Äù thrombolysis and immediate brain scans. District stroke units at other hospitals will remain open but their focus will be shifted to patient rehabilitation and recovery. It is hoped this move could save 50 lives a year. Following a prolonged consultation process called \\"Healthier Together\\" it was agreed in July 2015 that Stepping Hill Hospital, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Salford Royal Hospital and Royal Oldham Hospital will be the ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù in emergency and high risk general surgery. This decision was challenged by consultants at University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust who launched a campaign under the banner \\"Keep Wythenshawe Special\\" and an unsuccessful action for judicial review, claiming the decision was unlawfully based on the impact on travel times for patients outside Greater Manchester. Every acute trust in Greater Manchester apart from Bolton announced that they expected a deficit at March 2016, a total ¬£114m deficit. In January 2016 Sir Jonathan Michael was appointed to provide independent oversight of plans for a ‚Äúsingle hospital service‚Äù in Manchester which is intended to bring together Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust to provide single clinical services across the city. Devo Manc In May 2018 Jon Rouse announced that there would be a review of hospital specialities across the region which would lead to proposal for reconfiguration in paediatrics, respiratory, cardiology, orthopaedics, breast services, neuro-rehabilitation, benign urology, critical care and anaesthetics, and vascular services. =Initial arrangements= In February 2015 it was announced by George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the conurbation was to be given more control over the NHS budget of around ¬£6 billion per annum. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed by NHS England, 12 NHS clinical commissioning groups, 15 NHS providers and 10 local authorities and countersigned by Osborne and Jeremy Hunt. It builds on the work of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority which was agreed in November 2014 by the leaders of the 10 local authorities and which will lead to the election of a Mayor for Greater Manchester. There will be a new health and social care chief executive who will be accountable for the ¬£6bn devolved health and care budget. A health and social care partnership board will be responsible for ‚Äúshaping the strategic direction‚Äù of services in the region from April 2016. There will be a joint commissioning board consisting of representatives from the councils, CCGs and NHS England which will make ‚Äúdecisions about where funds go‚Äù. Norman Warner called the project ‚ÄúHealthopolis‚Äù and describes two great strengths: \\"First, it resolves the fragmentation of leadership, commissioning and service delivery that undermines most modern health and social care systems. Second, it aligns NHS and social care with other resources that build wellbeing, such as housing, transport and job support, all at the same devolved level.\\" He has been told that 20% of the local population will be offered unprecedented one-to-one, intensive primary and community care, using all available tools, to eliminate at least 60,000 acute hospital admissions a year. The conurbation was facing a recurring health and social care budget deficit of ¬£500m a year by 2017-18 and it is hoped that this approach will halve the problem. Manchester University published a report on developments in 2018 which they described as ‚Äúsoft devolution‚Äù because unlike most devolution reforms, there is no statutory basis, just agreements for administrative delegation. There are no substantial differences between the policies followed locally and national policies, but there is more control over implementation than in other areas. Although the Greater Manchester Partnership behaves in some ways like a strategic health authority it actually has little formal power over NHS bodies and none over local authorities. Positive relationships have been established, but they have not been tested. They agree that more co-ordination may improve care, but they doubt if it will save money. =Interim arrangements= In April 2015 Ian Williamson, Chief Executive of Central Manchester Clinical Commissioning Group was appointed interim chief officer for the project. ¬£2 million will be spent developing the project in 2015/6. Plans include ensuring that a GP made available in the local area for every Greater Manchester resident on Sunday. In July 2015 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Council leaders, Public Health England, NHS England and local NHS organisations to create a single public health leadership for the whole of the conurbation, with a pooled budget. Salford is one of the areas selected to pilot Integrated primary and acute care systems, and Stockport to pilot Multispecialty community providers, under the Five Year Forward View. Mark Hutchinson, Chief Information Officer of University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust is leading the development of a system which will make available an integrated record of key information to clinicians across the conurbation using Graphnet's CareCentric Patient Portal. In November 2015 it was reported that ‚Äòradical scaling up‚Äô of shared services between NHS trusts across the conurbation such as diagnostics, back office support and pathology was envisaged in order to save money. A transformation fund of ¬£450 million has been allocated by NHS England to the project for the period 2015-20. This is said to be the conurbation's fair share of the national transformation budget. It will not be used to cover NHS trusts deficits but will be used for double running costs. =Operational arrangements= In February 2016 it was reported that the Chief Officer (Jon Rouse) for NHS in Greater Manchester, who was soon to be appointed to the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership would be responsible for: *Half the specialised services budget, previously managed by NHS England *The public health budgets previously managed by NHS England *Dental care, pharmacy services and primary optical services *The running costs of NHS England as far as they relate to the conurbation *The transformation funds In March 2016 Howard Bernstein was appointed the leader of the Greater Manchester Sustainability and transformation plan footprint. In 2016-17 the region reported an overall surplus of ¬£237 million, which was regarded as significantly better than the average in the English NHS. Jon Rouse resigned in November 2019. =Technology= The Manchester CCGs and the City Council set up a shared Care Record scheme in 2015. From April 2015 it is to incorporate an Electronic Palliative Care and Coordination System which will be available to the 90 GP practices in the city. It captures a patient‚Äô wishes and key information in the last years of life, such as do not resuscitate orders. A Bolton Care Record was launched in September 2017, although Bolton was said to be falling bind the rest of the conurbation. The public-sector IT specialist, Shaping Cloud, was engaged in 2018 to conduct an asset review of the current software applications used across 20 NHS and local government organisations involved in the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership. A partnership between Health Innovation Manchester and the Association of British HealthTech Industries, to be known as the Greater Manchester Health Technologies Group was announced in November 2018. =Development= By November 2019 when Rouse left it appeared that enthusiasm for the devolution project in health was waning in Whitehall. Greater Manchester was no longer treated as exceptional, but integrated into the NHS England regional structure. Financial performance was slightly better than average but performance against A&E; targets was worse. A provider federation board has been established, which has taken over some of the functions and funding of the devolution team. The Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, declared a climate emergency in April and produced a sustainable development management plan in January 2020. This plans to save approximately 2 million pieces of plastic cutlery and 800,000 straws and stirrers per year by switching to sustainable alternatives. It hopes to replace single-use surgical gowns with reusable, laundered versions and to reduce the use of medical gloves. In June 2020 Andy Burnham proposed that Greater Manchester should be a pilot for the next phase of joining up social care with NHS services. He envisaged a joined up workforce, including more common training; a ‚Äúnew deal‚Äù of pay and conditions for care staff; funding flows via a combined ‚Äúyear of care‚Äù health and care tariff; and further institutional integration.

Role shift By war's end, both Cigarette and City camps' roles had shifted from gateways to combat staging GIs for repatriation to the U.S., processing liberated American POWs, and temporarily confining German POWs. Post-war, many of the camps survived with yet new roles, including housing for displaced persons at least into the mid-1950s. References External links * Locating Camp Twenty Grand.

He then took over Antioch, and launched a failed attack on the Hamdanid capital, Aleppo in early 966. He took the lower city and besieged the citadel for over three months, but was killed and his men fled back to Antioch.  Life  Rashiq is first mentioned in late 961, as commanding a Tarsian army sent to confront the invasion of the Byzantines under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, who were besieging Ayn Zarba. Rashiq tried to break the siege, but was defeated with heavy loss: according to Yahya of Antioch, 5,000 Tarsians fell and 4,000 were taken prisoner, while Rashiq managed to flee. As a result, Ayn Zarba surrendered (December 961/January 962). Then the governor of Tarsus, Ibn az-Zayyat, who had tried to break free from Hamdanid control, confronted the Byzantines but was also defeated. The Tarsians turned once more to Sayf al-Dawla for protection from the Byzantines, and Ibn az-Zayyat committed suicide, whereupon Sayf al-Dawla appointed Rashiq as his successor. In 963, Rashiq led a summer raid (·π£ƒÅ‚Äôifa) into Byzantine territory, and captured the Byzantine commander of Heraclea (possibly to be identified with Eustathios Maleinos). Such feats were not able to change the tide of the conflict, however. Following the sack of Sayf al-Dawla's own residence, Aleppo, in December 962, the Byzantines under Nikephoros Phokas, who became emperor in 963, firmly held the upper hand, while the Hamdanid ruler, whose prestige was sorely shaken by the sack of his capital, was debilitated by internal revolts. Having already diminished the military strength of Tarsus by his previous victories, the removal of the Hamdanid threat allowed Nikephoros to concentrate on the conquest of Cilicia: Adana fell in 963, while al-Masissa (Mopsuestia, modern Misis) was attacked in 964 and the Byzantines raided widely across the region. Cyprus was taken by a Byzantine fleet in early 965, while in the summer, Nikephoros moved his army once more against al-Masissa, which capitulated on 13 July. Tarsus was next, and after a brief siege, the city surrendered on 16 August. Rashiq fled to Antioch, where he managed to exploit the power vacuum to become governor and launch an attack on Aleppo, although the sources differ on the exact course of events. According to the hagiography of Patriarch Christopher of Antioch, he promised tribute and hostages to Nikephoros, while gaining the support of the populace. Along with the Hamdanid tax official al-Hasan ibn al-Ahwazi, he then ousted Sayf al- Dawla's appointed governor, Abu Thamal Fath al-Yamki. Ibn Shaddad on the other hand reports that it was Ibn al-Ahwazi who incited Rashiq to revolt, and that the latter played a double game, promising tribute both to Sayf al-Dawla and Nikephoros Phokas. Sayf al-Dawla accepted his offer of an annual sum of 600,000 dirhams, but, citing the imminence of the Byzantine threat, Rashiq deposed the governor Abu Thamal, seized control of the city (October 965) and offered the money promised to Sayf al-Dawla to the Byzantine emperor instead. All sources agree that Rashiq's coup was followed by a treaty between the Antiochenes and Nikephoros, which obliged the former to pay an annual tribute. Rashiq then (on 31 January 966, according to Ibn Shaddad) launched an attack on Aleppo. His troops and the Hamdanid loyalists under Qarghuyah gave many battles, but Rashiq succeeded in capturing the lower city and laid siege to the citadel for three months and ten days, until he was killed in a skirmish and his men fled back towards Antioch.

H. Gill, Ed. Meusel: XLI. On paraffin and the products of its oxidation. In: Journal of the Chemical Society. 21, 1868, p. 466, . The fatty acids are further processed to consumer products such as soaps and fats as well as to lubricating greases for technical applications. Coal slack wax, a saturated, high molecular weight hydrocarbon mixture and by-product of the Fischer-Tropsch process was used as raw material. Side products were a wide range of carboxylic acids and oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, esters, or ketones. The oxidation of paraffins was carried out in the liquid phase by molecular oxygen, e.g. by aerating with oxygen or atmospheric air, in the presence of catalysts such as permanganates, e.g. 0.1% - 0.3% potassium permanganate, at temperatures in the range of about 100 to 120 ¬∞C and under atmospheric pressure.Eugen Schaal, Patent US 335962 A, Converting Petroleum and similar Hydrocarbons into Acids, 9. February 1886.  History  The process was commercially important from the mid 1930s on and was carried out until the first years after the Second World War on a large industrial scale. Paraffin oxidation enabled for first time the large-scale production of synthetic butter from coal by chemical means which was at that time seen as a sensation.Arthur Imhausen: Die Fetts√§ure-Synthese und ihre Bedeutung f√ºr die Sicherung der deutschen Fettversorgung. In: Kolloid-Zeitschrift. 103, 1943, p. 105‚Äì108, . Because of the high availability of inexpensive natural fats and the competition by petroleum-based fatty alcohols, the process lost its importance in the early 1950s.  Process  The process consisted of three main steps: oxidation, reconditioning of the oxidation mixture to crude fatty acids and eventually their separation by fractional distillation into fatty acid fractions.G. Wietzel: Herstellung synthetischer Fetts√§uren durch Oxydation von paraffinischen Kohlenwasserstoffen mit molekularem Sauerstoff. In: Chemical Engineering Science. 3, 1954, p. 17‚ÄìIN4, . The chemical industry processed the fatty acid fractions further into finished products such as soaps, detergents, plasticizers and synthetic fat. The paraffin oxidation was almost exclusively run in a discontinuous batch mode. Fractions were selected based on the intended purposes of each of the desired products: * -: Acids used for industrial purposes, recovered from the vapors given off during the oxidation process * -: Reduced to alcohols * -: Froth flotation * -: Reacted with glycerol to produce edible fats such as synthetic margarine * -: Soap * -: Metallic soap, lithium soap, etc.  Mechanism  The first explanation for oxidation mechanism was given by the peroxide theory, developed by Alexei Nikolaevich Bach and Carl Engler, also known as the Engler-Bach theory. According to their theory, as the first step a secondary hydroperoxide is formed. The assumption that this hydroperoxide is then radically decomposed was confirmed by later studies by Eric Rideal. * R-H + O2 ‚Üí ROOH The function of metal catalyst is to increase the speed of both the formation and decomposition of the hydroperoxide. This produces, among other things, an alkyl radical, which forms with oxygen peroxo radikals. This forms by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from another molecule paraffin a new alkyl radical and a hydroperoxide. The mechanism of the reaction follows the following scheme:F. Asinger: Paraffins. Chemistry and Technology. Elsevier, 1968, , p. 617 File:Oxidation of paraffins.svg As a first step the formation of a hydroperoxide occurs, which degrades as the main reaction into water and a ketone.

She was the executive director of the Kentucky Foundation for Women. Early life and education Anderson was born in Frankfort, Kentucky. Along with her two sisters, Ann Stewart was a ‚ÄúPK,‚Äù a Preacher‚Äôs Kid, the daughters of Olof Anderson and Martha Ward Jones Anderson. Rev. Anderson led Presbyterian congregations in Lebanon and Richmond, KY., before moving his family to Louisville to head Harvey Browne Memorial Presbyterian Church. She graduated from Wellesley College with a B.A. in History of Art in 1957, and earned a Master in Art (Painting) from The American University in 1961. She attended the Corcoran School of Art and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Career Anderson worked at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in the late 1950s and taught art in the Montgomery County, Maryland schools before relocating to Chicago. From 1964 to 1975, she was employed by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she quickly rose to become Dean of Students, a position that tempered her spirit and tested her diplomatic skills as she dealt with students involved in the heady days of the late 1960s, including the protests around the Democratic Convention of 1968. After two unsuccessful attempts at applying for the Mary Elvira Stevens Traveling Fellowship, awarded to Wellesley alumnae, she won the fellowship in 1975, when she was 40. With the Stevens Fellowship, Ann Stewart spent a year in Egypt working on a photographic project, finding scenes of daily life from modern-day Cairo and Egyptian villages (plowing, planting, harvesting; making beer and bread and mud-bricks; plucking ducks; fishing with nets in the river delta) that mirrored those depicted in Pharaonic-era tomb paintings from 3, 000 years ago. After returning to Kentucky in 1975, Anderson served as artist-in-residence at St. Francis High School in Louisville and later as executive director of the Kentucky Foundation for Women. In 1985, she collaborated on an NEA-funded project called Hot Flash Fan with the feminist artist Judy Chicago, a giant multi-media project addressing menopause that included work by over 50 artists. A 60-year retrospective exhibition of her work, \\"Looking Back/Moving Forward,\\" was mounted at PYRO Art Gallery in Louisville in 2009.

Part of a series of Jacobite risings between 1689 to 1745, it was the only one to be supported by Spain, then at war with Britain during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The main part of the plan called for 5,000 Spanish troops to land in South West England, with a subsidiary landing in Scotland by an expeditionary force, led by Charles XII of Sweden. To facilitate this, Scottish Jacobites would capture the port of Inverness; however, Charles' death in November 1718 ended Swedish involvement, and the purpose of the Scottish rising. In late March, a small force of Spanish marines and Jacobite exiles landed in Stornoway, where they learned the Spanish invasion fleet had been severely damaged by storms, and the invasion of England cancelled. The Rising ended with defeat at the Battle of Glen Shiel in June. Jacobite leaders felt the revolt actively damaged the Stuart cause; over the next few years, senior exiles including Bolingbroke, and the Earl of Seaforth, accepted pardons and returned home. Others, such as James and George Keith, ended active participation in Jacobite plots, and took employment with other states. Many felt it ended any real prospects for a Restoration, including James Stuart himself. Background Cape Passaro, August 1718; Spanish defeat in the Mediterranean prompted Alberoni's support for the 1719 Rising When the War of the Spanish Succession ended in 1713, Spain lost its Italian possessions of Sicily and Sardinia. Their recovery was a priority for Giulio Alberoni, the new Chief Minister, and Sardinia was reoccupied in 1717. When Spanish troops landed on Sicily in July 1718, the Royal Navy destroyed the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Passaro, beginning the War of the Quadruple Alliance. After the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the 1716 Anglo-French Treaty expelled the Stuarts from France and permitted a smooth succession by George I. The 1715 Jacobite Rising showed they retained significant support, and Alberoni sought to use this to divert British resources from the Mediterranean. He devised a plan whereby 5,000 Spanish troops under the exiled Duke of Ormonde would land in South-West England, march on London and restore James Stuart. Ormonde added another element, based on his involvement in peace talks between Sweden and Russia. Charles XII of Sweden was then in dispute with Hanover over territories in Germany, an example of the problems caused by George I being ruler of both Hanover and Britain. A small Scottish force would secure Inverness, allowing a Swedish expeditionary force to disembark; Charles' death in November 1718 ended Swedish participation, and the entire purpose of the Scottish rising. Charles XII of Sweden; his death in November 1718 ended Swedish participation, and the purpose of the Scottish rising Preparations were carried out in Cadiz, while Ormonde and James waited in Coru√±a. A Royal Navy squadron took up station outside Cadiz, watching the Spanish fleet; as the delays continued, Ormonde wrote a series of increasingly pessimistic letters to Alberoni, telling him the plan was no longer viable. Unlike many contemporaries, Alberoni had direct experience of amphibious operations, and historians question whether he ever intended to follow through with the invasion plan. In any case, it was only part of a far more ambitious plan to reshape Europe; this included partitioning the Ottoman empire, and replacing the duc d'Orl√©ans, then Regent of France, with Philip V of Spain. Cape Passaro demonstrated the Royal Navy's power in far less favourable circumstances, making it unlikely the Spanish fleet would even reach England, let alone be allowed to disembark large numbers of troops. As the French demonstrated on numerous occasions, a threatened invasion was as useful in occupying the Royal Navy and far less risky, which would explain Alberoni's apparent lack of concern at the delays. The fleet left Cadiz in late March, but was severely damaged by a two day storm off Cape Finisterre. It put into Coru√±a on 29 March, where it remained. The Scottish landing was commanded by George Keith, who left Pasajes on 8 March, accompanied by 300 Spanish marines aboard two frigates. They landed at Stornoway in the Isle of Lewis, where they were joined by a group of exiles from France; these included the Earl of Seaforth, James Keith, the Marquess of Tullibardine, Lord George Murray and Cameron of Lochiel. Britain later complained about the French allowing them free passage; one suggestion is they did so hoping to reduce expensive pensions granted by Louis XIV to Jacobite exiles. Tullibardine wanted to wait until they heard from Ormonde, while Keith urged capturing Inverness before the garrison was warned. His view prevailed; on 13 April, they landed at Lochalsh in Mackenzie territory, and set up base in Eilean Donan. Here they learned of Ormonde's failure; as commander of Jacobite land forces, Tullibardine recommended retreat, which Keith prevented by ordering the frigates back to Spain. Left with few options, the Jacobites prepared to march on Inverness, with around 1,000 men, including 400 Mackenzies, 150 Camerons, the Spaniards and other small groups. Having brought arms and ammunition for 2,000, the excess was stored at Eilean Donan, guarded by 40 Spanish marines. Rising =Capture of Eilean Donan Castle= Eilean Donan, modern day After hearing of the landing in Stornoway, five ships of the Royal Navy arrived in the area at the beginning of May. Since they were unaware the Spanish frigates had already left, this was a substantial force which included the 50-gun fourth-rates HMS Assistance, Worcester, Dartmouth and Enterprise plus the 24-gun sloop, Flamborough. While Assistance and Dartmouth patrolled the waters around Skye, Worcester, Enterprise and Flamborough anchored off Eilean Donan on the north side of Loch Duich early in the morning of Sunday 10 May. Seeing this, Tullibardine marched inland; their options were limited since they could not escape by sea while a government force under Joseph Wightman was advancing towards them from Inverness. In the evening, a landing party captured the castle under cover of an intense cannonade and the prisoners were taken by Flamborough to Edinburgh.Excerpts from the official logs of HMS Worcester and HMS Flamborough - /log_01.htm Lt Randolph Barker, HMS Flamborough clan- macrae.org.uk. Retrieved January 14, 2017. Captain Boyle of Worcester recorded them as 'an Irish captain, a Spanish lieutenant, a Spanish sergeant, thirty- nine Spanish soldiers and a Scots rebel.' After blowing up the castle, the ships remained in Loch Duich for the next two weeks, searching for rebels, while raiding the nearby town of Stromeferry and the island of Raasay. =Battle of Glen Shiel= The Battle of Glen Shiel 10 June 1719 General Joseph Wightman left Inverness on 5 June for Glen Shiel with around 1,000 men and four Coehorn mortars. They reached Loch Cluanie on 9 June, less than 8 miles (13 km) from the Jacobite camp. Tullibardine blocked the pass running through the Five Sisters hills, with the Spanish in the centre and the Highlanders on the flanks behind a series of trenches and barricades. Wightman's force arrived about 4:00 pm on 10 June, and began the attack an hour later by firing their mortars at the Jacobite flanking positions. This caused few casualties but the Scots had not encountered mortars before, allowing Wightman's infantry to advance up the hill to their lines, then use grenades to bomb them out of their positions. The Spanish stood their ground but had to withdraw up the mountain as their flanks gave way. The battle lasted until 9:00 pm; several accounts claim the heather caught fire, and smoke combined with failing light enabled the bulk of the Scots to disappear into the night. The Spanish surrendered next morning, and as regular troops were shipped home; Lord George Murray, Seaforth and Tullibardine were wounded, but the Jacobite leaders also managed to escape. Despite the strength of the defensive positions, Wightman's victory was due to skilful use of mortars, superior firepower, and the aggression shown by his infantry. Lord Carpenter, commander in Scotland, advised the government pursuing the rebels was impractical, and it was best to let them go. In a letter of 16 June 1719 to the Earl of Mar, Tullibardine provides a description of the battle, and states 'it bid fair to ruin the King's Interest and faithful subjects in these parts.' Aftermath George Keith, one of many senior Jacobites who pursued a career with other European powers In October 1719, a British naval expedition captured the Spanish port of Vigo, held it for ten days, destroyed vast quantities of stores and equipment, then re-embarked unopposed, with huge quantities of loot. This demonstration of naval power led to Alberoni's dismissal, and ended Spanish support for the Jacobites. The government followed Carpenter's recommendation, and largely left the Highland levies alone, but Seaforth's tenants continued paying rents to him even in exile. The Mackenzies twice defeated attempts by the Commission of Forfeited Estates to collect them, first at Glen Affric, then Coille Bhan. This showed the Highlands could not be governed without the co-operation of the clan chiefs, and only Seaforth's return from exile in 1726 restored government control in the Mackenzie territories. Many exiles accepted pardons, including Bolingbroke and George Murray, while others took service elsewhere; George and James Keith both became Prussian generals. Ormonde lived quietly in Spain, and Avignon, until his death in November 1745; he was buried in Westminster Abbey in May 1746. Tullibardine remained in exile, took part in the 1745 Rising, and died in the Tower of London in July 1746. Despite swearing allegiance to George II, Murray also joined the '45, and died in the Dutch Republic in October 1760. However, new laws actively discriminated against Non-Juring clergy ie those who refused to swear allegiance to the Hanoverian regime. In 1690, more than half of the clergy were Non-Jurors and in theory deprived of their livings but many were protected by the local gentry. In 1673, Michael Fraser was appointed minister at Daviot and Dunlichty; despite being evicted in 1694, and joining the 1715 and 1719 Risings, he was still there when he died in 1726. Previous attempts to reintegrate ministers like Michael Fraser by measures such as the 1712 Toleration Act had been resisted by the kirk's General Assembly. After 1719, toleration changed to persecution, and many conformed as a result; Non- Juring Episcopalianism became a mark of Jacobite commitment and often associated with powerful local leaders, since their congregations required political protection for survival. A high percentage of both Lowlanders and Highlanders who participated in the 1745 Rebellion came from this element of Scottish society.

Life Weber was born June 3, 1814, in Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to an Old Order Mennonite family of Swiss descent. She was the fifth of ten children born to Johannes Weber and Catherine Gehman. Though she was more widely known as Anna, she was also sometimes called \\"Nance\\" and she is recorded as \\"Nancy Weber\\" in \\"A Biographical History of Waterloo Region\\" by Ezra E. Eby. In 1805, Anna's great-great-grandfather, Henery Weber, purchased over 3,000 acres of land in the historic \\"German Company Tract\\" of Waterloo County. Weber emigrated there with her family in 1825 and they prospered as farmers. At the age of 19 she became a deacon in Martin's Meeting House, a local Mennonite church. Weber was noted for her strangeness and rebellious nature by those who knew her. Art As a young person, she learned the traditional art of needlework and produced decorative embroidered samplers and show towels. She also produced stuffed animals and hooked mats. She was likely introduced to Fraktur at an early age. In the early 19th century, Fraktur art was commonly found in many areas of Pennsylvania. Several pieces have been retained by family members dating as far back as 1784, including an illuminated Spiritual Labrynth by the renowned Pennsylvanian artist Heinrich Otto. In addition, Fraktur hand was customarily taught in local Mennonite primary schools. The local Fraktur art style, known as the Earl Township school, is characterized by the use of a two-headed bird motif and took the form of Vorschriften, gaudily decorated calligraphy inscribed in Gothic German script. The local schoolmaster at this time, Mr. Altsdorf, was reported to produce very beautiful works of Vorschriften. By the age of 40, Weber began working with the Fraktur motifs she became known for. One of her earliest documented art is illustrations she added to her songbook in 1866. Most of her work through the 1870s and 1880s were gifts for birthdays and special occasions. While traditional Fraktur focuses on text with some decorative embellishment, Weber's work is characterized by \\"imaginitive visual expression\\". She filled the page with depictions of birds, animals and flowers with only a dedication, signature and date inscribed below. Her artwork was heavily influenced by Mennonite themes such as the Tree of Life. According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Weber was \\"the most original and prolific of Ontario's fraktur [sic] artists\\", which was particularly notable given the paucity of female Fraktur artists.

He is considered an innovator of the timbales, being the first to add a small cowbell to the setup, and popularizing the abanico. He started his career playing g√ºiro in F√©lix Gonz√°lez's orquesta t√≠pica, and rose to prominence as the timbales player of three important charangas: Orquesta de Tata Alfonso, Arca√±o y sus Maravillas and Fajardo y sus Estrellas.  Career  D√≠az was born in Pinar del R√≠o in the year 1900. He learned to play several percussion instruments by himself before joining the Septeto Cuba, based in Havana. He later became the g√ºirist in Orquesta de F√©lix Gonz√°lez. He then joined Tata Alfonso's charanga as the timbalero. He would become a master of the instrument, joining Fernando Collazo's La Maravilla del Siglo in 1936. Along with Antonio Arca√±o and other members of this band, D√≠az founded La Maravilla de Arca√±o in 1937. La Maravilla de Arca√±o, later renamed Arca√±o y sus Maravillas, would become Cuba's most prolific charanga. D√≠az later joined Jos√© Fajardo's charanga during the 1950s, and after Fajardo's exile, continued to play in the group, which was renamed Orquesta Estrellas Cubanas and directed by violinist F√©lix Reina. D√≠az died in 1990 in Havana.  Innovations  D√≠az is generally credited with the addition of the cowbell to the modern timbales setup, an innovation that expanded the sound of the instrument. Famous timbaleros such as Amadito Vald√©s credit him with this invention, although others have cited Antonio Orta Ferrol \\"Ma√±engue\\" with introducing the cowbell in 1912. According to Changuito, it was Guillermo Garc√≠a.

Accessed March 8, 2015. Named for congressman and brigadier general James Cox (1753-1810), who had lived here at the family home of \\"Box Grove\\", it is at the juncture of County Route 524 and County Route 43. The Upper Freehold Historic Farmland Byway passes through the area. History The Cox family had lived in Upper Freehold, New Jersey since the 1600s. In the Upper Freehold area, farmsteads had been created by 1731 at key crossroads, one of these later being named Wrightsville just east of Cox's Corner. Cox's Corner road junction existed in colonial times and one house, Merino Hill, was built for Samuel G. Wright (1781 ‚Äì 1845) who was born in Wrightsville. Like Cox, he also was elected to Congress but he died before taking office. Merino Hill is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Department of Environmental Protection and the Monmouth County Historical Association have declared that this house together with six neighboring houses at Cox's Corner are suitable for historic village status. A monument was erected in 1920 to commemorate the Cox family over five generations by recording that \\"Thomas and Elizabeth Blashford Cox were among the first settlers of the Province of East Jersey.\\" The first appearance of Cox's Corner on a New Jersey map was in 1917. In 1987, the then-owner of Merino Hill wrote that Wrightsville had been the name of the settlement a short distance east. However, that name fell into disuse ‚Äì and that entity no longer exists ‚Äì but the name was then resurrected on modern maps to erroneously name the corner itself.

She currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany  Work  Nina Canell‚Äôs practice concerns the physical and chemical characteristics of materials and found objects as well as their metaphorical and indexical nature. By placing material forms and immaterial forces into proximity, for example electrifying, heating or moistening wood, copper, plastic or glass, she creates works that embody an interchanging state, a process. Canell‚Äôs sculptural practice concentrates on this transformative affect: materials and objects are either being animated by a process in her installations or have been the site of a process in that an encounter or traversal has taken place. Despite the articulation of the material phenomena, Canell‚Äôs works are essentially of indexical nature as they open up a sense for the symbolic capacities of the objects by exploring the relationship between humans, objects and events.

History The house was built in 1887-1888 for wood dealer Hugo Hecht and designed by architect Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki. At the time, the address was Danzigerstrasse 126. It opens up a string of six close stylish buildings ordered by Hugo Hecht and built by Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki, all located on the same side of Gdanska street, and produced annually in the 1880s and 1890s. Immediately after the construction, the house was sold to the superintendent Ludwig Hollweg who installed a wrought iron gate. Shortly after, the building was bought by Otto Pfefferkorn, manager of a large furniture factory in Bydgoszcz, still active today under the name Bydgoskie Fabryki Mebli S.A.. Otto Pfefferkorn had another building built at Jagiellonska Street N¬∞2 in 1912. From April 1, 1939 till 1945, Kazimierz Orlicz, a Bydgoszcz architect, ran his own design office in this tenement.

Biography  Born Isabelle Am√©lie Cottiaux in Paris, Bogelot was the daughter of Antoine Andr√© Cottiaux, a cotton trader, and Marie Anne Th√©r√®se Cottiaux, from Cambrai. Orphaned at a young age (her father died when she was 2 and her mother when she was 4), she was adopted by the family of Maria Deraismes and her sister Anna F√©resse-Deraismes.Journal La Fran√ßaise, 3 octobre 1936. On May 7, 1864, she married Gustave Bogelot, a lawyer for the Court of Appeal of Paris.Marriage certificate, Paris, 18th arrondissement. The couple had at least two children.Isabelle Bogelot dedicated her work, Trente ans de solidarit√© to her children. Her death in 1923 was declared by her son Paul Bogelot, born 1866. This was the beginning of a long collaboration, similar to that of the couple Jules and Julie Siegfried. Her husband, who wrote several works on the question of prisons, was very involved in philanthropic activity: he was the secretary of the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale des prisons, vice-president of the Commission of the Hospice of Boulogne-sur-Seine for over 20 years, member of the board of directors of the ≈íuvre des lib√©r√©es de Saint-Lazare from 1890, and spokesperson for that organisation at various congresses. When he died in 1902, Isabelle Bogelot stated that they did ‚Äúnothing without considering it together‚Äù.Speech given to the board of trustees of the l‚Äô≈íuvre des lib√©r√©es de Saint-Lazare, April 1902, Isabelle Bogelot, op.cit..  Philanthropy  Although she was first made aware of feminist issues in Maria Deraismes‚Äôs family, and later of social issues by her husband, Isabelle Bogelot considered that she only had a ‚Äúphilanthropic revelation‚Äù in 1876, when her husband brought her a bulletin of the ≈íuvre des lib√©r√©es de Saint-Lazare.According to Jane Misme's article in Minerva on 16 novembre 1930, Isabelle Bogelot, although she was very much attached to the Protestant world - l'≈ìuvre des lib√©r√©es de Saint-Lazare was a Protestant charity - was not herself a Protestant. She then realized that it was her duty ‚Äì in her own words ‚Äì to devote herself to these issues.Speech at the Soci√©t√© de l‚ÄôAdelphie, January 1901, Isabelle Bogelot, op.cit. Two days later, she attended one of the charity‚Äôs meetings and met √âmilie de Morsier and Sarah Monod. The ≈íuvre des lib√©r√©es de Saint-LazareThose detained at Saint Lazare Prison were \\"women with warnings, girls in juvenile correction, children found on the street and women arrested by the moral police\\", essay presented to the Conseil d'√âtat to explain the request for a change of organisational name, 18 December 1891, Isabelle Bogelot, op. cit., or Society for Women Freed from Saint-Lazare, created in 1870 by Pauline Grandpr√©The founder of the organisation, on the initiative of her uncle, the prison's Protestant chaplain., aimed to help women and children freed from prisons, in order to protect them from recidivism: ‚Äúhelping women in the present, thinking about their future by educating them, providing them a livelihood and increasing their dignity through work‚Äù.Article on the Society, La Fraternit√©, 29 March 1885, cited in Isabelle Bogelot, op.cit. Two years later, she became the deputy to Caroline de Barrau, followed by director general of the ≈íuvre in 1887. From 1883 onwards, temporary shelters were created to house women and their children upon leaving prison. The charity was recognized as a public interest organization on 26 January 1885. The Franco-Prussian War led her to become interested in the efforts to help the military wounded. In 1886, she obtained the second prize for her nursing diploma, and a paramedic diploma the following year (both programmes created by the Women‚Äôs Union of France). She also founded, with Maria Martin and √âmilie de Morsier, the Women‚Äôs League for Peace and Union Among Peoples. She died in Boulogne-sur-Seine.  Feminism  Bogelot‚Äôs role in the ≈íuvre des lib√©r√©es de Saint-Lazare propelled her to the international scene, where she represented the organisation at various events: * 1884: Congress of the International Abolitionist Federation in Basel; * 1885: International Penitentiary Congress in Rome; * 1888: Suffragist Congress in Washington, D.C.

She was a member of the committee presided over by C√©cile Carnot for the women‚Äôs exposition. The International Congress of Women was held concurrently. Isabelle Bogelot was equally a major figure on the French feminist scene. In 1889, she and √âmilie de Morsier organised the first congress of women‚Äôs organisations and institutions, held in Paris on the margins of the Exposition Universelle. Sarah Monod was also a member of the congress committee chaired by Jules Simon. Losing no momentum, they created the Conference of Versailles, designed to gather ‚Äúall women interested in philanthropy‚Äù each year. The meeting was international, hosting women from all over Europe and the United States as well as from Africa. Bridging French and American feminists, Isabelle Bogelot, supported by the President of the International Council of Women May Wright Sewall, convened an initiative committee to form the French section of the international association, the National Council of French Women, of which Sarah Monod was the president, and Isabelle Bogelot the honorary president. In 1906, the Assistance Section, led by Eug√©nie WeillIsabelle Bogelot was also the honorary president of the Soci√©t√© amicale de bienfaisance d‚ÄôEug√©nie Weill., won one of the Council‚Äôs first fights: Isabelle Bogelot became the first woman appointed to the National Supreme Council for Assistance and Public Health.

Kahlo painted the self-portrait, which includes a black cat and a monkey, after her divorce from Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nickolas Muray. Muray bought the portrait shortly after it was painted, and it is currently part of the Nickolas Muray collection at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.Ditrich, \\"Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird\\". Background Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter active between 1925 and 1954. She began painting while bedridden due to a bus accident that left her seriously injured. Most of her work consists of self-portraits, which deal directly with her struggle with medical issues, infertility, and her troubeparate Frida on which to project her anguish and pain.Herrera, ‚ÄúKahlo, Frida\\". Scholars have interpreted her self-portraits as a way for Kahlo to reclaim her body from medical issues and gender conformity. In particular, scholars have interpreted her self-portraits in the context of the tradition of male European artists using the female body as the subject of their paintings and an object of desire.Udall, ‚ÄúFrida Kahlo‚Äôs Mexican Body,‚Äù 13. Kahlo, using her own image, reclaims this use from the patriarchal tradition. The autobiographical details of her life found in these works as well as her characteristic brows, elaborate hair, and vibrant Mexican clothing has made her a popular figure in Mexico and the United States. Kahlo was a big supporter of the Mexican Revolution, so much so that she attempted to change her birth date to correspond with the beginning of the Revolution in 1910. At the onset of this movement, a so-called ‚Äúcult of Mexican femininity‚Äù gained popularity, which Jolie Olcott describes as ‚Äúselflessness, martyrdom, self- sacrifice, an erasure of self and the negation of one‚Äôs outward existence.‚ÄùPankl and Blake, ‚ÄúMade in Her Image,‚Äù 5. In rejection of this limited conception of femininity, Kahlo fashioned herself as a Mexican counterpart to the flappers of the United States and Europe in the 1920s. Later, inspired by Rivera's concept of Mexicanidad, a passionate identification with Mexican pre-Hispanic indigenous roots, she donned the identity of the Tehuana woman. The Tehuana had a great deal of equality with their male Zapotec counterparts and represented strength, sensuality, and exoticism.Pankl and Blake, ‚ÄúMade in Her Image,‚Äù 8. Visual analysis This rather small painting (approximately 24‚Äù x 18‚Äù), shows Kahlo in a frontal position and directly confronting the viewer's gaze from the canvas with leaves behind her in the background. Her bold eyebrows hold the emphasis on her face, as a thorn necklace strangles her throat, trailing down her chest like the roots of a tree. A small black hummingbird with its wings outstretched hangs like a pendant from her throat. She is surrounded by insects and animals, setting the scene of a lush, but suffocatingly dense jungle. A monkey sits behind her right shoulder, its eyes focused on its hands, tugging at the thorn necklace, causing Kahlo to bleed. Above her head, two dragonflies float in mid-air, above two butterfly clips nesting in the elaborate hairstyle that crowns her head. A black cat with striking ice blue eyes peers up from the foliage over her left shoulder. Symbolism Kahlo's identification with indigenous Mexican culture greatly affected her painting aesthetic. By using powerful iconography from indigenous Mexican culture, Kahlo situates herself in a tradition of rebellion against colonial forces and male rule. The dead hummingbird which hangs around her neck is considered a good luck charm for falling in love in Mexican folklore. An alternative interpretation is that the hummingbird pendant is a symbol of Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of war.Baddeley, ‚ÄúHer Dress Hangs Here,‚Äù 13. Meanwhile, the black panther is symbolic of bad luck and death and the monkey is a symbol of evil.Fuentes and Kahlo, The Diary of Frida Kahlo,‚Äù 78. The natural landscape, which normally symbolizes fertility, contrasts with the deathly imagery in the foreground. Rivera gave Kahlo a spider monkey as a gift, thus suggesting that it could be a symbol of Rivera, especially since he inflicts pain upon Kahlo by tugging the thorn necklace hard enough to make her bleed. Alternatively, the thorn necklace could allude to Christ's crown of thorns, thus likening herself to a Christian martyr, and representing the pain and anguish she felt after her failed romantic relationships. In line with this interpretation, the butterflies and dragonflies could symbolize her resurrection.  Exhibition history  The University of Texas at Austin acquired the painting in 1966.

A project investigating war in film through the creation of visual knit stitches. This project is a combination of craft, labor, and combat and resulted in an animated work. It is currently in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. To make this work, Mazza gathered video footage from military conflicts including World War II, the Vietnam War and contemporary wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and ran the footage through software which converted video pixels into stitch patterns for knitting. She then created an animation piece from the knitted stills. * Nike Blanket Petition 2003-present.

Pastor examines issues of space encompassing structure, body and object orientations, imaginary forms, narrative and progressions of sequence. Pastor‚Äôs work has been described to play with the connection between the piece and the observer, making the observer hyper aware of their presence. Her sculptures including The Perfect Ride (2003), Dead Landscape (2009‚Äì2010), and Endless Arena (2013) are some examples of the connection made by Pastor between the piece and viewer. Her mediums range from animation to steel, and allow a mingling of the materials in a certain space. Pastor's openness to a creative experience can be demonstrated in her participation of \\"Office Hours\\", which are fifty-minute sessions between a student and an artist. These one-on-one sessions allows for an exchange of questions and ideas in a non lecture environment to help the flow of creative ideas and questions. Office Hours encourages reflection and poses questions to better one's work. Office hours are also a mandatory legal part of teaching and should not be credited to Pastor's generosity but her reluctant participation in the University system. Biography Pastor was born in Hartford, Connecticut. She graduated from the School of Visual Arts in 1988, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and went on to study at the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating with a Master of Fine Arts in sculpture in 1992. Exhibitions Pastor has exhibited in numerous museums including Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany; the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Chicago; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

The third part is a projected line drawn-animation of a cowboy performing an impossible, but what would otherwise be a perfect rodeo ride on a bull. The ideas behind the work are about balance and circulation, and how various organizing ‚Äúarmatures‚Äù direct systems of movement. The exhibition examines human‚Äôs ability to triumph over nature and it exemplifies Pastor‚Äôs extensive research on structures of movement. Pastor has explained that her fascination for rodeo competitions grew from ‚Äútrying to learn the aesthetic language, or system, that everyone in the rodeo seems instinctively attuned to‚Äù. = Dead Landscape, 2009‚Äì2010 = The work Dead Landscape is an installation featuring 40 drawings and photographs that juxtaposes archival materials on wars concerning the U.S. with Pastor's own drawings on public, culturally sanctioned fights, ranging from gladiator events to the Ultimate Fighting Heavy Weight Championship. The work was inspired by Pastor's research involving veteran combat artists from campaigns such as World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Operation of Iraq. The research involved interviewing these combat artists, as well as collecting \\"first impression\\" drawings of the war. The drawings were the initial reaction to the event, before the person had a chance to alter or subtly change the experience in their head. Many of these archival drawings and photographs, of which she accessed through the National Military Archives of the Navy, Army, and Marines, have never been on display before her exhibit. The contrasting element is Pastor's own \\"impression drawings\\", of when she attended local and national organized fights. These two elements are paired together in the installation creating an interesting opposition. = Endless Arena, 2013 = Endless Arena is a large-scale endless loop sculpture inspired from \\"blind gesture drawings\\" made of electroless nickel-plated steel and painted fiberglass. The piece was created from gesture drawings Pastor created over a two-year period of attending unregulated fighting events. Endless Arena came from an exploration of the space of the fights Pastor attended, including synchronized movements and the shifting dominance of the bodies. \\"Pastor sought to synthesize and distill fragments of these observations, spaces, and visceral experiences into a sculptural work.\\" Museum collections * FRAC Bourgone Dijon, France * Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humbelback, Denmark * Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, California * The Museum of Modern Art, New York New York * San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, California * Sandretto Re Rebaudengo Collection, Turin, Italy * Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands * Whitney Museum of American Art, New York * The Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Chicago * Kunstmuseum, Wolfsburg, Germany * Participated in 1996 Sao Paulo Biennial, the 1997 Whitney Biennial and the 2003 Venice Biennale  Grants  * Louis Comfort Tiffany (1995)  Publications  * Perfect Ride (2004)  External links  * Artist Bio and Exhibits featured on Regen Projects * Los Angeles Times articles on various works References Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:School of Visual Arts alumni Category:American women sculptors Category:1966 births Category:Artists from Hartford, Connecticut Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Living people Category:Educators from Hartford, Connecticut Category:Sculptors from Connecticut Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Jennifer Pastor"},{"id":"45620826","text":"Currito of the Cross (Spanish:Currito de la Cruz) is a 1965 Spanish drama film directed by Rafael Gil and starring Francisco Rabal, Arturo Fernandez and El Pireo.

Education  Yasmine Kandil was educated at the American University in Cairo, where she graduated with a Bachelor's degree in theatre. Additionally, she received a Master of Fine Arts Degree in theatre directing at the University and PhD in Applied Theatre with a focus on theatre for development at the University of Victoria (Canada). Her PhD focus was on 'Effective Methods of Theatre for Development Practice; Understanding the Conditions That Provide Autonomy and Empowerment for Marginalized Communities'. Career Yasmine Kandil began her career working in Cairo with Mohammed Sobhy, with one of the country's leading directors. While doing this work, she discovered that \\"the mainstream milieu of theatre directors, actors, and producers was quite corrupt, sexist, and male chauvinist\\" (Kandil, 2015). This provoked her to move away from mainstream theatre and to commit to the development of theatre that reflected her values and beliefs. She then worked with a group of theatre graduates and friends to create Yaaru, an independent devised theatre company which trained themselves in the art of improvisation and devising skills. While working as a part of Yaaru, Kandil traveled through Europe and the Middle East working as an independent lighting designer, and designed for shows which have been featured in international film festivals and competitions. During this time she worked as an actor and as a director in various productions. Kandil later worked with the garbage pickers in the slums of Cairo to create works of applied theatre that celebrated the lives of this marginalized community and through this work discovered \\"the power of theatre to build community, and to bring some respite to people's otherwise harsh lives\\" (Kandil 2015). This influenced her later work with immigrant and refugee youth in Victoria, British Columbia. Kandil has worked in Cairo and its outskirts, Alexandria, and Menya town in the South of Egypt. She has also traveled as a lighting designer to Paris, Uz√®s (France), Brussels, Rome, Genoa, The Hague, Beirut, Damascus, Amman, and Victoria and St. Catharines in Canada.  Current work  Currently, Kandil is developing a guide book for facilitators and directors interested in doing work with lay people wanting to create work that reflects their own experiences. Kandil is also developing research and documentation of the rise of Applied Theatre in post-revolution Egypt. She is currently an Assistant Professor teaching Applied Theatre at the University of Victoria‚Äôs Department of Theatre.  Awards and recognition  Kandil has been awarded the P.E.O International Peace Scholarship Award (2008 and 2005), and the Robert S. & Muriel A. Raguin Graduate Scholarship (2004-2005). Kandil has also been awarded the Artist in Residence Award by City of Victoria (2011), the 1-year UVic Graduate Student Fellowship (2009-2010), 3-year UVic Fellowship (2006-2009).  Collaborators and influences  Kandil has collaborated with the garbage pickers of Cairo, the immigrant and refugee youth of Victoria, Community & Institutional Development in Cairo (CID), the Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Center Society (VIRCS) in Victoria, and the Inter-Cultural Association (ICA) of Greater Victoria. Her work has been influenced by Harold Pinter, Frank Wedekind, Caryl Churchill, Bertolt Brecht, Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, Paulo Freire, Michael Etherton, Dorothy Heathcote, Tim Prentki, and Juliana Saxton.

Her plays explore artistic form, as well as assumptions of class and gender with a perspicacity ahead of second generation feminism of the 1960s, which influenced her youth. Rosen grew up in Flin Flon, Manitoba and attended high school in Edmonton, Alberta. She identified as an artist early, and had difficulty deciding whether to study as a pianist or to go into creative writing. With the help of a scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts, she decided to pursue writing and eventually enrolled at McGill to study English literature in 1955. At McGill, Rosen became increasingly involved in theatre, helping to found the McGill University Players. After transferring to UBC, she graduated with a BA degree in English and Theatre in 1959. Rosen's first full-length play, \\"The Elephant and the Jewish Question\\", was a \\"well-made\\" domestic drama staged by the Vancouver Little Theatre for the 1968 Dominion Drama Festival. Subsequently, she avoided the conventions of the \\"well made\\" form; her travel and extensive reading about theatre in Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and India led her to feel \\"cramped and dissatisfied‚Ä¶in traditional drama forms of the West\\" (application to the Canada Council, 1970). Rosen's second full-length play, \\"Crabdance\\", was greeted by critics as a brilliant, controversial work. It remains Rosen's best-known play. It has received six professional stagings, dramatizations by CBC Radio and CBC TV (never aired), an ACCESS video of the 1976 Citadel Theatre production, and two editions by in Print publications and Talonbooks. Rosen's short plays The Crusader and Triangle, Preparing, and Green Lawn Rest Home, reveal a growing frustration with the production restrictions of a realism-oriented Canadian theatre establishment. Presented at a University of British Columbia International Critics' Conference in 1976, these polemical plays are rhythmic, graphic, and allegorical. Prologue takes aim at the \\"ratings-oriented\\" policies of the CBC, and snipes at audiences who want theatre to be \\"predictable\\" or \\"nice\\". Instead, her works explore fantasy, brinksmanship, and madness through choral and movement elements that de-stabilize notions of identity, fragment time, and expose power structures within families and communities. Rosen's most ambitious work, Leela Means to Play (1976), is a sprawling epic that has never been professionally produced despite several workshops. It foregrounds serious Canadian social issues featuring the judiciary, the penal system, Indian Reserves, and psychiatric facilities. The size of the cast, the fluid multi-location setting, and the complex social commentary combined with raw emotional undercurrents of the play might have scared producers seeking Canadian hit shows. A master's thesis suggests that the time for Leela Means to Play will \\"come around\\" in a future where civil rights issues of the 1960s and 1970s excite more detailed attention, rather than seeming dated.Giants on the Lawn: the Plays of Beverley Simons. Unpublished Master's thesis, University of Calgary 1982 Rosen's most recent play, Now You See It (1996), is unproduced and unpublished but received a workshop by Necessary Angel theatre (1996).

Life McNeil was born in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her parents, George and Elizabeth (Upham) Knowling, had both been born in Devon in England and were supporters of women's rights. She was partially educated in England where she likely received her art education. Her parents were affluent and financially comfortable and in time her father would be on the legislative council. She was a prominent social activist for not only women's rights but also child welfare, literacy, and other issues. McNeil became a leading member of Newfoundland's Women‚Äôs Franchise League, which formed in 1920 to advocate for women‚Äôs suffrage. McNeil served as the League‚Äôs secretary and her home became its headquarters. Her many public talks and letters to the editor made McNeil one of the most well-known suffragists in the dominion. In 1925, the Franchise League finally won women the right to vote in Newfoundland. That same year, McNeil, alongside May Kennedy and Julia Salter Earle, became the first three women to seek political office in the dominion, when they ran in the St. John‚Äôs municipal election. All three women were defeated, although Earle came within 11 votes of victory. Also in 1925, McNeil and fellow artist Albert Edward Harris founded the Newfoundland Society of Art. They began by arranging exhibitions of the work of local artists as well as showing foreign art under the auspices of the existing Colony Club. McNeil and her husband Hector had a son, who died in infancy, and two daughters. McNeil died of cancer on February 23, 1928.

Throughout the 2002 season he assisted the club by clinching their division title, and winning the Open Canada Cup. In the post season he appeared in all the playoff matches and reached the finals where the club faced the North York Astros, where the Wizards ended up winning the playoff title in a 2‚Äì0 victory. He posted 14 clean sheets and allowed only 16 goals in 24 games - ranking Ottawa first with the fewest goals conceded. In 2003, Traore saw limited action due to the acquisition of Simon Eaddy, as Ottawa went undefeated the entire season clinching their third consecutive division title. The achievement marked the second time in CPSL history that a team went undefeated in a season. He was released from his contract in 2004 as the CPSL revoked the Ottawa franchise from the league.

History The principal organizers of the Studio Watts Workshop were jazz musician Jayne Cortez and accountant and arts patron James Woods. Woods, who worked at a local savings and loan, and his wife Margo Woods, a probation officer, provided the funding for the workshop's initial operating costs, because of their conviction that art could be a tool for social change. Woods found a location for the workshop, renting an empty furniture outlet on 104th Street and Grandee Avenue, and called together a group of eight artists to begin to plan what would become the Studio Watts Workshop. After the Watts riots led to renewed attention on the neighborhood, there were new opportunities for support and donations that led to the group being able to provide training for about 150 students in the visual arts, writing, drama, dance, and music. In order to work in the Studio Watts Workshop space, artists had to agree to give public exhibitions of their work at least two times a year in Watts and in an artistic space outside the area and also to provide free instruction to any student with, in the words of James Woods, \\"the initiative and the desire to participate in the creative arts.\\" Some of the early 'masters' to students were sculptor Guy Miller, Bruce Strobridge, a painter and sculptor who also had previously served in the Army with Woods and Anna Halprin, renowned international dance performer and teacher. A more detailed narrative on the Woods-Halprin collaboration can be found in Robby Herbst's April 2014 article \\"Ceremony of Us\\" published in East of Borneo, the Cal Arts School of Art's online magazine of LA contemporary arts. Bill Cosby and celebrated dance performers Marge & Gower Champion were also early supporters. Woods also produced and directed several plays (many original) at the Studio with student actors, to some acclaim. The celebrated poet Wanda Coleman, later known as the \\"Unofficial Poet Laureate of LA\\" was deeply engaged with early literary efforts among students at Studio Watts. In the late 1960s the Ford Foundation provided program funding to Woods and the Studio for its diverse initiatives. This was complemented by significant funding from the Doris Duke Foundation. Many Los Angeles professionals were friends of Studio Watts Workshop and donated their time and services to its governance. Others, such as John Blaine, worked as full-time Studio Watts staff. In the early years, UCLA management professor Will Mc Whinney worked with Woods on strategy and leadership issues and LA native Joel Fadem, then a Yale University grad student and later at UCLA, assisted Woods in many foundation fund raising efforts. In 1971, the Studio Watts Workshop received a $75,000 Ford Foundation grant to study how the arts could be used in low- income housing projects and Woods used the grant, together with a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and from other donations, to construct a 144-unit complex of rent-subsidized apartments. The Studio Watts Workshop became the Watts Community Housing Corporation, and spaces were set aside for arts workshops and gallery. Beginning in the 1970s, federal arts funding was drastically reduced and the Watts Community Housing Corporation could no longer support arts activity. In 1992, Woods, who was on the board of the Watts Community Housing Corporation, was continuing his efforts to advocate with the Department of Housing and Urban Development for allocating a part of the complex's rent income for arts programming. Programs One of the studio's best-known projects was an annual Chalk-In, first held in 1968 as a way to encourage community participation in the arts. Young people were invited to draw on a block-long section of sidewalk on 103rd Street. Twelve- year-old Richard Wyatt won the top prize at the first Chalk-In and credits the experience for starting him on his career as a prominent Los Angeles muralist. Other Studio efforts to integrate the arts into the Watts community included design programs, media production classes and facilities, a folk art archive, and dance, theater and other arts productions. Because of Woods' active involvement in the Watts arts community, in 1968 he was invited by the Los Angeles Music Center to organize the first Los Angeles Festival of the Performing Arts. Even while moonlighting as a doorman at a Hollywood jazz club (Shelly's Manne-Hole), he would go on to organize the second and third festivals (in 1969 and 1970), and artists affiliated with the Studio Watts Workshop were among the participants. During the period when Studio Watts transitioned into low cost housing with artists-in-residence as a component, Woods also was instrumental in organizing \\"The Meeting at Watts Towers,\\" a venue attracting both the new and old of the Watts community to honor its past, raise awareness on current issues, and celebrate the future. A comprehensive review of community arts in Watts may be found in \\"Watts: Art and Social Change in Los Angeles, 1965-2002\\" the 2003 exhibition catalogue of Marquette University's Haggerty Museum of Art, curated by Director, Curtis Carter (complete 68-page catalogue available on line).

Bratt (born 1943 in Suffern, New York) is an activist and emeritus law professor at the University of Kentucky. She has been faculty at the University of Kentucky College of Law since 1975. Career Bratt attended the State University of New York at Albany in 1965 with a major in History. She taught middle school history from 1965 to 1974 in the Syracuse (N.Y.) public school system. In 1969, Bratt and another teacher filed a lawsuit against the Board of Education of the Syracuse City School District because they claimed they had not been paid for coaching extramural basketball, as they should have been according to the collective bargaining agreement between the teachers' union and the city, and that additionally, male colleagues were paid for coaching basketball while the women were not. Before a decision was made in the case, Bratt and co-appellant Marilyn J. Patrick filed a Title IX complaint with the State Division of Human Rights alleging discrimination on the basis of sex. The latter organization helped mediate the decision, but subsequently, the board claimed that the state division had no right to hear the case and the Board of Education filed suit against the State Division of Human Rights in 1971. In 1974, Bratt graduated magna cum laude and in the Order of the Coif from Syracuse University's College of Law. She then clerked for the Presiding Justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1974 to 1975. In 1975, Bratt moved to Lexington, Kentucky, to work as a professor at the UK College of Law. She was promoted to full professor in 1984. She was named the Alumni Professor of Law in 1984 and became the W.L. Matthews Professor of Law in 1989. Between 1992 and 1993, she was a Fellow with the American Council of Education. That same year, Bratt consulted for the appellants on the Kentucky v. Wasson lawsuit, which went all the way to Kentucky's Supreme Court and eventually struck down the state's criminalization of sex between same-sex partners. The decision was seen as a major win for LBGT rights. She is currently a professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky. Bratt was the first woman to serve on the University of Kentucky's Board of Trustees; she served as legal advisor to Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown's Commission on Full Equality for Women; she served on the Association of American University Women's National Legal Advocacy Fund; and she also served as the chair of Kentucky Governor Martha Layne Collin's Governor's Commission on Women. She was also a member of the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance. Activism Bratt's social activism is a consistent part of her personal and academic life. She is a member of the American Civil Liberties Union in Lexington, and she lobbied the state legislature on a bill that would criminalize domestic abuse, as well helping establish safe houses for domestic abuse victims. She received the Hall of Fame award in 2003 from the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights for her general work in civil rights and women's rights in the state.

In 1880, he was briefly the presidential nominee of the Union Greenback Labor Party. Early life and family Dillaye was born in 1820 in Plymouth, New York, the son of Ren√© and Clarissa Dillaye. He graduated from Harvard University in 1845 with a Bachelor of Laws degree. In 1848, he married Charlotte Malcolm, but not before executing a prenuptial agreement that later became the subject of litigation. Dillaye and Charlotte would have three daughters, including Blanche, who became an artist in the school of Thomas Eakins. Political career By 1852, he was residing in New York City, where he was engaged in the practice of law. Dillaye became active in Democratic politics in the city, addressing a local convention of Manhattan Democrats in 1857. As the sectional differences that led to the Civil War grew, Dillaye joined (and was later president of) the Young Men's Democratic Union Club. He was appointed to the post of General Appraiser, a patronage position in the New York Custom House in 1856, but differences with the administration and Congressman Daniel Sickles led to his removal two years later. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb to protest his removal and had the letter published in New York Times, but to no avail. The bad feelings continued after Dillaye's removal from office. When he met former Congressman Emanuel B. Hart, a Sickles ally, in the street later that year, the two men began to argue and Hart struck Dillaye in the head with his cane. The next year, 1859, Dillaye was arrested in Pittsburgh, charged with forging certificates of deposit to purchase shares of stock in a bank there. He claimed to have been an innocent victim of the deception, and his explanation convinced the bank officers; the charges were dropped and Dillaye was later elected an officer of the bank. He later published a pamphlet about the incident. The New York Times suggested that Dillaye had only been charged at all because of the machinations of his political enemies. Dillaye continued his legal career in New York in the 1860s, including filing suit against Hart for damages from their 1858 altercation. The court eventually award Dillaye a verdict of $2,000. He returned to upstate New York and practiced law in Syracuse for several years. While there, he addressed an 1869 county convention with an argument in favor of women's suffrage. In the 1870s, Dillaye relocated to Trenton, New Jersey and worked for the Irish World as a journalist in addition to continuing his legal practice. Greenback politics His feuds with the leadership of the New York Democratic Party foreclosed any further advancement in the party, but Dillaye found a new political home in the Greenback Party. The party was a newcomer to the political scene, having arisen as a response to the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized \\"greenbacks,\\" a form of money redeemable in government bonds, rather than in gold, as was traditional. After the war, many Democrats and Republicans in the East sought to return to the gold standard, withdrawing greenbacks from circulation. The reduction of currency in circulation, combined with the economic depression, made life harder for debtors, farmers, and industrial laborers; the Greenbackers hoped to draw support from these groups. The new party suited Dillaye, who had recently authored a book on the monetary structure of revolutionary France. He ran for the New Jersey Senate as a Greenbacker in 1879, but was unsuccessful. By 1880, the Greenback Party had split into two factions. One of them, calling itself the Union Greenback Labor Party, met in St. Louis in March 1880 to nominate candidates for the upcoming presidential election. Dillaye declared he was not interested in nomination, but the delegates nevertheless selected him as their nominee for President and Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas merchant and surveyor, for Vice President. Because Dillaye had previously declared he was not interested in the nomination, many delegates protested, seeing him as a placeholder for eventual re-unification with the other half of the divided party, the National Greenbackers. Dillaye, himself, supported reunification and urged the delegates to send representatives to the National Greenbackers' convention, which was set for June 1880 in Chicago. The majority agreed with the sentiment, and Union Greenbackers gathered in Chicago along with National Greenbackers as their convention began a few months later. The National Greenbackers agreed to admit them, including Dillaye, and the party was reunified. In the reunified party's presidential nominations, Perry Talbot of Missouri placed Dillaye's name in nomination again; he immediately asked that it be withdrawn. On the first ballot he placed third, with 119 votes, but the nomination went to Congressman James B. Weaver of Iowa. Dillaye's health was poor that year, but he helped with Weaver's campaign, travelling to Indiana on a trip that was rumored to involve fusion negotiations with the Democrats. He also wrote a biographical sketch of Weaver for a book about the presidential candidates. The Greenback campaign won 3.3% of the vote. Dillaye continued to write on financial topics, authoring a book on monopolies in 1882. His health continued to worsen, and he died in Philadelphia in 1884. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse.

The double routes operate at the same time from different directions and meet at the Hadong Station in South Gyeongsang Province where passengers can transfer to the other train. One of the stops is Suncheon, with nearby Suncheon Bay, hosts of the 2013 Suncheon Garden Expo Korea. The letter \\"S\\" in the name stems from \\"south\\", the \\"S\\" shaped route along the curvy shape of the South Sea of Korea,\\"slow\\", \\"sea\\" and \\"sightseeing\\". The train is distinguished with its slow travel pace. Boseong tea field The train has five cars set up for different functions, including family occasions, tea drinking, party events, sports and leisure. Small spaces between cars are storage for bicycle riders. The traditional Korean tea ceremonies include a talk, and the tea served comes from the regions of Boseong and Hadong, which are among the train stops. The exteriors are coloured in blue and pink, representing the ocean and the pink camellia flowers of the southern regions. The turtle-themed train, with the nose of the train painted like the head of a turtle, is a tribute to 16th century naval commander Yi Sun-shin, famous for his deploying of turtle-shaped warships.

Early life Murray was born in Carisbrooke on the Isle of Wight, England, and was raised in County Wicklow in Ireland. Her father was Lieutenant Edward Murray and her mother, Louisa Rose Lyons, also came from a military family. She emigrated to Canada with her family in the 1840s because of the Great Famine; they settled on Wolfe Island (near Kingston, Ontario). Writing career While working as a schoolteacher, she published several pieces in various literary magazines, particularly the Literary Garland in Montreal. However, this practice of publishing in magazines resulted in several of her works being irretrievably lost: one was accidentally set on fire, while at least two others were not recovered after the magazines that were to publish them closed. Her novel Fauna was serialised due to the intercession of Susanna Moodie. This romantic description of Canadian life was published in the Literary Garland in 1851 and Mary S. Millar has noted that Murray defends the rights of Native Americans to preserve their culture from its domination by European values. According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Murray was \\"the major Canadian prose writer of the 1870s\\": she \\"bridged the period between the early Gothic and travel writing of pioneers such as Susanna Moodie and the generation of professional woman novelists and journalists at the turn of the century\\". Her writing largely reflected Victorian romantic traditions, but she was also interested in equality for women. She corresponded frequently with Susanna Moodie and mentored several younger Canadian women writers. Her novels described the Canadian backwoods and the role of pioneering women, which extended beyond the usual \\"domestic sphere\\". She also wrote nationalist essays, such as \\"An Appeal to Patriotic Canadians\\" (1889), and other nonfiction pieces; for example, her review of Sarah Anne Curzon's Laura Secord said that every Canadian \\"should make it a point of honour to possess a copy\\". She also wrote poetry. Death Murray lived in a farm in Stamford near Niagara, Ontario where she died of dysentery in 1894. Despite being respected as a stylist in her own era, Murray was largely forgotten after her death, as few of her works were published outside of serials during her lifetime.

She worked primarily in Portland on residences and congregational churches. Early life Rapp was born in Halsey, OR. Her parents were Catherine Maude Hopkins and Frank Hailey Porter. Frank Hailey Porter represented Linn County in the Oregon House of Representatives from 1913 to 1917. The Rapp family moved to Portland, Oregon in 1919. Rapp graduated from Grant High School in 1927. She attended the University of Oregon and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1931. A highlight of this period was Rapp's introduction to Frank Lloyd Wright. A friend of department head W.R.B. Willcox, Wright gave critiques of current student projects and participated in informal gatherings with students. At the University of Oregon, Rapp belonged to the Alpha Omicrom Pi sorority. Architect Chloethiel Woodard Smith was one of her sorority sisters. Rapp married Andrew Lee Rapp (d. 1996) in 1931. Career Rapp graduated with the onset of the Great Depression and had trouble finding work as an architect. According to her, \\"In 1931, with the Depression, no jobs were available for a geologist and certainly no job for a fledgling architect ‚Äì in fact ‚Äì no jobs at all. We were lucky - we managed my dad's apartment building.\\" In 1941 the Rapps bought a 50' x 150' lot and Amy designed the family's home herself. It was not until 15 years after graduation that Rapp started designing homes in reaction to a lack of government funds for new veteran homes. She did this with no prior office experience, two children and a third on the way. Rapp comments on this with a memory of her youngest child who tip-toed through the house, she \\"heard, 'Shush, Mama is architecting.' I thought ‚Äì that's it. I burned the midnight oil after that until he was in school.\\" As a volunteer, she chaired the Building Committee of the First Congregational Church in Portland, and represented the church on the jury for the Portland Center for the Performing Arts. She drew plans for church additions, and strove to keep the existing exposed stonework and brick. She further reviewed expansion plans and grew her professional skills of client relationships. Rapp completed her last commissioned home in 1955 and turned to help her husband with the Green Furniture Hospital, which was a repairing and refinishing shop of furniture that later added antiquities.

Biography Fernandez earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1989 and an MFA from California Institute of the Arts in 1996. Based in Los Angeles, her works deal with social and political commentary. Social consciousness and her Mexican heritage often influence her photography and collages, along with themes of space, migration, immigration, labor, gender, and her own relationship to the city of Los Angeles. Fernandez has received many awards and fellowships, including a Fellowship for Visual Arts in 2011 from the California Community Foundation.

Through six photographs of staged scenes and a map, Fernandez reimagines the story of her great-grandmother, a single mother who migrated from Mexico to Southern California. The scenes reference stories about the formidable challenges of starting anew in an unfamiliar place. By employing various costumes and printing techniques, Fernandez signals the passage of time. She also provides intimate narratives that offer insight into the circumstances of that time and challenge stereotypes about immigrants. = Sereno (2006) = The Sereno series (2006) was shot in El Sereno, in northeast Los Angeles, a working-class Mexican and Mexican American neighborhood. It describes Fernandez‚Äôs role as a participant in the gentrification of the area since the 2008 housing bubble burst. Fernandez conveys a sense of homelessness, of something lost, missing, or unattainable through the images by photographing in-between spaces where the refuse of outdated household items was dumped and people who could not afford even this modest community were forced to live outside. Sereno is absent of human figures and describes human presence through things left behind.

This foliage, including whole flowers, petals, leaves and varied organic pieces, are pressed until dry and flat, using a variety of pressing methods. These elements are then used to \\"paint\\" an artistic composition. The origin of this art form has been traced to 16th century Japan, but it is now practiced worldwide. The resulting artwork is referred to as an oshibana. Historical Background As early as the 16th century, Samurai warriors in Japan were said to have created oshibana as one of their disciplines to promote patience, harmony with nature and powers of concentration. Similarly, as botanists in Europe began systematic collection and preservation of specimens, art forms with the pressed plant materials developed, particularly during Victorian times. This art form became popular in the Holy Land in the late 1890s and into the 20th century when elaborate souvenir books combining photographs of the holy sites and the pressed flowers gathered at these sites. These photographs and pressed, dried flowers were artistically formatted and bound between olive wood covers to be sold to visitors. American actress Grace Kelly, during her years as Princess Grace of Monaco, practiced oshibana and helped promote the art of pressed flowers worldwide, employing pressed botanical materials sent to her from abroad. My Book of Flowers, published in 1980, includes chapters on her art.  Emerging Methods  Oshibana artists are employing various new technologies in pressing methods, framing techniques and color enhancing to help the pressed materials keep their beauty through the years. Nobuo Sugino, pioneering figure in contemporary oshibana, and his father used dessicant papers to press flowers, helping hold color. A method of vacuum-sealing frames to lock in color, texture and clarity of the petals and leaves and help prevent moisture and fungi intrusion was also developed in Japan and is now practiced by many oshibana artists worldwide. Contemporary Societies In recent decades, the emergence of several international art associations and schools have helped popularize and increase the recognition of oshibana as a unique art form through classes, conferences, international exhibitions and competitions. Among them: * International Pressed Flower Art Society, founded by Sugino, in Yokohama in 1999. * World Wide Pressed Flower Guild, founded in North Carolina, USA. * Pressed Flower Guild, established in 1983 in the UK by Joyce Fenton. * Philadelphia Flower Show, organized by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, host of the annual oshibana/pressed flower art competition. * Oshibana Art, a Japanese Pressed Flower organization and school founded by Mirian Tatsumi in 1996 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil References Category:Flowers Category:Japanese art ","title":"Oshibana"},{"id":"45621202","text":"Alejandro P√©rez Lug√≠n (1870‚Äì1926) was a Spanish writer and film director.

Active from 1920 to 1930, this umbrella organization included the League of Women Voters, the Women's Trade Union League, and the National Consumers' League, eventually coming to represent 12 million women.\\"The Women's Joint Congressional Committee and the Politics of Maternalism, 1920-30\\". Formation The committee was formed at the suggestion of Maud Wood Park, who was concerned that the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting any U.S. citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex might cause women to abandon the women's organizing groups and lead to greater political partisanship, and wanted instead to channel the existing organizing energy into continuing to lobby for women's interests.Women's Organizing after Suffrage: The Women's Joint Congressional Committee and the Sheppard-Towner Act\\". As a national organization with members including both national organizations and local chapters, the committee formed several sub-committees around issues including infancy and maternity protection, independent citizenship for married women, regulation of the meat packing industry and child labor, social hygiene and education, and Prohibition. Influence Called \\"the most powerful lobby in Washington\\", the committee used both grassroots and congressional lobbying to achieve their aims. It was at one point accused (along with many other organizations) of being a part of an international conspiracy to promote socialism in the U.S.,\\"The Notorious Spider Chart: The Socialist-Pacifistic Movement in America Is an Absolutely Fundamental and Integral Part of International Socialism\\". an accusation which was refuted at length by Carrie Chapman Catt via an open letter in The Women Citizen.Catt, Carrie Chapman (May 31, 1924). \\"Poison Propaganda\\". The Woman Citizen. 14, 32-33. In her letter, Catt describes the structure and function of the committee, > \\"The committee, as such, initiates no policy and supports no legislation and > no organization joining it is committed to any policy except that of > cooperation, whenever possible. The members bring to it the endorsements of > their organizations. After a measure has been endorsed by five or more > member organizations of the committee, a sub-committee of representatives of > endorsing organizations is organized, elects its officers and carries out a > campaign of action for the enactment of the measure by the Congress.\\" The committee successfully used the rhetoric of maternalism to lobby for greater legal protections for women and children. =Legislation= An early success of the committee was the 1921 passage of the Promotion of the Welfare and Hygiene of Maternity and Infancy Act, also known as the Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Act, which the committee was instrumental in getting passed. The committee resisted the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, concerned that it would undermine the protective labor legislation the committee had secured after years of work.\\"Library of Congress Manuscripts: Women's History\\".

Mountcastle (26 November 1837 ‚Äì 24 May 1908) was a Canadian artist and author who published her early work under the pseudonym Caris Sima. Early years and education Clara H. Mountcastle was born in Clinton, Ontario, Canada in 1837, one of 12 children of Sidney Harmon Mountcastle, a farmer, and Frances Laura (Meikle) Mountcastle. Mountcastle received early art training from her mother, an amateur painter, and later (1855‚Äì57) studied art in Toronto while living with her uncle John George Howard, an architect.Willard, Frances E., and Mary A. Livermore, eds. A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-Seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks Of Life. Moulton, 1893, pp. 527-28. By 1881, she had returned to Clinton, where she lived with two of her sisters for the remainder of her life. Career Mountcastle's watercolors won five prizes at the 1870 Provincial Exhibition in Toronto. She continued exhibiting at provincial and national exhibitions through the 1880s. Critics noted her skill with traditional marine subjects. In 1897, as the new Impressionist style gained favor, her work was rejected by the Ontario Society of Artists, where she had previously exhibited, and she was also prevented from joining the society. She joined the Women's Art Association of Canada instead. Mountcastle's writing career did not begin until the 1880s. She published both poetry and prose and also gave dramatic readings of her work. Her first two books, The Mission of Love (poems, 1882) and A Mystery (novella, 1886) came out under the pseudonym Caris Sima, which she derived from her childhood nickname of 'Carissima'. Her third book, Is Marriage a Failure? (essay, 1899), came out under her own name. She earned praise for her ability to write poems in a wide range of forms spanning from hymns to dialect verse, though she did not handle all equally well and her poems tended towards conventional sentimentality rather than originality. Recurring subjects included rural life, ill-fated love, and attacks on critics. Her meditations on aging and poverty speak to the struggles of genteel poverty which many women of her day faced, including the Mountcastle sisters. She died of kidney cancer in 1908.

Calame was included in the 2000 Whitney Biennial. Biography =Early life= Calame was born in 1965 in The Bronx, New York. She grew up in Westchester County, where her mother was a physical therapist and her father taught physical education. In college, Calame studied dance before shifting to painting. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the State University of New York at Purchase and later, a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in art and film from the California Institute of the Arts. = Career = Shortly after earning her MFA in 1996, Calame began a series of paintings based on the accidental spills on her studio floor. In creating the series, Calame re-presented spontaneous spills as deliberately created art; this technique became a cornerstone of Calame's artistic process going forward. At the same time as Calame began developing this artistic technique, revelations about her grandmother's death impelled her to investigate the subject of human mortality. Calame increasingly chose to concentrate her artistic work on exhibiting \\"the ever- presence of our mortality and the almost equally human need to hide or not to see it,\\" through tracing stains on streets and the floors of public spaces. In 2007 Calame was invited to produce a site-specific commission at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Out of that initial commission grew an entire exhibit, organized by the IMA's curator of contemporary art, Lisa Freiman, and titled:\\"Ingrid Calame: Traces of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\\" The exhibit comprised several large colored-pencil drawings and enamel-on-aluminum paintings utilizing tracings of tire marks on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The centerpiece of the exhibit was a 76-by-20-foot enamel and latex wall painting of the pretzel-shaped skid mark made by Dan Wheldon in 2005 after winning the Indianapolis 500. In 2008 Calame became the Albright-Knox Art Gallery's first artist-in-residence. During her residence, Calame and a group of assistants traced marks left on sites in and around Buffalo: on the floor of an ArcelorMittal Steel plant, on the Gallery's parking lot, and in a dilapidated wading pool. The results became a series of paintings and drawings organized into the exhibit, \\"Ingrid Calame: Step on a Crack...\\" Calame's work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, the Monterey Museum of Art, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and , in Germany. Her artwork is incorporated into the Leimert Park station of the Los Angeles County Metro Rail system.  Artistic style  Calame's works are often boldly-colored, multi-layered abstractions derived from human detritus, stains, and graffiti. Calame has stated that while her paintings and drawings are not maps, \\"they come from an impossible, cartographic impulse. I can't know the whole world, but going out into the world is really important to me, to try to know it through a kind of micro-mapping.\\" Noting the map-like aspects of Calame's works, art historians Gayle Clemans and Katharine Harmon featured Calame in their book The Map as Art: Contemporary Artists Explore Cartography.

She began learning piano aged eight and studied at the Conservatoire de Toulouse. She was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris in 1918 studying organ and composition. There she won prizes in harmony, fugue, counterpoint, and piano accompaniment. Her studies in improvisation on organ led her to travel to America where she gave her first organ recitals in New York. Her husband, Maurice Decruck, a clarinetist, saxophonist and double-bassist played both bass and saxophone with the New York Philharmonic. Maurice Decruck later became a music publisher, opening the company Les Editions de Paris.

She was known for her large scale, panoramic drawings of interiors that were created with many different materials in a collage-style. Her primary mediums were sumi ink and ballpoint pen on small to large scale paper panels. In order to complete a drawing she cut and pastes paper to edit things and achieve the desired scale. Her completed drawings show her process of editing and adding through wrinkles and folds. She described her work as ‚Äúa kind of visual diary of what [she] see[s], touch[es], and desire[s]. As I move between the mundane empirical spaces of my apartment and studio, and the glamorous fictions of movies, apparently seamless environments are disturbed through ever-shifting points of view.‚Äù Early life and education Clements was born in Woburn, Massachusetts in 1958. She received her M.F.A. from the State University of New York at Albany in 1989 and her B.A. from Brown University in 1986. Work Clements made large-scale drawings which explored interior spaces. She mostly made drawings from her surroundings and time-based media. She was especially interested in the spaces that women occupy. Clements' drawing Mrs. Jessica Drummond's (My Reputation, 1945) (2010) was featured in the 2010 Whitney Biennial. It's a drawing of the bedroom of the main character in the film My Reputation in ballpoint pen. Unlike most of her interiors, this drawing depicts the actress Barbara Stanwyck playing Jessica Drummond. The drawing is a combination of several scenes and shows different moments and camera angles in the room. Clements taught classes in fine arts at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), Brooklyn College, and Princeton University. She received many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in Fine Arts in 2012, the Civitella Ranieri Foundation Fellowship in 2013, and the Joan Mitchell Foundation Fellowship in 2015.

In 2007, Syms coined the term \\"conceptual entrepreneur\\" to characterize her practice. The broad idea of the artist as an agent seeking financial self-determination runs throughout modern and contemporary art, most notably in works by Marcel Duchamp and Marcel Broodthaers but also Piero Manzoni, David Hammons, and Joe Scanlan. The idea was given its most explicit sanction in a text by Scanlan titled People in Trade, in which he outlines Conceptual Art's business potential: Syms' self-identified title sustains one of her main ideas: self-determination through a sustainable institution, which stems from her interest in independent music and black-owned businesses. Her artwork has been exhibited and screened at venues including Human Resources, Bridget Donahue Gallery, the New Museum, Kunsthalle Bern, The Studio Museum in Harlem, Index Stockholm, MOCA Los Angeles, and MCA Chicago.http://artforum.com/picks/id=55228 Syms teaches at the California Institute of the Arts. Life Martine Syms was born in Los Angeles in 1988. She was raised with three siblings in the Altadena suburb of Los Angeles. She was homeschooled by her parents from age 7 through 12, and knew from an early that she wanted to be an artist. Syms' mother was interested in art and writing, and her father was an amateur photographer. She attended a pre-college program called CSSSA (California State Summer School for the Arts) at CalArts. In 2007, Syms received a BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) in Film, Video, and New Media at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. From 2007‚Äì2011 Syms co-directed Golden Age, an artist- run space in Chicago. Her work often explores contemporary black identity, queer theory, and the power of language through video, performance, writing and other media. Syms is the founder of Dominica Publishing, an artists' press dedicated to exploring blackness in contemporary art and visual culture. In addition to Syms' art practice, she has also worked as a graphic designer, and in advertising agencies. In 2011, Syms published \\"Implications and Distinctions,\\" an exploration of the performance of blackness in contemporary cinema, as part of the Future Plan and Program project created by Steffani Jemison. In 2013, Syms published ‚ÄúThe Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto‚Äù through Rhizome. In her manifesto Syms calls for black diasporic artistic producers to create culture that focuses on a more realistic future on earth. Syms writes: > \\"The imaginative challenge that awaits any Mundane Afrofuturist author who > accepts that this is it: Earth is all we have. What will we do with it? The > chastening but hopefully enlivening effect of imagining a world without > fantasy bolt-holes: no portals to the Egyptian kingdoms, no deep dives to > Drexciya, no flying Africans to whisk us off to the Promised Land...The > understanding that our \\"twoness\\" is inherently contemporary, even > futuristic. DuBois asks how it feels to be a problem. Ol‚Äô Dirty Bastard says > \\"If I got a problem, a problem's got a problem 'til it‚Äôs gone.\\" In 2014, Syms released Most Days, which consisted of a table read of Syms' screenplay about what an average day looks like for a young black woman in 2050 Los Angeles. The score for the album was composed by Neal Reinalda. In 2015, Syms was included in the New Museum Triennial Surround Audience. Her 2015 video Notes on Gesture, exhibited at Bridget Donahue Gallery in New York City and the Machine Project in Los Angeles, and explores the role of seemingly insignificant bodily gestures in the creation of identity. In 2016, Syms presented the performance \\"Misdirected Kiss\\" at the Storm King Art Center in New York's Hudson Valley and the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. The work takes its title from the 1904 film \\"The Misdirected Kiss\\". At times resembling a TED talk, the work picks apart issues of language and representation. In 2016, Syms' work was also displayed in a solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London titled \\"Martine Syms: Fact & Trouble.\\" Included in this exhibition, was the Syms' video series Lessons. In 2017, Syms showcased her work in a solo at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The show was titled \\"Projects 106: Martine Syms\\" which centered around a feature-length film, Incense, Sweaters & Ice. Syms is the recipient of the 2017 Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant. She obtained a MFA (Master of Fine Arts) from Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY in 2017. Syms joined the faculty of the California Institute of the Arts in September 2018. In 2018, Syms was awarded a 2018 Graham Foundation Fellowship for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.

Tsiang, originally self-published in 1935. The story is about a man called \\"Mr. Nut\\" who sits in a cafeteria, and listens to the problems of the people around him. Mr. Nut himself is unemployed, however feels as though his condition is temporary and dreams of striking it rich. Throughout the story, the reader sees Mr. Nut transforming into a radical activist. The book shows multiple facets of the social strata within the streets of Greenwich Village. The first edition was self-published in 1935, after being rejected from numerous publishers. Tsiang places numerous rejection letters in the opening pages of the novel. True to Tsiang's radical aesthetic, the original copy does not show the title of the book, instead questioning what a book cover really is: ‚Äúthe cover of a book / is more of a book / than the book is a book.‚Äù The book was published in 2013 by Kaya Press, and edited by Floyd Cheung. Background Hsi Tseng Tsiang (H.T. Tsiang) was born near Shanghai in 1899, and died in 1971 in Los Angeles. Tsiang is known as a poet, playwright, and novelist. In 1917, Tsiang was inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution led by Vladmir Lenin, and in 1926 attempted to migrate to the Soviet Union. After the failed migration, he entered the United States as a student and enrolled at Stanford University. He was involved with the Greenwich Village literary scene in the 1920s and 1930s, and self-published a number of books which he would hawk at downtown political meetings. H.T. Tsiang is also known for writing And China Has Hands (1937), which according to American cultural historian Michael Denning was, \\"repeatedly rejected by publishers (finally published in 1963)\\". A personal history of Tsiang appears in the 2013 publication of The Hanging on Union Square in the Chronology section. Critical Response \\"H.T. Tsiang‚Äôs satiric, quasi-experimental novel The Hanging on Union Square explores leftist politics in Depression-era New York ‚Äì an era of union busting and food lines ‚Äì in an ambitious style that combines humor-laced allegory with snatches of poetry, newspaper quotations, non sequiturs, and slogans. Back in print for the first time since it was originally self-published in 1935, Kaya‚Äôs new edition of the novel follows out-of-work protagonist Mr. Nut from a workers‚Äô cafeteria to dinner clubs and sexual exploitation in the highest echelons of society, then back again to the streets of Greenwich Village, where starving families rub shoulders with the recently evicted. In the process, Tsiang captures, hour-by-hour, Mr. Nut's profound transformation from itinerant roustabout to radical activist. Adventurous and unclassifiable in its combination of avant-garde and proletarian concerns, The Hanging on Union Square is a major rediscovery of a uniquely American voice\\". Cultural historian Alan M. Wald author of American Night: The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War describes the book as, \\"An artist of distinction, H.T. Tsiang created a genre unto itself in 1935 with The Hanging on Union Square. Its republication after seventy-five years rescues - from an outlaw existence - a strangely and beautifully evocative satiric allegory\\".

Elkpen can do her work in any size, place or thing that offers itself, sometimes it's a retail or corporate setting. Sometimes even a park bench, matchbook or post card her work may appear on. Her work has reached numerous cities and counties such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Canada and Mexico. In 2014, she was commissioned to create the design on the exterior of the Los Angeles River Rover, a mobile classroom which is used to teach students about the significance of the Los Angeles River to wildlife in the city. Elkpen also takes the time to do work shops with youth, presentations for communities and non profit organizations. She also associates with corporate clients to create authentic and socially progressive images and content. Elkpen's work has been seen on buildings, busses, beaches, fences, light poles and bus benches in the US and Canada. She has been working as a freelance artist for over 20 years with the slogan in the back of her mind \\"no job is too large or too small\\". Elkpen's work uses both images and words to convey biological, historical, and environmental information to draw the viewer's attention to the wildlife or lack of wildlife in a particular location. The key that distinguishes her projects from other people is her ability to hand draw images with great quality. Hand drawn images are more natural plus can give off a more lively feel for the viewers. Elkpen's subjects have included cottonwood trees, alder trees, coastal prairies, Grizzlies, Giant Swallowtail and Anise Swallowtail butterflies, Fairy Shrimp, Western Kingbirds, Goldfinches, Northern Mockingbirds, Yellow Chevroned Parakeets, Black Phoebes, Woodpeckers, Crows, Bushtits and many other birds found in Southern California.

She lives and works in Cape Town. Early life and education Born in Durban, South Africa in 1970, her parents founded and ran an anti-apartheid conference centre and died when she was a child. Poynton grew up in South Africa, England, Swaziland and the United States, often moving to different boarding schools. Poynton knew from the start that she wanted to be an artist. Before returning to South Africa to paint, she attended the Rhode Island School of Design for two years between 1987 and 1989, but did not graduate. Career Poynton's paintings are more about the act of looking, of exposing the \\"trickery\\" behind traditional artistic practices, than they are windows onto a surreal world. By constructing spaces, placing slightly discordant objects amongst seemingly natural landscapes, Poynton creates a tension within her work that is intended to make the viewer uncomfortably aware of the act of perception. While most of her work can be categorized as realism, a few series depart from her usual aesthetic in a more abstract project. Her current exhibition, Scenes of a Romantic Nature, draws on her connection to Germany by referencing the landscape paintings of German artist Caspar David Friedrich. Her work often conflates tropes from traditional art history, from compositional techniques to poses of her subjects, and the indices of contemporary life to create a sense of chaotic inscrutability; in this way, Poynton creates work which is aesthetically engaging and intellectually confounding. This quality of her work is exemplified in her series Safety & Security, 2006.

Middleton's artistic practice often involves the creation of elaborate, large-scale installations built out of a variety of materials including trash, wax, craft supplies, and other ephemera. She frequently re- purposes excess material from her studio practice in creating new installation and sculpture-based work. Her work has been collected by the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al. Notable Exhibitions In 2009, Middleton exhibited a large installation at the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montreal, titled Dark Souls. Taking its title from a novel by Nikolai Gogol, Dark Souls was designed to resemble a decaying bourgeois parlour and involved five connecting rooms, each filled with garbage and refuse, towering sculptures, and two video projections. In 2012, Middleton created a site-specific installation at the Oakville Galleries at Gairloch Gardens. Titled Form is the Destroyer of Force, Without Severity There Can Be No Mercy, Middleton's installation, like Dark Souls, took found objects like shoes, vases, tea sets, and artificial roses and transformed them into uncanny assemblages covered in wax and glitter. The installation referenced the domestic architecture of the Oakville Galleries at Gairloch Gardens, turning the gallery into a fantastical home in decay. Middleton participated in a large-scale group exhibition titled Misled by Nature: Contemporary Art and the Baroque organized by the National Gallery of Canada, and exhibited at the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton in 2013, and the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art in Toronto in 2014. The exhibition, which featured other prominent Canadian and international artists including David Altmejd, Yinka Shonibare MBE, and Sarah Sze, considered material excess and theatricality in recent installation art, and questioned the nature- culture divide.

It was caused when a signalman's error accidentally diverted the Irish Mail express onto a dead end siding, where part of the train crashed through the buffers and into the River Anker. Three people were killed, and thirteen injured. Setting At Tamworth low level station in 1870, there were two running lines through the station, with two platform loops diverging at each side, serving each platform. At the end of the up (London bound) platform loop was a dead-end siding leading to a pumphouse by the River Anker with a small reservoir alongside it. The points exiting the up platform loop onto the running line were interlocked with those into the siding, meaning that when the points were set to allow trains through on the running line, the points would also be automatically set to divert any trains running forward on the loop into the siding, to prevent them from accidentally running onto the running line. There were two signalboxes at the north and south ends of the station, each controlling the points and signals from either direction. The accident On 14 September, the Irish Mail had been delayed by the late running of the steamer at Holyhead, and it was thirteen minutes late by the time it approached Tamworth. The signalman in the south signalbox was expecting the Mail, and had correctly set his points to allow it through on the running line, which also set the points on the loop into the siding. The signalman in the north signalbox however became confused after his watch had stopped, and was expecting a goods train, and set his points into the loop. At around 4:09 am the Mail approached Tamworth at around 50 mph (85 kmh), the driver saw that the signal was set for the loop and applied the emergency brakes, but could not stop before being diverted onto the platform loop and then into the siding. The train had slowed to about 15 mph when it hit the buffer stop at the end of the siding. The locomotive went through the buffers and crashed into the River Anker. A coach and a postal van overturned into the reservoir. The driver, Samuel Taylor, and fireman, William Davis, on the engine, and one passenger, Rev. Father Healy, were killed. Thirteen other people were injured, including ten passengers, two postal staff, and a guard who was seriously injured. Report The accident report criticised the poor interlocking and signalling arrangements at the station, specifically the lack of interlocking between the north and south signalboxes to prevent an accident of this type from occurring. It also criticised the lack of sufficient warning to the engine driver that the points were set the wrong way, and also the lack of information about train movements; telegraph equipment had been installed at both signalboxes at the time of the accident, but was not in use. The report also noted that the accident would have been considerably worse had the Mail not been fitted with continuous brakes, and noted that it might have stopped short of the buffers had the rails not been greasy.

She also attended Columbia University and studied painting at The Barnes Foundation. She taught at the Department of Art at the University of Oklahoma from 1943‚Äì44, and at the University of Arizona, Tucson from 1945‚Äì46.  Work  Her most recognized films were Introspection (1941‚Äì47) and What Is A Man? (1958). Introspection was the first abstract dance film made in the United States, and it pioneered the \\"cine-dance\\" genre (along with Maya Deren's A Study in Choreography for Camera, released in 1946). Arledge also painted throughout her career and worked in the media of glass slide transparencies, which combined attributes of painting and filmmaking that interested her. According to film historian David E. James, \\"almost all the European avant-garde filmmakers of the 1920s were visual artists,\\" and Arledge was one of the only Los Angeles visual artists to continue experimenting with the film medium after the 1920s. She also wrote about experimental film history; her essay \\"The Experimental Film: A New Art in Transition\\" was published in Arizona Quarterly 3, no. 2 (Summer 1947). Arledge was noted for her glass slide transparencies created by layering pieces of multicolored stage-light gelatins and baking them on glass slides. The artist then draws on the surface of the gels with a variety of objects and seals the images by covering them with another set of glass slides. The fragile nature of this medium led her to make her \\"stabile color films\\" between 1978 and 1980 that integrated the slides and sound recordings in such works as Tender Images, Interior Garden I, Interior Garden II, and Iridium Sinus (Cave of the Rainbows).  Legacy  Filmmaker Barbara Hammer described how Arledge \\"creates films that combine structural and painterly concerns guided by the emotions\\" and \\"represents for us the filmmaker as a whole person, as unified woman, as liver/artist\\". Her paintings were first exhibited posthumously in the exhibition \\"The Making of Personal Theory: Mysticism and Metaphysics in the Work of Sara Kathryn Arledge, Charles Irvin, and Jim Shaw,\\" curated by Irene Tsatsos at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena, California.

Early life Ramsay was born in Kolkata, West Bengal on 15 March 1818 to Robert Ramsay, a captain in His Majesty's 14th. Regt. of Foot, and his wife Margaret (n√©e Cruickshank). He was the eldest child in a Scottish family of three sons and two daughters, the youngest of whom was the writer Elizabeth Ramsay-Laye, 1832-1932, who when she wasn't writing under her own name used the nom-de-plume Isabel Massary. Robert Ramsay was educated in Edinburgh and at Harrow. In 1836, with a military career in mind, he also attended L'√âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, founded by Napoleon in 1803. Business and Pastoral Interests in Australia In about 1837, after having had second thoughts about army life, Ramsay started to see business and farming opportunities in Australia. His father was by then a partner in Cruickshank Melville & Co., a mercantile firm in London that, in addition to its main business in the West Indies, was already doing some business with Australia. On 24 February 1838 he arrived in Port Jackson in New South Wales aboard the 'Upton Castle'. Also aboard the ship were fellow Scotsman Joshua Richmond Young, one of his future business partners, and the incoming New South Wales governor Sir George Gipps. In Sydney on 5 March 1838, with Joshua Young and his brother Alexander, both of whom he had known in Scotland, he established Ramsay, Young & Co., a mercantile firm and shipping agent. The inclusion of the name 'Ramsay & Young' in a letter dated 22 August 1838 to Sir Gordon Bremer regarding a new settlement at Port Essington revealed that even then Robert and his partners had an eye on trading up north. From sometime in 1839 until 27 January 1843, Ramsay and the Young brothers were also in business with a John Holdsworth in Holdsworth & Co., a trading company in Sydney that specialised in ironmongery. Anecdotal evidence together with numerous local newspaper advertisements and articles at the time relating to shipping in and out of Sydney suggests that both firms did well. By 1843 though, Ramsay was hearing about the massive potential of what was later to become Queensland and getting itchy feet. On 27 January 1843, the Holdsworth & Co. partnership was dissolved; on 1 October 1844, Ramsay, Young & Co. was dissolved. In September 1844, freed briefly from his business commitments, Ramsay became a magistrate although his time on the Sydney bench was short-lived. By 1846, he had left Sydney to run stock on Rosalie Plains, an area of 64,000 acres on the Darling Downs that was then still \\"beyond location\\".Ramsay, Robert (1818‚Äì1910) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 9 March 2015. Having acquired the lease over Rosalie Plains on 15 June 1847, Ramsay went into partnership with Louis Hope in April 1848 and with him acquired Lagoon Creek Downs in October 1848, Cooyar station in August 1849, Kilcoy on 11 September 1854, East Esmond and East Crinum in November 1854 and at least two other stations in the Burnett area, Upper Crinum and Lower Crinum, at about the same time. Robert Ramsay's licence to depasture Rosalie Plains was transferred to the new partnership on 2 August 1848. Between 1848 and February 1866 when the partnership was dissolved, Hope & Ramsay invested huge amounts of money and time into the development of numerous pastoral properties on and close to the Darling Downs. Their holdings also included the pastoral interests at Mundubbera of Ramsay's younger brother Marmaduke following his death by drowning while crossing the Dawson River on 20 September 1865. An advertisement in the Brisbane Courier on 6 April 1866 reveals that the runs of M[armaduke] Ramsay and representatives of [his former business partner] the late A[lexander] Jopp, who had also died by drowning, were transferred to Louis Hope and Marmaduke's brother Robert Ramsay on 1 April 1865. They included Hawkwood and Oaky Creek. On 9 January 1858, Mort & Co, on behalf of Hope & Ramsay, placed an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald about the forthcoming auction of their flagship stations at Rosalie Plains and Cooyar. Hope & Ramsay reportedly sold the stations to William Kent & Edward Wienholt. However, some reports say that the deal, worth ¬£41,000 including 37,500 sheep and 1200 cattle, fell through and that Hope and Ramsay continued to lease the properties until they were transferred to the Queensland Lands Department in 1870. In June 1859, confident that his pastoral interests were being properly looked after by paid managers, Ramsay went to England and Scotland for an extended holiday. He didn't return to Australia until 1865. Soon after his return, he entered into partnership with his good friend Arthur Hodgson, later Sir Arthur Hodgson, by buying former station manager John Watts' share of Eton Vale, a substantial station on the eastern Darling Downs that Hodgson and his brother Christopher had established 25 years earlier, and which had only recently been secured against selection by use of the pre-emptive right and provisions of the Leasing Act of 1866. Following the formal dissolution in February 1866 of his partnership with Louis Hope, who was by then actively involved in Australia's burgeoning sugar industry, Ramsay and his family moved into the Eton Vale homestead from where he took over the day-to-day management of the station. The business partnership between Ramsay and Hodgson not only went on to become hugely successful in its own right but led to the formation of the much larger pastoral firm of Ramsay Brothers & Hodgson, a partnership between Robert Ramsay's sons Frank, Bob, Lauderdale, Douglas and Norman, and Arthur Hodgson's son Edward, that made most of its fortune from merino wool in and around Winton in central Queensland. Although Robert Ramsay and Arthur Hodgson remained firm friends until Hodgson's death in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1902, their business partnership ended in 1893 when Ramsay purchased a 35,000 acre (14,164 ha) portion of Eton Vale for himself. He named it Harrow after his sons' old school in England and because Arthur Hodgson was an old Etonian who had named Eton Vale after his old school. Politics Ramsay won the seat of Western Downs at the 1867 Queensland colonial election. He was made Colonial Treasurer on the 3 May 1870 and held that role until 28 March 1871. He resigned as the member for Western Downs in November 1873 and was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council in 1874. However, the seat was declared vacant three years later as Ramsay had by then spent most of that period in England. Personal life On 18 April 1855, while on a visit to England and Scotland, Robert Burnett Ramsay married Susan Lindsay Carnegie, daughter of William Fullarton-Lindsay and Jane Christian, n√©e Carnegie, a daughter of William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk. With his new bride, he sailed for Australia in August 1855 and, after a brief sojourn in Sydney, returned to his home at Rosalie Plains later that year. Contrary to what the Australian Dictionary of Biography says, they had fourteen children, five of whom died before reaching adulthood. He retired to 'Howletts' near Bekesbourne in Kent in 1887 and died there on 5 July 1910. Ramsay Street in Toowoomba and the locality of Ramsay on the Darling Downs were named in his honour.

Born in London, England, on 2 November 1825, Kennedy emigrated to the Red River Settlement (now Manitoba) with her husband William Kennedy in 1861 to establish a mission school for the Church of England. Though they tried to return to England in 1862, they were trapped by a Sioux uprising in Minnesota that prevented them from leaving the province by their intended route. After returning to Red River, the couple imported the second piano to appear in the settlement, on which Kennedy performed. They built the first frame house in Manitoba in 1866, which they called \\"Maple Grove\\". Kennedy organized a clothing club during the \\"severe grasshopper plagues of the later 1860s\\". Known locally as \\"The Duchess\\", she was heavily involved in efforts to open a hospital in the settlement. The Kennedys were next caught up in the Red River Rebellion in 1869 - Eleanor was said to have personally delivered a letter to Louis Riel asking him to stop the fighting. \\"Distressing\\" gossip arose that she had petitioned for the life of Riel and demanded the death of Thomas Scott.

As a young artist, she was influenced by the storytelling tradition passed on to her by her mother and grandmother, by her grandfather's woodworking and her mother's quilting, and by her brother, Edward Poitras's art practice. She holds an MFA (2003). She spent three years apprenticing with Luise√±o performance artist James Luna in California in the 1990s. In 1995, she co-founded Tribe, an artist-run centre geared towards exhibiting the work of contemporary First Nations artists in Canada. Work Much of Blondeau's work revolves around the misrepresentation of First Nations women in popular culture and media culture. She regularly works with positive and negative associations attached to the tropes of the Indian Princess and the Squaw, examining how post-colonial imagery impacts the reception of Aboriginal women in urban communities. These personas manifest in photo-based works such as COSMOSQUAW (1996) and Lonely Surfer Squaw (1997), in which Blondeau performs a \\"re-working of a notorious racist-sexist stereotype.\\"Len Findlay and Dan Ring, Lori Blondeau: who do you think you are?

(2000), Sisters (2000), and A Moment in the Life of Belle Sauvage (2002). In addition to her solo practice, Blondeau frequently collaborates with other artists, including performance artist Adrian Stimson. Together, they presented an exhibition entitled Buffalo Boy and Belle Sauvage: Putting the WILD Back into the West at the Mendel Art Gallery in 2004, which paired Stimson as Buffalo Boy with Blondeau's persona Belle Sauvage. The exhibition provided an Indigenous re-thinking of the iconography of cowboy narratives, probing questions of representation.Ryan Rice and Carla Taunton, \\"Buffalo Boy: THEN and NOW\\" INDIANacts: Aboriginal Performance Art Other collaborations have included works with internationally renowned artists James Luna, and Shelley Niro. Blondeau has served as a member of the Aboriginal Curatorial Collective. In October 2015, as part of a symposium, Supercommunity Live hosted by the Remai Modern Art Gallery of Saskatchewan she performed \\"The Birds, The Bees, The Berries\\" with Blackfoot artist Adrian Stimpson.

Her hoarse voice charged with melancholy and strong personality made her a Sicilian icon of the twentieth century, much like the writer Leonardo Sciascia, the poet Ignazio Buttitta and the painter Renato Guttuso, who counted all three among her admirers. Biography Rosa Balistreri was born in Licata, a town in the province of Agrigento, in western declined Sicily, in the late 1920s. Her father was an alcoholic carpenter and Rosa was forced to do menial jobs, instead of going to school. In 1951, after experiencing the Sicily of Leonardo Sciascia's Candido, Rosa left her village at the age of 24 for Tuscany, settling in Florence, where she worked as a domestic servant. Uprooted from her native land, she started her artistic career at 39, through Dario Fo who made her star in one of his shows, Ci ragiono e canto. Rosa recorded her first two albums the following year, in 1967, and performed at Teatro Carignano in Turin, at Teatro Manzoni in Milan and at Teatro Metastasio in Prato. In 1971, now renowned Rosa Balistreri returned after twenty years in Sicily, where she would sing until her death. Often composed in dramatic style, her songs depict Sicily, as her friend Leonardo Sciascia describes, as \\"violent, tender, bitter, sweet, full of ambiguities\\". The \\"Soprano of the South\\", as Ignazio Buttitta nicknamed her, related the misfortunes but also the beauties and mysteries of the three- pointed island. She also embodied, as her friends Amalia Rodrigues, Renato Guttuso and Leonardo Sciascia, a generation of artists joining the communist ideology. Rosa Balistreri died in Palermo in 1990 at the age of 63, but her work survives and is modernized through the interpretations of Serena Rispoli, Carmen Consoli, and especially Etta Scollo who, accompanied by the Sicilian Symphony Orchestra, performs her most iconic songs, such as \\"'U cunigghiu\\", \\"I pirati a Palermu\\" or \\"Cu ti lu dissi\\".Etta Scollo Canta Ro, record released in February 2005 Discography *La voce della Sicilia (1967, Tauro Record) *Un matrimonio infelice (1967, Tauro Record) *La cantatrice del Sud (1973, RCA reissue of La voce della Sicilia) *Amore tu lo sai la vita √® amara (1971, Cetra Folk) *Terra che non-senti (1973, Cetra Folk) *Noi siamo nell'inferno carcerati (1974, Cetra Folk) *Amuri senza amuri (1974, Cetra Folk) *La Ballata del Prefetto Mori (1977, Il prefetto di ferro) *Vinni a cantari all'ariu scuvertu (1978, Cetra Folk) *Concerto di Natale (1985, PDR) =Posthumous discography= *Rosa Balistreri (1996, Teatro del Sole, CD reissue of La voce della Sicilia) *Un matrimonio infelice (1997, Teatro del Sole, CD reissue) *Amore tu lo sai la vita √® amara (2000, Teatro del Sole, CD reissue) *Terra che non-senti (2000, Teatro del Sole, CD reissue) *Noi siamo nell'inferno carcerati (2000, Teatro del Sole, CD reissue) *Vinni a cantari all'ariu scuvertu (2000, Teatro del Sole, CD reissue) *Rari e Inediti (1997, Teatro del Sole) *Collection‚Ä¶ la raggia, lu duluru, la passione (2004, Lucky Planets), CD 1 et 2 *Rosa canta e cunta.

It has its roots in Zimbabwe and was first described in literature by J. B. Matthews Notes on Some African Games. In: NADA, the Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs Annual 1964; 9 (1), 64-66. in 1964. Tsoro belongs to the same class of African strategy board games collectively called Mancala, such as Oware, Bao, and Kalah. Tsoro was played by warriors to improve their enemy capturing and raiding strategies in war situations. It was also used to teach young boys and girls how to count.MAWERE, M. (2012). Struggle of african indigenous knowledge systems in an age of globalization a case for children's traditional games in South- Eastern Zimbabwe. Bamenda, Cameroon, Langaa Research & Publishing.Tsoro for Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anywhere.tsoro Kings and chiefs often settled disputes by playing Tsoro. Today it is frequently played during leisure times and sometimes competitively. In its original form, the game was played by digging 4 rows and 21 columns of small holes in the ground which were then populated with a pre-determined amount of pebbles or seeds. Each of the two players occupy two rows of holes. Tsoro has countless variations in terms of the number of holes in each row and the number of seeds in each hole.Kumar, S, Ncube, O and Munapo E, (2003) Tsoro and Hungarian approaches: A hybrid algorithm. Asia and Pacific Journal of Operations Research, Vol 20, pp 41-56 In the most common implementation in Zimbabwe, the game is played on a board that has 4 rows with each row containing 7 holes. At the start of the game, all holes are filled with the same number of seeds. The players sit face to face and each player occupies the two rows nearest to them. Below is a representation of a 10-hole Tsoro board with 2 seeds in each hole at the beginning of a game. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Rules # The starting player chooses any hole from his/her set of holes and collects all the seeds in that hole and then distributes them one per hole in the succeeding holes, going in one direction (either clockwise or anti-clockwise). This direction is maintained throughout the game. # If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole in the outer row, the player collects all the seeds in that hole and redistributes them into the succeeding holes. # If the last seed falls into a hole in the inner row, the player captures all the seeds in his or her opponent's two holes in the same column as his or her hole and distributes them as before. # A player's turn ends when the last seed being distributed lands, either in an empty hole in the outer row, or in a hole in the inner row which is in the same column with an empty hole in the opponent's inner row. # The game ends when one of the two players has captured all the seeds in the holes of the other player. # The winner is the player with all the seeds. Difference between Tsoro and Oware The main differences between Tsoro and Oware are as follows: # Number of playing rows: While Oware employs one playing row for each player, Tsoro uses 2 playing rows for each player. # Number of holes per row: Oware uses a fixed number of holes for each player (6) while for Tsoro, the number of holes can range between 5 and as much as 40 # Number of starting seeds: Tsoro can be started with any fixed amount of seeds in each hole while Oware requires 4 seeds in each hole before starting. # Capturing seeds: In Oware, a placer can capture their own seeds to end a game while in Tsoro one cannot capture their own seeds. Tsoro is unique in its possession of two rows of playing holes for each player in which seeds can be sown in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. While Bao also has 4 rows, there are restrictions concerning which holes a placer is allowed to move in.A.J. de Voogt (1995), Limits of the mind: towards a characterisation of Bao mastership, CNWS Publications: Leiden. Mathematical approaches to optimizing a game of Tsoro Since Tsoro is a turn-based game in which one placer tries to minimize losses and maximize gains, mathematical optimization strategies employing the minimax theory and alpha-beta pruning can be used to solve it for trivial cases. Such solutions exist for some trivial cases involving specific combinations of starting number of seeds and holes.Tsoro: A Not So Trivial Gambling Game.

Life Yestadt grew up in New Rochelle, New York, her mother an artist and her father an architect. She studied fine arts at University of Hartford, and eventually transferred to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, and started focusing in millinery in 2004. She worked as an apprentice at millinery design studio Cha Cha‚Äôs House of Ill Repute from 2004 to 2007, and as a designer for Steve Madden from 2007 to 2009. In Spring 2009, fashion retailer Intermix started carrying some of Yestadt Millinery's designs. Later that same year, a model wore a hat of Yestadt's at a photo shoot with Alister Mackie, then stylist for Marc by Marc Jacobs, and the design caught the stylist's eye. This resulted in a collaboration with Marc by Marc Jacobs that significantly raised Yestadt's profile. Work Yestadt Millinery has come to be known as the \\"go-to for cool, artisanal hat-making.\\" Yestadt herself is known for hand-designing with classic techniques and traditional hatmaking styles - bowlers, cloches, panamas, berets, turbans, pork pie hats - with elegant, modern flourishes, and a ready-to-wear aesthetic. Yestadt has collaborated with designers such as Marc Jacobs, Vena Cava, Thom Browne, and Phillip Lim. Her works with Yestadt Millinery also have a number of celebrity fans, among them Rihanna and Courtney Love. A number of retailers carry or have carried Yestadt's designs, including Intermix, Anthropologie, Henri Bendel, Barney's CO-OP, and The Hat Store. While a number of high fashion figures started out as milliners, such as Halston and Coco Chanel, the art of hatmaking has had a comparatively lower profile in the latter half of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, possibly as a result of the woman's wardrobe becoming more casual and informal. Yestadt is one of a small but growing number of designers championing millinery as an art.

The group consisted of Tonita Pe√±a, Julian Martinez, Awa Tsireh, Crecencio Martinez, Jose Encarnacion Pe√±a, and others. This was the first known Native American group in the American Southwest to practice easel painting.  History  The San Ildefonso school was an art movement from 1900 until 1935, and 1917 was a key year in the production of artwork by the San Ildefonso school according to many art historians including W. Jackson Rushing. The artwork during this movement was created utilizing traditional aspects of Native culture but created specifically for a non-Native patronage. It was not until the 1920s these artists were able to sell their work. The first artist from the San Ildefonso school to become well known was Tonita Pe√±a. Beginning in 1900, Esther Hoyt a non-Native teacher at the San Ildefonso Day School taught Native students painting on easels and encouraged the students to \\"paint as they wished\\". At the time it was against government policy to allow Native students to paint what they wanted, the school was operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Students were given materials by Hoyt and encouraged to sketch their life experiences. Hoyt, provided young Tonita Pe√±a with watercolors when she was a student there. Other students at the San Ildefonso Day School included Crecencio Martinez, Awa Tsireh (Alfonso Roybal), Tonita Pe√±a, Romando Vigil, Alfredo Montoya, Santana Roybal, and Abel Sanchez. After Hoyt left the school, Elizabeth Richards continued to teach painting to elementary school students. Despite being enrolled in classes these students have been referred to as \\"self taught\\". Edgar Lee Hewett, a professor of archaeology and the director of the Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe, was working closely with locals from the San Ildefonso Pueblo on excavations between 1907 and 1908. He said that he \\"discovered\\" their ability to draw and paint in watercolor. Hewett encouraged the production of art work from Native American artists and helped gain them financial support of white patrons.  Artwork  Mostly works on paper, the paintings focused on human figures and portrayed Pueblo dances, koshares, ceremonies, and genre scenes of daily life. Backgrounds were minimal or absent. The artists used blacks and whites and bright, flat colors. They added stylized motifs used in other Pueblo artist expressions, such as ceramics, mural painting, and embroidery. The artists used watercolors, and distemper and casein, a milk-based paint. = Critics = During the early 20th century, numerous white Americans became involved in an effort to promote Native American arts within white social circles. Critiques of the San Ildefonso school have been made by those who study \\"traditional\\" Native American art, versus art of Native Americans supported (and perhaps shaped by) white patronage.

The Ordinariate of Brazil for the faithful of the Eastern rite or Brazil of the Eastern Rite (Portuguese: Ordinariato para os Fi√©is de Ritos Orientais no Brasil) is an Ordinariate (pseudo-diocese of the Catholic Church) for the Eastern Catholics in Brazil without proper jurisdiction of their own particular churches sui iuris. It is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See and its Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches, not part of any ecclesiastical province. The Ordinariate is headquartered Rua Cosme Velho 470, 20241-090 Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil and currently governed by Walmor Oliveira de Azevedo, (Latin) Metropolitan Archbishop of Belo Horizonte, but not vested in a particular see.  History  The Ordinariate was erected on 14 November 1951 with the papal decree Cum fidelium of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, which gave effect to a decision ex audientia of Pope Pius XII took on 26 October 1950, as Ordinariato para os Fi√©is de Ritos Orientais no Brasil. The same decree appointed the archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, Jaime de Barros C√¢mara, as its first ordinary. On April 13, 1952 Barros C√¢mara inaugurated the Ordinariate, appointed Francisco Nogueira Bessa as General Secretary of the same and created a system of general vicariates for the 3 major communities, each with its general guard: Elias Gorayeb for the Maronites, Archimandrite Elias Coueter for the Greek Melkites and Clemente Preima for the Ukrainians.IGREJAS CAT√ìLICAS ORIENTAIS NO BRASIL: PRESEN√áA, AUTOCOMPREENS√ÉO, PERSPECTIVAS, DESAFIOS.

Its seat was the city of Rio de Janeiro, but its current headquarters is the city of Belo Horizonte, because since 2010 its ordinary is the metropolitan archbishop of Belo Horizonte Walmor Oliveira de Azevedo. Previously, the previous 3 ordinary were archbishops of Rio de Janeiro and the headquarters was in this city. As per 1998 it pastorally served 10,000 baptized Eastern Catholic Brazilians in 4 parishes with 5 priests (2 diocesan, 3 religious) and 3 lay religious brothers. = Parishes = At present it only attends Syriac Catholic faithful, who have a parish, but the small communities of Italian-Albanian and Russian faithful dispersed and the faithful of other rites are insignificant in number and dispersed. Although the 2016 Pontifical Yearbook mentions the existence of 4 parishes in the Ordinariate, but there is only one Eastern Catholic parish in Belo Horizonte, known as Igreja do Sagrado Cora√ß√£o de Jesus dos Sir√≠acos Cat√≥licos, whose parish priest, George Rateb Massis, is the Syriac Catholic vicar of the ordinariate. The Capela Nossa Senhora da Anuncia√ß√£o of Ipiranga in S√£o Paulo belonged since 1954 to the Ordinariate as a Russian Catholic mission, but after the death in 2005 of its parish priest, Jo√£o Stoisser, its few remnant faithful passed in 2013 to be part of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church together with the chapel. A small community of Italo-Albanian Byzantine rite used the Igreja de Nossa Senhora Aparecidahorariodemissa.com.br in Riachuelo in Rio de Janeiro until the death in 2002 of the parish priest Atanasio Accursi.

Hebron critically examines and employs modes of feminist activism in art. Early life and education Hebron studied theater and visual arts at the University of California, San Diego from 1991 to 1992, and the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, Venice, Italy, from 1993 to 1994. She went on to graduate summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a Bachelor of Arts in fine art in 1995. In 2000, she graduated from the UCLA with a Masters of Fine Arts in new genres and contemporary art history.  Work  In 2013 Hebron launched Gallery Tally, a collaborative art project in which people around the world were tracking women's representation in art galleries and creating posters for exhibition. In 2014, the (en)Gendered (in)Equity: The Gallery Tally Poster Project discovered that in Los Angeles and New York galleries, roughly 70% of gallery representation was of male artists. In order to protest the Instagram social network's nipple policy and social media sexism, in 2014 Hebron created an \\"Acceptable Male Nipple Template\\". The template consisted of the visual image of a male nipple that could be photoshopped on to an image of a woman's breast or elsewhere, reminiscent of a pastie. As a result of her nipple project, the template went viral and Hebron has been suspended from Facebook multiple times. In October 2019, Instagram held a closed meeting to discuss censorship, art, and nudity on their software platform, a few artists joined the meeting including Micol Hebron, Marilyn Minter, Joanne Leah, Siddhant Talwar and Betty Tompkins (via written statement). After this meeting, Hebron's instagram account was immediately shut down because she attempted to post a topless selfie from outside the meeting location.

It is held by Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, presented by the John Feeney Charitable Trust in 1956.  Content  The painting measures . It depicts two well-dressed women who are sitting facing each other in a cramped first-class railway carriage, like mirror images. The women may be sisters, or may represent two elements of the character of one woman. The women are dressed identically, in the same voluminous grey silk travelling clothes, with their hats identically placed on their laps. They are arranged symmetrically on seats to either side of the carriage window. The window has three parts, framing the view like a triptych. The coastline of Menton, on the French Riviera, is visible through the window, but neither woman seems to be paying any attention to this. The train is in motion, witnessed by the swinging tassel on the window blind. The carriage itself is symmetrical, as the women are. The symmetry is broken, however, by a number of small differences. The woman on the right reads a book; her hair is tied up, she is wearing gloves and a bouquet of flowers lies next to her. The red feather in her hat is neatly groomed. The woman opposite her is sleeping, her hair loose, with bare hands, and a basket of fruit beside her. The feather in her hat is a little ragged. The painting could be read as a Victorian version of William Hogarth's Industry and Idleness.  Making  Egg travelled frequently to the south of England and the south of France, seeking relief from his life-long asthma. It was one of the last paintings made by Egg before his death in 1863.  Influences  Engraving by John Tenniel from Through the Looking-Glass Railway art became popular after William Powell Frith's 1862 painting The Railway Station. The painting influenced an engraved illustration by John Tenniel in Through the Looking-Glass, in which Alice wears a similar costume and hat in a railway carriage, sitting opposite Benjamin Disraeli, wearing a paper hat, and a goat.

They moved from San Ildefonso to Cochiti Pueblo, the birthplace of Martina's father, between 1902 and 1905. While the bentonite slip employed in Cochiti pottery gave it a soapy appearance, Southwestern ceramics expert Jonathan Batkin considers the Montoyas' work from this period to be stylistically San Ildefonso.

Gameplay  The player interacts with each letter to proceed through the alphabet. For instance, the letter A grows antlers, becomes an arch, and begins to amble. Then it is replaced by the letter B. The letters and words are read aloud.  Development  Metamorphabet is an iOS game developed by Patrick Smith. He had previously worked on the 2009 Windosill. Smith designed the game to feel \\"intuitive\\" and \\"as natural as possible\\" for all users, but also designed to be accessible to young children. The game was in development for three years but only came to fruition when Smith thought of having the letters turn into words. The game was released for iOS devices on February 12, 2015, and for Windows and OS X via Steam on April 29.  Reception  Metamorphabet won the 2015 Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art award and was a finalist for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize. It was one of ten Apple Design Award recipients in 2015. Reviewers noted the game's charm and intuitiveness. Andrew Webster of The Verge wrote that Metamorphabet helps kids learn the alphabet and vocabulary, though the game \\"isn't educational in the traditional sense\\", as it does not force the player in one direction. He described the game as \\"more playful than instructive\\" and \\"more of a toy than a textbook\\", making it a suitable first video game for his two-year-old daughter. Webster thought the gameplay was \\"charming and intuitive\\" and \\"fun ... to watch\\". Evan Narcisse of Kotaku similarly wrote that the game was the first his four-year-old was allowed to play alone. He noted that she struggled with games like Cut the Rope and Where's My Water, and thought that a game like Flower or Hohokum would be her first, but found Metamorphabet to be sufficiently magical in that it inspired curiosity without being \\"overly earnest or treacly\\".

In this episode, Regina goes undercover for the heroes; and Mr. Gold masquerades as Hook, while flashbacks show how she and Maleficent met. Plot =Opening Sequence= A tree that Maleficent left burning for eternity is shown in the forest. =Event Chronology= The Enchanted Forest events take place after \\"Labor of Love (Once Upon a Time)\\" and before \\"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\\". The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Unforgiven\\". =In the Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest, before the Dark Curse, Rumplestiltskin finds Regina exploring Maleficent's spell book. However, Rumplestiltskin tells her that she is rushing into this too fast, saying that the key to Maleficent's skills is time, and sends Regina to Maleficent's palace, where she sees a tree still burning from Maleficent's wrath \\"half a lifetime\\" after she burned down a forest. Regina enters Maleficent's palace to discover a disheveled, depressed Maleficent; the sorceress explains that an encounter with Briar Rose drained her of all her spirit. Regina tells her that Briar Rose's daughter, Aurora, is about to be married. Regina is furious to see heroes getting happy endings, and, after Maleficent reveals that her fire and ability to transform into a dragon has disappeared, Regina decides to use the royal wedding to inspire Maleficent. Regina takes Maleficent to the remnants of the forest that the sorceress once burned and shows her the tree that is burning eternally. Maleficent attempts to channel the fire back into her body but she still lacks the ability to transform and the duo are captured by King Stefan, who had ruined Maleficent's plans in the past, and his guards. Regina refuses to give up and burns through the ropes binding her hands; she throws a fireball at a guard before her magic begins to fail her, which prompts Maleficent to realize that she does not want to go down without a fight, thus rekindling her fire and allowing her to transform into her dragon form. As they reach the castle, Maleficent and Regina are able to find Aurora, whom Maleficent puts under her legendary sleeping curse. Afterwards, Regina returns to see Rumplestiltskin, who is very impressed that she helped Maleficent regain her fire. Regina reveals that she has realized that she already had the perfect teacher all along in Rumplestiltskin, and feels that there are fates worse than death, one of them being the sleeping curse. =In Storybrooke= An undercover Regina meets with Maleficent, Ursula, and Cruella to convince them that she is still a villain, and the Queens start testing Regina's loyalty to them in a night of debauchery. Mary Margaret and David worry that something has happened to Regina when she does not return as planned. After the couple finds her, Regina explains that she needs time to learn about their \\"very powerful\\" secret plan. Later on, Maleficent, Cruella, and Ursula meet with Gold, who is convinced that Regina has reverted to her evil ways because of the heartbreak she has gone through, but cryptically adds that, \\"When war hits Storybrooke, everyone will have to pick a side.\\" Maleficent then meets up with Regina, revealing that they, too, are after the Author and that they have leads that Regina does not. She says that The Queens are willing to share the leads if Regina helps them with a task. The Queens are planning to reverse the history and destiny of every story that was ever written in the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" fairy tale book so the heroes will become the losers this time, and Regina must go with Maleficent to steal something. When Regina tells Hook and the Charmings about this, Emma Swan decides that she will follow. At the same time, Maleficent takes Regina to Marco's house, where it is revealed that the item they intend to steal is Pinocchio, and by kidnapping the now-human boy, it will prove to Maleficent that Regina is on their side. After Regina completes the tasks by knocking both Marco and Pinocchio unconscious, Emma enters, having tracked Regina's phone, and says she thinks that things have gone too far. Regina swears to Emma that she will protect Pinocchio. Maleficent is now convinced that Regina is on their side after she completed the kidnapping of the boy, but at this point Regina decides to keep Emma from following her, and she drops her phone on purpose. Hook steals Belle away from a date with Will Scarlet and tells her his suspicions that the Queens are after the Dark One's dagger and plan to use it to force the Dark One to find the Author. The twosome agree to hide the dagger, but Belle has a strange feeling that Gold is already in Storybrooke, so Hook suggests that she try to conjure him. Belle uses the dagger to try to summon Gold, but he does not appear, and she gives the dagger to Hook and leaves. However, it is revealed that Belle calling the Dark One to her did not work because Gold was already there, masquerading as Hook in an attempt to acquire the dagger. Gold, as Hook, goes to the pawn shop to make Belle promise to never mention the events that transpired with the dagger, to which she agrees, believing it to be the safest option. He then questions her about her relationship with Will. She responds that she could never be truly over Gold but that Will makes her happy for the time being. Later, Maleficent brings Regina to Gold's remote cabin, where Regina is shocked to find Gold back in Storybrooke, and with his reclaimed dagger. Gold then uses his magic to turn Pinocchio back into his older self, August Booth, who might know about the Author, now that his memories have been restored.

Rebecca Jane Stokes of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5, noting the show's improvement over previous episodes, saying \\"After a rough couple of weeks, it was great to see Once Upon A Time do what it does really, really well -- provide a great forum for complex, strong female characters to strive, battle, fail, and persevere.

The title is the motto of Eton College, \\"may Eton flourish\\". The painting depicts an incident that took place in 1881, during the First Boer War. The work depicts Lieutenant Robert Elwes of the Grenadier Guards, who was killed at the Battle of Laing's Nek on 28 January 1881. The British Army was attempting to force its way through a pass in the Drakensberg Mountains, when Elwes joined a hopeless frontal assault into the teeth of a formidable Boer defence, charging up a hill on horseback. He reportedly encouraged another Eton old boy, adjutant of the 58th Regiment of Foot, with a shout of \\"Come along Monck! Floreat Etona! We must be in the front rank!\\" immediately before he was shot and killed. Elwes was one of 83 killed and 11 wounded. Monck survived the battle. The painting shows two mounted British officers in blue patrol jackets, with swords drawn, leading red-coated infantry in a charge towards the viewer. The horse to the right (bearing Monck) is stumbling, and the officer to the left (Elwes) shouts encouragement. A Queen's Colour is visible in the background - this attack was the last time a British battalion carried its colours into action - and the flat-topped mountain of Majuba in Natal. The painting measures . It was shown at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1882.

This period is also called pre-ceramic or aceramic.  Earliest human occupations  The earliest humans that came to South America are known as Paleo-Indians. This period is generally known as the Lithic stage. After this came the period that is widely known as Archaic, although there are also some different classifications of this period. The precise classification is complicated because somewhat different terminologies tend to be used for North America and Mesoamerica. The Andean preceramic period would include cultures that belong to Lithic and Archaic stages.  Preceramic in Peru  The Za√±a Valley in northern Peru contains the earliest known canals in South America. These were small stone-lined canals which drew water from streams in the Andes Mountains region. These canals may have been built as early as 4700 BC. A lot of archaeological work has been done in Peru in relation to the preceramic cultures. While Norte Chico civilization has now been studied extensively, there are also many other sites. = Norte Chico civilization = Map of Norte Chico sites showing their locations in Peru This ancient period is studied most extensively in relation to the archaeology of Peru. In particular, the Norte Chico civilization is very important. The most impressive achievement of this civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Also, these preceramic peoples were building massive irrigation and water management projects. Archaeological evidence suggests a very early use of textiles, and in particular the use of cotton. Also, recent studies (2013) indicate that maize played a big role in this civilization starting as early as 3000 BC, contrary to previous beliefs. Also, beans and sweet potato were grown. Norte Chico sites are notable for exceptional collective density, as well as individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China).[13] The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.  Caral  Caral ceremonial plaza Caral is an important center of this civilization. The city was inhabited between 2600 and 2000 BCE,Eurekalert.org, \\"Oldest evidence of city life in the Americas reported in Science, early urban planners emerge as power players\\" Public release date: 26-Apr-2001 American Association for the Advancement of Science enclosing an area of more than 60 hectares.Archaeological Site in Peru Is Called Oldest City in Americas. The New York Times - 27-Apr-2001 Caral was first fully documented and analyzed by Dr. Ruth Shady Sol√≠s and other Peruvian archaeologists in the late 1990s. A 2001 paper in Science, providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in Nature, describing fieldwork and radiocarbon dating across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.See CNN, for instance. As a result, Norte Chico has pushed back the horizon for complex societies in the Peruvian region by more than one thousand years.  Huaricanga  Huaricanga, also in the Norte Chico region, is believed to be the earliest city of this civilization, and thus it would have been the oldest city in the Americas. It existed around 3500 BCE.\\" Besides the lack of pottery, a remarkable feature of this civilization is the apparent absence of any artistic or religious symbolism. Or at least they have not been identified so far. Nevertheless, there is evidence for the worship of certain deities, such as the Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and it has been suggested that its use so early points to the worship of common symbols of gods for a long period of time. A view of Caral Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions still remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics. Some scholars suggested that Norte Chico was founded on seafood and maritime resources, rather than on the development of an agricultural cereal and crop surpluses, as has been considered essential to the rise of other ancient civilizations. Yet now these views are being revised because of strong evidence for maize consumption. = Casma and Sechin rivers = Several major preceramic archaeological sites are located in the valleys of the Casma River and its tributary the Sechin River. The largest among them is Sechin Alto; the other big mounds are Sechin Bajo, Mojeque, Cerro Sechin, Las Haldas and several others. The dates for these sites start at c. 3600 BCE. = Kotosh Religious Tradition = The Kotosh Religious Tradition is a term used by archaeologists to refer to the ritual buildings that were constructed in the mountain drainages of the Andes between circa 3000 and c.1800 BCE, during the Andean preceramic.[1] Archaeologists have identified and excavated a number of these ritual centers; the first of these to be discovered was that at Kotosh, although since then further examples have been found at Shillacoto, Wairajirca, Huaricoto, La Galgada and Piruru.[2] These sites are all located in highland zones that are lower than the Puna, and yet there are considerable distances separating them. In spite of this, all these cases of highland preceramic public architecture are remarkably similar.[3] = Other cultural traditions = A pyramid at El Paraiso El Paraiso, Peru is a very large early center in the Anc√≥n-Chill√≥n Valley, that may be somewhat related to the Norte Chico tradition. It is approximately from the same time frame as the above. It is just one of the six major preceramic sites in the Anc√≥n-Chill√≥n Valley, including Ancon (archaeological site). Another important site is Bandurria, Peru, on the Huaura River, featuring monumental architecture that may go back to mid-fourth millennium BC. In the northern peruvian coast stand out sites such as Huaca Prieta, were the earliest recorded use of indigo dye to date was found and Huaca Ventarron, its painted murals are the oldest discovered in the Americas.  Preceramic in Ecuador  In Ecuador, the Preceramic period is believed to have started around 9000 BC, and lasted until around 4200 BC. According to Jeffrey Quilter, Ecuador yielded plentiful evidence of early dense occupations of the highlands that is so far not found either in Peru or in Bolivia.Jeffrey Quilter, The Ancient Central Andes. Routledge World Archaeology, 2013 p107 Along the Pacific Coast, the Las Vegas culture predominated, while up in the mountains, it was the Inga culture. The Las Vegas culture is the first known culture in Ecuador. They lived on the Santa Elena Peninsula on the coast of Ecuador between 9000‚Äì6000 BC. The skeletal remains and other finds preserve much evidence of this culture. Scientists have classified three phases of cultural development. The earliest people were hunter-gathers and fisherman. Approximately 6000 BC, these peoples were among the first to begin farming; among their early crops were bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria, and an early type of maize, Zea mays L. El Inga peoples lived high in the mountains near present-day Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Evidence from the archeological site El Inca date the culture to 9000‚Äì8000 BC. Excavations were undertaken around 1961. It is believed that, from the archaeological perspective, this area is one of the most important in South America, and it may have existed along an ancient trade route. Some of the tools used by these early nomadic hunters have provided relationships to the Clovis culture \\"Level I\\" at Fell's Cave in southern Chile, and technological relationships to the late Pleistocene \\"fluted point\\" complexes of North America.  Preceramic in Colombia  El Abra is the earliest evidence of inhabitation in central Colombia El Abra is an important early human settlement site in Colombia with a large cave system. Its investigation started in 1967, and the stratigraphy of lithic instruments, bones and vegetal charcoal with radiocarbon dating established the date of the settlement in 12,400 BP ¬± 160 years.Correal Urrego, 1990, p.70 Other preceramic archaeological sites are Tibit√≥ (11,850 BP), Tequendama, dated to 11,000 years BP, Checua (dated to 8500 BP), Aguazuque (5000 BP) and El Infiernito, dated to 4900 years BP.G√≥mez Mej√≠a, 2012, p.153 Nivel paleoinfio abrigos rocosos del TequendamaGroot, 1992, p.58 Investigaciones arqueol√≥gicas en Villa de Leiva - Banco de la Rep√∫blica  Preceramic in Bolivia  The earliest cultures of Bolivia are the Wankarani culture, and the Chiripa. The earliest Wankarani sites are dated from 1800 BC onwards.Jason (Jake) R. Fox, Time and Process in an Early Village Settlement System on the Bolivian Southern Altiplano. PhD Thesis 2007 Wankarani culture arose in the area of the current Oruro Department in Bolivia near Lake Poopo. The Wankarani had developed a copper metallurgy by 1200 B.C. The area of the Altiplano close to Bolivia yielded the earliest evidence of metalworking in South America. This is the site of Jisk'a Iru Muqu, also spelled Jiskairumoko, in the Lake Titikaka basin, which was first investigated in 1994. A necklace consisting of nine gold beads was found in an excavated grave located next to a Terminal Archaic pit-house. Charcoal recovered from the burial dates the gold beads to 2155-1936 cal BC  Preceramic in Chile  Some of the early preceramic cultures flourished both in Peru and in Chile. This applies to the Chinchorro culture that was active in what is now northern Chile and southern Peru. This culture left us the Chinchorro mummies; these are the oldest examples of artificially mummified human remains in the world. The oldest mummy recovered from the Atacama Desert is dated around 7020 BC.Arriaza, Bernardo T. Beyond Death: The Chinchorro Mummies of Ancient Chile. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1995.

New England  The New England region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the provinces and many towns as well, tried to foster economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, inns and ferries. They gave bounties and subsidies or monopolies to sawmills, grist mills, iron mills, pulling mills (which treated cloth), salt works and glassworks. Most important, colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights.

Jefferson supporters never stop complaining of the dangers provided by the special interests behind a private national Bank, and block the renewal of its charter in 1811. The bank closed, and the government had enormous difficulty in financing the War of 1812. President James Madison, despite his Jeffersonian heritage of anti-banking rhetoric, realized the need for a replacement, and the Second Bank of the United States was opened in 1816. It flourished, promoting a strong financial system across the country, until it was challenged and destroyed by President Andrew Jackson, Jefferson's successor, in the Bank War of 1832.Bray Hammond, Bank and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War (1957).Robert V.

By 1845, there were 31 textile companies‚Äîlocated in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and southern Maine‚Äîproduced one-fifth of all cotton and wool textiles in the United States. With the capital earned through these mills, they invested in railroads, especially the Boston and Lowell. These railroads helped transport the cotton from warehouses to factories.

It had a large port to handle imports and exports, and a large hinterland that included the tobacco regions of Maryland and Virginia. It dominated the flour trade. Alexander Brown (1764‚Äì1834) arrived in 1800 and set up a linen business and his firm Alex. Brown & Sons expanded into cotton and shipping, with branches in Liverpool, England, Philadelphia, and New York. The firm Helped finance the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to tap its own hinterland as far as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Brown was a business innovator after 1819 when cash and short credits became the norms of business relations. By concentrating his capital in small-risk ventures and acquiring ships and stock in the Second Bank of the United States he came to monopolize Baltimore's shipping trade with Liverpool by 1822. Brown next expanded into packet ships, extended his lines to Philadelphia, and began financing Baltimore importers, specializing in merchant banking from the late 1820s to his death in 1834. The emergence of a money economy and the growth of the Anglo-American cotton trade allowed him to escape Baltimore's declining position in trans-Atlantic trade. His most important innovation was the drawing up of his own bills of exchange. By 1830 his company rivaled the Bank of the United States in the American foreign exchange markets, and the transition from the \\"traditional\\" to the \\"modern\\" merchant was nearly complete. It became the nation's first investment banking.Gary L. Browne, \\"Business Innovation and Social Change: the Career of Alexander Brown after the War of 1812,\\" Maryland Historical Magazine (1974) 69#3 pp: 243-255.Stuart Bruchey, Robert Oliver, Merchant of Baltimore, 1783-1819 (1956). =Baltimore and Ohio Railroad= Baltimore faced economic stagnation unless it opened routes to the western states, as New York had done with the Erie Canal in 1820. In 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring \\"that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation.\\" Their answer was to build a railroad‚Äîone of the first commercial lines in the world. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) became the first important American railroad. Some 20,000 investors purchased $5 million in stock to import the rolling stock and build the line. It was a commercial and financial success, and invented many new managerial methods that became standard practice in railroading and modern business. The B&O; became the first company to operate a locomotive built in America, with the Tom Thumb in 1829. It built the first passenger and freight station (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad that earned passenger revenues (December 1829), and published a timetable (May 23, 1830). On December 24, 1852, it became the first rail line to reach the Ohio River from the eastern seaboard. The B&O; railroad was merged into CSX in 1987. Big business: the impact of the railroads Railroads had a dramatic large-scale impact on American business in five dimensions. =Shipping freight and passengers= First they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. The late 19th century pipelines were added, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation.Leland H. Jenks, \\"Railroads as an economic force in American development.\\" Journal of Economic History 4#1 (1944): 1-20. in JSTOR =Basis of the private financial system= Railroads financing provided the basis of the private (non-governmental) financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals. The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts. A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track. In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).Edward C. Kirkland, Industry comes of age: Business, labor, and public policy, 1860-1897 (1961) p 52, 68-74. Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \\"Patterns of American Railroad Finance, 1830-50,\\" Business History Review 28#3 (1954), pp. 248-263 in JSTOR The federal government provided no cash to any other railroads. However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route. Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. Larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.Kirkland, Industry comes of age (1961) pp 57-68. The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.Leland H. Jenks, \\"Britain and American railway development.\\" Journal of Economic History 11#4 (1951): 375-388. in JSTOR In 1914‚Äì1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies.Mira Wilkins, \\"Foreign Investment in the US Economy before 1914.\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science (1991): 9-21. in JSTORMuriel E.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \\"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., The Railroad and the Space Program (MIT Press, 1965) pp 127-62 After a serious accident, the Western Railroad of Massachusetts put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers keep track of all train movement. Discipline was essential‚Äîeveryone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.Chandler and Salsbury, \\"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\\" pp 130-34 As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations. The Erie Railroad, faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the Pennsylvania Railroad‚Äîthe largest in the world‚Äîwas making further advances in using bureaucracy under John Edgar Thomson, president 1852‚Äì1874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.Chandler and Salsbury, \\"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration,\\" pp 134-63 = Career paths= The fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakemen at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57. Women were not hired.Walter Licht, working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century (1983) p 289 White-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters. At each level they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care. Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.Licht, Working for the Railroad pp 262-63. 269. Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.Dora L. Costa, \\"The evolution of retirement.\\" in Costa, The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880-1990 (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6-31 online. =Love-hate relationship with the railroads= America developed a love-hate relationship with railroads. Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people who dressed in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that: :The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignified, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of Republicanism. The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime. Travel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores. Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering. Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue: : with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine a United States of continental proportions without the railroad.Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, Technology and American society: A history (2005) p 102. The engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.Robert Zussman, Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers (1985). By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and the Union Station in Washington DC.Carl W. Condit, \\"Cincinnati Passenger Stations Before 1930,\\" Railroad History No. 132 (1975) pp. 5-36 in JSTOR But there was also a dark side. As early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.George H. Douglas, All Aboard! The Railroad in American Life (1992), chapter 5 By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some \\"Granger Laws\\" passed.George H. Miller, \\"Origins of the Iowa Granger Law,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 40#4 (1954), pp. 657-680 in JSTOR Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated in late 19th century political rhetoric.Douglas, All Aboard! (1992), chapter 10. The idea of establishing a strong rate fixing federal body was achieved during the Progressive Era, primarily by a coalition of shipping interests.Harold U. Faulkner, The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897-1917 (1951), pp 187-219. Railroad historians mark the Hepburn Act of 1906 that gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates as a damaging blow to the long-term profitability and growth of railroads. After 1910 the lines faced an emerging trucking industry to compete with for freight, and automobiles and buses to compete for passenger service.Albro Martin, Railroads Triumphant: The Growth, Rejection, and Rebirth of a Vital American Force (Oxford UP, 1991), pp 348-64. Marketing The general store= General store exhibit at the Deaf Smith County Historical Museum in Hereford, Texas General stores, and itinerant peddlers, dominated in rural America until the coming of the automobile after 1910. Farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Often farmers would barter butter, cheese, eggs, vegetables or other foods which the merchant would resell. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criterion was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying off the bill when crops, hogs or cattle were later sold; the owner's ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success. The store was typically a gathering point for local men to chat, pass around the weekly newspaper, and talk politics.Lewis E. Atherton, The Frontier Merchant in Mid-America (1971).Thomas D. Clark, Pills, Petticoats, and Plows: The Southern Country Store (1944). In the South the general store was especially important after the Civil War, as the merchant was one of the few sources of seasonal credit available until the cash crops (usually cotton or tobacco) were harvested in the fall. There were very few nearby towns, so rural general stores and itinerant peddlers were the main sources of supply.Jacqueline P. Bull, \\"The General Merchant in the Economic History of the New South.\\" Journal of Southern History 18.1 (1952): 37-59. in JSTORGlenn N. Sisk, \\"Rural Merchandising in the Alabama Black Belt, 1875‚Äì1917.\\" Journal of Farm Economics 37.4 (1955): 705-715.Roger Ransom, and Richard Sutch. \\"Credit merchandising in the post-emancipation south: Structure, conduct, and performance.\\" Explorations in Economic History 16.1 (1979): 64-89; heavily statistical online = Retail in towns and small cities= In the small cities consumers had more choices, usually purchasing dry goods and supplies at locally owned department store. Sometimes entrepreneurs opened stores in nearby cities, as did the Goldwater family in Arizona. They had a much wider selection of goods than in the country general stores and price tags that gave the actual selling price. Department stores provided limited credit, and set up attractive displays and, after 1900, window displays as well. Their clerks‚Äîusually men before the 1940s‚Äîwere experienced salesmen whose knowledge of the products appealed to the better educated middle-class women who did most of the shopping. The keys to success were a large variety of high-quality brand-name merchandise, high turnover, reasonable prices, and frequent special sales. The larger stores sent their buyers to Chicago or other big wholesale centers once or twice a year to evaluate the newest trends in merchandising and stock up on the latest fashions. By the 1920s and 1930s, large mail-order houses such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward provided serious competition.Boris Emmet, and John E Jeuck, Catalogs and Counters: A History of Sears, Roebuck and Company (1950)Daniel J. Boorstin, \\"A. Montgomery Ward's Mail-Order Business,\\" Chicago History (1973) 2#3 pp 142‚Äì152. In response the local department stores came to rely even more on salesmanship as well as close integration with the community.Henry C. Klassen, \\"T.C. Power & Bro.: The Rise of a Small Western Department Store, 1870-1902,\\" Business History Review, (1992) 66#4 pp 671+ in JSTORWilliam R.

They followed a model that originated in London and Paris, but all the major department stores quickly copied new features from each other.Jan Whitaker, Service and Style: How the American Department Store Fashioned the Middle Class (2006). In New York City in 1862, Alexander Turney Stewart built a store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. Beauty and elegance were central themes, the department stores hired attractive upscale young women to deal with the customers, while the back rooms the men made practically all the decisions.Harry E. Resseguie, \\"Alexander Turney Stewart and the Development of the Department Store, 1823-1876,\\" Business History Review (1965) 39#3 pp. 301-322 in JSTORWilliam R.

Self-service, whereby the customer roamed the aisles and picked out what she wanted, was innovation in the early 20th century that made possible supermarket grocery chains and other forms of chain stores. Clarence Saunders (1881-1953) launched the self-service revolution with his Piggly Wiggly store in Memphis, Tennessee in 1916.Mike Freeman, Clarence Saunders and the Founding of Piggly Wiggly: The Rise & Fall of a Memphis Maverick (2011) excerpt The store depended on personal shopping baskets, branded products, and checkouts at the front. A critical ingredient was the educated consumer who had familiarized herself with brand-name products and prices. By 1922, Piggly Wiggly had opened 1,200 stores in 29 states. Saunders, however, went bankrupt through speculation on Wall Street in 1923. By 1932, the chain had grown to 2,660 stores doing over $180 million annually. The stores were either owned by the firm and franchised. The success encouraged imitators, including Handy Andy stores, Helpy Selfy stores, Mick- or-Mack stores and Jitney Jungle, all of which operated under patented systems.Paul Henry Nystrom, Economics of Retailing (1930) During Great Depression, chain stores became the targets of angry local merchants, who secured the Robinson‚ÄìPatman Act of 1936; it was a federal law that required all retailers to charge the same price for certain items. = Advertising= J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903 By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession. At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers. N. W. Ayer & Son was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia. In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising. Most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: Quaker Oats, Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and Procter & Gamble soap. By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires, nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.Daniel Pope, The making of modern advertising (1983) pp 42-46. Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of copywriters.Ralph Hower, The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer & Son 1869-1949 (1949) pp 58-59. Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1900 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.Stanford Ewen, Captains of Consciousness (1976), p. 33. \\"As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single- purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods.\\" Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.  The golden age of black entrepreneurship The nadir of race relations was reached in the early 20th century, in terms of political and legal rights. Blacks were increasingly segregated. However the more they were cut off from the larger white community, the more black entrepreneurs succeeded in establishing flourishing businesses that catered to a black clientele. In urban areas, North and South, the size and income of the black population was growing, providing openings for a wide range of businesses, from barbershops Quincy T. Mills, Cutting along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America (2013) online to insurance companies.Walter B. Weare, Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company (1973).Robert E. Weems, Jr., Black Business in the Black Metropolis: The Chicago Metropolitan Assurance Company, 1925-1985 (1996) Undertakers had a special niche, and often played a political role.Robert L.

According to the National Negro Business League, the number black-owned businesses doubled from 20,000 1900 and 40,000 in 1914. There were 450 undertakers in 1900 and, rising to 1000. Drugstores rose from 250 to 695. Local retail merchants ‚Äì most of them quite small ‚Äì jumped from 10,000 to 25,000.August Meier, \\"Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T.

Walker Manufacturing Company based on her invention of the first successful hair straightening process.A'Lelia Bundles, On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker (2002) excerpt College president Booker T. Washington (1856-1915), who ran the National Negro Business League was the most prominent promoter of black business. He moved from city to city to sign up local entrepreneurs into his national network the National Negro Business League.Michael B. Boston, The Business Strategy of Booker T. Washington: Its Development and Implementation (2010) onlineLouis R. Harlan, \\"Booker T. Washington and the National Negro Business League\\" in Raymond W. Smock, ed. Booker T. Washington in Perspective: Essays of Louis R. Harlan (1988) pp. 98-109. online Although black business flourished in urban areas, it was severely handicapped in the rural South where the great majority of blacks lived. Blacks were farmers who depended on one cash crop, typically cotton or tobacco. They chiefly traded with local white merchants. The primary reason was that the local country stores provided credit, that is the provided supplies the farm and family needed, including tools, seeds, food and clothing, on a credit basis until the bill was paid off at harvest time. Black businessmen had too little access to credit to enter this business.Jacqueline P. Bull, \\"The General Merchant in the Economic History of the New South.\\" Journal of Southern History 18.1 (1952): 37-59. in JSTORGlenn N. Sisk, \\"Rural Merchandising in the Alabama Black Belt, 1875‚Äì1917.\\" Journal of Farm Economics 37.4 (1955): 705-715. in JSTOR Indeed, there were only a small number of wealthy blacks ; overwhelmingly they were real estate speculators in the fast- growing cities, such as Robert Reed Church in Memphis.Meier, Negro thought in America, 1880-1915 p 140. Heavy industrySteel= Numerous smaller companies when operation before the Civil War the British innovation of making inexpensive steel, which is much stronger than traditional ironwork, cause the radical transformation. Young Andrew Carnegie (1835‚Äì1919) was a key leader. He was not an engineer, but he gave experts in the mills in Pittsburgh their lead, and he moved to New York City to sell large quantities of steel for the new bridges, railways and skyscrapers. Eads Bridge across the Mississippi River at ST Louis, opened in 1874 using Carnegie steel By 1890 Carnegie Steel was the world's largest manufacturer of pig iron, steel rails, and coke. In 1888, Carnegie bought the rival Homestead Steel Works, which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a 425-mile (685 km) long railway, and a line of lake steamships. Consolidation came in 1892 through the Carnegie Steel Company. By 1889, American output of steel exceeded that of Britain, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. By 1900, the profits of Carnegie Bros. & Company alone stood at $40,000,000 with $25,000,000 being Carnegie's share. Carnegie's empire grew to include the J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works, Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark Eads Bridge project across the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology which marked the opening of a new steel market.Jonathan Hughes, The Vital View: American Economic Progress and its protagonists (1966) pp 220-73 covers Carnegie's industrial career. U.S. Steel was the iconic billion-dollar industrial corporation. It was formed by banker J. P. Morgan (1837-1913) and lawyer Elbert H. Gary (1846-1927) in 1901 by combining the Carnegie Steel Company with Gary's Federal Steel Company, and several smaller concerns. Carnegie permanently left industry to become a philanthropist on a global basis, and judge Gary ran the operation. In 1907, it received federal permission to buy out its largest competitor, the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, To end a panic on Wall Street. It escaped prosecution for monopoly by arguing it had never engaged in any illegal monopolistic practices. But it was classes, and year-by-year watched its share of the market decline has been competitors entered the steel industry to provide warships, building materials and supply railroad same consumer products. By 1902 U.S. Steel made 67 percent of all the steel produced in the United States. One hundred years later, it accounted for only 8 percent of domestic consumption.Kenneth Warren, Big Steel: The First Century of the United States Steel Corporation 1901-2001 (2001).

It failed because of the difficulty of moving a large force through the forest. After his defeat at Akhulgo in 1839 Shamil established a new headquarters at Dargo in a forested valley in Chechnya about south of the Russian lines. The region was called Ichkeria. In late 1841 Count Grabbe visited Saint Petersburg and persuaded Nicholas I to give him command of the forces on the Left Flank and northern Dagestan, that is, the area north and east of Dargo. From at least 21 March 1842 Shamil and most of his men were fighting at Kazi-Kumukh about southeast of Dargo. Grabbe decided to attack Shamil's capital in his absence. Grabbe's intention was to march quickly south to Dargo, destroy it, and then move south over the mountain and take Andi and Gumbet. He had 10,000 men and 24 guns. The size of his force worked against him. To carry his supplies he needed a large number of carts and 3,000 horses. Because of the poor roads, or trails, through the forest the baggage train strung out over several versts {kilometers} and it took half his force to guard it on both sides. With several battalions for front and rear guard, the various parts of the line could not protect each other. In addition to the hills and rivers the mountaineers began to build barricades and set ambushes. On 30 May {all dates old style, so add 12 days for the Western calendar}, Grabbe left Gerzel north of Dargo. He went south along the left bank of the Aksay River, the same route as Vorontsov‚Äôs retreat in 1845. That day he made only 7 vests against no resistance (the sources do not say whether the Chechens had advance knowledge of the attack. If they had no warning it would have taken them several days to bring up their reserves). That night it rained heavily, making the road worse. On the second day they made 12 versts in 15 hours, fighting all the way. They were forced to camp for the night on a waterless plain. On the third day they made only 6 versts. The enemy had increased to something under 2,000, the roads were more difficult, barricades more frequent, the troops had been short of water for two days, there were already several hundred wounded and confusion increased hourly. On the night of the third day (1 June) Grabbe saw that further advance was impossible and gave orders to retreat along the same road. The retreat was worse than the advance. It necessitated the abandonment, or, where possible, the destruction of everything that would slow their movements. The retreat became vary disorganized and assumed the appearance of a rout {The sources do not say whether this was due to command failure or whether there was some other problem}. On 4 June (the sixth day) they arrived back in Gerzel, having lost 66 officers, 1700 men, one field gun and nearly all their provisions and stores. When Shamil heard of Grabbe‚Äôs movement he abandoned his perhaps unprofitable campaign and hurried back to Chechnya. When he arrived the fighting was already over. The impact of Grabbe's failure was even greater because he had faced only the local levies of two Naibs ‚Äì Shu ‚Äòayb and Ullubey. A month later Grabbe made an unsuccessful raid against Igali on the Andi Koysu. After this he was released from command at his own request. Grabbe's return was witnessed by Prince Chernyshev, the Minister of War. This contributed to Nicolas' decision to forbid all major raids into the interior, a policy that did not work well.

Jones (born 1968 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is an African-American artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York. Her work has been described, by Ken Johnson, as evoking minimalism, and paying tribute to the cross-pollination of different genres of music, especially jazz. As an artist, she connects most of her work between art and sound. Such connections are made with multiple mediums, from paintings to sculptures and paper to audio collages. In 2012, Jones was the recipient of the Joyce Alexander Wien Prize, one of the biggest awards given to an individual artist in the United States. The prize honors one African-American artist who has proven their commitment to innovation and creativity, with an award of 50,000 dollars. In December 2015 a 10-year survey of Jones's work, titled Compilation, opened at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, Texas. Education Jennie C. Jones received her BFA at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, in 1991. She then graduated from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, earning her MFA in 1996. In the summer of 1996, Jones was a participant at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. Work Jones is a visual and sonic artist whose paintings, sculptures, and works on paper incorporate ideas around minimalism, abstraction, Jazz, and Black history. Valerie Cassel Oliver noted in her ‚ÄúOutside The Lines,‚Äù catalogue essay, that ‚Äúworking in painting as well as sound, she has mined the politics, culture and aesthetic innovations of the mid-20th century and has emerged with sharp criticisms and astute queries that are now embedded in the work. Jones‚Äôs work challenges us to understand the frameworks of modernism, which embraced black musical forms but excluded black visual art from its canon\\". During Absorb / Diffuse, her fall 2011 exhibition at The Kitchen in New York City, Jones presented a piece titled From The Low, which is a sound piece that has multiple music samples, ranging from jazz to modern electronica. From The Low presents her political statement: that African-American artists and musicians are absent from modernism. The samples used in this sound piece have been \\"given a new context, perhaps to be classified in a category of black minimalism\\". The audio pieces are constructed using traditional sound editing methodologies and often have their origin in historic recordings. With the amalgamation of industrial acoustic materials, often used in recording studios and listening rooms, Jones's art focuses on building a bridge between two-dimensional works, architecture, and sound. Jennie has stated that \\"conceptualism allows these different media to occupy the same space.‚Äù Jones is a critic in the Sculpture Department at Yale University. _2000s- Early Work:_ In Jones's 'Selected Early Works,' she combined photography, visual arts, and audio art. Jones's website displays 30 images of her work completed in the 2000s. These works not only includes static, lasting art but also records of her installation art, such as her 2003 A/V Sound Work installation. These works, along with the works that follow, are easily accessible on her artist website. Towards the end of the early years of Jones work she received the William H. Johnson Prize in 2008. This is a $25,000 award given to African American artists based in the Los Angeles area. _2009- Atlanta:_ This installation was a collection of visual works of acrylic painting, ink and collage works among other mediums. Jones's \\"Atlanta\\" exhibit at the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center. _2010- Electric:_ This collection is a variety of 2-D and 3-D works exhibited at Sikkema, Jenkins & Co. Gallery during July 8 - August 13, 2010. _2011- Absorb, Silence:_ This installation at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, California was a combination of acrylic paintings, installation art, and various other 3-D art works. _2012- Harmonic Disruption:_ This exhibit was a collection of ink works on paper and installations of cable and speakers located in the Arratia Beer gallery in Berlin, Germany. _2013- Higher Resonance:_ At the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Gallery in Washington, D.C., this exhibit contained works of acrylic paint, wood, fiberglass, mineral wool filling, and fabric. _2014- Tone:_ In a combination of acrylic paint on canvas and acoustic absorber panel, noise cancelling cable, and mixed media collage, Jones's Tone was displayed at Sikkema, Jenkins & Co. Gallery. _2015- Group:_ This exhibition was a group collection at the Sikkema, Jenkins & Co. Gallery. Jones, along with Josephine Halvorson and Leslie Hewitt displayed works of paintings and photography during 12/11/15 - 1/28/16. _2016- Compilation:_ This installation at The Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, TX, was on display from December 11, 2015 - March 27, 2016 and combined 2D art and 3D art. _2017- Amplitude:_ This installation included both paint on canvas and acoustic soundboard. The Sikkema, Jenkins & Co. Gallery had this to say about Jones's Amplitude: \\"Jennie C. Jones' work exposes the connections between conceptual and avant-garde African-American music and the cultural, political, and historical ideas surrounding Minimalism and Abstraction. Jones brings to light the unlikely alliances that emerged between the visual arts and the imprint of music, highlighting the way they became and continue to exist as tangible markers of social evolution and political strivings.\\" _2018- Alternative Takes:_ This installation was at the Patron Gallery, Chicago, IL from February 3 - March 18, 2018. It combined acrylic paint and 3D art. _RPM (The Glass House):_ This installation brings together audio collages and works on paper. It was displayed at The Glass House, New Cannon, CT from September 2018 - January 2019. Exhibitions Jones's work has been exhibited all over the world. One of her first notable New York City group shows was \\"Freestyle\\" at the Studio Museum in Harlem, a show that included artists such as Sanford Biggers, Mark Bradford, Julie Mehretu, and Rashid Johnson.

He was the founding editor of three Pittsburgh newspapers, most notably the Pittsburgh Dispatch. Biography Born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania on 18 April 1822, Foster became a resident of Pittsburgh in the spring of 1831. He was the youngest son of Alexander W. Foster, for many years a prominent attorney in Western Pennsylvania. As a youth Foster worked as an apprentice in the printing business. At the age of only nineteen years, he became the initial editor of the Pittsburgh Morning Chronicle in company with publisher Richard G. Berford. Foster was a social and moral crusader from his earliest editorials, targeting such vices as drunkenness, corner loafing, and desecration of the Sabbath. Subsequent to his time at the Chronicle, he co-founded and edited the Spirit of the Age, which, after he left it, became the Commercial Journal. In 1846 he put out the first issue of the Dispatch, the paper with which he was connected in editorial and ownership roles for the rest of his life. A staunch opponent of slavery, Foster was nominated by a Free Soil Party convention in late 1852 for Mayor of Pittsburgh. He ran a distant third for that office behind the two main-party candidates. By 1855 he had aligned himself with the Know Nothings; historian Michael F. Holt called him \\"the city's leading Know Nothing editor.\\" Foster was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 1858 session and again for the 1859 session, each time on a fusion ticket comprising Republicans and allies. * * Foster served as an officer in the Civil War, eventually attaining the post of district Provost Marshal. After the war, he was brevetted from captain to colonel for meritorious service. He had been known as \\"Colonel\\" even before the war, from his rank in the state militia. After a lengthy struggle with lung disease, Foster died on 21 April 1868 at his home in Allegheny City. A funeral procession more than a mile long escorted the remains to Allegheny Cemetery. Mark Twain, in his travelogue The Innocents Abroad (1869), noted with sadness the loss of the man he called \\"a most estimable gentleman.\\" The two had met on the overseas voyage on which the book was based.

The terrace became a Grade II listed building in 1972. Street artist Banksy drew an artwork, The Spy Booth, on either side of a public telephone booth adjacent to the gable end of number 159 in April 2014. The work was destroyed in August 2016.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-37148473 Buildings The terrace comprises four houses (odd numbers, from right to left: 153, 155, 157 and 159), constructed between c.1806 and 1835, with later 19th and 20th century additions and rear extensions. Fairview Road was developed from 1806, when the field in which the road was built was inclosed by an Act of Parliament. The two-storey houses were built from ashlar blocks, and are now covered in stucco, with pilasters between the houses and at each end of the row, and string course between the floors. A parapet with frieze atop the fa√ßade conceals the pitched roof. 153 also has an architrave and cornice. 153 and 155 have three bays each, originally with 2-over-2 sash windows, and 157 and 159 have two bays each, originally with 1-over-1 sash windows. All have their entrance door in the right bay, recessed in 153 and 155, and all have glazed overlights above panelled doors. A house adjacent to 159 Fairview Road, at 64 Hewlett Road, was acquired by Gloucestershire County Council in around 1962 and demolished to allow for road improvement works. Artwork Street artist Banksy drew an artwork, \\"The Spy Booth\\", on either side of a public telephone adjacent to the gable end of number 159 in April 2014, showing three stereotypical secret agents wearing dark sunglasses and brown raincoats, holding microphones to eavesdrop. The building is approximately from The Doughnut, the headquarters of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The artwork drew hundreds of visitors and suffered from several acts of vandalism before it was boarded up to protect it. Some reports indicate that it was sold to Sky Grimes, and was damaged in an attempt to remove the plaster on which it was created. Gloucestershire County Council delivered a \\"stop notice\\" requiring works to remove the plaster to cease, and then granted retrospective listed buildings consent for the artwork in February 2015, giving it protection under the building's listing. However, the work was destroyed in August 2016.

The memorial commemorates approximately 25,000 British and Commonwealth sailors who were lost in the World Wars, around 10,000 sailors in the First World War and 15,000 in the Second World War. The memorial features a central obelisk, with names of the dead on bronze plaques arranged around the memorial according to the year of death. To commemorate sailors who had died at sea in the First World War and had no known grave, an Admiralty committee recommended building memorials at the three main naval ports in Great Britain: Chatham, Plymouth, and Portsmouth. Identical memorials at all three sites were designed by Sir Robert Lorimer, with sculpture by Henry Poole. A separate memorial in Lowestoft commemorates the lost from the Royal Naval Patrol Service; the Fleet Air Arm is commemorated in Lee-on-the-Solent; and merchant seamen are commemorated at the Liverpool Naval Memorial and the Tower Hill Memorial in London. The Royal Naval Division War Memorial is on Horseguards Parade in London. The memorial is made of Portland stone, with a prominent central obelisk topped by a metal finial. Steps lead up to a plinth bearing bronze inscription plaques fixed to the obelisk's base bearing the names of the lost. Each corner projects as a buttress, surmounted by a statue of a reclining lion, beneath a stepped base to the obelisk. The four-sided obelisk tapers slightly to a stepped top with an elaborate finial with corner ships prows and bronze supports to a verdigris copper ball. The memorial was unveiled on 15 October 1924 by Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI). The memorial was extended after the Second World War, to a design by Sir Edward Maufe. Names of those lost in the Second World War are recorded on panels set into the low walls of an enclosure added to the north, leading to a barrel-vaulted pavilion on each side. Additional sculpture was created by Charles Wheeler, William McMillan, and Esmond Burton. The additions were unveiled by the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, on 29 April 1953. The memorial is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It became a listed building in 1972, and was upgraded to Grade I in May 2016 for the centenary of the Battle of Jutland.

She is known today for her translations of Plato.  Translations of Plato Mason's annotated translations of Plato's dialogues in everyday English were published anonymously by Charles Scribner's Sons beginning in 1879, with a book titled Socrates that included translations of the Apology, Crito, and parts of Phaedo. The book also included an introduction by William Watson Goodwin, professor of Greek at Harvard University. This book was followed by A Day in Athens With Socrates (1883; includes translations from Protagoras and The Republic), Talks with Socrates About Life (1886; Gorgias and The Republic), and Talks with Athenian Youths (1891; Charmides, Lysis, Laches, Euthydemus, and Theaetetus). Although her name did not appear on the title pages of any of these books, her identity as the translator was known to librarians by 1880. Her translations of Plato inspired Jo Walton to include her as a character renamed Aristomache in her novel The Just City, where she has been transported to an experimental community based on Plato's Republic. Walton writes in an author's note that Mason's life \\"is like a type-example of how difficult it was for women to lead a life of the mind\\" in her day.  Personal life and organizational work Mason was the daughter of Robert Means Mason (son of U.S. Senator Jeremiah Mason), and Sarah Ellen Francis. She lived in Beacon Hill in Boston, where she was a patron of the arts, an Associate (trustee) of Radcliffe College., and a friend to authors like Sarah Orne Jewett. She spent summers in Newport, Rhode Island, where she lived in a mansion with her sister Ida Means Mason, and served as president of the Newport Civic League for many years. Her death was reported by the Newport Mercury on May 2, 1930. She and her sister (who died two years earlier) left estates of nearly $5 million to charity.

Description The bigmouth chub has a body length that averages 15.2 centimeters and can reach up to 21.4 centimeters. The chub has an elongated body that is nearly circular in cross section. It has a triangular head and a pointy snout. The mouth of the chub is medium-sized and has a barbell on each side. The chub has eight dorsal fin rays, eight pelvic fin rays, seven anal fin rays, and fourteen to seventeen pectoral fin rays. The fish is covered with cycloid scales. The scales on the chub's dorsal section, or top of the fish, have brown pigment. The scales on the ventral section, or bottom of the fish, lack pigment and are white in appearance. Habitat It is generally found in pools and fast moving waterways in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia. Many populations are located in the New River of West Virginia and its tributaries. The fish prefers clear rivers with warm temperatures. The substrate of rivers inhabited by the bigmouth chub ranges from pebbles to boulders. It avoids the shallowest parts of rivers and waterways, and tends to be found near substrate. Reproduction The chub reproduces through spawning. Spawning occurs in gravel spawning mounds created by the male. The mounds tend to be located in areas with small to large-sized gravel and with medium water speeds. Conservation status It is ranked as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The fish is not seen as at risk for extinction due to its large and stable population size, large habitat range and a lack of wide-scale threats to its survival.

They presume that \\"enterprises, from small to large, evolve continuously. As a result, their structures are transformed and extended continuously. Without some means of control, such changes are bound to lead to an overly complex, uncoordinated and heterogeneous environment that is hard to manage and hard to adapt to future changes.

As a consequence, architecture principles should be seen as the cornerstones of any architecture.\\"Greefhorst & Proper (2013, summary) Furthermore, they argue, that this work \\"provide[s] both a theoretical and a practical perspective on architecture principles. The theoretical perspective involves a brief survey of the general concept of principle as well as an analysis of different flavors of principles. Architecture principles are regarded as a specific class of normative principles that direct the design of an enterprise, from the definition of its business to its supporting IT. The practical perspective on architecture principles is concerned with an approach to the formulation of architecture principles, as well as their actual use in organizations.\\"  Publications  Danny Greefhorst has authored and co-authored numerous publications in the fields of enterprise architecture, software engineering and IT.

He was known for his sumptuous paintings with a dramatic and colourful style. Dating from circa 1545‚Äì1548, the painting was commissioned by a noble patron in Verona. It is held by the National Gallery in London. Subject The subject of the painting had been debated: the general opinion is that it depicts the conversion of Mary Magdalene, as described in Pietro Aretino's 1535 book L'umanit√† di Cristo; this version of the Gospels was widely distributed and read in Northern Italy at this time. In the legend that inspired the painting, Mary went to a temple where the teachings of Jesus inspired her to convert to a pious life. In the painting she is depicted in dress inappropriate for the religious building, which Veronese used to symbolise her prior sinful life. She is shown on her knees and blushing as she listens to Jesus. Painting The scene that the painting depicts is an event that is not described in the Bible or the Golden Legend. Martha and Mary Magdalene are in the Temple where Jesus is preaching. Mary Magdalene is on her knees beside Christ, turning her face towards him, while Martha is extending her hands towards Christ and Mary Magdalene. Her low-cut dress alludes to her former life of sin, and the necklace slipping from her neck echoes her turn away from a worldly life towards one of spiritual devotion. Paolo Veronese was known for his depictions of luxurious settings and love of decorating the most holy and sacred of scenes with people clad in shimmering fur-lined gowns made of silks and brocades, more reminiscent of Venetian high society than humble representations of the subjects. When the Inquisition questioned his choice of representing holy subjects he answered: \\"We painters take liberties, the same way that poets and lunatics do\\", thus asserting that his liberty as an artist included being able to choose how to portray his subjects. The painting has been held by the National Gallery in London since 1876, when it was bequeathed from the estate of art collector Wynn (or Wynne) Ellis.

Early life and family Bass Weston was born in Early County, Georgia, the daughter of an African-American mother from Georgia and father from South Carolina. Her father was of West Indian descent, her dance style was influenced by her Caribbean background. She was the youngest of 10 children born to Brutus Bass and Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" (n√©e Holmes), both farmers.1910 United States Federal Census Career During the 1920s, the teenager toured Mexico, where she was spotted by the artist Diego Rivera, who was reportedly enraptured by her beauty. Rivera sought an introduction through the American Consulate, and he secured her services as a model for his portraits. Bass spent three years touring Central and South America with the Folkl√≥rico group. Her dance repertoire was influenced by dances from Africa, Egypt, Africa, Cuba, Brazil and America. In Mexico City, she was a critical darling of the press after her performance at the famed Palacio de Bellas Artes. The magazine Hoy wrote, \\"Maudelle is the high priestess of the dances. She possesses a kind of spiritual mysticism,\\" while √öltimas Noticias wrote, \\"She tells the story of the dance with rapture and passion.\\" Bass Weston moved to Los Angeles around 1933, where she continued her training at John Gray's Conservatory of Music in Los Angeles, and was trained in ballet by Isobel Keith Morrison. She was the first African American to study with modern choreographer Lester Horton. In L.A., she established herself as a well-known studio model for art schools and for artists such as Rivera, Johan Hagemeyer, and Edward Weston. She continued to tour for many years and was nationally known for her performances. The renowned dancer La Meri, an expert in ethnic dance, said, \\"Maudelle is an artist of rare and moving sincerity.

Investigation The NCAA's investigation into violations by Syracuse athletics date back to May 2007, following an initial report by the university to the NCAA, after the university learned that local YMCA employees paid some football and men's basketball student- athletes; Syracuse claims the NCAA‚Äôs investigation of Syracuse has taken longer than any other investigation in NCAA history. On October 27, 2010, Syracuse formally submitted a written report detailing actual and potential NCAA violations to the NCAA, who in turn sent Syracuse a written notice of inquiry on December 2, 2010.Syracuse University Public Infractions Decision, p. 70. Initial media reports Prior to the NCAA's March 2015 infractions report, Syracuse and national media began reporting on potential rules violations by Syracuse athletics. Yahoo! Sports reported on March 5, 2012, that Syracuse often failed to follow its own internal drug policy. On March 20, 2013, CBS Sports and the Syracuse Post-Standard reported that the NCAA was investigating Syracuse in issues that CBS called \\"both major and wide-ranging in nature\\". ESPN revealed on October 29, 2014, that Syracuse had a hearing with the NCAA Committee on Infractions in Indianapolis scheduled for the next two days. As the NCAA continued its investigation, The Post-Standard continued to reveal new areas of investigation. On November 17, 2014, the newspaper reported that the NCAA was investigating possible improper benefits offered by the YMCA of Oneida, New York to Syracuse student-athletes, including falsified internship hours for credit in the child and family services major. Findings The NCAA found that men's basketball coach Jim Boeheim failed to promote compliance of NCAA rules within his program for nearly a decade. =Eligibility of Fab Melo= In the summer of 2012, Syracuse learned that men's basketball player Fab Melo (identified in the infractions report as \\"student-athlete 7\\") received improper assistance on coursework.Syracuse University Public Infractions Decision, p. 18. After Melo was suspended for academic ineligibility in January 2012, athletic director Daryl Gross held a meeting with other academics and athletics officials to create a strategy to reinstate Melo, an unprecedented move. Ultimately, it was decided that Melo would be allowed to re-submit a paper from a class taken two semesters prior to raise his grade for eligibility. Melo initially submitted his own work on January 27, 2012, but his professor considered Melo's work \\"inadequate\\"; within a few hours, Melo re-submitted his assignment and received sufficient credit to raise his grade in the class from a C+ to a B-.Syracuse University Public Infractions Decision, pp. 25-26. On January 30, two days before Melo was cleared to play basketball again, the Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences questioned the grade change. The NCAA and university also investigated the circumstances behind Melo regaining eligibility and found that based on file metadata, staffers on the men's basketball team completed Melo's assignment.Syracuse University Public Infractions Decision, p. 26. =Oneida YMCA= The NCAA found that the YMCA of Oneida, New York provided improper benefits to student-athletes and coaches. Jeff Cornish, the youth sports coordinator at the Oneida YMCA from 1996 to 2006, used a checking account to pay over $8,000 to three football and two basketball student- athletes in 14 months. Also, Oneida YMCA CEO Hank Leo hired three football players as interns for academic credit but falsified certifications that the student-athletes met their service requirements for said credit. The improper benefits were not restricted to student-athletes: The NCAA found that the YMCA gave an assistant coach a free gym membership, paid two trainers to volunteer at basketball clinics, and subsidized the rental payment for an administrative assistant. Penalties Prior to the NCAA's final infractions report, Syracuse self-imposed a one-year postseason ban on February 4, 2015. In March 2015, the NCAA released its infractions report which found that Syracuse had possibly violated rules. As a result, 101 wins were vacated by the NCAA from 2004‚Äì05, 2006‚Äì07 and from 2010‚Äì11, 2011-12 seasons. However, the NCAA confirmed that sanctions did not include the removal of any trophies or banners. As a result, Syracuse can keep the banner for its 2012 team's run to the NCAA Elite 8 and 2011 advancement to the third round of the NCAA tournament. Also, A Big East Conference official confirmed that the conference's updated media guide continues to list Syracuse as its 2005 and 2006 tournament champion. This reduced the number of Boeheim's career wins at the time from 966 to 858 and dropped Boeheim from second to sixth in all-time wins. Previous to the NCAA decision, Syracuse voluntarily vacated 24 men's basketball wins: 15 from the 2004‚Äì05 season and 9 from the 2011‚Äì12 season. Following an appeal by Syracuse University, the NCAA reduced its scholarship reduction for Syracuse over the seasons from 2015‚Äì16 to 2018‚Äì19 from 12 to 8. Syracuse voluntarily vacated all 11 wins from the 2004 to 2006 football seasons, and the NCAA placed Syracuse football on probation until 2020.

The stream is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters, but was historically stocked. It has an alkalinity concentration of 2 milligrams per liter, but is slightly acidic. The surficial geology in its vicinity mainly consists of alluvium, Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. Course Conety Run begins on Stony Cabin Ridge in Fairview Township. It flows west for a short distance before turning south-southwest for several tenths of a mile. It then passes through Fountain Lake and turns south for several tenths of a mile. The stream then enters Dennison Township and turns south-southeast. After more than a mile, it turns south-southwest and then south, crossing Pennsylvania Route 437. The stream then flows south- southeast for several tenths of a mile until it reaches its confluence with Little Nescopeck Creek. Conety Run joins Little Nescopeck Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Conety Run is not considered to be impaired. The concentration of alkalinity in Conety Run is 2 milligrams per liter. The stream is slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.2. The concentration of water hardness is 5 milligrams per liter. The specific conductance of the waters of Conety Run is 22 micro-siemens. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Conety Run is above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is between above sea level. The surficial geology along the lower reaches of Conety Run mainly consists of alluvium. However, bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and a small patch of Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift are also present in the stream's vicinity. In the stream's upper reaches, the surficial geology consists almost entirely of bedrock and Wisconsinan Till. Watershed The watershed of Conety Run has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of White Haven. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Wilkes-Barre East. The watershed is in the northwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The watershed is considerably longer than it is wide. Considerably more than 80 percent of the watershed of Conety Run is forested land. There are fewer than of local roads in the watershed of Conety Run. There are only a few miles of state roads in the watershed. Pennsylvania Route 437 is in the vicinity of the stream. A lake known as Fountain Lake is located near the headwaters of Conety Run. History Conety Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1172312. The community of Glen Summit Springs was historically located near Conety Run. The Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Lehigh Valley Railroad also passed through that area. In 2012, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission requested that Conety Run, along with several dozen other streams in Pennsylvania, be upgraded to High-Quality Coldwater Fishery status. This was requested because of the Class A Wild Trout Waters status of the streams. Biology Conety Run is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. It has held this status since at least 2012. However, the stream is considered to be infertile. Fish were stocked in Conety Run in the early 1960s.

When a collection of his designs came to light some 60 years after his death, it became apparent that he had been a prolific art forger. Early and private life Vasters was born in Erkelenz, a few miles north of Aachen. His father was a locksmith. His father died when he was aged 8, and he was raised by his uncle. After attending school, he trained as a goldsmith in Krefeld, and developed his skills further in London, Paris and Vienna. He exhibited works at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, and won a prize. He moved to Aachen, registering his mark in 1853. In Aachen, he worked with Heinrich Joseph Viethen making and repairing metal articles for the cathedral, and developed a reputation as a specialist in antique liturgical gold and silver. He married Anna Catharina Josepha Hammacher in 1855; she was the sister of painter Theodor Hammacher. They had three children, but she died shortly after giving birth to the third in 1859. Vasters suffered a stroke and died in Aachen, aged 82 years. He was survived by two children and eight grandchildren. Art forgeries To support his family after his wife's death, Vasters started to create reproduction works in a historical style. He worked for the art historian Franz Bock, who moved to Aachen in 1862, and for goldsmiths August Witte and Martin Vogeno. He also worked for the art dealer Fr√©d√©ric Spitzer from Vienna, who helped Vasters to sell historical fakes. He became an expert in creating convincing fakes, which he distressed and aged, and also added fake later additions and fake workmen's marks. He became an expert in faking Renaissance jewellery, in the styles of, for example, Wenzel Jamnitzer, Leone Leoni, or Valerio Belli. When an archive of his designs came to light in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London in the 1970s, it became apparent that many works held by that museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, originally considered to be originals, were faked by Vasters. The designs were acquired in Aachen in 1909 by the art dealer Murray Marks, sold to Lazare Lowenstein in 1918, and donated to the V&A; in 1919. One example is the Rospigliosi Cup, previously attributed to Benvenuto Cellini and then to Jacopo Bilivert or Biliverti. He is suspected to be involved in several objects in the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum. Others are still undiscovered in other museums and private collections.

In addition to serving during the Indian Wars, he was Commandant of Cadets at the United States Military Academy from 1908 to 1911.  Early life  Frederick W. Sibley was born at Fort Phantom Hill in Texas on October 17, 1852, to U.S. Army Colonel Caleb C. Sibley and Nancy Davenport-Sibley. In 1869 at the age of 16, Frederick was admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point from Georgia, and graduated in the class of 1874.  Indian Wars  Sibley was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the 2nd United States Cavalry Regiment on June 17, 1874 and initially stationed in Nebraska before moving to Wyoming Territory. In March, 1876, he participated with Company E, 2nd Cavalry in the Big Horn Expedition, and on March 17, fought with his company in the Battle of Powder River, Montana Territory. Three months later on June 17, Sibley participated in the Battle of the Rosebud under General George Crook. The battle was a defeat for Crook's men, and they retreated to Goose Creek in Wyoming Territory. = Sibley Scout = After remaining idle for more than two weeks at Goose Creek, on July 6, 1876 General Crook ordered Lieutenant Sibley to take 25 men and two scouts, Big Bat Pourier and Frank Grouard, and make a reconnaissance to the north to locate Indians. Two civilians joined Sibley's party, bringing the total up to 30 men. While traveling down the Tongue River in the vicinity of present-day Dayton, Wyoming, the scouting party discovered a large party of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors moving south very close to them. Their only chance of escape was to take a trail to the Bighorn Mountains. The war party followed closely, and after surviving attacks by pursuing Indians, the patrol abandoned their horses and traveled deep into the rough steep terrain of the Tongue River Canyon system on foot. Over several days the group was able to evade the Indian force, after which they walked over thirty miles out of the mountains back to the Goose Creek camp, arriving worn out and fatigued but with no casualties. For this event, Lieutenant Sibley was brevetted to First Lieutenant for \\"gallantry in action on the Little Big Horn River\\". In July 1876, he was recommended for the Medal of Honor.Life and Adventures of Frank Grouard, Joe DeBarth, Combe Printing Company, St. Joseph, Missouri, 1894, pp. 266‚Äì292.Troopers with Custer: Historic Incidents of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, By E.

On September 9‚Äì10, 1876, the now First Lieutenant Sibley participated in the Battle of Slim Buttes, in Dakota Territory.  Later service  On September 1, 1877, at Fort Sanders, Wyoming, Sibley married Fannie Lane, the daughter of Colonel E. D. Lane. He then served as the Adjutant of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry from 1889 until 1893. In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Sibley commanded the Headquarters Guard of the IV Army Corps, under Major General John J. Coppinger. He again served as the Adjutant of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry from 1899 to 1900. In 1900, Sibley became the Inspector General of the Department of Texas, and remained in that position until the following year. In 1902 he was promoted to the Major of the 11th United States Cavalry Regiment. He was then made the Adjutant General of the Department of Luzon, in the Philippines from 1903 to 1904, and was in command of squadrons of the 2nd Cavalry and battalions of the 7th U. S. Infantry, which suppressed Landrones of Cavite and Bantangas Provinces, 1905, returning invalided to the United States. He was selected for detail to the General Staff, but declined the position in December, 1908.

Set in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the novel follows the exploits of Emilio Roccanera, Lord of Ventimiglia as he continues his attempts to avenge his brothers, slain by the Duke Van Guld, as narrated in the first book of the series, The Black Corsair. This novel focuses on the struggles between the Black Corsair's quest for vengeance and his guilt for having abandoned Honorata, his love interest and daughter of his enemy.  Plot summary  Four years have passed since the battle of Gibraltar. The Black Corsair has tracked Duke Van Guld down to Veracruz at last, and has formed an alliance with Nicholas van Hoorn, Michel de Grammont and Laurens de Graaf, three of the most formidable pirates in the Gulf, to finally bring his foe to justice. After Van Guld explodes his ship as a final resource, the Black Corsair and some of his men manage to escape and are lost in the jungles, at which point they're captured by the native Caribs. Fortunately for them, Honorata had shipwrecked on the coast before and was believed by the natives to be a sea deity and then followed as their queen. After they're freed by her, the Corsair decides to stop his piracy and return with Honorata to Italy. The Series The quest for vengeance stretches over the course of several novels: The Black Corsair (Il corsaro nero),The Queen of the Caribbean (La regina dei Caraibi), Yolanda, The Black Corsair's Daughter (Jolanda, la figlia del Corsaro Nero), and The Son of the Red Corsair (Il figlio del corsaro rosso).  Film versions  There have been several film versions of the novels. In the 1920s, director Vitale Di Stefano first brought the Corsair trilogy to the screen with a series of silent films. In 1937, Amleto Palermi directed the first remake of Il corsaro nero and Italian fencing champion Ciro Verratti was cast to play the Black Corsair. In 1944, Mexican director Chano Urueta filmed El corsario negro, the first Spanish language adaptation. In 1976, Kabir Bedi and Carole Andr√© were reunited to portray The Black Corsair and Honorata in another Sergio Sollima adaptation of a Salgari classic, The Black Corsair. Urueta's and Sollima's films are available on DVD. In 1999 Mondo TV (Italy) created a 26-episode animated TV series \\"The Black Corsair\\".  Trivia  In the late 19th century Emilio Salgari was Italy's foremost writer of adventure novels. He was knighted in 1897 in recognition for his work. The Black Corsair, the Chevalier Emilio, is named after himself. He also pays tribute to the House of Savoy, Italy's Royal family to show his gratitude. Yolanda, the Black Corsair's daughter is named after Princess Yolanda of Savoy. Salgari used Geschichte der Filibustier. The History of the Pirates, Free-Booters, or Buccaneers of America. by Johann Wilhelm von Archenholz as one of his main references. The attack on Vera Cruz is based on true events as are the biographies of the pirates that appear in the novel.

Retrieved 9 March 2015. He probably arrived in Sydney on board the James Pattison and spent the next few years gaining pastoral experience before heading to the Darling Downs with sheep in 1848. He found work in Cecil Plains, becoming Henry Stuart Russell's head stockman before becoming a partner 1856 and sole owner in 1859. Using the property as a fattening and disposal centre for western sheep, he began to prosper and by 1880 the 147,310 acre freehold property held almost 100,000 sheep and was supplemented by Dunmore, Goodar and Coomrith stations on the Western Downs and Mount Marlow on the Barcoo River. Political career Taylor was elected to the first Queensland Parliament in 1860, winning the seat of Western Downs. Appointed Secretary for Public Lands in 1869, he administered his office with little regard for the good of the public. He withheld large areas of Cecil Plains from selection until 1870 when he suddenly sold them to himself. These actions were one of the reasons for his resignation as Secretary in May 1870, and in September of that same year he resigned as member for Western Downs to stand for the seat of Drayton and Toowoomba but was unsuccessful. He was not long out of politics long before he was appointed a member of the Queensland Legislative Council in November 1871 where he proved to be one of the most vigorous and obstructive of the squatting rearguard. He resigned after almost 10 years service in January 1881 to once again stand for the seat of Drayton and Toowoomba but was once again unsuccessful. He was reappointed to the Queensland Legislative Council in July 1881 and served until his retirement due to ill health in August 1893. He also served on the Toowoomba Town Council, being Mayor of Toowoomba in 1890. Business life Taylor was a director of several companies including the Queensland Mercantile and Agency Co, the Land Bank of Queensland, and the Queensland Brewing Co. He was also a trustee for the Queensland Turf Club, the Toowoomba School of Arts, the Royal Agricultural Society, and the Queensland Club. Personal life In April 1850, Taylor married Sarah Boulton in Drayton and together they had nine children. Known as the King of Toowoomba he died at his home, Clifford House in Toowoomba in 1895 and was buried in Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery.Taylor James -- Toowoomba Regional Council Grave Location Search.

In the same year she made a brief appearance in The Search (Die Gezeichneten) by Carl Theodor Dreyer. After attending Reinhardt's acting school, Landshoff turned to stage acting. She made appearances in Berlin, Leipzig, and Vienna before giving up acting.

Standards Standards for condition and grading have been developed by TCA that are widely accepted by individuals, websites, and auction houses. These include condition codes for original trains, for train paper, for restored trains, and for reproduction trains. These condition standards, together with the rarity of the item, will help to determine the dollar value and the collectability of a particular train or accessory. Publications TCA issues three publications during the year, the Train Collector Quarterly (a magazine dedicated to tinplate and contemporary trains), the National Headquarters News (listing of the monthly Chapter and Division meets as well as other information), and the e*Train (an online magazine). Other organizations reference TCA and the York Meet in their publications and websites. Examples are Collectors Weekly, the Toy Train Paper and Memorabilia Group and Tandem Associates Education Divisions and Chapters of TCA host local train meets or train shows on a schedule throughout the United States where members may buy, sell, trade trains, or just enjoy the fellowship of collecting. Most shows are open to the public and may include educational segments, kids activities, and train doctors who can repair trains. The most prominent show, the York Train Meet, sponsored by the Eastern Division of TCA, is held over a three-day period twice a year in April and October in York, Pennsylvania. This show has 2000 tables of trains, large operating train layouts, and is open to TCA members and their guests.

It was the victim of vandalism in 2007, when thieves used a blowtorch to remove copper piping from the building. This caused major flooding in the mansion's basement, which went unnoticed for several days due to a non-functioning alarm system. In 2010, vandals once again targeted the house, smashing many of its windows.

At that time it was located on the west side of Sveiahaugen, about west of the present-day location. The church was surrounded by a cemetery. In 1688, that church was torn down and rebuilt by the builder Oluff Bysemb from Oster√∏y. The new church was located slightly to the west of the previous church, but still located inside the cemetery. The new church was partially constructed with salvaged materials from the previous building. After about 170 years, the church was too small for the congregation, so it was decided to tear down the old church and build a new one.

The chassis were very common for fire apparatus. Design The MC/MR was designed from the beginning to be available in right- hand drive as well as left-hand drive. This allowed Mack to market the truck in the United Kingdom without costly conversions, and also opened the trash truck market at home. The right-hand drive models also have the exhaust relocated to the left, while the turbocharger is mounted behind the engine so as to provide more space and less heat soak. Export models are coded MCE and MRE respectively. The low profile cab is of steel, while the doors are fibreglass. The engine intrudes considerably into the low cab. The cab tilts through a full 90 degrees, allowing for the radiator to be removed without first removing the cab.Sturgess, p. 23 The dashboard is lit from a single source through fibreoptics, this being a very early example of such an application.

History The Mohave came to be built by the George A. Johnson Company in response to a challenge to their monopoly of the Colorado River trade. Discontent by miners and merchants in upriver mines and settlements over high prices and shortages arose in late 1863. A lack of adequate shipping on the part of the company to carry the volume of cargo caused by the Colorado River mining boom had slowed delivery of goods upriver from the ships in the estuary of the Colorado. Additionally steamboat captains were profiteering on the resulting shortages brought on by this bottleneck in the supply chain. The consequence was the arrival of the sternwheeler Esmerelda for the Union Line, the first \\"Opposition Line\\", on the river. George Alonzo Johnson, who had neglected to deal with the building crisis, finally took action and had a third boat built by famed shipbuilder John G. North. North built it at his shipyard in San Francisco in sections and brought it down to the estuary, where it was assembled and launched in late May 1864. Scott, Erving M. and Others, Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part II, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 25, February 1895, The 193 ton Mohave was 135 feet long and 29 feet by the beam with a 4 foot deep hull. The power of its engines and cargo carrying capacity was illustrated by its May 27 - June 6, 1866 run upriver 365 miles to El Dorado Canyon from Yuma, under the command of Captain Issac Polhamus. She carried 225 tons of cargo in a record time of ten days and two hours despite being slowed for four days out of the ten, where the captain made only 41 miles against the strong current of the spring rise of the river. To do it Polhamus had to transfer the cargo off the two barges he was towing, on board his boat, and leave the barges behind. Daily Alta California, Volume 18, Number 5946, 21 June 1866, p.1 col.4 PACIFIC COAST CORRESPONDENCE. LETTER FROM ARIZONA Fate of the Mohave The Mohave continued to run the river, towing barges from 1865 until 1875, when the worn out boat was hauled out of the river at Port Isabel. She was dismantled there and her machinery was sent back to equip the Sacramento River stern-wheeler, Onward, a longer, heavier steamboat, being built in San Francisco in 1877 and which ran until 1909. The first Mohave was replaced in 1876 by the largest steamboat ever on the Colorado River, the double stacked, stern-wheeler Mohave II. Richard E.

Blowers, who was then employed as the technology director for the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library, created the project as a way to encourage librarians to learn and adapt to Web 2.0 and other new technologies.Maxymuk, John (2008) \\"23 Things and more\\", The Bottom Line, Vol. 21 Iss: 2, pp.64 - 66 The program was loosely based on an article by Stephen Abram, \\"43 Things I (or You) might want to do this year\\". History The original format of 23 Things required participants to take part in an eight-and-a-half-week course where they kept up with coursework via a series of weekly blog posts that described Web 2.0. During this time participants were given 23 assignments (23 things) and were encouraged to work with other learners. As the project was non-mandatory, participants took part in the coursework by posting their own blog entries for each week's coursework. The project was so successful that Blower held a 23 Things summit in 2009. Since its inception 23 Things has had over 500 iterations and the concept has broadened over time to include learning programs for other professionals and students, and has also expanded to include more than 23 topics. 23 Things has also expanded beyond the United States and is currently used in multiple countries including Australia and New Zealand.14 Currently, \\"23 Things\\" is the name for this Web immersion experience for participants primarily supported by the participants themselves, where they are actively involved in a network of peers and colleagues, using digital communication tools, and using a blog to post reflections as they learn. Research In 2012 San Jose State University assistant professor Michael Stephens performed a research study of 23 Things programs in Australia. He found that even if people did not successfully complete the program, that the program still had the potential to positively impact library staff as the participants would still be likely to use what they did learn and/or to return to the program at a later date. Stephens also noted that a strong majority of those who completed said they felt confident exploring and using new technologies: confidence and curiosity were identified as particularly notable outcomes.

The company was also known as Emile Marghab Inc. Since 1850, when Madeiran natives were introduced to hand embroidery as a means of industry, the islands had been renowned for their needlework. The Marghabs took advantage of this reputation, producing textiles that were skilfully hand-embroidered on the highest quality Irish linen and a form of organdy called Margandie, made in Switzerland, and harder wearing than usual organdy. The linens were designed by Vera, and hand-embroidered as a home industry by the women on Madeira, who Vera insisted received payment per stitch - which for a single place mat could amount to seventy thousand stitches. Marghab linens were retailed through leading American department stores such as Lord & Taylor, Marshall Field's, and Neiman Marcus. In 1945 Vera Marghab was awarded the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award. Emile died in 1947, and his wife took charge of the business until its disestablishment in 1980. She died in 1995. While linens have continued to be produced by Madeira since Marghab closed in 1980, as of 2015 the quality and workmanship in Marghab's output remains highly regarded. In 1970, the South Dakota Art Museum were gifted nearly eight hundred examples of Marghab linens, followed by many gifts from Vera and her trustees. The Marghab Gallery was dedicated in 1970. As of 2015, the Museum's holdings are described as the world's most complete collection of Marghab linens, with over three hundred patterns and almost 2800 objects. The Museum holds at least one example of almost every design produced, but deaccessioned and sold off all the duplicates at auction in 2005 in order to raise money for building work. At the time of the auction, it was noted that Marghab linens had previously sold for hundreds of dollars over their reserve prices, and that it was extremely difficult to find matched sets.

National Bal Shree Honour is constituted by National Bal Bhawan, an autonomous body of Ministry of Human Resource Development (India). The Honour includes a plaque, a certificate, educational resources and a cash prize.

Such children are an asset to the society and therefore, it was considered to honour them as Bal Shree.  History  Bal Shree Scheme was conceived in 1993.

An additional nomination is sent in case the nominee is a child of special needs or from tribal areas. = Zonal Level = In the zonal level, the country has been divided into different zones ‚Äì North, East, West, Central, and South. As there are large number of Bal Bhavans in the southern region, South Zone has further been divided into two zones ‚Äì South-I and South-II Zones. Every year different Zonal Centers are identified for organizing zonal selection camps. As there are certain states where there are no Bal Bhavans, representation of these states are ensured through the Chief Secretaries of these states. Children selected at the local levels participate in these 3-days zonal level camps where the second round of selections is made by local experts, specialists from the Zone and National Bal Bhavan. The local resource persons are thoroughly briefed by the National Bal Bhavan before the start of the camps. = National Level = This is the final level where the qualifying students from different States are provided a common platform to prove their creativity in their respective fields at the 4-days National Level Camp held at National Bal Bhavan. New Delhi. A panel of experts and resource persons drawn from the various streams is identified to administer the tests. In the National Level camp the psychological tests are also conducted by experts. These include verbal tests and tests on creativity. On the basis of these tests and other tools, the children are finally selected.  Criteria of Selection  While selecting children, the process and product are assessed on the basis of: * Originality * Innovative approach * Fluency * Flexibility * Divergent thinking * Elaboration of ideas * Creative process culminating into meaningful product * Effective functioning in the group * Analytical and critical approach  Tools used for selection of children  There are two types of tools used for selection of children * Activity related tools * Psychological tests = Activity Related Tools = For identifying the creative talents of children, an exhaustive list of activities is planned in four identified areas.

She was notable for authoring a book about her father, her contributions to increasing travel abroad via aviation, photographing her aviation adventures, and for being a socialite. Early life Margery Pitt Durant was born on May 24, 1887 in the city of Flint, Michigan. She was the daughter of William Crapo Durant and Clara Miller Pitt Durant. Growing up, Durant attended schools in Michigan, New York, and Washington D.C. My Father In 1929, Durant published My Father, the book about her father William Crapo Durant. He was still alive at age 65 when the book was released. In the opening of the book, she wrote of her first \\"horseless carriage\\" ride. Upon her return, her father, the future founder of General Motors said, \\"Margery, how could you - how could you be so foolish to risk your life in one of those things.\\" Margery wrote about her father with anecdotes from him, but a lot was written through her viewpoint. Aviation In the early thirties, Durant advocated for private aviation. Amelia Earhart gave her the name of a reputable pilot who assisted her in learning to fly. She later bought her own airplane, a Lockheed Vega. In 1931 Durant had her aircraft transported across the Atlantic aboard the ocean liner S.S. Hamburg so she could fly over different countries in Europe and Africa. While there, she took a number of photographs of her travels which are occasionally displayed today. Personal life Durant married a doctor and associate of her father, Edwin Rutheven Campbell (1868‚Äì1929), on April 18, 1906 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Flint, Michigan. She had William Durant Campbell in 1907 and Margery Edwina Campbell (later Mrs. Grant Sanger) in 1909 with him. They divorced in 1919.

Hani Motoko (ÁæΩ‰ªÅ „ÇÇ„Å®Â≠ê Hani Motoko, 1873 - 1957) is considered to be Japan's first female journalist. Born into a former samurai family, Hani was born Matsuoka Motoko in Aomori Prefecture and was baptized a Christian in 1890. She was educated at Tokyo First Higher Women's School and then at the Meiji Women's Christian School. After leaving school in 1892, she taught school in Hachinohe and in Morioka. Her marriage in 1895 did not work out and she moved to Tokyo, working as a maid for a female doctor. She joined Hochi Shinbun in 1897, working first as a copy editor and later becoming a reporter. In 1901, she married a co-worker, Hani Yoshikazu. Together, they founded a new magazine called Fujin no tomo (Women's friend) in 1908. An association of readers of that magazine was established in 1930 which still existed as of 1999. In 1921, the couple founded a private school for girls, Jiyu Gakuen. She wrote an autobiography in 1928 titled Speaking of Myself. Early life Family = Hani Motoko was born on September 8, 1873, in Aomori Prefecture, the year after Japan's modern public school system was established. \\"In its attempt to catch up with the West by modernizing the country, the Meiji government made education one of its top priorities. Public elementary education was made compulsory in 1872 for the first time in Japanese history. This stress one education was further expanded during the succeeding Taisho period (1912-1926), which made the education of women beyond elementary school more accessible as general response to the worldwide trend toward liberalism and internationalism in the post-World War I years.\\" She was born into a wealthy family. She was raised by her grandfather, Matsuoka Tadataka, who was a former samurai and her father. Hani considered the other women of her household, her grandmother and mother, to be na√Øve, because they were illiterate. Hani was close to her father (who was a lawyer), but her father became estranged after her parents divorced. Her father's estrangement bothered her very deeply. She attended elementary school in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture. She was part of a new generation of girls who were allowed to pursue an education beyond basic schooling. The Meiji government (1868‚Äì1912) idealized the earlier Confucian ideal of a male-centered society. Men were educated to become leaders of society and their own households. The government‚Äôs philosophy towards women was expressed with the slogan ‚Äúgood wife, wise mother‚Äù, which stressed women as caretakers and obedient wives. Women‚Äôs education focused on ‚Äúwomanliness‚Äù and preparation for marriage. = Early Schooling = Hani struggled to get along with her classmates and she failed to act appropriately under moral convictions. As a child, she ranked herself among the boys. In 1884, she won an award for academic excellence, presented by the Ministry of Education. Due to Hani's close relationship with her grandfather, he enabled her to attend Tokyo's First Higher Girls' School (K≈çt≈ç Jogakk≈ç). At the time, no colleges in Japan admitted women. = Higher Education = Christian Schools began to open their doors to women and Hani was able to attend the Meiji Girls' School (Meiji Jogakk≈ç).Christian Schools, unlike the Japanese school at the time, promoted modernity and the advancement of women's social status, preparing them for leadership roles in society. At the Meiji Girls' School (Meiji Jogakk≈ç), Iwamoto Yoshiharu, the school's president and editor of Jogaku Zasshi (a women's magazine), became her first mentor. In an interview, she convinced him to give her a job as a copy editor for the magazine. The magazine opened many doors for her, in terms of her journalism career. She withdrew from the Meiji Women's School in 1892.  Career  Teaching career = Before she became a journalist, Hani was a teacher. At the time, most who worked in wage labor at the time were employed as textile-mill operators or domestic servants.Only 5.9% of teachers in Japan were women. For a woman, teaching was the most prestigious and lucrative career available. = Journalism career = Hani's first major break was soon after she joined the Hochi Shimbun, a newspaper column entitled \\"Fujin no sugao\\" (Portraits of Famous Women), which featured profiles of famous married women in Japan. Hani took initiative on the story, despite not being assigned to it. She interviewed the wife of Viscount Tani Kanjo, Lady Tani, and her article was an instant success. After receiving positive responses from readers, Miki Zenpachi, president of the newspaper, promoted her to reporter. Hani became Japan's first female journalist in 1897 at the age of 24. Her reputation as a reporter grew quickly, because she covered often neglected social issues such as child care and orphanages. As a journalist in the 1920s, Hani operated as a mediator between two polarizing ideas: one being that women are equal to men in every way. The other belief being that women are inferior to men. She argued that women were equal to men in the domestic sphere. Hani popularized the virtues of the Western-style ‚Äúhouse wife.‚Äù She cooperated with bureaucrats in sponsoring daily life improvement exhibitions and she also gave lectures. Her work emphasized Christian ideals, independence, self-esteem, and personal freedom Hani was among several prominent female leaders‚Äîsuch as Ichikawa Fusae, Dr. Yoshioka, and Takeuchi Shigeyo‚Äîwho worked with the Meiji government to better the life of women in their country. Like many activists, Hani used the war with China in 1937 as an opportunity to elevate the position of Japanese women within the state. She used the Western world as a frame of reference. \\"Followers of Hani Motoko, led by her daughter Setsuko, also actively assisted the wartime government in urging women to economize and 'rationalize' their daily lives.\\" Personal life First Marriage = Hani married in 1892, but the marriage was short lived. According to her autobiography, she married in order to save the man she loved from a lifestyle she deemed vulgar; she married him to change him, but it didn't work. She kept her divorce a secret from her family; after the failure of her parents' marriage, her own divorce was the second most painful emotional crisis of her life: \\"I have always feared that this painful episode of my life, of which I am ashamed even today, might jeopardize the effectiveness of my public service. Not for a moment, however, do I regret my decision to liberate myself from the enslaving hold of emotion, for my life had been rendered meaningless by the selfish and profane love of another\\". = Second Marriage = In 1901, she married a co-worker, Hani Yoshikazu. Together, they founded a new magazine called Fujin no tomo (Women's friend) in 1908. An association of readers of that magazine was established in 1930 which still existed as of 1999. In 1921, the couple founded a private school for girls, Jiyu Gakuen. Death and afterward She died in 1957.

It was soft-launched in Canada on March 5, 2015, as Angry Birds Under Pigstruction, released for iOS and Android worldwide on July 30, 2015, and the name was changed to Angry Birds 2. Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay Like the original Angry Birds, players use a slingshot to launch birds at nearby structures; a key difference in Angry Birds 2 is the ability to select birds of the desired choice from a deck. This can give the player more freedom by allowing the creation of their own unique strategies. The main enemies of the game are green-colored pigs of varying sizes and abilities to defend, who can be defeated by hitting them with birds or objects. Individual birds and spells are represented on cards. Tapping on a card will select it, placing its contents on the slingshot for launching. Players increase their score by destroying objects and pigs and leveled up birds multiply the score. Upgrading the slingshot also multiplies your score. Birds can be leveled up by gaining feathers of the respective birds and the slingshot can be leveled up by completing a hat set (hats are purchased by black pearls). The \\"Destruct-o-meter\\" fills up during play and if it gets full, a random card will be given to the player. Only three cards can be displayed at a time; the rest appear in the deck. The player begins with five lives (or more by purchasing) and loses one if all cards have been used and at least one pig remains undefeated; once all five lives have been lost, the player must use gems, watch an advertisement or wait (30 minutes for each of the five lives) until the lives are refilled. Levels include multiple waves of pigs, which progress through separate structures. Bosses will appear on some levels and require the complete depletion of the boss's health bar in order to defeat it. Spells are disabled for boss levels. Gifts are randomly located in the levels, or it may also be an apple or a treasure chest. The player can only acquire it if they successfully completed the level. Occasionally, Golden Pigs may appear in some levels, which fills the \\"Destruct-o-meter\\" fully when they are popped. They are not required to go to the next stage though but are helpful to get one extra card irrespective of destruction caused. The game may be connected to Facebook to backup scores and play in the arena. Gems, lives, avatars and many miscellaneous items can be earned from in-app purchases while only gems can be collected by completing daily quests. Also in the game, players can care for a Hatchling by getting an egg and naming it and have to wait or can pay some gems to speed it up, and collecting or buying apples to feed it which can also level it up and increase all birds' multipliers, but it needs to be fed regularly to let it stay. The Arena is unlocked after reaching level 5. The concept of the Arena is similar to Angry Birds Friends. The players in the world were randomly divided into a batch of 15 and feathers were awarded to a particular bird according to the high score of each player in an endless level of same arena event which changed every day. After the Mount Evernest update, with the same division of players, the arena became a six-day-long tournament where the rewards were gems instead of feathers. The endless levels of arena events are now randomly given and not fixed for a particular day and multiple events can be played in a day. Instead of player playing alone for a high score, now the player competes with a randomly chosen opponent and one with a better score is awarded stars according to the margin of victory. Stars decide the ranks of the players. The top three move up a league and bottom three go down one league. Players also get medals if they finish in the top three in Arena. This is the only traditional slingshot Angry Birds game with procedurally generated levels, which might be the reason the game has 2300 levels in its campaign mode as of September 2019. Plot After the events of Angry Birds, Chef Pig steals the eggs and puts them in an airship, leaving Red to gather the rest of the flock pursuing him and the rest of the pigs. After Chef Pig is defeated, the Foreman Pig takes over followed by the King Pig's defeat in order to prevent the birds from recovering the eggs. In other media Silver, a bird who first appeared in the game, went on to appear in the animated film The Angry Birds Movie 2, voiced by Rachel Bloom. In that film, she is Chuck's sister, a skilled engineer and a potential love interest for Red. Promotions Rovio uses new spells for promotional use which are similar to the 'Golden Duck' spell. These spells can be used until the completion of only one level and no other spell can be used on that particular level. These spells are available for a limited time and change with ongoing events. The ongoing festivities are also promoted by specially designed levels which gives a premium treasure box in return if the players win it. Only one attempt is given for this level. This started on February 14, 2016 which promoted Valentine's Day through a specially designed level. These levels were only available for a limited time. The Gravity Grove update promoted The Angry Birds Movie by using the character appearances from the movie in the levels. Reception The game has received mixed reviews. Pocket Gamer gave the game a 7/10, feeling that the gameplay was a step forward in puzzle design and the graphics were gorgeous; however, it did not like the energy system that, after failing to complete a few levels, either makes the player stop playing or use gems to continue playing; overall the website thought the game was Rovio at its best. IGN awarded it a score of 6.7 out of 10, saying \\"Ever-shifting levels and limited lives take a lot of the fun out of smashing pigs with birds in Angry Birds 2.\\" Three days after its release, Angry Birds 2 was downloaded over 10 million times; it is a free game on all platforms. One week after its release, Angry Birds 2 was downloaded over 20 million times. On August 6, 2015, the game was the number one downloaded iOS game in 100 countries and the most downloaded game on Android.

At the 1955 Brier, the team went undefeated, winning all 10 games to capture their only national championship, and the first Brier championship for Saskatchewan. The team returned to the Brier two years later by winning the 1957 provincial championship. At the 1957 Brier, the four-some finished in second place, behind Alberta's Matt Baldwin, finishing with an 8-2 record.

Endorsements are part of the \\"invisible primary\\" process, which occurs not only long before the general election in November 2016, but also largely occurs before even the caucuses and primaries have begun in February 2016. Early endorsements were correlated with the success candidates achieved in caucuses and primaries, for elections from 1980 through 2004. (See the UCLA School of Political Parties.) Historically, there has been a correlation (\\"76% of the eventual vote percentage\\") between the percentage of political endorsements from sitting and former elected officials earned by a Republican candidate in the first half of the year prior to a presidential election (for the purposes of this article, January‚ÄìJune, 2015), with the percentage of votes cast for that candidate in Republican primaries during the first half of the election year (i.e., January‚ÄìJune, 2016). The value of political endorsements varies, depending on whom they are from, when they are given, and other factors. Endorsements from politicians who live in states with early primaries are highly sought after. So are endorsements from governors, federal senators, and federal representatives. Endorsements from people from the candidate's home state are less valuable, unless multiple candidates from that state are running. The impact of celebrity endorsements of political candidates is less clear, but can increase general election turnout, or increase fundraising totals and media exposure.

The stated goal of the cooperative is the provision of environmentally friendly energy to the electrical grid. As a founding member of the association, Greenpeace e.V. holds only five shares at ‚Ç¨55 in the cooperative, otherwise the environmental group and the company are financially and legally independent. The name use is linked contract with the condition that Greenpeace Energy fulfils the conditions laid down by the Greenpeace e.V. quality criteria for \\"clean energy\\". Formation In 1998, Greenpeace started a renewable energy initiative called \\"power shift\\". There, consumers could choose to switch to a green electricity provider. As more and more consumers agreed to switch to an environmentally friendly provider, Greenpeace found no electricity provider that met all the criteria for environmental sustainability, and supply the increasing demand for sustainable energy. As a solution, Greenpeace Energy was founded in 1999, as an electricity provider that produces a large part of its electricity from renewable sources. The areas of network management and energy billing are not adopted by Greenpeace Energy itself but by its affiliate company, Stadtwerke Schw√§bisch Hall, as a service provider. The Cooperative Greenpeace Energy chose to establish itself in the legal form of a registered cooperative (eG). The motivation for this decision was that it allows Greenpeace Energy to be independent of banks and major shareholders and build equity on a wide base of shareholders to offer as well as favorable current. Therefore, at present no returns will be distributed to the shareholders (as of 2011). Membership in the cooperative is formally dependent on the current reference - according to the statute, can be excluded a cooperative member who \\"does not cover its demand for electrical energy supplies through the Cooperative\\". This right part of the cooperative is expressly not perceived, what results are based on the fact that some members of the cooperative power of Greenpeace Energy can not relate. A cooperative member has at least one, and can hold a maximum of one hundred shares of ‚Ç¨55. As usual with cooperatives, each member has regardless of the number of shares only one vote at the General Meeting. In this way, a takeover, or any interference is excluded by large investors. By his own admission, the cooperative explicitly does not pursue the goal of maximizing profits. From the border of 1,500 members occurs a representative assembly in place of the General Assembly. Fifty elected representatives of the members then represent the rights of the members. Since Greenpeace Energy has significantly more members every four years, representatives are elected (the last election was 2009). The selection of representatives is made by a selection committee. The tasks of Representatives correspond according to cooperative law duties of the General Assembly: members can vote on motions, select the Supervisory Board and the Management Board or released and vote on their workload, and decide on the distribution of any surplus. Greenpeace criteria for clean energy Greenpeace Energy works on the basis of the \\"Greenpeace criteria for clean energy.\\" The determination of these criteria was carried out by the Greenpeace e. V., an adaptation to the market conditions was last held in January 2008. =Mix-criteria= *Waiver of electricity from nuclear power and coal *Carbon dioxide emissions must not exceed 135 g / kWh *At least 50% renewable energy sources (wind power, biomass, hydro, photovoltaic and geothermal) *A maximum of 50% of cogeneration plants (natural gas with overall efficiency of at least 80%) At present (2013) only power is obtained from renewable sources (see Greenpeace Energy # mix). =Consumption adjusted supply= The current is injected at any time in accordance with consumption. This ensures that the supply from Greenpeace Energy matches the customer demand at any time, without electricity from nuclear or coal power plants (excluding distribution losses). For the simultaneous supply, a reserve amount of electricity must always be maintained in order to compensate for the loss of some distribution. (For details, see the section #Zeitgleiche feed) =Construction of new plants= Each year, the drawn current amount of connected clients since last year is determined. This amount must be supplied no later than the fifth subsequent year of new investments into the German power grid, which are not older than five years or for which construction has initiated the power company. This more current is produced in an environmentally friendly way, which one of the main points is that makes the transition to a real green electricity provider sensible of also applying this criterion. =Subsidization of photovoltaics= Until the last adaptation of the \\"Greenpeace criteria for clean electricity\\" from 1 January 2008 saw them before that Greenpeace Energy refer within five years at least 1% of the electricity sold from photovoltaic systems or from newly built photovoltaic plants had to feed into the grid, which also here the subsidized rates were allowed to be taken, according to the Renewable Energy Sources Act. Due to the development of photovoltaic industry, it was decided in the light of the highly successful Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) that an additional promotion of photovoltaics is required by a purchase of solar power is no longer deleted and the corresponding criterion. =Sustainability= The overall concept of the energy supplier shall be so designed that even large amounts of demand can be operated over the long term. =Transparency and consumer protection= Important points of the criteria are to be monitored by independent experts. These include: *Review of the current origin and compliance with the criteria for the electricity mix *Simultaneous current feed *Compliance with the maximum emission values *Compliance with the new obligation References Category:Renewable energy companies of Germany Category:Greenpeace ","title":"Greenpeace Energy"},{"id":"45623594","text":"Weekend Nachos were an American powerviolence band from DeKalb, Illinois.

Injury and death of Hsu Tsu-tsai 2014 photograph of Prinse Mauritslaan, the street on which Hsu Tsu-tsai was found injured. The house in which Hsu was staying is at the far right ‚Äì number 17 on the corner with Van Hoornbeekstraat. Hsu was in the Netherlands with eight colleagues to attend the International Welders Conference in Delft. On 16 July 1966, Hsu was seen by a witness lying critically injured on the doorstep outside number 17, Prinse Mauritslaan, the rented house of the third secretary of the Chinese legation, where the engineers were staying. The witness, businessman S. P. van der Veer, parked his car to offer assistance, but found that Hsu had been moved inside the house. When there was no response to his door knocks, Van der Veer went next door to number 19, where a neighbour let him in to call the police. The police arrived to find Hsu screaming in the lobby of the house, and despite the objections of the Chinese officials present, they took him to the Red Cross Hospital, where doctors began treatment for spinal and internal injuries. Whilst in the hospital's X-ray department, three Chinese men entered the room, placed Hsu on a stretcher and carried him to a car bearing diplomatic plates. The car drove to the Chinese legation at Adriaan Goekooplaan 7, The Hague, located in the mansion of the charge d'affaires Li En-chiu, where Hsu later died on the Sunday afternoon. Hsu's body was seized by Dutch police for post-mortem examination, when they intercepted a hearse carrying the body from the legation to a crematorium. Diplomatic response Dutch police sought to question Hsu's eight colleagues regarding his death, however the Chinese legation refused to allow this. On 19 July, the Dutch government ordered the expulsion of the Chinese charge d'affaires, Li En-chiu. China responded by declaring Gerrit Jan Jongejans, the Dutch envoy in Peking, persona non grata, although he was prevented from leaving the country until the eight engineers were released. In December, it was announced that a 10-foot (3 metre) fence would be constructed around the grounds of the legation to prevent the engineers from leaving covertly. On 30 December, five-and-a-half months after the incident, the Chinese relented to police questioning the engineers, on the condition that they be immediately allowed to return to China. The Dutch prosecutors decided that Hsu's colleagues were not complicit in his death, and they were permitted to leave the Netherlands. The Chinese officials who had abducted Hsu from the hospital could not be prosecuted due to diplomatic immunity. Accounts of the incident There are several contradictory accounts of Hsu's death and the events leading up to it, however each account contains some element of espionage and defection. The Chinese government accused the Dutch government of responsibility for Hsu's death. The Chinese foreign affairs department released a statement saying that Hsu had jumped from the building in an attempt to escape from agents of the United States Central Intelligence Agency who were trying to convince him to defect with the support of Dutch intelligence. On 10 September 1966, a correspondent for The Observer newspaper‚Äîciting Dutch official sources‚Äîstated that it was believed Hsu had been run over by a car after a formula for liquid rocket fuel was found on him, and that he had been left lying outside the legation to suggest he had tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window. The Observer also said it was almost certain that Hsu had given a sample of rocket fuel to American intelligence agents, and was seeking to defect to the West. The Dutch public broadcaster, NPO, reported that the Domestic Security Service (Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst ‚Äì BVD) had also conducted an investigation, which outlined the agency's suspicions that Hsu was a potential defector who had been approached by the CIA. In 1974, the historian Donald McCormick (writing as Richard Deacon) devoted a chapter of his book, A History of the Chinese Secret Service, to the Hsu incident in which he suggests that the CIA had offered Hsu \\"a million dollars\\" to defect to the U.S. Embassy with a parcel containing a sample of \\"poison gas\\". A declassified review of McCormick's book by Stanley Bergman for the CIA newsletter called the author's account an \\"imaginative concoction\\" and \\"fiction fantasy\\". Bergman cites Liao Ho-shu (second secretary at the Chinese legation who later defected to the United States), who stated that Hsu had intended to defect and fell when he attempted to climb from the window using bedsheets tied together. Bergman also denies that the CIA had approached Hsu to defect, and that CIA-affiliated scientists who had spoken with Hsu at the conference had reported no indications that he intended to seek asylum. The Dutch espionage documentary series James Bond in Den Haag () covered the \\"Chinese Affair\\" in episode 4 of the series on 20 February 2013.

History Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn was made chairman of the committee to erect a memorial to his cousin Prince George, Duke of Cambridge. Architect John Belcher and sculptor Adrian Jones collaborated on the project. Belcher led on the original proposal in 1905, in which he requested that Westminster City Council should allow the construction of the statue outside Horse Guards on Whitehall. In July 1906, while the statue was being sculpted at Jones' studio on Church Street, Chelsea, he was visited on one occasion by Queen Alexandra, accompanied by her daughter Princess Victoria, Crown Princess Sophia of Greece, Duchess of Sparta, and Prince George of Greece and Denmark. By the following October, the committee changed its mind on the location of the statue. The new War Office building had opened in August, and they requested an amendment to the permission granted by Westminster City Council for a change of building location to place it outside that building instead. Once again, this request was approved. The construction of the plinth was contracted out to a building company, Pethick Brothers, and it was completed on 18 May 1907. Forty-five tonnes of granite was used, and the combined height of the plinth and statue was expected to be some . The statue was added shortly afterwards during the night, and then obscured until the unveiling. It was unveiled on 15 June 1907 by King Edward VII, who had been escorted from Buckingham Palace by a detachment of 2nd Life Guards. He was accompanied on the journey and at the ceremony by Queen Alexandria, Princess Victoria, Edward, Prince of Wales, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. The statue in 2004 Other attendees at the ceremony included several members of the of the German Army, of which the Duke had been an honorary colonel. The group was led by Field Marshall Wilhelm von Hahnke. A variety of British military personal were also present, including Major-General Wykeham Leigh Pemberton. During the ceremony, the King declared, \\"The statue I am about to unveil is committed to the care of the City of Westminster.\\" This was unexpected, as the statue was actually owned by the Office of Works. Some two weeks passed before the two offices came to agreement that it would be handed back from the City of Westminster to the Office of Works. In November 2012, a nude man mounted the statue for more than an hour until he was persuaded to come down and was taken into police custody. Design Jones sculpted the Duke of Cambridge on horseback, while wearing the full-uniform of a Field Marshal. It included his medals, such as four orders of knighthood and his campaign medals. The sculpture holds in its hand a baton, this was intended to represent the one which was presented to the Duke's father by King William IV, and in the other hand it holds the reins of the horse. On the sides of the plinth there are two bas-relief panels showing the Duke's connection with the Grenadier Guards and the 17th Lancers.

This site is believed to have been continuously associated with banking since 1832, longer than any other site in Illinois.  History of Ayers Bank Building Banking operations at the building site began with David Ayers who operated a merchant bank out of his drug store in the 1830s, and the Ayers family continued banking at this site throughout the 19th century. In 1910, when Millard Fillmore Dunlap and Andrew Russel bought a controlling interest in the business, Ayers Bank was one of the state's leading financial institutions. Dunlap and Russel hired architect Jarvis Hunt of Chicago to build the Ayers Bank Building on the same site where David Ayers had begun his banking business. The bank continued to prosper until the 1930s, when Dunlap and Russel were convicted of illegal banking practices and went to prison. Depositors received 33 cents on the dollar and the federal government closed the bank in November 1932. The Farmers State Bank & Trust Company bought the building for $53,000 at a foreclosure sale in 1939. The upper floors were rented to a series of dentists, physicians, and other professionals until 1985, when Farmers renovated the entire building for its exclusive use. As of 2017, the bank still has its headquarters at this site. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 1986.  Building architecture The Ayers Bank Building is the tallest building in downtown Jacksonville; it is tall and has eight stories. The building was the first steel-frame and reinforced concrete structure in Jacksonville. The building is in the Renaissance Revival style with a brick and cut stone exterior and a terra cotta egg-and-dart cornice.

Kidner (1866‚Äì1932) was one of the founders of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy (NSPOT) later renamed the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA). He served as president of the society from 1923 to 1928. Life Kidner was born in 1866 in Bristol, England. He migrated to Canada in 1900 as one of three teachers selected by the Macdonald Manual Training Fund of Canada to introduce technical education to elementary school children. While in Canada he had many roles in education and passionately incorporated manual training into his programs including the programs to rehabilitate soldiers returning from World War I in Canada he ran from 1916 until coming to the United States. These programs gained the attention of Eleanor Clark Slagle, Elizabeth Upham-Davis, and members of the US Federal Board for Vocational Education. These programs were a product of Kidner's time as the vocational secretary of the Military Hospitals Commission. After being named vocational secretary he promptly moved to Ottawa in January 1916. In Ottawa, he was given the duty of preparing soldiers returning from World War I to return to their former vocational duties or retrain soldiers no longer able to perform their previous duties. He developed a program that engaged soldiers recovering from wartime injuries or tuberculosis in occupations even while they were still bedridden. Once the soldiers were sufficiently recovered they would work in a curative workshop and eventually progress to an industrial workshop before being placed in an appropriate work setting. He used occupations (daily activities) as a medium for manual training and helping injured individuals to return to productive duties such as work. While involved with NSPOT, he used his background as an architect to help build the foundation for occupational therapy including pushing for a national registry and training standards to ensure that occupational therapists were properly trained to treat clients. He also pushed for occupational therapy to stay within the medical field. Kidner's association with the medical professional association in the United States to head towards this goal and even helped push for the occupational therapy insignia to include components of the medical insignia. He is credited with bringing crafts, in general, as the intervention for treatment in occupational therapy beginning at the Military Hospitals Commission in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Within AOTA, his main concern was to establish the structure and function of the association. He began a registry of therapists and instituted standards in education and desired all therapists to promote OT and keep the profession in the public eye. After leaving NSPOT/AOTA, Kidner worked with the National Tuberculosis Association, as the head of the Advisory Service on Institutional Construction until 1926. He then returned to his original occupation, working as an architect from 1926 until his sudden death in 1932. Little is known about the circumstances of his death.

In 2015 a long- range cruise missile was revealed under the name ‚ÄúSoumar‚Äù. The design closely resembles the Kh-55 that Iran acquired from Ukraine in 2001.

Here they were introduced to natural history studied by the Principal, Peter Churton. In 1869 their father died and with three children, his mother needed assistance and Henry went to London to work in the office of a stockbroker and family friend. In the early 1870s, a chance meeting with the family of John Edward Sowerby led to a deeper interest in English botany and the works of the late botanist. In 1874 the brothers Henry and James joined the South London Microscopical and Natural History Club where they met many botanists including T. B. Blow. They made a botanical excursion to Thames Ditton with Hewett Cottrell Watson and Blow apart from visit to the botanical section of the British Museum. From 1877, the two brothers took a keen interest in British Characeae. They also took an interest in molluscs. Henry left the stockbroker office after the death of the owner in 1879.

Early baseball career Akira began pitching in third grade, then went on to become the ace of Kuwanoyama Junior High where he led his school in winning the prefectural championship. In his sophomore high school year, he pitched 2 consecutive complete games, and brought his team to the quarterfinals of Spring Koshien. The next year, his school made it to Summer Koshien, but got eliminated in the 1st round (2-1), despite him finishing the game with 99 pitches without relief nor walks issued. In October 2010, he submitted his application for the 2010 professional baseball draft, with the condition that he will only turn pro should he receive 4th nomination or higher. Otherwise, he would join the industrial leagues. Hanshin Tigers The Tigers selected him as their 4th pick on October 28, and he signed a contract for an annual salary of 6 million yen, plus a 40 million yen signing bonus. 2011 He spent his first year playing in Western League games (minors), where he pitched 6 games, recorded 1 save and an ERA of 2.84. 2012 He continued pitching in ni- gun games, and recorded his 1st shutout game against Orix in August. His success in ni-gun paid off, and he finally made it to the active roster on September 8. The following day, he debuted as a starter against the Dragons in Nagoya Dome, where he pitched 6 shutout innings (2 hits) and recorded his first pro victory. With this, he became the 13th Hanshin pitcher to record a win on his first outing, and just the 4th pitcher out of high school to do so, the last one being Osamu Nishimura in 1951. He was temporarily demoted to ni- gun to make way for additional players in the active roster, but on his 2nd outing against the Swallows, he again recorded another win, making him the 3rd pitcher in franchise history to do so since Yukio Nishimura in 1937. On October 5, he would have been the first ever Hanshin pitcher to win all of his first 3 career starts, but due to a fielding error by Ryota Arai that resulted to a run and the lack of run support from the lineup, he earned his first career loss despite surrendering only 3 hits and no runs in 6 innings of work. He finished the season with a 2‚Äì1 record and a 0.00 ERA. 2013 He again spent the first half of the season playing in ni-gun. His first appearance came on August 1 against the Dragons, where he pitted against 48-year-old veteran Masahiro Yamamoto in what was called the battle of pitchers with the widest age gap in NPB history (27 years, 2 months). But despite the advantage of youth, Iwamoto suffered the loss when he gave up 2 runs in 4 innings, and was consequently taken off the roster the following day. He remained in the second squad for the rest of the season, and out of 18 starts, he finished with a dismal 3‚Äì7 win-loss record, and overall ERA of 3.95. 2014 He joined the ichi- gun spring training camp in Okinawa. Pitching Coach Nakanishi saw his potential as a long reliever and was appointed as such during the pre-season exhibition games. He appeared on April 1 as a closer against the Dragons, and gave up 1 run in an inning. He appeared for 3 more games until May 29 as a closer, but never saw any more playing time in ichi-gun afterwards.  Fukui Miracle Elephants  Orix Buffaloes  On July 7, 2018, Iwamoto signed a contract with the Orix Buffaloes. Playing Style Listed at 182 centimeters, Iwamoto is a right-handed pitcher who throws mostly fastballs, the occasional slider, and forkballs as changeup. He tries to emulate Tsunemi Tsuda, a former Hiroshima Carp pitcher and reliever who went to the same high school as he did. He has been called \\"Tsuda the 2nd\\" because his 150 km/h fastball is reminiscent of the late pitcher.

Garcia finds it to be fulfilling to watch families make changes and gain their own inspiration through her programs. Garcia's main inspiration as a chef is to bring loved ones together to enjoy wonderful food, just how it would bring her own family together. CareerEarly culinary jobs= After receiving her degree in culinary arts from Johnson and Wales University, Garcia began her career as a chef through an apprenticeship at the Ritz-Carlton in Paris, France. After working at the Ritz-Carlton, Garcia went on a tour through several cities known for their culinary cuisine and landed culinary jobs in several countries, including Italy, Japan, Korea, Thailand and China. Through these jobs Garcia was able to get an exposure to world cuisine and was able to work with world-renowned chefs such as Pascal Audin. =Restaurants=Previous restaurants In 2002, Garcia opened Food Caf√© in Miami's Design District. Later that year, she established Elements Tierra in the Design District as well. The cuisine of the two restaurants was influenced by both Latin and Asian cooking styles. In 2008, Garcia sold both restaurants. Current restaurants In February 2011, Garcia accepted a job as an executive chef at the Miami International Airport. She recognized the need to provide comfort food to stressed-out travelers. To fill this need, Garcia opened up her own restaurant in the American Airlines terminal of the airport. Her restaurant, Lorena Garcia Cocina, seeks to provide diners with a healthy twist on traditional Latin Cuisine. Lorena Garcia Cocina provides travelers with dishes such as Shrimp Ceviche, Baked Empanadas, and Caribbean Jerk Chicken, in order to satisfy their cravings for nutritious and gourmet food while traveling. In August 2012, Garcia opened her second travelers' restaurant, Lorena Garcia Tapas, in the Atlanta International Airport, Delta International. Garcia has opened a third restaurant in the Dallas/ Ft. Worth Airport as of September 2016. In May 2017, Chef Lorena paired with John Kunkel of 50 Eggs (Yardbird, Swine, etc.) to open an upscale Latin American restaurant named CHICA inside the luxurious Venetian on the Las Vegas Strip. Garcia is the first female-Latin chef to be featured on the strip =Obesity campaigns=Big Chef, Little Chef One thing Garcia was introduced to growing up was obesity. Living near Hispanic homes, Garcia saw it become a problem and wanted to do something about it. Garcia created \\"Big Chef, Little Chef\\", in an effort to help end the problem of childhood obesity. \\"Big Chef, Little Chef\\" is a non-profit organization that aims to encourage healthy eating starting at a young age. The foods Garcia develops for \\"Big Chef, Little Chef\\" are Hispanic foods. Taco Bell's Cantina Bell Menu Garcia continued her fight against obesity by working with Taco Bell. The partnership began in 2010 and progressed into major changes for Taco Bell. Garcia came to Taco Bell with hopes of creating variety within the menu. To do this, Garcia helped rework the existing menu and add 8 new ingredients to various dishes. Starting on July 5, 2012, Taco Bell implemented the new Cantina Bell menu which was largely credited to Lorena Garcia. Other campaigns Garcia also developed food for public schools through the organization \\"Alliance for a Healthier Generation\\" in 2011. As of spring 2014, Garcia was added as a partner with Charlotte Motor Speedway and promoted by NASCAR driver Danica Patrick in the \\"10 Blockbuster Days of Racing\\" in Charlotte, North Carolina. TelevisionSpanish television cooking shows= Due to her Latin upbringing and culinary skills, Garcia has been featured on numerous Spanish networks, including Telemundo, Gems, and Mundo TV, She hosted the cooking shows \\"Vida Gourmet\\", \\"Cocine Mundos\\", \\"De Ma√±anita\\", and \\"El Arte del Buen Gusto\\", and on the FoxLife series \\"Saz√≥n con Lorena Garcia\\", \\"Lorena en su Salsa\\", and \\"El mejor de los peores.\\" Garcia competed on Top Chef Masters, a reality competition on the network Bravo, challenging the world's leading chefs to compete against one another. Garcia ranked third among the twelve competitors on season four of the show. Garcia was also a judge on both \\"Cocineros al limite\\" and \\"Top Chef: Estrellas\\". While on \\"Top Chef: Estrellas\\", Garcia served alongside fellow chefs Jaime Mart√≠n Del Campo and Ramiro Arvizu. =Top Chef Masters= Lorena Garcia participated in the fourth season show Top Chef Masters, and she chose to compete for the organization Alliance for a Healthier Generation. Garcia made it through nine episodes, winning two quickfire competitions and two elimination challenges. Throughout the whole process Lorena was berated by other opponents for her lack of classical training. Garcia's last episode called \\"Old School, New School\\", consisted of instructing a culinary student without getting involved in the preparation, and Lorena Garcia's dish lost to Kerry Heffernan's. =NBC's America's Next Great Restaurant= Lorena Garcia participated as one of the investors and judges on NBC's \\"America's Next Great Restaurant\\". The show was also judged by chefs Curtis Stone, Bobby Flay, and Chipotle Mexican Grill founder Steve Ells. Even though the show comes from the producers of Top Chef Masters, it is not the conventional cooking show. In fact, it is a reality show where contestants are competing for investors and do not solely compete in direct cooking competitions. On May 13, 2011, NBC cancelled the show after the first season because of low ratings. =Other television appearances= Garcia's other television appearances included The Kovak Box and El C.I.D. These two screenings are the only two appearances that she did not play herself, but she did appear as herself in many other roles. Her success with food has led her to fame, as she appeared on many talk shows. She was on The Queen Latifah Show, The Talk, Guy's Grocery Games, The Chew, The Wendy Williams Show, and The Biggest Loser. She also played a semi-fictionalized version of herself in several episodes of the Nickelodeon show Talia in the Kitchen. ProductsBooks= Lorena Garcia has many recipes, and she compiled many of those into a cookbook. That book is entitled \\"Lorena Garcia's New Latin Classics\\". The hard cover book is 256 pages long of recipes of Latin cuisines, usually featuring ingredients such as beans, rice, and salsa. She is also the author of \\"Lorena Garcia's New Taco Classics\\" (2015). =Kitchenware= On November 14, 2013, Lorena, along with Ingenious Design's president, Joy Mangano, released their line of new kitchenware, the Lorena Bella Kitchen Collection. Some items included on the Lorena Bella Kitchen Collection for HSN include cookware with Technolon +, Corningware oven to tabletop serveware, and a plethora of smart accessories. On October 14, 2016, Lorena launched her first international reality show called Food Hunters, in where each team of eight (8) or six (6) kids cook-off from all about countries of Latin America compete to be called the best of the best of the competition in the farm and in the kitchen, in which she is the first new host and judge.

B. Priestley 1945 play of the same name. It is directed by Aisling Walsh, produced by Howard Ella and stars David Thewlis as the titular character. The story is centred on a mysterious inspector, who investigates the socially ambitious Birling family and a dinner guest following the suicide of a young woman. The film was first broadcast on 13 September 2015 on BBC One. Plot The film is set in 1912, and follows the events of a single evening on which the wealthy Birling family is holding a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of their daughter, Sheila. The festivities are then interrupted by a visit from what is taken to be a policeman, Inspector Goole, who is investigating the recent suicide of a local young woman. Goole‚Äôs interrogations of each member of the dinner party make it clear that all of them have contributed to the tragedy through individually unjust, selfish or exploitative behavior. The \\"Inspector\\" leaves the subdued group with a warning that human beings have shared responsibility for each other and that this lesson will soon be taught \\"in fire and blood and anguish\\"‚Äîan apparent reference to the outbreak of World War I two years later. Final scenes establish that Goole is not a real policeman, and suggest that he is some form of supernatural messenger. Cast * David Thewlis as Inspector Goole * Sophie Rundle as Eva Smith/Daisy Renton/Mrs Birling/Alice Grey * Chloe Pirrie as Sheila Birling * Finn Cole as Eric Birling * Miranda Richardson as Sybil Birling * Ken Stott as Arthur Birling * Kyle Soller as Gerald Croft * Lucy Chappell as Edna * Flora Nicholson as Miss Francis * Gary Davis as Alderman Meggarty * Wanda Opalinska as Charity Lady Production In February 2015, filming began in Saltaire, West Yorkshire. Although the exterior shots of the mill were filmed at Saltaire, the interior shots of the mill were filmed at Queen Street Mill on the outskirts of Burnley, Lancashire . A full sized office was built in the middle of the Weaving Shed for this production and was dismantled once filming was completed. A large number of scenes were also filmed at Scampston Hall, near Malton, and in the market town of Malton. Like the 1954 version, this adaptation employs flashbacks to the events described (allowing some dialogue to be eliminated), as well as additional scenes showing more of the life and death of Eva, and the Inspector after he leaves the Birlings' home. The majority of the action in this play takes place within the Birlings' home. For the 2015 production, the interior is that of the Dining Room at Scampston Hall. Critical reception The programme was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Reviewing for the Daily Mail, Deborah Ross gave the programme four stars, writing that it \\"stands up, and even felt timely\\". For The Daily Telegraph, Anita Singh was generally positive, writing that the programme was \\"as good an adaptation as it could be\\" and praising Helen Edmundson for her \\"decent job of expanding the drama\\". The Guardian‚Äôs Sam Wollaston was positive in his review, writing that Priestley‚Äôs \\"play might be set over a hundred years ago, in 1912, but the messages and sentiments ‚Äì about social responsibility and a shared humanity ‚Äì remain important and relevant... An Inspector Calls, sensitively adapted here by Helen Edmundson, time-travels remarkably well: it translates into gripping 21st-century television\\".

A native of Brampton, Ontario, Teat's long lacrosse career began when he was five years old in the Brampton Minor Lacrosse Association. He made his debut with the Brampton Jr. Excelsiors of the Ontario Junior A Lacrosse League in 1988, winning the league's rookie of the year award. Teat began playing for the Major Excelsiors of Major Series Lacrosse in 1993, once again winning his league's rookie of the year award. His association with the Excelsiors would last over two decades, and he was a forward on squads that won Mann Cup championships in 1993, 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2009. Teat's 211-game MILL/NLL career began in 1997 with the Rochester Knighthawks, with whom he won the Champion's Cup in his rookie year. He was left unprotected in the 2001 Expansion Draft, and was picked up by the Columbus Landsharks, who promptly dealt him to the Albany Attack for Ken Montour and Mat Giles. He spent the next three years with the Attack in Albany, and moved with them as the club became the San Jose Stealth. Teat then moved on to the Buffalo Bandits, where he played from 2005 to the middle of the 2008 season when he was dealt, along with a second round pick in the 2008 draft and a first round pick in the 2009 draft, to the Edmonton Rush for Mike Accursi. Teat led the Rush in scoring in 2009, and was traded to the Philadelphia Wings for Derek Malawsky after the season. He spent 2010 with the Wings, and signed on with the Boston Blazers prior to the 2011 season. Teat joined the Blazers for the first week of training camp before announcing his retirement from the NLL.

The name was changed from Buchfelde to Loos in 1918 after a town in France which was the site of a battle in 1915. This was to remove a \\"name of enemy origin\\". The name returned to Buchfelde in November 1990. Geography The modern boundaries of the suburb were set in June 2011 after the construction of the Northern Expressway.
