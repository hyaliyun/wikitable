The majority of his works are in English, but translations of some of them have appeared in Russian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Korean and Japanese. He is particularly noted for his authoritative studies on Spinoza, Hegel, and Whitehead. He was President of the Hegel Society of America (1984–86), and President of the Metaphysical Society of America (1985–86). He has also made notable contributions to the study of Marx and the Marxist tradition. He attended Boston University for three years (1938–41), but his education was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Air Corps during WW II, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Career After the war he completed his undergraduate education with honors at Columbia College, Columbia University (1947), followed by graduate degrees at Columbia University (M.A. 1948; Ph.D. 1950). He taught philosophy at Columbia University 1950–52 and 1953–59 and was Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago, 1952-53. He moved to Bryn Mawr College (Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania) in 1959, initially teaching in both the philosophy and the Russian departments. He was appointed full Professor of Philosophy in 1961, becoming Milton C. Nahm Professor of Philosophy from 1981 until his retirement in 1991. Afterwards, Kline served as a Professor of Philosophy at Clemson University, South Carolina (1992–93). He also taught one-semester courses at Rutgers University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania, Haverford College and Swarthmore College. Beginning in 1952, at the University of Chicago, Kline first taught his famous course on \\"Russian Ethical and Social Theory\\"; it was subsequently taught at Columbia University through the 1950s, at Bryn Mawr College from 1960, and at a number of other institutions over the years. He also taught, more or less continuously, courses on the history of Russian philosophy, Russian and Soviet Marxism, and a number of courses on Russian literature. The entire field of Russian philosophy as an object of study in America has been shaped to a remarkable degree by the efforts of Kline himself over the course of a long career, beginning with his first publications in 1949: \\"Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor and the Soviet Regime,\\" Occidental (NY), no. 2, and \\"A Note on Soviet Logic,\\" Journal of Philosophy, v. 46, p. 228\\\\. The textual precision, historical learning, and depth of insight found in Kline's own numerous studies of Russian and Soviet philosophy over several decades have served as a model of serious scholarship on these topics for many other researchers. He is also responsible for making available in English some of the most important reference works in the field, including the English translation of Zenkovsky's History of Russian Philosophy, and (with others) Russian Philosophy, a 3-vol. anthology of original translations of Russian philosophical texts, continuously in print from 1965 to the present. Works in Slavic studies Kline has also supplied a large number of entries on Russian philosophers for a variety of philosophical encyclopedias over many years. He has written approximately 75 reviews of other scholars' works on Russian and Soviet philosophy as well as of new Soviet philosophical works. For example, during the 1950s Kline reviewed approximately thirty recent Soviet publications in the fields of formal logic, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of mathematics, principally for the Journal of Symbolic Logic, as the field of formal logic was opening up in the U.S.S.R. He has also published several authoritative bibliographies of works in Russian, and also in other languages, concerning the history of Russian thought and culture, as well as a bibliography of Brodsky's published writings. Finally, Kline's skills as an editor are legendary. He contributed his services to a great many publishing ventures connected with Russian and Soviet philosophy, including the Sovietica series of monographs and the journal Studies in Soviet Thought. On a personal level, he most generously assisted in the editing of other scholars' drafts of works in philosophy, intellectual history, literature and literary criticism, and has been a constant source of encouragement and support for younger scholars. In all of these ways Kline has placed his own irreplaceable mark upon the entire field. In 1949-50 Kline was in Paris as a Fulbright Scholar, just as V. V. Zenkovsky's История русской философии (2 vols., 1948 and 1950) was being published there. While in Paris Kline met Zenkovsky and volunteered to translate the History into English, completing it after returning to the U.S. During this process Zenkovsky introduced revisions and corrections for incorporation into the English translation, so that Kline's translation became the authoritative version of the text.V. V. Zenkovsky, A History of Russian Philosophy. Trans. George L. Kline (2 vols.). London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1953; republished in 2003. This work became the standard history of Russian philosophy for the next half-century, a crucial reference source for all scholars of Russian philosophy. In addition to Kline's translation of Zenkovsky, another exceptionally important resource for English-speaking students of Russian philosophy has been the comprehensive three-volume collection of original translations of Russian philosophers from the 18th century (Skovoroda) up through early Soviet Marxism (Russian Philosophy, Ed. James M. Edie, James P. Scanlan and Mary-Barbara Zeldin with the Collaboration of George L. Kline, New York: Quadrangle Press, 1965; revised paperback ed. in 1969; reprinted by the University of Tennessee Press in 1976, 1984). The appearance of these three volumes in the 1960s made it feasible for the first time for instructors in the U.S. and U.K. to teach university courses based upon a representative sampling of the entire history of Russian philosophy, with excellent translations and scholarly introductions for each general section and each philosopher. Kline contributed ten translations to these three volumes, revised a number of others, and advised the editors on which selections should be included. They commented that \\"Without his help and inspiration the publication of this historical anthology of Russian philosophy could have been neither successfully planned nor achieved.\\" Kline's own many studies of Russian and Soviet philosophy can be distributed into five main categories: #Religious thought in Russia and the Soviet Union #Russian and Soviet ethical thought #Studies of individual Russian philosophers #Marx, the Marxist tradition and Marxism–Leninism #Arguments for ethical individualism (though all four of these topics can sometimes be found interwoven in the same work) The first category is well represented by Religious and Anti-Religious Thought in Russia (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 1968), based upon the six Weil Institute Lectures that Kline delivered in Cincinnati in 1964, examining a panorama of attitudes toward religion by ten Russian thinkers, treated in five pairs: Bakunin and Tolstoy (two versions of anarchism, anti- religious and religious), Konstantin Leontiev and Vasily Rozanov (religious neo-conservativisms), Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev (religious existential- isms), Maxim Gorky and Anatoly Lunacharsky (pseudo-religious \\"God-Building\\"), V. I. Lenin and Sergei M. Plekhanov (militant vs. moderate atheism). Attitudes toward religion Against the background of this extreme range of attitudes toward religion by various Russian thinkers, Kline concluded by examining three dominant attitudes toward religion in the then contemporary Soviet Union.JSTOR They were: #The collectivist atheism of Marxist–Leninist ideology, which appeared to function as a kind of secular pseudo-religion for some of its most devout believers, an inversion of normal religious belief. #A \\"scientific-technological Prometheanism,\\" somewhat analogous to Gorky's and Luncharsky's religion of \\"God-Building,\\" which apparently inspired substantial numbers of the population, especially among the scientific and engineering elite. #A genuinely religious sense of life which was emerging among some poets, writers and artists outside of the church, inspired by earlier writers such as Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova. Religious belief in Russia Kline has published a number of important articles on aspects of religious belief in Russia, including \\"Religious Ferment Among Soviet Intellectuals,\\" in Religion and the Soviet State: A Dilemma of Power ed. M. Hayward and W. C. Fletcher (New York: Praeger, 1969), and especially \\"Spor o religioznoi filosofii: L. Shestov protiv Vl. Solov'eva,\\" Russkaia reigiozno-filosofskaia mysl; XX veka, ed. N. P. Poltoratzky (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh, 1975) and \\"Russian Religious Thought\\" in Nineteenth Century Religious Thought in the West, ed. Ninian Smart, et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1985). Russian and Soviet ethical theory have not only been at the center of much of Kline's teaching, but also of many of his publications. In \\"Changing Attitudes Toward the Individual\\" (in The Transformation of Russian Society:Aspects of Social Change since 1861, C. E. Black, Ed. (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1960), Kline examined the entire range of Russian ethical/social thought from 1861, pursuing the question of the degree to which the freedom, worth and dignity of the human individual figured as crucial values in that tradition, and found that the weight of nineteenth-century Russian thought was clearly on the side of ethical individualism. Prior to the revolution, only \\"the collectivist tendencies of Leo Tolstoy, Vladimir Soloviev, and such Marxists as Bogdanov and Bazarov\\" seem to stand out as exceptions. Nietzschean Marxism during the Soviet Silver Age Kline was one of the first Western scholars to direct special attention to the episode of \\"Nietzschean Marxism\\" found especially in the works of Volsky and Lunacharsky, as well as Bogdanov and Bazarov during the period 1903-12. Three of his studies are especially relevant: \\"'Nietzschean Marxism' in Russia,\\" (in Demythologizing Marxism, Frederick J. Adelmann, S.J., Ed. (Boston and The Hague: Nijhoff, 1969), and \\"The Nietzschean Marxism of Stanislav Volsky\\" in Western Philosophical Systems in Russian Literature, ed. Anthony Mlikotin (Los Angeles: University of Southern California Press, 1979). Kline's attention to \\"Nietzschean Marxism\\" has inspired work by a number of other researchers on this same theme: see Kline's \\"Foreword\\" in Nietzsche in Russia, ed. Bernice G. Rosenthal (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1986). Ethics and morality in the Soviet period have also been a continuing interest: \\"Current Soviet Morality\\" in Encyclopedia of Morals, ed. Vergilius Ferm (New York: Philosophical Library, 1956), \\"Economic Crime and Punishment,\\" Survey, no. 57 (1965), \\"Soviet Ethical Theory,\\" in Encyclopedia of Ethics, ed. Lawrence C. Becker (New York: Garland; London: St. James Press, 1992), and \\"The Soviet Recourse to the Death Penalty for Crimes Against Socialist Property (1961-1986),\\" Sofia Philosophical Review, vol. 3, 2009. (III) Phenomenology in Marxist materialism Kline's publications on individual Russian philosophers include fifteen entries in the first edition of The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Paul Edwards (1967), ten entries in the second edition, ed. Donald M. Borchert (2005), two entries in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed Edward Craig (1998), plus individual entries in several others. Kline has published several studies on Gustav Shpet: \\"Meditations of a Russian Neo-Husserlian: Gustav Shpet's 'The Skeptic and his Soul'\\" in Phenomenology and Skepticism: Essays in Honor of James M. Edie, ed. Brice R. Wachterhauser (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern UP, 1996); \\"Gustav Shpet as Interpreter of Hegel,\\" in Archiwum Historii Filozofii i myśli społecznej, T. 44, 1999; \\"Shpet as Translator of Hegel's Phänomenologie des Geistes,\\" in Gustav Shpet's Contribution to Philosophy and Cultural Theory, ed. Galin Tikhanov (W. Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 2009). See also \\"The Hegelian Roots of S. L. Frank's Ethics and Social Philosophy,\\" The Owl of Minerva, Vol. 25 (1994). (IV) Kline has published studies of Marx, the Marxist tradition and Soviet Marxism–Leninism throughout his career. One of his most important articles on Marx is \\"The Myth of Marx's Materialism\\" in Philosophical Sovietology: The Pursuit of a Science, ed. Helmut Dahm, Thomas J. Blakeley and George L. Kline (Dordrecht and Boston: Reidel, 1988). There he denies that Marx ever promoted a materialist ontology in the normal philosophical sense, whereas most of his followers from Engels through Plekhanov and Lenin, plus all the Marxist-Leninists, have claimed that he did so. He identifies seven distinct senses of the adjective \\"materiell\\" as used by Marx, no one of which actually justifies the claim that Marx was committed to a materialist ontology. \\"Leszek Kolakowski and the Revision of Marxism\\" plus a \\"Bibliography of the Principal Writings of Leszek Kolakowski,\\" published in European Philosophy Today, ed. George L. Kline (Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1965) played a significant role in introducing the work of Kolakowski to American intellectuals. See also \\"Beyond Revisionism: Leszek Kolakowski's Recent Philosophical Development\\" and \\"Selective [Kolakowski] Bibliography,\\" Triquarterly 22: A Kolakowski Reader (1971). In a similar vein, see \\"Georg Lukács in Retrospect: Impressions of the Man and his Ideas,\\" Problems of Communism, vol. 21, No. 6 (1972), \\"Lukács's Use and Abuse of Hegel and Marx,\\" in Lukács and His World: A Reassessment, ed. Ernest Joos (Frankfurt and New York: Peter Lang, 1987), and \\"Class Consciousness and the World- Historical Future\\" in Georg Lukács: Theory, Culture and Politics, ed. Judith Marcus and Zoltan Tarr (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1989). Work on Spinoza In 1952 Kline published Spinoza in Soviet Philosophy (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; New York: Humanities Press), a study of the revival of Spinoza scholarship in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 30's, including the emergence of conflicting Marxist schools of Spinoza interpretation. This work included translations by Kline of seven major articles on Spinoza published from 1923-1932, with a lengthy introduction. Other studies of Soviet Marxism–Leninism by Kline include \\"The Poverty of Marxism-Leninism,\\" Problems of Communism, Vol. 19, No. 6 (1970) and \\"La Philosophie en Union Soviétique autour de 1930\\" in Histoire de la littérature russe, ed. Efim Etkind et al. (Paris: Payard, 1990). (V) Set of Principles in political philosophy Throughout his career, in an important series of essays stretching from 1953 to 2000, Kline has argued for the necessity of a genuine ethical individualism, an individualism of principles (and not of mere ideals, such as might be attributed to Marx or Nietzsche or Lenin). A genuine ethical individualism recognizes the intrinsic value of existing human beings, the primacy of their claims to self-realization and the enjoyment of value in the present, and rejects as illegitimate any attempt to treat them merely instrumentally, to sacrifice their lives in the name of some as-yet-unrealized future value or future state of society. The background for Kline's argument of ethical individualism is contained in \\"Humanities and Cosmologies: The Background of Certain Humane Values,\\" Western Humanities Review, Vol. 7 (1953); \\"Was Marx an Ethical Humanist?\\" in Studies in Soviet Thought, Vol. 9 (1969); and \\"The Use and Abuse of Hegel by Nietzsche and Marx,\\" [Presidential Address to the Hegel Society of America] in Hegel and His Critics, ed. William Desmond (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1989). In \\"'Present', 'Past', and 'Future' as Categoreal Terms, and the 'Fallacy of the Actual Future',\\" Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 40 (1986) Kline argued that past, present, and future are genuine categorical terms pace attempts by some physical theorists to claim that time is not a fundamental property of the real, that past and future are ontologically asymmetrical, that time-reversal is not possible (see irreversibility and Ilya Prigogine), and consequently that the present is ontologically prior. It follows that any attempt to justify treating presently-living individuals as mere instruments for the realization of some alleged future good must involve the fallacy of the \\"actual future,\\" i.e., the attempt to claim that the actuality of some (supposedly valuable) future state is sufficient to justify the actual sacrifice now of presently-living individuals. But such a claim is always necessarily false: the future is a realm of possibilities, and never of actualities. More recently (in \\"Gustav Shpet as Interpreter of Hegel\\" [see above]), Kline pointed out that a strikingly similar argument was made by Shpet in his Filosofskoe mirovozrenie Gertsena (1921). Commenting on Herzen, Shpet agreed that those committed to a revolutionary quest for a future ideal \\"become cruel dreamers, strangers to the large and small joys of the present day, prepared...to sacrifice their own lives and the lives of others.\\" Herzen, like Hegel, had a sense of the historical present as an end-in-itself (Selbstzweck). Shpet concluded that \\"for Herzen the individual person is not a 'future' ghostly person, but a person of the present day, alive and in the flesh, a real person, not a future one.\\" Kline is also widely known as one of the most important early champions of Joseph Brodsky, translations of whose poetry Kline began to publish as early as 1965, several years before Brodsky was expelled from the Soviet Union. Kline is an exceptionally highly regarded translator of Russian poetry, including poems by Pasternak, Tsvetayeva and Voznesensky. Works on A. E. Whitehead Kline's work on Whitehead cover's Whitehead's metaphysics and the influence Whitehead's ideas have had on other non-English speaking cultures. Translator for Brodsky's poetry However it is Klines long association with Brodsky, and his very numerous translations of Brodsky's poetry, for which he is particularly known. Kline first met Brodsky in Leningrad in August, 1967, and formed a close association as translator and friend. Between 1965 and 1989 Kline published translations of poems by Brodsky on more than thirty separate occasions in a variety of publishing venues, and played a leading role in the publication of both Ostanovka v pustyne (New York: izd. Chekhova, 1970) and Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems, Trans. George L. Kline (New York: Harper & Row, 1973). Ostanovka v pustyne was the first Russian-language edition of his poetry for which Brodsky was able to make the main editorial choices, thanks to Kline's connection with him, but Kline's name did not appear on the original edition, in order to protect Brodsky, who was still in Leningrad. Selected Poems was the first volume of translations to appear after Brodsky came to the U.S. (and the first one for which Brodsky was able to participate directly in the editing process). Kline translated all the poems for this volume and wrote the \\"Introduction\\" for it. Brodsky gradually began taking a more active role in assisting with translations of his poetry by others; as early as 1980 he began publishing some of his own translations into English. In recognition of the long personal and professional bond between them, Brodsky invited Kline to attend the ceremony in Stockholm in 1987 when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. In addition to his personal association with Brodsky, Kline has also had personal connections with Lukacs, Kolakowski, Marcuse and Losev. Both Brodsky and Kolakowski attended and made presentations for Kline's retirement ceremony at Bryn Mawr in 1991. In 1999 Kline received the award of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies for \\"Distinguished Contributions to Slavic Studies.\\" In addition to citing his remarkable scholarly career as a philosopher, translator, editor and teacher, the citation went on \\"to call particular attention to his extraordinary impact on his fellow scholars, many of whom have been his students. They recall his erudite, generous, and detailed comments on their papers and books, and the depth and wisdom he brought to his scholarship. Countless younger scholars consider themselves indebted to him for his judgment, encouragement, and guidance. We all stand in his debt, therefore, for helping us to appreciate the richness and depth of Russian philosophy and literature and for his long dedication to nurturing our field.\\" Higher education Boston University 1938–1941 (no degree) Columbia College, Columbia University, NY 1946-1947: A.B.

At age 12, he played organ and conducted a choir which performed his own works. In 1979, he entered the Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln, where his teachers included Günther Ludwig, and studied composition there. He subsequently studied piano, harmony, counterpoint, analysis, and chamber music at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris, where his teachers included Yvonne Loriod, Pierre Reach (piano), Jean-Sébastien Béreau (orchestra conducting), Bruno Pasquier, Jean-Claude Bernède, Maurice Crut (chamber music), Annie Chaland, Alain Bernaud, Roger Boutry (harmony), Jean-Paul Holstein (counterpoint), Françoise Rieunier (analysis), and Alain Weber (composition). He had afterwards advanced studies in conducting at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, where his teachers included Alexander Jenner, and at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. He has also studied with Bertrand Molia, Éliane Richepin, and Alexis Weissenberg. Weigel has had long-standing artistic collaborations with the Flâneries musicales de Reims, and with the Paris Bastille Opera as chorus master. He performed with Ruggero Raimondi for the program Le Grand Tour, which led to a series of recitals with Raimondi. In other media, Weigel began a collaboration in 2010 with the journalist and writer Alain Duault for concerts in the French operas presenting the movies On the steps of the great composers, and Musical Promenades in European Music Cities. He appears regularly on radio and television programmes across Europe, such as Le Fou du roi with Stéphane Bern, Carrefour de Lodéon with Frédéric Lodéon on France Inter, Fauteuils d'Orchestre with Anne Sinclair, Le Grand Tour with Patrick de Carolis on France Télévisions, and Le monde est à vous with Jacques Martin on Antenne 2.

The two vessels were named for Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley. The vessels are also sometimes described as cutters, but more generally as brigs. The Spanish captured the first Sir Thomas Pasley. The second had a brief, but highly productive, career that later led to her crew qualifying for the Naval General Service Medal. After she was returned to her owners in March 1802, she may have been wrecked in the Mediterranean that same year. Records of their service are far from complete and even their name is ambiguous as contemporary records refer to them interchangeably as Admiral Pasley, Pasley, and Sir Thomas Pasley. (The National Maritime Museum's database has all three names, with considerable overlap in the service notes.) Sometimes the vessel is referred to as Paisley, Admiral Paisley, or Sir Thomas Paisley. First Sir Thomas Pasley One account describes this vessel as the hired brig Pasley, of 204 tons burthen (bm), and armed with two 6-pounder bow chasers and twelve 12-pounder carronades. she served the Royal Navy from 18 September 1800 to 9 December 1800. She had a crew of 44 men and boys under the command of Lieutenant Charles Niven, or Nevin. She left Plymouth on 17 October with despatches for Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Tetuan Bay.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.344. She returned to Plymouth on 10 November in a remarkably quick round trip.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp.435-7. She then left again on 22 November with despatches for Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Malta. was to have carried the dispatches but she had grounded in The Hamoaze.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.421-2. On 10 December Pasley was off Ceuta when one, or perhaps two, Spanish gunboats engaged her. Spanish sources report that the attacker was the Spanish gunboat San Francisco Javier, alias Poderoso, from Cadiz. Poderoso was armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns, and under the command of Miguel Villalba.El Imparcial, 19 March 1896. All accounts agree that a gunboat sat on Pasleys stern and proceeded to fire on her with the gunboat's long gun. The lack of wind prevented Pasley from turning to bring her two bow chasers into action. The location of the carronades thwarted attempts to bring the guns to the stern. (Had Pasley not had to rush to carry the dispatches to Gibraltar, she would have been modified at Plymouth to enable the guns to be moved to the stern when necessary.) After a two-hour resistance, Nevin struck. He had been wounded three times, and the master had been wounded as well. In all, Pasley suffered three men killed and eight wounded of her crew of 45 men. The court martial of Nevin absolved him of any culpability. The Spanish took Pasley into Ceuta and then Algeciras. Nevin wrote from Algeciras on 10 December briefly describing the action and reporting that he and his wounded men were recovering rapidly.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.179. Second Sir Thomas Pasley On 3 February 1801, Lieutenant James Nicholson of HM hired armed schooner Suwarrow captured the French brig Jeune Annette (or Jeune Nannette). Jeune Annette, under Lieutenant de vaisseau Feuqueux, was armed with 18 guns and had a crew of 45 men. She had been sailing from Cayenne to Bordeaux with a cargo of \\"anatto, dye wood, elephants teeth, etc.\\" and a number of deported priests, who were emaciated after their confinement. Because Suworow had previously sent in four Danish vessels, Suwarrow had only 16 men and boys on board when she chased and captured Jeune Annette.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.111 Jeunne Annette came into Plymouth. There orders arrived on 11 April that she be surveyed in preparation for being taken into the navy.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.370. The Naval Chronicle reported on 24 April \\"That beautiful brig La Jeune Annette, now Paisley, of sixteen six-pounders, is commissioned, and the command given to Lieutenant W. Wooldridge, late of the .\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.372. Other records describe the vessel as the cutter Sir Thomas Pasley, of 16 cannons (two 12-pounder chase guns and fourteen 12-pounder carronades), and 162 tons (bm). This record states that Sir Thomas Pasley served the Royal Navy as a hired vessel from 20 May to 6 March 1802. On 23 May Pasley was ready for sea.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.462. She sailed on 2 June with dispatches for the Channel Fleet.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.534. She returned six days later to Plymouth with dispatches from Admiral the Honourable Cornwallis, off Brest.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.535. On the way Wooldridge chased a French lugger of 16 guns and a cutter of 12 guns, but lost them in the fog. When the fog lifted, he sighted the cutter some distance to leeward, but being under orders to deliver the dispatches immediately, declined to resume the chase. Pasley sailed on 9 June with dispatches. Then on 15 June Pasley sailed from Plymouth as part of a squadron under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. The squadron had supplies for five months and sealed orders that the admiral was not to open until they had crossed a certain latitude.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.536. As it turned out, Saumarez was under orders to establish a blockade of Cadiz. On 25 June Pasley captured the Spanish privateer felucca Golondrina off Cape St. Vincent. Golondrina was armed with two guns and small arms, and had a crew of 33 men, nine of whom were away as prize crews on a Guernsey lugger and a Portuguese schooner that Golondrina had captured. In early July Saumarez sent Pasley to try to find Rear-admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. Pasley sailed as far as Malta but was unable to locate the rear-admiral.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.454. Then on 21 July Pasley was on her way back to Menorca when at 7am, six or seven leagues south west of the island of Carbera, she encountered a Spanish naval xebec of 22 guns. An engagement that lasted an hour and a half developed in which Pasley lost one man killed and two wounded. Pasley succeeded in silencing the xebec, which however escaped to Ivica by nightfall. The wind had fallen away and both vessels resorted to their sweeps, with the xebec being faster. Eight days after that, on 29 July, Pasley was off Cape Tresforcas. There she captured the Spanish privateer schooner Atamara. Atamara was pierced for 14 guns, but only mounted seven 6 and 12-pounder guns. She had a crew of 55 men, was ten days out of Malaga, and had taken a schooner from Oran that had been carrying cattle to Gibraltar. Pasleys most costly victory came on 28 October. She was some 20 leagues E.S.E. of Cape de Gat when she encountered a Spanish polacca that commenced to give chase, and drew close. A battle ensued that lasted about an hour when Wooldridge, realizing that most of Pasleys rigging had been shot away, decided that her only hope was to run into the polacca and board her. Pasley ran across the polacca's hawse and lashed her bowsprit to Pasleys capstan. The British boarded and after a hand-to-hand battle of about 15 minutes, prevailed even though the Spaniards had 40 more men. The Spanish polacca was the privateer Virgine de Rosario, of Malaga. She was pierced for 20 guns and mounted 12, two 24-pounder and eight 12-pounder guns. She had been out 20 days but had not captured anything. Virgine de Rosario had commenced the fight with a crew of 94 men. The battle cost her her first and second captains killed, as well as another 19 officers and men killed. She also had 13 men wounded. Pasley had three men killed and eight men wounded, out of a crew of 53 men. One of the wounded was Wooldrige, who had been shot through the shoulder. Subsequently, the master, one of Pasleys wounded, died of his wounds.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.513. Admiral Suamarez promoted Wooldridge to the rank of Commander for his heroism. In December Wooldridge and Pasley returned to England. From there he wrote that his wound still had not healed. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Pasley 28 Octr. 1801\\". Wooldridge's next command was . Wooldridge's successor as captain of Pasley was Lieutenant Morris, who replaced Wooldridge in or before February 1802. Morris sailed from Gibraltar on 9 February 1802 and arrived at Plymouth on 24 February.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.374. The Treaty of Amiens, signed 25 March 1802, ended the French Revolutionary Wars. Shortly before, the Royal Navy returned Sir Thomas Pasley to her owners. The next mention of a vessel by that name is a report in December in Lloyd's List that the Sir Thomas Pasley, Neale, master, had run on shore at the island of Majorca while on a voyage from Newfoundland to Leghorn.Lloyd's List, no. 4310, - accessed 12 May 2014. Another report had the brig Sir Thomas Pasley driven ashore and wrecked at Menorca while on a voyage from Newfoundland to Naples, Kingdom of Sicily.

Euthanasia of insects and other invertebrates has historically received limited attention. While vertebrate animal experimentation typically requires approval by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in the United States, use of invertebrate animals has few guidelines, and many research papers make no mention of how their invertebrate subjects were killed. Many of the euthanasia methods developed for vertebrates do not transfer well to invertebrates. While a number of euthanasia methods have been proposed for various invertebrate taxa, many have not been adequately vetted, and more research is needed. Uncertainty over insect sentience Scientists debate the existence and extent of pain in invertebrates, including insects. Vincent Wigglesworth suggests giving insects the benefit of the doubt, in case they can suffer. Cornelia Gunkel and Gregory A. Lewbart suggest that \\"Until the question of pain in invertebrates is clearly answered, an analgesic should be given to any animal that is subjected to a painful procedure.\\" Jeffrey A. Lockwood agrees: > If we use anesthetic and it turns out that insects don’t experience pain, > the material cost of our mistake is very low [...]. However, if we don’t use > anesthetic and it turns out that the insects were in agony, then the moral > cost of our mistake is quite high. AVMA guidelines echo this perspective: > While there is ongoing debate about invertebrates’ abilities to perceive > pain or otherwise experience compromised welfare, the Guidelines assume that > a conservative and humane approach to the care of any creature is warranted > and expected by society. Consequently, euthanasia methods should be used > that minimize the potential for pain or distress. Laboratory euthanasia =Recommended methods= Pentobarbital overdose Pentobarbital is an anesthetic drug used in medicine, human and animal euthanasia, and capital punishment. AVMA recommends overdose of pentobarbital or similar drugs as a method of invertebrate euthanasia. The dose can be chosen at comparable levels as those given to poikilotherm vertebrates, adjusted proportionally to the animal's weight. Injection into hemolymph is ideal, but for invertebrates that have an open circulatory system, \\"an intracoelomic injection\\" may be required rather than injection into blood vessels. It may help to premedicate the animal with another injected or inhaled drug. Verifying an insect's death from chemical injections is difficult, so it's often recommended to follow up anesthetic overdose with physical destruction. Note that since insects have different nervous systems from vertebrates, decapitation alone may not always be sufficient to destroy neural function. Professor Peer Zwart has observed that commercial pentobarbital may have a pH between 9.5 and 11.0, which can coagulate the protein of snail hemocele. This might be painful to a live organism. Potassium chloride Potassium chloride (KCl) is one of the three drugs typically used in lethal injection in the United States. It causes hyperkalemia, which stops the heart by inducing depolarization of cellular membrane potentials. Intravenous KCl injection is unacceptable for vertebrate animals unless they have been rendered unconscious by other means. Development on American lobster: Andrea Battison and colleagues proposed KCl for euthanasia of the American lobster. The researchers injected KCl solution in order to fill with potassium ions (K+) the hemolymph sinus that holds the lobster's ventral nerve cord and the region around its supraesophageal ganglion. In normal circumstances, neurons maintain a negative membrane potential and have a high intracellular K+ concentration. When KCl is injected into hemolymph, extracellular K+ increases and begins to enter the neurons to restore equilibrium. This depolarizes the neurons and generates an action potential. Subsequent repolarization is blocked by the high intracellular K+, so the nervous system fails, and transmission of adverse sensory information is prevented. The potassium then triggers cardiac arrest within 40–90 seconds, in both warm and cold environments. While intravenous KCl is not humane for vertebrates, the researchers in this study assume that in lobsters \\"disruption of the CNS, its ability to process and transmit sensory input, and loss of any awareness would be almost immediate\\" because the injection directly targets the lobster's \\"brain.\\" KCl injection produced immediate extension of claws and legs due to deactivation of motor neurons, and the researchers assume that sensory neurons degraded in a similar fashion. The lethal dose for this procedure was rather high: 1 g KCl per 1 kg of body weight. This was 10-30 times more than the required dose for intravenous mammalian killing with KCl, and it may reflect the lobster's resilient physiology. Tissues were well preserved, except for myofiber damage at the injection site, which means this technique is generally suitable for histology research. Extension to terrestrial arthropods: Cockroach nymph Neil A. C. Bennie and colleagues extended the technique of Battison et al. to arthropods like Blaberus giganteus, Gryllus bimaculatus, and Locusta migratoria. They produced a table of suggested injection sites and doses for ten orders of arthropods. The researchers propose the name targeted hyperkalosis to describe the procedure of injecting a large dose of K+ to the thoracic ganglia. Advantages of this approach are that KCl is cheap, safe, doesn't need special storage, and preserves specimens for most research use cases except those that look at the neural culture itself. That said, the method is hard to use for small insects like Drosophila sp. The recommended dose is 10% v/w 300 mg/ml KCl injected between the first pair of legs for Blattodea, Phasmida, Orthoptera, Mantodea, Coleoptera, and Diptera. =Techniques requiring an adjunctive method of euthanasia= Inhaled anesthetics Overdose on inhaled anesthetics can work for terrestrial invertebrates like insects, but verifying death can be difficult, so it's advised to use another euthanasia method alongside them. Isoflurane and sevoflurane are examples of volatile anaesthetics that can be used; afterward, the insects should be mechanically destroyed such as by crushing. Systems have been developed to provide vaporized anesthetic in the minimal required amounts in order to make anesthesia more cost-effective. Pithing Pithing requires sufficient anatomical experience with the relevant species. It is not humane on its own and should be preceded by other means of anaesthesia. Chemical Chemicals like alcohol and formalin can destroy nervous tissue but are not humane by themselves and should be preceded by other means of anaesthesia. Ethyl Acetate (EtOAC) or Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) are and were commonly used field chemicals in conjunction with a kill jar for collecting insect specimens by many entomologists.http://www.extension.umn.edu/youth/mn4-H/projects/environment/entomology/collecting- and-preserving-insects/ Freezing Freezing is sometimes suggested as a method of insect euthanasia. Others contend that freezing is not humane on its own but should be preceded by other means of anaesthesia. Cold by itself doesn't produce analgesia. Romain Pizzi suggests that freezing, while common in \\"hobbyist literature,\\" will compromise tissues of spiders for later histopathological examination, but does not make any statement about its effect on spider wellbeing. The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) Terrestrial Invertebrate Working Group (TIWG) reports on a survey conducted by Mark Bushell of BIAZA institutions. He found that refrigeration and freezing were the most common methods \\"of euthanasia of invertebrates although research has suggested that this is probably one of the least ethical options.\\" That said, freezing is a worst-case method if chemical or instantaneous physical destruction is not possible. Insects put in an ordinary freezer may require a day or more to be killed. =Uncertain methods= Carbon dioxide is sometimes used for terrestrial invertebrates, including insects. However, its effectiveness is not known. It has been reported to cause convulsions and excited behavior, perhaps suggesting animal discomfort. It is not believed to induce analgesia. John E. Cooper writes: \\"If a procedure is considered to be potentially painful, there may be merit in using isoflurane, halothane, or sevoflurane rather than because the extent to which the latter induces analgesia in invertebrates is not known, and its use in vertebrate animals is controversial because of concerns about its effects on the animals' health and welfare.\\" Farm euthanasia Some insect farmers believe that mechanical shredding is the least painful way to kill insects suitable for human consumption. Freezing is also commonly used for commercial entomophagy operations, though as discussed above, there is debate over whether freezing is fully humane. Many insects eaten by humans are roasted, fried, boiled, or otherwise heated directly, without any effort made at euthanasia. Many pets eat live insects, which cannot be euthanized.

He is known for his solo work and for his role in the groups Mambotur, Skipsapiens, Monne Automne and Bucci (with his brother Andrés Bucci). He is one of three Bucci brothers – Juan Pablo, Pier and Andrés – all of whom are electronic music producers. Like his brother Andrés, Pier combines Latin rhythms with German style, as a result of his Chilean origin and the influence of the music scene of Berlin, his home since 2002. Career Pier Bucci was born in Santiago, Chile and grew up in the \\"Bucci Gallery\\" in the city centre. The gallery was one of the few places that offered art exhibition space in the Chilean military regime, and was one of the cultural bastions of the last years of the dictatorship, welcoming emerging avant-garde painters as well as punk and 80s new wave musicians. Pier's first track \\"Yahow\\" was included on the album Ruta 5: Austral (2000), a compilation of Chilean electronic music. In 2002, he moved to Berlin, Germany with his brother Andrés (Plan V) and together, as the duo Bucci, they recorded an EP also entitled \\"Bucci\\". Pier also took part in projects like Skipsapiens with Danieto, Monne Automne with Luciano (of Lucien-n-Luciano), and Mambotur with Argenis Brito. In 2003, the Bucci duo had their debut release with the track \\"Dude\\" and came in at number 8 in the specialist De:Bug magazine chart, performing in several Berlin clubs. Also in 2003, Bucci appeared in the \\"Canción Electrónica\\" (\\"Electronic Song\\" in English) compilation album from Argentina's Indice Virgen Records, as well as the \\"Colores Compilation\\" album from Mexico's Mil Records. He has produced for Lo-Fi Stereo and Crosstown Rebels, and has released on Luciano (DJ)'s Cadenza label. He also had a track featured on Cocoon Recordings' 'Cocoon Compilation F'. Pier recorded his first solo album \\"Familia\\" in 2005, with collaborations from Macha (Lafloripondio) and the voice of Armelle Pioline (Holden). In 2009, Pier launched his own label, Maruca Music, which has to date featured his own new original music along with remixes from heavyweights like Baby Ford and Thomas Melchior.

Cohen in 1992. The firm employed approximately 800 peopleSteve Cohen's Trade Secrets Bloomberg.com, February 26, 2010 in 2010 across its offices located in Stamford, Connecticut and New York City, and various international satellite offices. It reportedly lost many of its traders in the wake of various investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2010, the SEC opened an insider trading investigation of SAC and in 2013 several former employees were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice. In November 2013, the firm itself pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and paid $1.2 billion in penalties (in addition to $616 million already paid to the SEC), although no formal charges have been filed against Cohen himself. The firm shrunk after returning the vast majority of its outside investor capital (i.e., not controlled by Steven Cohen personally). Point72 Asset Management was established as a separate family office in 2014. SAC ceased to exist as a separate entity in 2016.SEC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD)  History The company's name 'SAC Capital' derived from Steven A Cohen's initials. The company started trading with $25 million in 1992, grew AUM to $16 billion, and became the world's highest-returning hedge fund: SAC averaged annual returns of 30% net of fees under a 3% management fee and 50% performance fee from 1992 to 2013. The company's strategy was the \\"mosaic theory of investing\\" which develops investment positions based on stock information from many sources. SAC focused on trading liquid, large-cap stocks and later began using fundamental and quantitative strategies. The company had $14 billion in assets under management across four independent portfolios at the start of 2013. According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine, SAC Capital Advisors daily trading activity accounted for as much as 3% of the New York Stock Exchange's daily trading and up to 1% of the NASDAQ's daily trades. SAC Capital maintained offices in Stamford, Connecticut, New York City, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, London, Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago. On December 9, 2013, SAC agreed to sell its reinsurance business, SAC Re, to a group of investors led by insurance-industry veteran Brian Duperreault. =Biovail= In March 2006, 60 Minutes reported on a lawsuit against SAC filed by Biovail, a Canadian pharmaceutical company which alleged that SAC had manipulated reports on Biovail in order to drive the price of the stock down. SAC denied the charges and said that the stock was overvalued and that the decline was due to shortfalls in earnings and regulatory investigations. In August 2009, the New Jersey Superior Court dismissed all of Biovail's claims against SAC Capital. On February 10, 2010, SAC Capital filed a lawsuit in federal court in Connecticut seeking damages from Biovail for filing \\"vexatious\\" litigation against them in 2006. The lawsuit was settled out of court in November 2010.Valeant Pharmaceuticals Press Release, November 4, 2010 Under the settlement, Biovail's new owner, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, paid $10 million to SAC. =Fairfax Financial Holdings= In July 2006, SAC Capital Advisors was one of three industry participants that were sued by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH) and accused of conspiring to manipulate the company's stock price. FFH alleged SAC Capital and two other hedge funds paid analyst John Gywnn and his employer Morgan Keegan to publish negative reports on FFH and drive its stock price down. In December 2008, Fairfax Financial Holdings provided email exchanges as evidence to the court amongst the hedge funds and Gywnn, that discussed the content of the soon-to-be-published report on FFH. In September 2011, the Superior Court in Morris County, New Jersey, granted SAC Capital Advisors’ motion for summary judgment and removed SAC Capital Advisors, Sigma Capital Management, a division of SAC Capital Advisors, and Steven Cohen as defendants from the case. Judge Stephan C. Hansbury wrote in his judgement: “There is no direct evidence of any sort of conspiracy involving SAC to take down Fairfax.\\" =Insider trading cases= A 2013 article in Yahoo! Finance reported that SAC Capital Advisors had been under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for six years. In November 2010, the SEC conducted raids at the offices of investment companies run by former SAC traders. Several days later, SAC received what they described as \\"extraordinarily broad\\" subpoenas. In February 2011, two former employees were charged with insider trading. In November 2012, federal prosecutors levied charges against additional former SAC Capital traders. Portfolio manager Michael Steinberg was arrested in March 2013 and accused of using inside information to make $1.4 million in profits for SAC Capital. In July 2013, SAC Capital was charged with conspiracy and securities fraud, citing the actions of 8 current and former employees. With the conviction of Mathew Martoma on February 6, 2014, and after a four-week trial, a total of eight former SAC Capital employees were either convicted at trial or plead guilty.. However, three convictions and guilty pleas were later overturned or withdrawn, casting doubt on aggressive prosecutorial tactics and overreach by the then US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. Notably, prosecutors dropped charges entirely against a former SAC portfolio manager when new evidence emerged suggesting his initial plea had been coerced and evidence pointed to his factual innocence. In July 2013, the SEC filed a civil suit against SAC for failing to properly supervise its traders. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice \\"filed a five count criminal indictment by a federal grand jury, including four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud.\\" SAC said it would \\"vigorously fight\\" the accusations and charges, but shortly thereafter, in November 2013, SAC Capital agreed to plead guilty to all counts of the indictment, stop managing funds for outsiders, and pay a $1.2 billion fine. Trading teams at SAC have since left to join competing hedge funds such as BlueCrest Capital Management, Millennium Management, and Balyasny Asset Management. On September 8, 2014, Martoma was sentenced to 9 years in prison and was ordered to forfeit nearly $9.4 million, more than his net worth.

It was originally published by St. Martin's Press in 1994. The novel tells the coming-of-age story of a young Black woman, Liliane Parnell, through the numerous voices of childhood friends, family, lovers, acquaintances, conversations between Liliane and her psychoanalyst, and Liliane herself. Liliane is the daughter of a wealthy and prominent African-American judge, Lincoln Parnell, and his beautiful wife Sunday Bliss Parnell who is working towards reconciling her life as an artist in the present with both the secrets and the expectations of class ascendance from her family's past. Plot summary The novel opens with a conversation between Liliane and her psychoanalyst. These conversations become regular interval points within and throughout the novel as the story unfolds. Liliane expresses concern about her current situation, professing that she cannot breath and that she is looking for somebody and it does not matter who, she says, \\"as long as he won't hurt me\\". As the novel continues, Liliane's character is developed through the lens of those around her with whom she is close. The reader learns that Liliane grew up within a wealthy and prominent Black family that was part of the Talented tenth. Liliane's father pushes her to pursue a husband who will \\"'...have the backbone to fight for what's never happened, or for dreams.'\\" These comments lead Liliane to eventually leave her first boyfriend, Danny, and pursue another man, named Granville, who better conforms to her father's ideal of a suitable match. As Liliane and her close friends grow older, however, they begin to face significant conflicts within their lives. One of Liliane's close friends, Hyacinthe, begins to have mental health troubles early in her adolescence and depends heavily on her brother, Sawyer Malveaux III for support. When he is unexpectedly shot, however, Hyacinthe's mental condition becomes worse and she eventually enters care in a mental health facility. For Liliane, a major hurdle is the disappearance of her mother from her life and the breakdown of her nuclear family. As Liliane transitions to adulthood, the pressures from her father to be the ideal Black woman and mate to a powerful Black leader begin to have less of an impact on her life decisions. While the relationships with the women that Liliane formed throughout her early childhood and adolescence remain deeply important to her (and are maintained throughout the novel), Liliane begins to make romantic, sexual, and platonic connections with men and women from all walks of life. The desires of her father, and the mysterious disappearance of her mother, however, are never far from her mind. Characters *Liliane The novel's eponymous protagonist. Liliane is a young artist who is coming to terms both with the social issues of her time surrounding racial uplift and her own family's past and secrets. *Jean-René One of Liliane's various lovers. He is introduced to the reader in the first chapter to the reader as a man Liliane met at a fast food place next to the Moulin Rouge. *Roxie One of Liliane's close childhood friends. She remains friends with Liliane throughout Liliane's transition to adulthood. *Sierra Roxie's daughter. *Sunday \\"S.\\" Bliss Liliane's mother. She is described as beautiful and articulate. *Parnell Liliane's father. He is a judge and a wealthy, prominent, and well respected figure in the African-American community. *Victor-Jésus Maria Another one of Liliane's lovers, Victor-Jésus Maria is a Puerto Rican photographer living in the Lower East Side of New York City. He is boastful and playful. *Danny Liliane's first boyfriend. Danny hails from a different class background from Liliane and is looked down upon by Liliane's father Parnell Lincoln because he is not seen as a promising enough match for Liliane. *Sawyer Malveaux III Eldest son in a prominent Creole family residing in St. Louis, Missouri. Malveaux is the charismatic, handsome, and unruly brother of Hyacinthe. He fails to live up to the expectations of his well to do family and is seen as a failure and \\"good-for-nothing\\" after having been kicked out of multiple colleges and universities. *Hyacinthe One of Liliane's childhood friends and the sister of Sawyer Malveaux. She struggles with her mental health. *Rose Lynne Liliane's good friend from childhood. *Lollie Liliane's cousin. *Granville Liliane's boyfriend after Danny. He fits the description of a what Liliane's father would deem a suitable match for Liliane. *Bernadette One of Liliane's most ambivalent acquaintances. Bernadette is close to Danny and also hails from a different class than that of Rose Lynne and Liliane's.  Structure  The novel's form is seemingly unique as it is divided into chapters narrated by important persons in Liliane's life and conversations between Liliane and her psychoanalyst that occur in between each chapter. These chapters feature anecdotes about the narrating character's interactions with Liliane, usually providing illumination of the conversations Liliane has with her psychoanalyst that are featured prior to the chapter. Because of the multiplicity of narrators throughout the novel, the reader is often forced to make a decision about which narrator to believe. This unique episodic structure allows for the novel to cover a wide range in time periods.  Major themes  =Racial uplift= A central theme in the novel concerns the project of Racial Uplift within the African-American and Black community. Liliane's social standing within an upper middle class prominent Black family seemingly conforms to the model of racial uplift promoted by figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who advocated for the instruction of Liberal Arts education to Black people in the United States in order to create a leadership elite often referred to as the Talented Tenth.Lomotey, pp. 355–356. Liliane's father, a prominent Black judge, is highly invested in maintaining the image of his family as a part of that leadership elite. However, Liliane's contact and social relations with Black individuals who are outside of her own class seemingly problematizes this philosophical project to a certain extent. =Mother–daughter relationships= The broken relationship between Liliane and her mother, Sunday \\"S.\\" Bliss operates in the novel as a point of deep internal conflict in Liliane's life. Early on in Liliane's life, Sunday Bliss serves as a role model to Liliane, however, after Sunday \\"S.\\" Bliss has an affair and marries a white man, Liliane's father, ashamed of his wife's choice to pursue her own happiness over the project of racial uplift, lies to Liliane telling her that her mother is dead. Unable to reconcile her adoration of her mother with her mother's sudden and unexplained absence in her life, Liliane develops a sense of self that is fragmented and, at times, deeply conflicted. Once Liliane recognizes that her mother is, in fact, not dead, she is unable to make sense of the fact that her mother would abandon her to pursue a romantic relationship with a white man. =Female sexuality= The exploration of Female Sexuality is featured heavily in the novel. Despite her father's attempts to instill Liliane with a sense of obligation to the project of Racial Uplift, and his encouragement of Liliane to become the wife of someone who has the potential to be a powerful leader in the Black community, Liliane's romantic and sexual relationships are varied, diverse, and bridge interpersonal gaps of both class and race throughout the novel. The novel portrays Liliane as a decisive agent in the context of her sexual relationships. =Psychoanalysis= Liliane is very much emotionally conflicted as a result of her family's past secrets, her desires for herself, and her father's desires for her. Like her mother, Liliane struggles with choosing between honoring herself and the project of Racial Uplift that her father is heavily invested in. Additionally, Liliane is heavily affected by the existential pain of anti-black racism. As a result, Liliane's conversations with her psychoanalyst are often turbulent and disjointed as she struggles to build her sense of self in her transition to adulthood and her growth as a painter. Reception and literary criticism Initial reviews of Liliane: Resurrection of the Daughter were mostly positive. In her New York Times book review, Valerie Sayers characterized the novel as a work that is \\"moving and evocative\\" as well as \\"dense, ambitious\\" and \\"a worthy song\\". Other reviewers have described the novel as somewhat frustrating. In a Booklist review, Donna Seaman writes of Liliane, \\"You admire it, learn from it, desire it, and resist it all at the same time.\\" While little critical scholarship of Liliane exists, Ntozake Shange has spoken about the novel in interviews that have been featured in literary journals, including an interview published in Black American Literature Forum, in which Shange remarks of Liliane's character as a woman who, \\"goes all over the world, and all over the world she is confronted with sexism\\".

Plot A mysterious object plummets to Earth, sending out a shock wave that causes five strangers to die, only to miraculously come back to life moments later. The members of the group are Vera (Shantel VanSanten), a struggling radio-astronomer living in New Mexico who is searching for her missing son; Erin (Sofia Black-D'Elia), a young mother in Tucson, Arizona who is desperate to protect her seven-year-old daughter Amy from her abusive policeman ex-husband; Peter (Joel Courtney), a troubled high school student and orphan in Little Rock, Arkansas; Raul (J.D. Pardo), a federal agent in Mexico who is looking to escape his dangerous and violent undercover assignment; and Joshua (Jon Fletcher), a charismatic second-generation televangelist in Houston, Texas. Most mysterious of all is the figure known only as The Man (Diogo Morgado), who offers Vera the location of her abducted son if she will help him with one morally complicated task which puts her on a collision course with Rose (Anna Diop), a nurse in Houston who has been in a coma for seven years after being shot by an unknown hitman. Drawn together by fate and biblical prophecy, \\"The Messengers\\" soon learn they now have supernatural gifts that might be the only hope for preventing the impending Rapture. Cast and characters =The Messengers= The main characters of the series are the Messengers (real term: \\"Angels of the Apocalypse\\"), a group of ordinary humans chosen by God to determine if humanity is worth saving. They are hit by an energy wave from the meteorite that brought The Man to earth, which causes them to die for a few minutes. Then they awaken with strange supernatural abilities denominated as \\"gifts\\". However, their gifts have side-effects on their bodies unless the seven true Messengers are united. *Shantel VanSanten as Vera Buckley :An emotionally and financially struggling radio-astronomer who is searching for her missing son, Michael, who was kidnapped seven years earlier. After finding out her ex- boyfriend (and Michael's father), Leo Travers, carries a genetic disease, which was the reason he broke up with her, Vera decides to tell him about their kidnapped son's existence, rekindling their relationship. :Gift: spirit- walking; side-effect: If her spirit doesn't return to her body in a short time, her body dies. *J. D. Pardo as Raul Garcia :A former drug courier who became a US Federal agent to bring down the Mexican drug cartel he worked for.

He also develops an interest in Raul's niece, Nadia. :Gift: super strength; side-effect: emotional instability. *Jon Fletcher as Joshua Silburn Jr. :A second-generation televangelist preacher and recovered addict who struggles to find his place in the world. After he realized that his wife cheated on him with his own father (Silburn, Snr.) which makes him the possible father of her baby, Joshua leaves in anger and meets the rest of the Messengers on the way. By the end, he is the only one aware of Erin's daughter, Amy and her true self as the Antichrist. :Gift: Having psychic visions of the future; side-effect: seizures. *Sofia Black-D'Elia as Erin Calder :A young woman trying to make a new life for herself and daughter after fleeing from her abusive and controlling husband, who is a policeman, but what she doesn't know is that her own daughter is in fact the new Antichrist, the Devil's daughter.

She has been watching over the new team's activities, and she has her suspicions about Rose's activity and intentions (by deducing she is a Horseman). She is later killed by the Fairburns under the Devil's orders because she refused to tell him how the antichrist can be destroyed. :Former gift: visions (currently Joshua's gift). *Brittany O'Grady as Nadia Garcia :Raul's daughter, who she blames for her legal father's (Raul's brother, Cesar) death, especially after she found out that Raul was having an affair with her mother, Gabriela. *Justin Bruening as Leo Travers :A research scientist who dated Vera while they were attending the same university and is Michael's father.

Four Horsemen Every generation there are four people who commit a grievous sin and are assigned to become the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Rose Arvale, the Horseman of Death, is the leader of the current generation, and they want to use The Man's meteorite as their ultimate weapon for the end of humanity. In contrast to the angel Messengers, the Horsemen immediately become aware of their powers upon a seal being broken as well as their destiny, and about each other's identity. It is also implied that all four of them are telepathic (only to each other) and can read each other's minds. *Anna Diop as Rose Arvale :A former nurse whose experience during war turned her into a cold-blood murderer with psychotic tendencies. Back from war, she started killing ill patients as an act of mercy while having an affair with a married doctor until he ended the affair to return to his wife. Feeling jealous, Rose killed the doctor's wife and kept her ring as a souvenir, completing her transformation into the Horseman of Death. Rose then decided to pose as and become the de facto leader of the Messengers as a ruse to find the other Horsemen of the Apocalypse with their help. She shelters the Messengers at a foreclosed house and uses a local eatery/bar entitled \\"The Last Supper Bar-Grill\\" as their base of operations. After she shows her true colors by killing Joshua, he is later resurrected by the Devil himself. :Abilities: use of dark magic; speaking and understanding any language (e.g. the language of the dead) *Lauren Bowles as Cindy Richards :Chosen as the Horseman of War, she is a Senator with an immense resentment against Afghanistan after her son was killed while serving in the Armed Forces. *Sam Littlefield as Leland Schiller :Chosen as the Horseman of Pestilence, he is the leader of a hacking group called \\"Abaddon\\", who wants revenge against an insurance company for denying medical treatment for his ill mother. His plan (which involved killing many innocent people) was stopped once by the Messengers, but he was later released from prison by Rose so he could choose to complete his plan, thus breaking his seal. *Riley Smith as Mark Plowman :Chosen as the Horseman of Famine, he is initially one of the chairmen of an agricultural company. He cares about the field and his workers, unlike his charismatic and unscrupulous brother Vincent, towards whom he a harbors deep resentment. It turns out that both brothers were set up as potential Horsemen of Famine, but Mark is chosen in the end when he kills his brother out of that resentment and thus (like the other three Horsemen) instantly loses his humanity and joins the Horsemen's cause. =Others= *Robb Moon as the patron of the \\"Last Supper Bar and Grill\\". *Lexi Atkins as Alice, a student who attends Peter's school. *Katy Rowe as Charlotte Silburn, Joshua Jr.'s wife who is pregnant with his child despite having a short affair with her father- in-law, Joshua Snr. *Bernardo Saracino as Cesar Garcia, Raul's brother, Gabriela's husband and Nadia's legal father. *Loren Escandon as Gabriela Garcia, Cesar's widowed wife who has an extramarital affair with his brother Raul, conceiving their daughter Nadia. *Navid Negahban as the Prime Minister of Afghanistan, Senator Richards' target during her attempted assassination. *Hannah Marshall as Hope Silburn, Joshua Jr.'s sister whose father discarded her after she came out as a lesbian. *Roberta Isgreen as Margaret Schiller, Leland's late mother. *J.B.

She is a member of the Choctaw Nation. Early life and education Summer Wesley was born and raised in rural Southeastern Oklahoma and is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation. She attended school in the small town of Rattan, graduating high school a year early, in 1998. Wesley earned four degrees from the University of Oklahoma: A Bachelor of Liberal Studies (2005), a master's in Administrative Leadership (2008), during which time she also completed the course requirements for a master's in Interprofessional Health & Human Services. She completed her Juris Doctor and Master of Arts in Native American Studies as part of a dual-degree program. Additionally, Wesley received a Certificate in American Indian Law.  Writing  Wesley began writing early, publishing poetry while in her teens. During law school, Wesley spent a semester as a writer for the Oklahoma Journal of Law & Technology (OKJOLT) and was on OKJOLT's 2012–13 board of editors. Her published Master's thesis, \\"Trademarking Tradition: Intellectual Property and Native American Tribes\\" is deposited in the University of Oklahoma's Bizzell Library. Career In 2012, Wesley interned at Oklahoma Indian Legal Services,http://oilsonline.org where she developed her skills in Federal Indian Law and the Indian Child Welfare Act. Since graduating law school, Wesley has been an advocate for Indian Country and has represented clients in tribal courts.  Activism Prior to attending law school, Wesley was active as a volunteer, frequently speaking to Scout groups about racism and stereotypical representations of Native Americans in popular culture. In addition to her professional work representing Native Americans, Wesley has become an activist on several issues affecting her people. She has taken part in campaigns to eliminate race-based mascots for sports teams, as well as advocating for positive representations of Indigenous peoples. Wesley is often quoted by her social media name of \\"Chahta Summer.\\" She was featured in the National Congress of American Indian's 2014 #ProudToBe project. In August 2014, Wesley criticized the Choctaw Nation's inviting Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin to participate in their annual Labor Day Festival, stating: \\"Mary Fallin has demonstrated to not be an ally to Native tribes, yet has been chosen to not only appear at Choctaw Fest, but to unveil a statue in honor of our women . . .As a Choctaw woman, I am appalled that she is being given a platform for her insincere pandering and her participation in the unveiling causes the statue to lose all honor to me. Further, I think this sends the wrong message to Indian Country regarding the Choctaw Nation's priorities and loyalties. Fallin's participation implies that our Nation condones her anti- Native policies.\\" As a result of the social media protests, the tribe pulled its announcement about the Fallin appearance from its website and all mention of the appearance was removed from Fallin's social media accounts. In the end, Fallin made an appearance at the festival to sign a tribal tag compact, and left without participating in the honors she had previously been invited to. Days later, Wesley commented on the poor taste of Oklahoma State University students who made a banner with a flip reference to the Trail of Tears. In September 2014 Wesley was quoted as criticizing Governor Fallin for cancelling a second scheduled meeting with the mother of Mah-Hi-Vist (Redbird) Goodblanket, a young Cheyenne Arapaho man who had been killed by police. Reporters found that Fallin staged a media event instead. Wesley was among Native American activists who expressed the belief that the Governor was sending \\"the message that the issue holds no importance to her. Indian Country had long felt that she is no ally, but this is a bigger issue. Police brutality affects all communities...\\" In November 2014, Wesley used social media to report on the federal trial of Jason Merida, former Executive Director of the Choctaw Nation, who was convicted on all but one charge of counts of embezzlement of tribal funds and corruption. She criticized the media for not covering the trial adequately, leaving tribal citizens unaware of the serious case. She coined the hashtag #ChoctawCorruptionTrial and posted updates to various sites. Also in November 2014, Wesley spoke out in support of three young rape victims from Norman, Oklahoma. They left school after being bullied following reporting the attacks on them. Wesley was quite vocal in her support of the Oklahoma City Public School's decisions to end land run reenactments, as well as the board's vote to eliminate the \\"redskins\\" mascot used by Capital Hill High School. Wesley live-tweeted meetings on the topic and her account of a community educational forum on the topic was published.

The play opened off-Broadway in 1964 and won the Obie Award for Distinguished Play. The play shared this award with Amiri Baraka's Dutchman, and was influenced by both the Black Arts Movement and the Theater of the Absurd.Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African-American Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. Print. While the play has been produced on stage numerous times, it has been more frequently studied in academic settings than it has been produced.  Summary  The play tells the story of a young woman named Sarah living in New York City, and focuses on Sarah's internal struggle with her racial identity. She spends much of the play grappling with her feelings about her mixed ancestry; she idolizes her white mother and despises her black father. To demonstrate this internal struggle, Kennedy transforms the stage into a manifestation of Sarah's mind and uses historical figures to represent Sarah's mixed black and white ancestry. These characters are manifestations of Sarah's self, and include Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Hapsburg, Patrice Lumumba, and Jesus Christ. The play was written during the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, which had a strong masculine element. Kennedy's female perspective was a rarity for the time and the movement. Funnyhouse of a Negro takes place in Sarah’s mind, allowing the audience to witness the anxiety, entrapment, and alienation of being a black woman in the United States. Kennedy focuses on the obsession with whiteness and the struggle of mixed ancestry, and the audience ultimately witnesses the complete fragmentation of Sarah’s self.  Plot  The play opens with a dreamlike sequence of a woman in a white nightgown with long, dark hair crossing the stage. The woman, who the audience later learns is Sarah's mother, carries a bald head in her hands. A white curtain opens, revealing Sarah's bedroom. The play takes place in Sarah's mind, with her room as a symbol for her obsession with whiteness. The white statue of Queen Victoria on the stage is a symbol of whiteness. The first scene is between Queen Victoria and the Duchess of Hapsburg, with Sarah's room representing the Queen's chambers. This gives the audience an understanding of the permeability of the set, as it constantly takes on new forms for its various inhabitants. The two women discuss whiteness, with the Queen stating, \\"My mother was the light. She was the lightest one. She looked like a white woman.\\" Their conversation is not their own words, but the words of Sarah. The Queen and Duchess embody Anglo-American culture and are a manifestation of Sarah's white self. The conversation between the Queen and Duchess is interrupted by the woman from the opening sequence's knocking and yelling about how she should have never let a black man touch her. This is how we first learn of Sarah's hatred towards her black father. The scene shifts into one of Sarah's monologues, and ends with a comment from the landlady, who is one of the few characters who exists outside of Sarah's mind and therefore one of the few manifestations of reality in the play. The landlady helps the audience to understand Sarah's situation, explaining how her father killed himself when Patrice Lumumba was killed. The landlady says that Sarah hasn't left her room since her father's death, and that Sarah claims her father did not actually hang himself, but rather, she \\"bludgeoned his head with an ebony skull that he carries about with him. Wherever he goes, he carries black masks and heads.\\" The scene ends with the landlady's comments about how Sarah's hair has fallen out and how she always knew that Sarah wanted to be someone else. This scene introduces us to the motif of hair, which recurs throughout the play. There is also a persistent knocking sound in the background for the rest of the play, representing the father's attempts to return to Sarah's life. The next scene is between the Duchess and Raymond, the funnyman of the funnyhouse. The two characters discuss the Duchess' father, who is actually Sarah's father, as the Duchess is an extension of Sarah. They call the father a \\"wild beast\\" who raped Sarah's mother, and compare his blackness to the mother's whiteness. Finally, the Duchess reveals that the mother is currently in an asylum and is completely bald; this explains the significance of the opening sequence of the play. The audience also learns that the Duchess' hair is falling out; this implies that Sarah's hair is falling out, because her white self cannot coexist with her black self. The next scene contains a speech by Lumumba, a manifestation of Sarah's black self. His character is unknown to the audience, and he holds a mask in his hands. The speech discusses how Sarah is haunted by her bald mother in her sleep, blaming Sarah's father for her plight into insanity, saying, \\"Black man, black man, my mother says, I never should have let a black man put his hands on me.\\" The next scene begins with a movement sequence between the Duchess and Queen, in which they discover that the Queen's hair has fallen out on her pillow, and the Duchess tries to place hair back onto her head. As they continue to pantomime, Lumumba's character returns for another monologue, in which he gives more information about Sarah's life. The audience learns that Sarah is a student at a city college in New York, and that she dreams of being surrounded by European antiques and having white friends. He also explains that Sarah's black father was given mixed messages about his identity by his parents. His mother wanted him to go to Africa and save the race, while his father told him that \\"the race was no damn good.\\" Lumumba's speech ends with the claim that Sarah's father tried to hang himself in a Harlem hotel, but leaves ambiguity as to whether the suicide was successful. The next scene is between the Duchess and Jesus in the Duchess' palace. They are both bald, and express their fear surrounding the loss of hair. The scene begins with a movement sequence between the Duchess and Jesus, similar to that between the Duchess and the Queen, in which the two characters sit on a bench, attempting to brush the shreds of hair left on their heads. When they speak, they discuss how the father won't leave them alone. The landlady enters and tells a story about how Sarah's father asked her for forgiveness for being black, and she would not give him forgiveness. The scene ends with Jesus telling the Duchess that he plans to go to Africa to kill Patrice Lumumba. The next scene takes place in a jungle, which covers the entire stage, while Sarah's bedroom remains in the background. Jesus appears, surrounded by the rest of the characters, all with nimbuses on their heads \\"in a manner to suggest that they are saviors\\". The group speaks in unison about how they believed their father to be God, but he is black. They speak of how his darkness killed the lightness, or Sarah's mother, and haunted Sarah's conception. Finally, they say that they are bound to the father unless he dies. They all rush to the grass in unison and repeat their chants, as the mother enters. They enact a conversation between Sarah and her father, in which he seeks forgiveness for being black, and Sarah asks him why he raped her mother then states how she wants to \\"bludgeon him with an ebony head.\\" All of the characters run around the stage laughing and screaming until the blackout. As the final scene begins, a new wall drops onto stage. A white statue of Queen Victoria acts as the representation of Sarah's room. Sarah appears in the light, \\"standing perfectly still, we hear the KNOCKING, the LIGHTS come on quickly, her FATHER'S black figure with bludgeoned hands rushes upon her, the LIGHT GOES BLACK and we see her hanging in the room.\\" The landlady and Raymond enter, noticing Sarah's hanging body. The landlady remarks on the sadness of Sarah's situation, when Raymond says, \\"She was a funny little liar.\\" He then says that her father never actually hanged himself, but rather, he is a doctor and married to a white woman, living the life that Sarah dreamed of having.  Symbolism  The funnyhouse Kennedy addresses in Funnyhouse of a Negro is the madhouse of racism. Sarah is torn between the paradoxes of black and white, past and present, flesh and spirit. The play also dramatizes the sexual economy of racism that constructs blacks as hypersexual and culturally deficient. Additionally, Funnyhouse of a Negro demonstrates global citizenship from multiple perspectives: as Africans, as Americans, as women, and as women of color. At the time the play was written, there was a theme among black playwrights addressing a newly awakened social consciousness manifested in a movement to sustain or rebuild ties with Africa. Kennedy's play seeks to deconstruct and disempower \\"thing white thing\\" by showing audiences haunting and perverse images of whiteness. Kennedy uses whiteface to interrogate perceptions of whiteness, a signifying strategy. Kennedy references blackface by using transracial mimicry. She revises the meaning of minstrelsy through enactment of white, rather than black, representation. The skin tone is envisioned as \\"whitish yellow\\" or \\"alabaster\\", illustrating that \\"pure whiteness\\" is a myth. Through Sarah is in whiteface, her \\"wild kinky hair\\" is highlighted, reminding the audience of who is beneath the mask. This is also a reminder of the miscegenated reality of blacks and whites in America. Additionally, the Queen and Duchess symbolize power, but are used to de-romanticize idealized perceptions of whiteness. They are white, but both have \\"kinky hair\\", demonstrating Sarah's identity conflict.Petrusso, A. \\"Overview of 'Funnyhouse of a Negro'.\\" Drama for Students. Ed. Ira Mark Milne. Vol. 9.

The only facts given about Sarah are that she is studying English at a city college in New York, works as a librarian, and lives in a brownstone in the West 90s of Manhattan, and that her mother was white and her father was black. She spends the play confronting her multiracial identity, trying to latch onto her whiteness but failing to escape her blackness. The Duchess of Hapsburg, Queen Victoria, Jesus, and Patrice Lumumba all act as manifestations of Sarah's self. * Duchess of Hapsburg (one of herselves): The Duchess of Hapsburg represents Sarah's racist subconscious, as her character is an emblem of European colonialism. She is also a manifestation of Sarah's desired sexuality. She is romantically involved with Jesus in the play, and spends most of her time on stage in the Queen's chambers. She loses almost all of her hair throughout the play. Her character has traditionally been played by a black woman wearing a white mask. Additionally, the Duchess of Hapsburg's personal history echoes the Sarah's mental condition. In 1864, Napoleon III appointed Carlota and her husband, Austrian Archduke Maximillian, to the Mexican throne. They were left penniless and powerless against Mexican revolutionaries. During her reign, the Duchess began to display signs of mental illness, which eventually descended into schizophrenia. Her husband was tried for treason and executed by revolutionaries, while Carlota was banished to the family's castle. Her story was portrayed in the 1939 film Juarez, which provided inspiration for Kennedy. * Queen Victoria Regina (one of herselves): Queen Victoria Regina represents Sarah's obsession with whiteness and her repressed sexuality. Her character also lives on stage in the form of a statue. Like the Duchess of Hapsburg, she is an emblem of European colonialism. She is portrayed in the same manner as the Duchess, played by a black woman with a white mask. She also loses her hair throughout the course of the play. Historically, Queen Victoria was the queen of England from 1837 to 1901 and the empress of India from 1876 to 1901. Queen Victoria exemplifies the height of British colonial rule and the fragile life of a royal figure. She was a symbolic, rather than political, leader. She suffered familial distress and depression during her reign. The Queen's life symbolizes another form of masking. It is a mask of power that obscured the weakness of a constitutional monarchy. * Jesus (one of herselves): Jesus, traditionally depicted as an emblem for Christianity, represents Sarah's disdain for her father. However, Kennedy's Jesus rebukes modern representations of a white, beautified Jesus. He is traditionally portrayed on stage by a black actor with either a white mask or painted yellow skin. Jesus is described as a \\"dwarf, dressed in white rags and sandals\\". He leads the selves into the jungle to kill Lumumba and also loses his hair throughout the course of the play. As a historical figure known for his martyrdom, Jesus's character is an integral element in the play's confrontation of racial identity and sacrifice. This character also challenges notions around Christianity's holiness. Kennedy's Jesus violates an insistence on binary constructs like good-evil, white-black, and normal-abnormal, an embodiment of dichotomies which addresses the problematic role of Christianity in the lives of the enslaved and colonized. While Christianity symbolizes comfort and liberation, it is also a source of persecution and oppression. Jesus also represents Sarah's feelings about herself: stunted, deformed, and needy. He is the last of Sarah's inner selves to lose his hair, sealing her fate. * Patrice Lumumba (one of herselves): Patrice Lumumba represents Sarah's self-hatred and is also a manifestation of Sarah's father. He carries an ebony mask throughout the play, alluding to African tradition. He also loses his hair throughout the course of the play; Lumumba reveals the secret to hair within the play. He proclaims, \\"For if I did not despise myself then my hair would not have fallen. Historically, Patrice Lumumba was the Prime Minister of the Republic of Congo from June 1960 to December 1960. He was executed by a firing squad, and both the United States and United Kingdom have been accused for conspiring in his murder. He was an activist for independence. With a death so influenced by imperialism, he is the opposite of Queen Victoria and the Duchess, who embody imperialism. * Sarah's landlady (funnyhouse lady/Mrs. Conrad): The landlady is a white woman who runs Sarah's boarding house, and is one of the only two characters to exist in the reality of the play. She delivers monologues about Sarah's life, making her crucial for the audience, as she is one of the few characters who offers an objective view of Sarah. She discovers Sarah's body at the end of the play. * Raymond (funnyhouse man): Raymond lives in the boarding house with Sarah, and she calls him her boyfriend. Raymond is a white, Jewish young man. Raymond likes Sarah because of her race, which upsets her. Sarah asserts, \\"I would like to lie and say I love Raymond. But I do not. He is very interested in Negroes\\". He is the only other character to exist in an objective reality, along with the landlady. He is with the landlady at the end of the play when she discovers Sarah's body, and ends the play by saying that her father never actually committed suicide. He also appears in the play as the funnyhouse man with the Duchess, revealing the role he plays in Sarah's subconscious. * The mother: While Sarah's mother is never formally introduced in the play, she appears in the opening dreamlike sequence, as well as two other scenes in which she yells about being raped by Sarah's black father, claiming that she should have never let a black man touch her. Her mother represents all that is good and a victim of \\"blackness\\". The landlady reveals that the mother has lost all of her hair and lives in an insane asylum; she also haunts Sarah in her nightmares.  Themes  Funnyhouse of a Negro addresses the themes of racial identity and mixed ancestry, as seen through the four manifestations of Sarah's self. The play's lack of plot and surrealistic elements are influenced by various artistic movements of the time. The play uses masks, hair, and its set and props to evoke the mixed cultures being represented. By casting the white characters with black actors, Kennedy utilizes a form of reverse minstrelsy to represent Sarah's racial identity crisis. Obsession with whiteness is also prominent in the play. Aside from the fact that her other selves are a ghostly white color, the way Sarah worships her mother for her light skin and long hair points to an obsession with whiteness. She states within the play that the only \\"acceptable\\" part of her is her yellow skin. This also ties into Sarah's obsession with her hair. Her hair is curly and wild, prominently showcasing her blackness. This may be a reason why Sarah, her mother, and Sarah's other selves all lose their hair in the play. Sarah’s need to meet the white standards of society and not have black features overtakes her life and is the driving force behind her thoughts and actions. Sarah's selves include both female and male characters, representing her internal divide not only between blackness and whiteness, but between femininity and masculinity. This helps relay the theme of both mental and literal imperialism in the play, as Sarah's mind and body are violated by foreign elements. The female fragments of Sarah's self are white European elegance and royalty, while the black fragments of herself are masculine martyrs. By contrasting Sarah's multiple genders and races, Kennedy adds complexity to Sarah's conflicting racial identity. The theme of death is also prominent in the play. All of Sarah's selves are dead historical figures, and Sarah is haunted by the image of her father's death and mother's plight into insanity. Sarah also reveals her desire to kill her father, also seeking to kill the blackness inside of her. The father is portrayed in a way in which his touch is fatal, driving Sarah's mother to lose her sanity and ultimately driving Sarah to her own suicide. The opening sequence of the play presents deathly imagery, as the white curtain is described as being made of \\"a cheap material and a ghastly white, a material that brings to mind the interior of a cheap casket.\\" Sexuality is not prevalent in the play, as Sarah is repulsed by and fears to form any sort of union with her father. She expresses fear of being raped by her father because she believes he raped her mother. As the product of rape, Sarah's view of healthy sexual relationships is very stunted. Sexuality reveals itself through the Duchess and Jesus' interactions, as well as her interaction with Sarah's boyfriend, Raymond. The Duchess acts as the ultimate expression of Sarah's sexuality. Hair is another important theme in Funnyhouse of a Negro. Hair defines the characters and illustrates Sarah's fate. Sarah's \\"wild kinky hair\\" is the only part of her physicality that identifies her as black. Her hair underscores the idea Sarah tried to disavow, then kill, the African-American part of her heritage.  Psychological aspects  Funnyhouse of the Negro demonstrates how a person can be emotionally and mentally damaged by something that didn’t directly involve them. Sarah experiences self-hatred because of her blackness and what it represents in her life: her father; the man who raped her mother. The fact that Sarah's father kills himself because of her rejection serves to damage her further. The effect of having nobody to support her or tell her the truth of what happened between her mother and father (the end of the play implies that the story Sarah knew may not have been true) causes her to create multiple versions of herself to make sense of what was happening. To pathologize Sarah's experience in the play, both multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia seem possible. The audience can’t tell whether she’s speaking out loud when she interacts with these characters, which would differentiate those two disorders. It's hard to distinguish whether or not the audience is experiencing the play through her head or if it's happening in the real world. Either way, Sarah has mental and emotional issues that ultimately lead to her death.

Kennedy contributed her female voice to this movement by using the tactics of artists involved in the movement, such as reinventing language and forms, and by representing the experiences of black womenn. After Funnyhouse of a Negro won the Obie Award for Distinguished Play in 1964, Kennedy's work gained force not only within the Black Arts Movement but also among aspiring black female playwrights. Ntozake Shange, Aishah Rahman, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Robbie McCauley were all influenced by Kennedy. Critics have noted that Kennedy's plays, specifically Funnyhouse of a Negro and its successor, The Owl Answers, offer \\"a plea for a more compassionate relationship between men and women in the black community,\\" but the play also \\"urges black women artists to chart their own course — if necessary, even without approval from black male artists.\\" Kennedy’s play shows the vulnerability of the black woman, an experience that is still rarely represented in art and media. The play shows how black women suffer from their circumstances and that they are also susceptible to mental instability. Funnyhouse of a Negro encourages the audience to see black woman separately from the stereotypical independent black woman.

Williams (born 1952) is an American feminist legal scholar whose work focuses on issues faced by women in the workplace. She currently serves as the Founding Director at the Center for WorkLife Law. Williams is also a Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California, Hastings School Law. Williams also contributes to the Harvard Business Review blog, the Huffington Post, and the Psychology Today blog. Education Williams received a B.A. in history from Yale, a master's degree in City Planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School. Women in the workplace The primary focus of Williams's work has been gender inequality in the workplace and the lack of women in leadership positions. She looks at how gender roles and expectations influence career success of both women and men. Her main arguments focus on the need for both men and women's roles to be redefined in order to allow for greater gender equality in the workforce. In Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What To Do About It, winner of the 2000 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award, she argues that in order for there to be equal opportunity for men and women in the workplace, not only must women be freed from their traditionally exclusive responsibility for child-rearing, housekeeping, and other domestic duties; but that men need to be freed from the burden of their traditionally exclusive role as breadwinner. In her latest book What Works for Women at Work: Four Patterns Working Women Need to Know, co-authored with her daughter Rachel Dempsey, she identifies four particular obstacles that women face: # The pressure for women to constantly prove their competence at work. # The need for women to find the right balance between masculinity and femininity in the workplace. # The long-discussed issue of mothers balancing responsibilities at home and work. # The idea that women's strategies for solving these issues vary and they often feel compelled to argue for their way and against the ways of other women. Center for Work Life Law The Center for Work Life Law was founded by Williams with the goal of creating new initiatives that would help women to succeed in the workplace, which she identified as having stalled, as women's involvement in the workplace hit a plateau in the 1990s. The Center aims to create concrete and permanent solutions to many of the problems faced by women. Much of the work done attempts to marry research with policy in order to change attitudes towards working women, creating new methods for women to become leaders, and also integrates and acknowledges that gender attitudes need to change for men, as well. To date, Williams and her colleagues have succeeded in formulating new best practices, legal theories, policies, and even a framework for performance evaluations that integrates research on gender issues in the workplace. The Center for Work Life Law also has a series of initiatives and workshops aimed at providing women with skills and support in order to become leaders in their workplaces and also provides companies and organizations with information and training on how to create an environment that allows for women to advance. Additionally, their Gender Bias Learning Project works with universities to retain women in STEM programs.

Life Ivan Pavle and his brothers Matej and Slavomír grew up in a mining town Prievidza where his parents Matej Pavle and Alžbeta Pavleová moved from southern Slovakia. In 1970, Ivan Pavle successfully completed primary school in Prievidza. After graduating from high school of engineering in Tvrdošín, Pavle went to study fine art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bratislava and became a student of professors Dezider Castiglione and Ivan Vychlopen. While studying he married a classmate Soňa Oravcová, with whom he has two children. Pavle graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in 1981 and since then he has been pursuing a career of an artist devoted to painting, drawing, graphics and sculpture.  Style and methods  Ivan Pavle systematically refers to several thematic fields. Figurative painting, nudes, torso and faces covered by masks characterise Pavle’s paintings and drawings. The representation of human body is further reinforced by emphasising the gestures, body shapes in motion and relationship studies of two and more characters. A long term cycle Madon is not only an attempt to cope with one of the basic themes of the large painting of the past, but also highlights artist‘s intimate intention to explore the world around him. Another major and repeatedly depicted theme in Pavle’s work concerns mythology, which is implemented in a never ending cycle of paintings about Babylon, as well as in other art pieces – fictitious landscapes and mysterious characters with animal features. His work is noted for its intensity and distinctive style. Furthermore, Pavle‘s interest to cherish the legacy of the finest artworks of the past encourage him to apply obsolete techniques in a combination with his own specific artistic processes. His extensive work combines knowledge of tradition and respect for the material while also focusing on contemporary content.  Exhibitions and awards Pavle‘s works have been exhibited in prestigious Slovak and foreign galleries in Poland, Germany, Netherlands, Austria, France, Monaco, Italy, Thailand and the USA. In order to broaden up his artistic perception the artist attended numerous creative workshops, mainly in the USA and France, where he was awarded with the Jury Prize at the International Festival of Painting in Cagnes sur Mer in 1989. His monumental and intimate works are represented in many galleries and private collections around the world. * 1985 Turčianske múzeum A.

She was the head designer at J&R; Lamb Studios for more than four decades, and created notable commissions for the Tuskegee Institute Chapel and for chapels at the United States Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune, among others.  Early life  Katharine Lamb was born on June 3, 1895, to Charles Rollinson Lamb and Ella Condie Lamb in Alpine, New Jersey. Charles was an architect and designer, and was president of J&R; Lamb Studios and the Stained Glass Association of America. Ella was an award-winning artist and stained glass designer. From a young age, Katharine was influenced by her artistic parents. Tait attended the Friends Seminary in New York City, graduating in 1912. She studied at a number of art and design schools, including the Art Students League of New York, Columbia College, the National Academy Museum and School, and Cooper Union. She taught at the latter from 1922 until 1926. Her first commercial work as an artist was for the Fleishman Company in New York City, where she was employed in the advertising department.  Career  Design drawing for the Froelich Memorial Window in the Newark Museum by Katherine Lamb Tait, J&R; Lamb Studios, c. 1927. In 1921, Tait joined her family's company, J&R; Lamb Studios. She designed stained glass windows, mosaics, and other ecclesiastical art, including altar crosses, candlesticks, stone lettering, and woodwork for choir stalls and pulpits. Her work was influenced by trips to France, England, and Italy, and the medieval stained glass she saw in cathedrals there. Tait married Trevor S. Tait in November 1925. Together they had four children: Barrie, Robin, Colin, and Kevin. During this time, Tait continued occasionally designing from home. One of her major commissions from this period was for the Singing Window in the Tuskegee Institute Chapel in Alabama. The window, completed in 1932, illustrated eleven spirituals, including \\"Go Down Moses,\\" \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,\\" and \\"Deep River.\\" Tait became the head designer at J&R; Lamb Studios in 1936, and soon returned to working full-time. In 1945, her award-winning designs led to the firm receiving a commission from the United States Marine Corps. Lamb Studios was to create a number of windows for the Protestant and Catholic Chapels at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Although Tait's work won them the commission, the company did not reveal that a woman would be designing the windows until after details were finalized. Tait designed both sets of windows over the course of almost two years. Her work was praised by the Marine Corps, and she received letters of thanks from then-Commandant Robert H. Barrow and Major General David B. Barker (Commanding General, Camp Lejeune). During her career, Tait was a member of a number of professional organizations, including the Stained Glass Association of America, the National Society of Mural Painters, and the National Arts Club. She continued to work full-time as the head designer until 1979, and was the last member of the Lamb family to work at the firm. She designed more than 1,000 commissions over the course of her career. On August 11, 1981, Tait died at the age of 86 in Cresskill, New Jersey.  Selected works  *Arts Education, Hugo B.

They had no common bond, apart from their military service with the British Army and their typical British upper class Victorian upbringing, and were so dissimilar in character and moral beliefs as to be quite incomprehensible to each other. Within a month of their departure from Mombasa on the East African coast into the unknown interior of Kenya the two men were barely speaking. The repressed and racially bigoted Speke felt that Burton was a lackadaisical wastrel, more interested in whoring and passing the time with natives and Arab traders than in the enterprise at hand and Burton believed the dyslexic Speke to be stupid and incompetent, unable even to learn how to use simple measuring devices, vital to serious exploration. Despite these obvious drawbacks however, it is Speke who eventually discovers Lake Victoria as the source of the Nile, due to Burton falling seriously ill with malaria and having to be left behind in an Arab trading camp. Here their mutual antipathy turns to bitter enmity when Speke, breaking his word to Burton, claims sole credit for the discovery. Unfortunately for Speke his lack of accurate readings and sloppy map making skills lead the scientific world to doubt his word. Speke dies from a self- inflicted gunshot wound shortly before he and Burton were due to take part in a public debate regarding the controversy.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book- reviews/william-harrison-3/burton-and-speke/ Adaptation Mountains of the Moon (1990) was directed by Bob Rafelson and starred Patrick Bergin and Iain Glen.

The book was first published in hardcover by Simon & Schuster and audiobook by Brilliance Audio in July 2011. The title is drawn from those of the magazines, Astounding Science-Fiction, Amazing Stories, and Unknown, for which his main protagonists wrote.Dirda, Michael. \\"Heinlein, Asimov and Hubbard: Stars of a tale stranger than sci-fi.\\" Review in The Washington Post, July 21, 2011, page C2. Plot The story, divided into short, numbered \\"episodes\\" rather than chapters, is presented as a \\"story about Nikola Tesla\\" recounted by Richard Feynman to a group of other Manhattan Project scientists in the wake of World War II. It involves the efforts of a similar think-tank, the Kamikaze Group, to uncover the secret of a rumored \\"super-weapon\\" Tesla had developed before his death, one supposedly responsible for the mysterious Tunguska explosion of 1908. Feynman makes no claims for the tale's veracity, a caution warranted at the end of the book when his informant is revealed to have been pulp writer L. Ron Hubbard, a participant in the novel's events portrayed as a self-promoting, delusional narcissist. Malmont bases the Kamikaze Group on the trio of science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov, who in actual history spent most of the war doing aeronautical engineering research for the U.S. Navy at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard's Naval Air Experimental Station. He portrays them as engaged in a joint project there to develop super-scientific weapons to help the U.S. win the war, though in reality they worked separately on technical improvements to airplanes and weapons systems. Heinlein leads the fictional project, which also draws on the assistance of other pulp authors of his acquaintance, most notably Hubbard, Walter B. Gibson, and Lester Dent, with cameo roles by John W. Campbell, Norvell Page, Hugh B. Cave, Frederik Pohl, Cleve Cartmill, Kurt Vonnegut, Judith Merril, and Ray Bradbury. Additional historical luminaries such as Jack Parsons, Albert Einstein and Jimmy Stewart also put in appearances. After Tesla's mysterious death the military raids his apartment and confiscates his papers, spurred by apparent German interest in his discoveries. Heinlein is charged with investigating the supposed \\"wonder weapon\\" referred to in the papers. Together with de Camp, Asimov, Hubbard and Gibson he explores a sub- basement of the Empire State Building where Tesla had left some of his equipment, and is almost trapped there by an unknown adversary. Further inquiries take the core group to the former site of Wardenclyffe Tower, the inventor's wireless transmission facility in Shoreham, New York, which apparently doubled as the \\"sending\\" component of the weapon. Afterwards Hubbard is sent first to the Aleutian Islands and then the South Pacific to retrieve the receiver, while Asimov is put in charge of securing the capacitors needed to make the transmitter work. Meanwhile, government goons are investigating the group itself, alarmed by the publication of Cartmill's story \\"Deadline,\\" with its all-too accurate description of a nuclear weapon similar to that being developed by the Manhattan Project. Their brutal interrogation of Heinlein is interrupted by a deadly phone call via which they are somehow electrocuted in the same fashion as Tesla. Matters come to a head as the Kamikaze Group seemingly makes good a promise to \\"make a ship disappear\\" (a nod to the \\"Philadelphia Experiment\\" urban legend), while Heinlein, convinced that time is running out, works with Tesla's ex-assistant at a duplicate of Wardencyffe Tower to make the wonder weapon functional. Once it is activated the assistant reveals himself as the group's prime adversary, and nearly succeeds in killing the group members before falling to his death in the pits beneath the tower. After the villain's defeat the military shuts down the Kamikaze Group. Heinlein is disheartened to discover that his group was conceived and regarded as a mere blind to distract the Axis powers from the U.S.'s real super weapon effort—the Manhattan Project. His assertions of the reality of Tesla's weapon fall on deaf ears. Much later, Hubbard, returning to the U.S. after the war, learns what has become of his former compatriots, encounters Feynman, and tells him the story. Reception Michael Dirda, writing for The Washington Post, feels the novel \\"never quite lives up to its title. It opens slowly, breaks up its narrative among too many different characters and plot lines, and is unpersuasively framed as a story related by physicist Richard Feynman. Frequent comic episodes, some verging on slapstick, don't wholly come off. Nor are the big scenes - involving secret tunnels underneath the Empire State Building or the final showdown at Tesla's Tower - altogether fresh. I couldn't follow much of the science, and Hubbard's feverish dreams reminded me of accounts of bad LSD trips.\\" He concludes, however, that \\"if you're already a fan of any of the writer-heroes of this novel, you'll probably be irresistibly drawn to The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown. And the book does have some good moments. It's almost worth reading just to arrive at the pronouncement: 'Oh my God! . . . You've vaporized Isaac Asimov!'\\" Rege Behe in the Pittsburgh Tribune calls the book \\"humorous and clever, . . . an opus waiting for Hollywood to call.\\" In reference to the book's title he notes that it \\"is all of those things, a joyous romp grounded in the golden age of science and pulp fiction in the 1940s. The author's cast . . . are wonderfully realized.\\"Behe, Rege. \\"Author imagines sci-fi writers in World War II intrigue.\\" Review in the Pittsburgh Tribune, Sunday, July 3, 2011. Paul Di Filippo in The Speculator \\"applaud[s] its vigorous storytelling and historical acumen,\\" calling the book's style \\"by turns analytical, journalistic, affectionate, elegiac, philosophical, and, well, pulpish. [Malmont] reconstructs his characters and their era with historical fidelity and empathy without feeling chained to total textbook accuracy . . . [blending] verisimilitude with outlandish blood-and-thunder action\\" in a \\"seething scrum of high-minded conversation and low-down deeds . . . Malmont plainly has a blast recreating this dangerous, promising era and putting its inhabitants through their larger-than-life paces.\\" Di Filippo does twit the author for his anachronistic use of the term \\"sci-fi,\\" not coined until the late 1950s, but feels that \\"[t]aken all in all, the book delivers both thrills and meditative reflections on the writerly condition.\\"De Filippo, Paul. \\"The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown.\\" Review in The Speculator, July 15, 2011.

The first pressing of the reissued vinyl LP was on translucent pink vinyl, with black to follow. The reissue also included a booklet with essays and remembrances from band members and colleagues, including Steve Wynn of The Dream Syndicate. The booklet also included previously unreleased images by photographer Robert Toren, some of which were featured in Omnivore's promotional video for the release launch. Dan Vallor, as co-producer of the 2014 reissue, supervised the remastering of Blaze of Glory from the original tapes. Vallor wrote that the album \\"remains the wonderfully uncynical pop gem Scott mischievously packaged in a trash bag when it first appeared on vinyl in 1982.\\" According to Vallor, who was Game Theory's tour manager in the 1980s, Miller expressed \\"mixed feelings about his early work. At times he was convinced it was best not revisited, and at other times he appreciated that it could stand on its own. His uncertainty was borne of rigorous standards he set for himself as a writer and as a musician. But his work from the very start shows an unrelenting creative energy rarely matched by his contemporaries.\\"  Songs and thematic notes  In the liner notes of the 2014 reissue, Fred Juhos stated that Blaze of Glory \\"foreshadows Scott's other recordings admirably. Within it, I hear some of Scott's freshest material. It's innocent and contains no hint of the jaded cynicism found in his later work.\\" Harvard professor Stephanie Burt, writing in 2011, considered this album \\"true to the visceral power, the sexual charge, in guitar-based Anglo-American pop\\" while simultaneously exemplifying \\"the wordy awkwardness... of the nerd stereotype.\\" According to Burt's analysis, \\"The songs, and the people depicted in the songs, attempted to have fun, to act on instinct, but they knew they were too cerebral to make it so, except with like-minded small circles of puzzle-solvers.\\" \\"Something to Show,\\" the opening song, was primarily about \\"settling; coming to terms with not getting 'the girl,' and who knows what else,\\" according to Franklin Bruno's analysis in The Pitchfork Review. Taking note of Miller's quietly sung first line, \\"I never wanted to be tough,\\" Bruno commented that toughness \\"doesn't sound like an option,\\" and called the song \\"a strange way to announce a rock 'n' roll career.\\" The song \\"Bad Year at UCLA\\" was intended by Miller to refer instead to his alma mater, U.C. Davis, but the location was altered for the sake of scansion and a better rhyme. At the outset of \\"Sleeping Through Heaven,\\" according to The Big Takeover, Juhos' bass and \\"Nancy Becker's period- appropriate synthesizer chords and countermelodies\\" dominated Miller's \\"hushed voice in the mix,\\" until Miller raised his voice to sing \\"with growing confidence in a way that suggests facing fears and emerging victorious,\\" bringing a defiant edge to the chorus, \\"I want to go bang on every door and say, 'Wake up, you're sleeping through heaven.'\\" Reviews and critical reception AllMusic's Stewart Mason wrote that Blaze of Glory was \\"about as D.I.Y. as it gets.... recorded in leader Scott Miller's old bedroom at his parents' house in Sacramento, CA, and you can just barely hear his mom running the vacuum cleaner downstairs at one point.\\" In 2001's All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music, critic Chris Woodstra called Blaze of Glory \\"a pleasant amalgam of '60s pure pop and the quirkier elements of new wave\\" that \\"only hinted at the band's potential.\\" According to Trouser Press, the album was a \\"promising debut\\" with \\"awfully thin sound and more enthusiasm than skill.\\" Conversely, AllMusic's Stewart Mason wrote in 2002 that despite Blaze of Glory′s \\"extremely inconsistent\\" songwriting and \\"funky homemade feel,\\" the album was a \\"clear signpost towards the hyperactively literate art pop of Game Theory's later albums\\", with \\"a handful of early gems.\\" Mason specifically cited \\"Sleeping Through Heaven\\" as \\"jubilant... a fan favorite\\", as well as \\"Bad Year at UCLA,\\" with its \\"wry collegiate angst\\". Mason also wrote of \\"Date With an Angel\\" as \\"giddy and galloping... one of Miller's sunniest sounding songs,\\" featuring a \\"jangly guitar-led arrangement\\" predating the \\"Paisley Underground-influenced sound of 1985's Real Nighttime.\\" In 2014, prior to the reissue, Omnivore Recordings wrote that Blaze of Glory displayed the origins of the \\"power-pop mixed with new-wave sensibilities\\" for which Game Theory was later to be known, with hints of \\"the upcoming Paisley Underground sound that would take California by storm,\\" According to CMJ, on Blaze of Glory, Miller's \\"primitive electro sounds\\" and jangle pop displayed \\"a wee hint of punk residue, sounding today like a 2014 indie-pop band landing in 1982, mutated, from a Star Trek transporter.\\" Reviewing the 2014 reissue, Blurts Michael Toland described Blaze of Glory as \\"that special kind of debut album – not perfect, perhaps, but boiling over with so many ideas and so much talent it makes you eager to hear where the band goes with the rest of its career.\\" Toland added: According to Wilfully Obscure, the debut \\"charts the slyly esoteric path that Game Theory were poised to venture off on,\\" and \\"boasts some profoundly great signature tunes\\" in a \\"stunning reissue.\\" Jeff Elbel of The Big Takeover described the band's sound as \\"rooted in a propulsive, guitar-based jangle.\\" Elbel praised the album's \\"personal, handmade character\\" and Omnivore's restoration for preserving its \\"low-budget origin\\" with a \\"clean, clear and full-bodied\\" enhancement. While the 2014 remastering may have reinforced \\"certain flaws in the recording and mix,\\" AllMusic's Mark Deming concluded that \\"the best moments sound better than ever.\\" The Vinyl District ranked the album as #9 (tie) in its list of 2014's best reissues. The London music magazine Uncut, in its review of the 2014 reissue, wrote:  Other performances (1987–2014)  \\"Bad Year at UCLA (Reprise),\\" a thirty-second acoustic guitar version of \\"Bad Year at UCLA\\" with Scott Miller humming the vocal melody, appears as a bonus track on the 2014 Blaze of Glory CD reissue. Originally recorded in 1987, the track first appeared as a backward recording on Game Theory's double album Lolita Nation, under the title \\"Turn Me On Dead Man.\\" Game Theory's 2013 reunion show, a memorial tribute to Scott Miller, included performances of \\"Bad Year at UCLA\\" and \\"Sleeping Through Heaven.\\" Since Miller's death, \\"Sleeping Through Heaven\\" has been covered in live performances by Bradley Skaught and The Bye Bye Blackbirds.

The novel, which took eight years to complete, is a story of three Black sisters, whose names give the book its title, and their mother. The family is based in Charleston, South Carolina, and their trade is to spin, weave, and dye cloth; unsurprisingly, this tactile creativity informs the lives of the main characters as well as the style of the writing. Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo integrates the whole of an earlier work by Shange called simply Sassafrass, published in 1977 by Shameless Hussy Press. As is common in Shange's work, the narrative is peppered with interludes that come in the form of letters, recipes, dream stories and journal entires, which provide a more intimate approach to each woman's journey toward self-realization and fulfillment. The book deals with several major themes, including Gullah/Geechee culture, women in the arts, the Black Arts Movement, and spirituality, among many others.  Plot summary  The story starts with Indigo, the youngest daughter of the family, sitting amongst her beloved hand-made dolls, which each have names and personalities that emerge over the course of the novel. Before the reader learns much about the other sisters or mother, Indigo begins menstruating, is gifted an old fiddle by Uncle John, and consequently initiated into a cult-like group of pre- adolescent boys called the Jr. Geechee Captains. Indigo's first section is full of informal mappings, remedies, and tales such as \\"Moon Journeys: cartography by Indigo\\" and \\"To Rid Oneself of the Scent of Evil: by Indigo\\". Soon, some of those cartographies are replaced by recipes as the family prepares for and celebrates Christmas, with the ever-present spirit of Daddy, the girls' father, wafting through their annual traditions. Sassafrass and Cypress are back from school in New England and New York City, respectively, and the reader won't see the four women together again until the very last pages of the book. The reader next meets Sassafrass in Los Angeles, where she lives with Mitch, a struggling and self-destructive jazz saxophonist. Sassafrass is working to find her creative niche, still weaving and cooking, but pining to get to an artists' colony in New Orleans. She eventually leaves Mitch in LA, moving to San Francisco to live with her younger sister Cypress. Sassafrass exists on the periphery of Cypress' bright and full world for some time, planning to dance and write in hopes of regaining herself outside of Mitch's abuse. After a while, Sassafrass returns to LA and Cypress decides to pursue a professional dance career, which eventually lands her back in New York City. There, the middle sister finds community amongst feminist and/or lesbian dance collectives, along with a new way of expressing through her body. Idrina, along with Ixchell, Laura, Celine and others, become important characters in Cypress' image of her self, and after breaking off an intense romantic relationship with Idrina, the dancer found herself unmoving and frequenting late-night dive bars. Coincidentally, in one of those bars Cypress found Leroy McCullough, an old musician friend from San Francisco. After a fateful night together, Cypress and Leroy seemingly reinvigorate each other's creativity, living and loving together until Leroy leaves for a summer European tour. During Leroy's absence, Cypress revisits Idrina and recounts an arguably post-apocalyptic dream where women are punished for childbirth and men are locked away. During that same summer, Cypress joins a dance company that raises money to support the Civil Rights Movement and Leroy asks to marry her before she starts on her first tour with the group. The reader is then taken back into Sassafrass’ world, where she has been living in The New World Found Collective with Mitch for over a year. There, Sassafrass is undergoing the process of initiation into santería as Mitch slips further into a downward spiral. To shake the bad spirit of her man, Sassafrass performs a sort of exorcist as the deity Oshun came into her body and she decides to return home to the South, without Mitch. Finally, the reader re-enters Indigo’s spheres, where she has been studying violin and midwifery in her Charleston town. Sassafrass has come home and is in labor, with Indigo delivering the baby and Cypress and Mama close at hand, coaxing \\"a free child\\" into their world.  Background/style  Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo is set in Charleston, South Carolina, with major influences from the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The Sea Islands, comprising over 100 land masses along the southeastern coast of the United States are home to Gullah culture, sometimes also referred to as Geechee culture. The Gullah represent a unique community of African-descendant Americans; since slaves of various African ethnic groups were brought to the region, they remained relatively isolated from the rest of the contiguous 50 states and developed a distinct culture that included a creolized language and distinguishable africanisms. The slaves brought to the Sea Islands, who were primarily from western Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, cultivated rice, indigo, and cotton on the islands as early as the 17th century. Since then, a culture based on agriculture and featuring several direct links to an African heritage has developed and sustained these communities; their language, use of African names, rice-based cuisine, and reliance on African folktales and craftwork all connect them to the African continent in a way unlike any other region in the United States. Notably, Gullah communities privileges what is often deemed \\"women's work\\" by Western standards — weaving, cooking, and storytelling are all key elements of Gullah life and this female-centered culture greatly inform Shange's feminist writing in the novel. Gullah culture also emphasizes the potential for symbiosis between human life and the natural world, contributing to the important Gullah value of self-sufficiency. The oral and physical knowledge passed down from generation to generation include recipes, remedies, and tales of various natural or supernatural events that both link Gullah culture to Africa and distinguish its isolation within American culture. Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo borrows from these traditions and reflects an emphasis on the role of women in a society’s functioning, particularly through the sharing of recipes and ways of taking care of oneself and others. Gullah culture paired with influences from the Black Arts Movement create the cultural context for the novel (Artistic Expression). Shange employs Gullah culture as a point of departure for understanding these women’s lives in the late 20th century and historicizes their experiences as artists against the backdrop of the Black Arts Movement, which \\"asserted blackness as a countercultural force in opposition to the Eurocentric ideology of white supremacy\\", but often excluded women from its mainstream. In addition, Shange’s reliance on music, particularly jazz, also reflects a harkening back to the Black Arts Movement, where distinctly \\"black\\" forms such as jazz were celebrated. While these influences inform the content of the novel, they are also reflected in Shange’s prose and structural choices, demanding a new kind of reading from her audiences  Key characters  * Indigo: The youngest daughter of the family. Indigo seems to possess a certain magic that is sometimes attributed to \\"the South in her\\". She indicates strong relationships with a spiritual realm through her dolls and her interactions with the natural world. The formation of her character contributes greatly to Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo being read as a magical realist text. * Cypress: Middle daughter. Cypress is a dancer that struggles with the body norms of the white ballet world, but eventually finds herself as an artist amongst more political, modern dance circles. She journeys through lovers across the country and sells drugs for a stint to support herself before marrying Leroy at the end of the book. She especially connects with Mama and those around her through music and food, two important themes in much of Shange's work. * Sassafrass: Eldest daughter. Sassafrass dutifully carries on Mama's tradition of textile weaving, Sassafrass grapples with interpersonal relationships interfering with her art and eventually relies on santería to pull her out of a negative, abusive space. Her relationship with Mitch informs the majority of her young adult life and she is re-centered after returning home to South Carolina to give birth. * Mama/Hilda Effania: Family matriarch. Mama is an anchor for her girls as they explore themselves and their artistries. Through her letters, her voice, with its Southern wisdom and often old-fashioned conventions, is a constant backdrop to the sisters' journeys throughout the story. She is home for each of her daughters and they depend upon her stability as they adventure toward self-realization. The mother-daughter relationships in the Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo contribute to a larger theme of female relationships in many Shange texts. * Daddy: Mama's deceased husband; Sassafrass, Cypress, and Indigo's father. Although Daddy is already dead at the start of the novel, he maintains a strong presence in the family's home life and serves as Mama's confidante, strengthening the family's ties to more spirit-filled worlds. Notably, his distinct absence allows the family's home to be a strictly female space. * Mitch: Sassafrass' longtime abusive boyfriend. Mitch, an often volatile jazz musician who loves Sassafrass, catalyzes much of the eldest sister's life until the very end of the novel. Mitch was orphaned at age eight and seems incapable of reciprocating the intimacy Sassafrass directs toward him. * Leroy: Cypress' boyfriend, and eventual husband. Leroy, also a jazz musician, comes from a wealthy St. Louis family, but was left parentless at age 18 when his parents were supposedly burned to death. The product of expensive, integrated prep schools, Leroy studied music at prestigious institutions before meeting Cypress. Although he is initially introduced to the reader as a love interest for Sassafrass, he and Cypress are married by the end of the novel. * Aunt Haydee: Community healer; Indigo's guide. Aunt Haydee, who can be seen as another matriarch figure in the novel, has \\"gone to the moon a lot\\" and unquestioningly trusts Indigo to find her way in a world filled with magic and spirits. Throughout Indigo's life, Aunt Haydee provides guidance and teaches Indigo what she knows about midwifery, which becomes Indigo's primary trade by the end of the novel. * Sister Mary Louise: One of Indigo's adult friends. Another female role model for young Indigo, Sister Mary Louise performs a ritual with Indigo upon her first menses and entertains both the girl and her dolls. She tells Indigo about the ways of the South at that time and helps shape Indigo's transition from girlhood to womanhood. * Uncle John: Neighborhood figure; friend of Indigo. Uncle John, known as \\"the junk man\\", shows Indigo some magic early in the story and gives her an old tattered fiddle as a gift, which becomes an extension of the young girl early in her life. He is also a Geechee Captain, and Indigo's relationship with him legitimizes her in the eyes of Crunch and Spats, the Jr. Geechee Captains she gets involved with. * Idrina: Cypress' ex-lover; dancer. After Cypress returns to New York City to pursue dance, she integrates herself into feminist performance spaces where she meets the women of Azure Bosom, including Idrina, Ixchell and others. Idrina, whose longterm girlfriend Laura is out of town for a stint, befriends Cypress and they end up involved in an emotionally intense romantic relationship that leaves Cypress lost after Laura's return.

Such crossbreeding has occurred numerous times in captivity, and was first confirmed to occasionally happen in the wild in Croatia in 2015. Similar matings between golden jackals and grey wolves have never been observed, though evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although no genetic evidence has been found of grey wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, some cases exist where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably grey wolf-like phenotypes, to the point of being mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.Kopaliani, N. et al. (2014), \\"Gene Flow between Wolf and Shepherd Dog Populations in Georgia (Caucasus)\\", Journal of Heredity, 105 (3): 345 DOI: 10.1093/jhered/esu014 History Scottish surgeon and amateur naturalist John Hunter was the first to write an account of the two species' interfertility in 1787. He described how a ship captain of the East India Company adopted a female jackal and had it mated to his spaniel, after which it whelped six pups upon arriving in England. Hunter purchased one of the female hybrid pups and attempted to mate it with several dogs upon reaching maturity. Further crossbreeding experiments were initially hampered by the hybrid female's apparent disinterest in the dogs brought to it, though it subsequently mated with a terrier and produced five pups.Hunter, J. (1787). Observations tending to show that the Wolf, Jackal, and Dog are all the same species. Phil. Trans., and Animal Œconomy, 2nd Edit. Marie Jean Pierre Flourens attempted his own crossbreeding experiments nearly a century later, noting that first-generation matings between the two species tended to produce animals in which jackal characteristics were dominant, having straight ears, hanging tails, lack of barking, and wild temperaments.Flourens, P. (1855), De la Longévité Humaine et de la Quantité de Vie sue le Globe, Paris: Garnier Frères, Libraires-Éditeurs, 2nd ed. pp. 152-154 A similar observation was made by Robert Armitage Sterndale, who recorded a jackal-dog crossbreeding experiment spanning several generations in British India, noting that glaring jackal traits could be exhibited in hybrids even after three generations of crossing them with dogs.Sterndale, R. A. (1884), Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, London: W. Thacker and Co. pp. 238-239. Flourens, however, observed that his jackal hybrids became sterile after the fourth generation, but could be mated back to either parent species. Charles Darwin wrote of a first-generation hybrid kept in the London Zoo which was completely sterile, though he noted that this was an exceptional case, as first-generation hybrids have been known to reproduce successfully. He criticized Flourens's earlier experiments, noting that the specimens he used were all closely related; thus, their subsequent sterility would have been explainable as a result of inbreeding. Breeding experiments in Germany with poodles and jackals and later on with the resulting dog–jackal hybrids showed a decrease in fertility and significant communication problems, as well as an increase of genetic diseases after three generations of interbreeding between the hybrids, unlike with wolfdogs, which remain healthy and never become sterile.Doris Feddersen-Petersen, Hundepsychologie, 4. Auflage, 2004, Franck- Kosmos-Verlag 2004 These \\"puchas\\" (poodle-jackals), like the \\"pucos\\" (poodle coyotes), exhibited much less domestic dog-like behaviour than the wolf- hybrids.Der Hund, Abstammung- Verhalten – Mensch und Hund, Erik Zimen, 1. Auflage, 1988, C. Bertelsmann Verlag GmbH, München During 1975, scientists at Russia's DS Likhachev Scientific Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Environmental Protection began a breeding project in which they crossed golden jackals with Siberian Huskies to create an improved breed with the jackal's power of scent and the Husky's resistance to cold. During recent years, Aeroflot has used one-quarter jackal hybrids, known as Sulimov dogs, to sniff out explosives otherwise undetectable by machinery.Helen Briggs, Jackal blood makes 'perfect' sniffer dogs, BBC News (9 May 2002)Steven Rosenberg, Russian airline's top dogs fight terror, BBC News (13 December 2002) In 2015, hybridization between golden jackals and domestic dogs in the wild was confirmed when three specimens with anomalous traits were harvested in Croatia and had their genetic markers analyzed. Two of the specimens, a light-colored female and a melanistic male, were very jackal-like in appearance, save for their coloration and rounded ears, while one was much more doglike, lacking the jackal's conjoined middle paw pads and sporting dewclaws and a white coat with brown patches. This last specimen was thought to be the pup of the female, which had likely backcrossed with a stray Istrian Shorthaired Hound.Galov, Anna, et al.

Newton and Noss is a civil parish in the South Hams district of Devon, England comprising the villages of Newton Ferrers and Noss Mayo and outlying hamlets such as Membland.The population of the parish taken at the 2011 census was 1,814. History In 847 AD, the Saxon King Æthelwulf created an estate for himself that stretched from the River Dart to the River Plym. In this estate there were many manors, one of which is Newton, belonging to Lord Emar. The first time that the name Newton was recorded in the naming of the Church of Newton in the Geld Roll of 1084. The Domesday Book listed Newton in 1086 as part of the holdings of the Valletorts of Trematon, across the Tamar, who handed it to the Ferrers family. Ralph Ferrers was established at Newton in 1160 and he is the one who has given the village the family name \\"Ferrers\\". There were sixteen villeins listed in the manor in the Domesday Book, the farmsteads of which are still recognizable today. By 1200 most of the boundaries and general landscape patterns had been established and they remained largely untouched until the end of the 19th century. One of these successful farmers, Pugh of Puslinch (Pugh's Land) acquired a farm adjacent to the manor, and his descendants expanded the estate until Puslinch was large enough to become a sub-manor, thereby establishing two manors within the parish.http://www.newtonnoss.co.uk/history.asp . \\"History\\".

He was the son of Gerhard I of Metz and Oda of Saxony, a daughter of Otto I, Duke of Saxony from the family of the Liudolfings, and thus a nephew of King Henry the Fowler. Moreover, he was the younger brother of Wigfried, who was archbishop of Cologne from 924 to 953 and arch-chancellor of his cousin King Otto I from 941. It is thought that his wife Ermentrude (b. 908/9), was the eldest daughter of Charles the Simple, who probably owned the Duchy of Lorraine at the time and was thus his liege lord. Since Charles was deposed in 923, both as king and as duke, and taken prisoner a short time later, it is probable that the wedding took place shortly before the fall of Charles, especially since the other five daughters were apparently no longer married. For a time, Godfrey was known as Count Palatine of Lotharingia. The office was filled from 911 to 915 by Reginar and subsequently by Wigeric. Since Wigeric died before 922, and Charles was deposed 923, there is a short window of time in which Godfrey could have been used as deputy to his father-in-law in Lorraine. But since Godfrey was also the nephew of Henry I, the cousin of Otto I, and the brother of Otto's close adviser and later chancellor Wigfried, it is also possible that this office was entrusted to him after 923 despite his connection to the deposed Charles.

Analogous to the nonribosomal code is prediction of peptide composition by DNA/RNA codon reading, which is well supported by the central dogma of molecular biology and accomplished using the genetic code simply by following the DNA codon table or RNA codon table. However, prediction of natural product/secondary metabolites by the nonribosomal code is not as concrete as DNA/RNA codon-to-amino acid and much research is still needed to have a broad-use code. The increasing number of sequenced genomes and high- throughput prediction software has allowed for better elucidation of predicted substrate specificity and thus natural products/secondary metabolites. Enzyme characterization by, for example, ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assays for substrate specificity, in silico substrate-binding pocket modelling and structure-function mutagenesis (in vitro tests or in silico modelling) helps support predictive algorithms. Much research has been done on bacteria and fungi, with prokaryotic bacteria having easier-to-predict products. The nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a multi-modular enzyme complex, minimally contains repeating, tri-domains (adenylation (A), peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) and lastly condensation(C)). The adenylation domain (A) is the focus for substrate specificity since it is the initiating and substrate recognition domain. In one example, adenylation substrate-binding pocket (defined by 10 residue within) alignments led to clusters giving rise to defined specificity (i.e. the residues of the enzyme pocket can predict nonribosomal peptide sequence).The nonribosomal code 1999 In silico mutations of substrate-determining residues also led to varying or relaxed specificity.The specificity-conferring code of adenylation domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases 1999 Additionally, the NRPS collinearity principle/rule dictates that given the order of adenylation domains (and substrate-specificity code) throughout the NRPS one can predict the amino acid sequence of the produced small peptide. NRPS, NRPS-like or NRPS-PKS complexes also exist and have domain variations, additions and/or exclusions. Supporting examples The A-domains have 8 amino acid-long non-ribosomal signatures.

The POKEY chip is one of three custom coprocessors created for the Atari 8-bit computers. POKEY handles potentiometer (paddle) controllers and the keyboard—the name is a combination of \\"POtentiometer\\" and \\"KEYboard\\"—as well as generating four channels of 8-bit audio. It also serves as the audio chip in many arcade games, such as Missile Command and Centipede. Games Wanting to create an action-oriented game inspired by Star Wars and Star Trek, Neubauer designed Star Raiders in eight to ten months while working for Atari, Inc. He reported that it took him six months to reach the highest player level during development. In the early 1980s Neubauer moved from Atari computer line to the Atari 2600 because that's where the money was being made. He developed three cartridges for Fox Video Games under the pseudonym Dallas North: Megaforce, Alien (based on the movie), and M*A*S*H (based on the TV series). He was working on a game for Atari in 1984 to be based on The Last Starfighter film, but it was cancelled when Atari was bought by Jack Tramiel. In 1986, Atari Corporation showed new interest in the game, and it was published as Solaris for the Atari 2600. Despite being released for simpler hardware, the game is a spiritual sequel to Star Raiders that is more advanced than the computer original. Neubauer's final two games for the 2600 were Super Football (1988) and Radar Lock (1989), both published by Atari Corporation. He later was developing a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System with the working title of Solarian Patrol. The graphics were scanned images of spaceships kitbashed from commercial model kits.

The walk passes through much of the Lake District. It allows participants to run or walk as they choose. Most choose to walk, while the running contingent compete for the fastest runner trophy. The walk has it origins in a 1966 challenge between a team of American experts working on the construction of HMS Resolution in Barrow, and local workers from Vickers, the owners of Barrow's shipyard. The challenge was inspired by American President John F. Kennedy's recommendation that \\"every American should be capable of walking 50 miles a day\\" The original walk started at the Castlerigg Stone Circle, roughly 50 miles from Barrow, but the length of the walk was in following years reduced to around 40 miles, starting south of Keswick. The walk proved popular and became an annual event. By 1974 it had 1,500 participants, and has continued to grow. Entry is currently capped at 2,900 walkers for logistical reasons, and the event is regularly oversubscribed. For many years, the route began at Rough How Bridge on the A591 three miles south of Keswick. However, for the walk's fiftieth anniversary in 2016 and again in 2017, the start was moved to near Castlerigg Stone Circle, increasing the distance to around 43 miles. The walk follows minor roads along the west of Thirlmere, before climbing up Dunmail Raise. It passes through the village of Grasmere and over Red Bank into Elterwater and on to Coniston. Walkers then continue along the east bank of Coniston Water to the village of Lowick, before passing over Kirkby Moor, the walk's highest elevation. The route then continues into Low Furness and the village of Marton, passing the South Lakes Wild Animal Park on its way to Dalton-in- Furness. The final stretch runs close to Furness Abbey, before ending at the Hawcoat Park Sports Club in Hawcoat, Barrow. The shorter Coniston to Barrow walk is aimed at teenagers, and joins the main route in Coniston. Competitors enter in teams of between 6 and 12, and prizes are awarded to both individuals and teams. The competition retains a close association with BAE Systems, current owners of Barrow's shipyard, and teams from the armed forces, with prizes for the best performers among both groups Competitors must raise a minimum of £80 for charity for their entry to be accepted. Up to 2016, more than £3.7M has been donated to charities over the history of the walk.

They were formed in 1993 by members of various Little Rock punk bands, but shifted their sound from punk rock to early rock and roll.  History  =Early Years= The Big Cats formed in 1993 following the breakups of Burt Taggart's previous band, Chino Horde, and Colin Brooks and Josh Bentley's band, Substance. Each of the members had grown up in and around Little Rock, Arkansas and played together in earlier bands. They made their live debut at a New Year's Eve party on December 31, 1993. In 1994, Shannon Yarbrough, Taggart's former bandmate in 5-0, joined the band. In 1996, Bentley moved to Nashville. Pinhead Gunpowder's Jason White (who had previously played in Chino Hoarde), moved back from Berkeley, California to Arkansas to replace him. This incarnation of the band won local accolades, continued to write and record, and eventually toured the midwest and northeast United States with the thought of relocating. Unable to reach a consensus of where to move, the group disbanded. Over the next two years Taggart, Brooks, and Yarbrough moved to Brooklyn, New York, while White returned to Berkeley and continued to play with Pinhead Gunpowder, eventually joining Green Day. =Yarbough's death= On May 7, 2000, Shannon Yarbrough was killed in an automobile accident. The loss brought the surviving band members back together to play a tribute show for him the following Christmas. A year after his death, The Big Cats regrouped in a Fayetteville, Arkansas studio to record a two song 45 single on their newly formed label, Max Recordings. The songs from the single were later grouped with unreleased recordings throughout the 1990s, and released as the 2002 compilation album, Worrisome Blues. =On Tomorrow= In the spring of 2006, White, who was on break from Green Day, and Brooks, who had begun playing with the Canadian based band The Stills, began making trips back to Little Rock, to write a full length Big Cats album. This would become On Tomorrow, which was recorded with Barry Poynter at his studio in Little Rock. Pop Matters gave the record a rating of 6/10.http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/the-big-cats-on-tomorrow// Stewart Mason of All Music said about the album, \\"In some ways, the Big Cats are so retro they're positively cutting edge: this Little Rock quartet is a jangly guitar pop band from the South, a style of music that was absolutely everywhere in the post-R.E.M.

On Tomorrow isn't some kind of archeological enterprise, however: this kind of low-key, earnest jangle pop is more timeless than that.\\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/on-tomorrow-r944305/ =The Ancient Art Of Leaving= In January 2010 the band began the follow up to On Tomorrow, again working with Barry Poynter. They set out to develop and arrange the 25 demos that Taggart had written. By late October the band announced that recording had finally come to an end and that they would be releasing 25 songs as a two part album in late 2011 and early 2012. On December 13, 2011, the first half of that effort was released, titled: The Ancient Art Of Leaving: High & Low. Arriving nearly a year after The Ancient Art Of Leaving: High & Low, part two of The Big Cats 25 song project The Ancient Art Of Leaving: Two Parts was released on November 6th, 2012. The band also announced via their website that there will be a limited 3xLP vinyl release of the entire project titled simply The Ancient Art Of Leaving available on the same date.

He emigrated as a child with his family from the United States to Israel at the age of 11, completed high school, and served in the IDF. Ha'ivri is an Orthodox Jew, and lives with his wife and eight children in Kfar Tapuach in the West Bank. He is a religious Zionist leader, writer, and speaker.

Canadian producer Igal Hecht of Chutzpa Productions film 35 Acres explores the issue of the Temple Mount the most contentious piece of real estate on the face of the Earth.35 Acres at Chutzpa Productions Holy for both Jews and Muslims the Temple Mount, is one of the most volatile areas in Jerusalem. Many say that those who control it, control the entire land. This film shows both Palestinians and Israelis whose entire lives revolve around that area. Ha'ivri has been involved in the Jewish side of this story for over 25 years. Ha'ivri has also been interviewed by major media outlets BBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera and others. Present =Shomron Liaison Office= Ha'ivri is the founder of the Shomron Liaison Office, an NGO that worked closely with the local government promoting public relations for the towns of the region. In this capacity, he serves as English-language spokesman, interacting with all foreign language journalists. The Shomron Liaison Office under his direction has developed partnership and pen pal programs connecting schoolchildren in the Shomron with their peers around the world. He delivers speeches internationally to a wide range of groups, as well as hosting tours in the Shomron. An outpost carved in bedrock Jerusalem Post As a spokesman for the Shomron Regional Council, Ha'ivri interacts with international media, foreign government representatives and philanthropists. From 2008, he served as strategic adviser to Regional Council head Gershon Mesika on international affairs. He currently serves as the Advisor of Mesika's successor Yossi Dagan.article in Times of Israel =Empowering local activists and spokespeople= In 2009, Ha'ivri conducted professional training for 30 spokespeople from a wide range of settlements in the Shomron region aimed at improving their abilities to express themselves in English and so to improve the general public relations of the settlers in the area. He contracted Ron Bowman Director of Dale Carnegie Training in Israel provide a 13-week course for the local activists. =Student volunteer programs= He organizes student volunteer programs in the Jewish communities in the Shomron (settlements). In these programs, American youth are introduced to aspects of planting and building. They are offered an opportunity to take part in the actual expansion of the Jewish growth there. =UN Settlement Prize= In August 2009, Ha'ivri advocated that the United Nations award the Jewish settlements in the West Bank an international prize for settlement activity. The annual prize, the Habitat Scroll of Honor, is handed out annually to acknowledge \\"outstanding contributions in developing and improving settlements and the quality of urban life\\". =Social Media Activism= Ha'ivri maintains active Twitter and Facebook accounts. He was selected as one of the \\"25 most influential people on ‘Jewish Twitter’\\" in 2016.on JTA, on ceoworld.biz =Connecting with American Zionists= Ha'ivri has developed a number of programs aimed and establishing a connection for the settlements in the West Bank with Jewish communities and supporters around the world. One of those programs is the Purim package distribution to IDF soldiers in cooperation with the Zionist Organization of America. Thousands of gift packages are packaged by students in schools in the Shomron and then distributed it soldiers throughout the region and the whole country. Another project devised by Ha'ivri is twinning schools in Shomron with school children in the Jewish communities outside of Israel. The project is implemented by the Israel Connecthttp://israelconnect.org/homeeng.aspx program. Political activism As a youth, Ha'ivri became involved with rabbi Meir Kahane's Kach, and was already active in the 1984 election that saw Kahane elected to Knesset, and was a close friend of the rabbi's son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane. The Kach party was banned from running in the 1988 Knesset elections, and has since been added to terrorist watch lists by Israel, Canada,Canada Public Safety website and the United States.U.S. Dept. of State, Country Reports on Terrorism 2004. April 2005 =Jail term and legal battles= Ha'ivri has had several disputes with the Israeli government. He was notably arrested for celebrating the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in a television interview, and served six-month jail time in connection with the desecration of a mosque. Tax-Exempt Funds Aid Settlements in West Bank However, in an interview with the New York Times newspaper, Ha'Ivri said he no longer engaged in such activism, adding that, at age 43, he had mellowed, even if his core convictions had not. \\"I'm a little older now, a little more mature\\", he said. In 2001, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein ruled that the slogan publicized by far-right activists, \\"No Arabs, no terror\\", constitutes incitement to racism and offence, especially to the 20% of Arabs who have Israeli citizenship. Rubinstein handed his ruling to the police to investigate. As a result, in January 2005, the Jerusalem Magistrate's court sentenced Ha'ivri to four months of community service for distributing the T-shirts.Prof. Paul Eidelberg The David Ha'ivri case =Kfar Tapuach= In the late 1980s, he formed a group of Rabbi Kahane's students at the Yeshivat HaRaayon HaYehudi, which later moved to the town of Kfar Tapuach. After Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane's assassination in December 2000, Ha'ivri took on responsibility for his bi-weekly publication, Darka Shel Torah and HaMeir L'David, a publishing group which prints and distributes the works of Rabbi Meir Kahane and Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane. Ha'ivri has been active in leadership of the town, and has served as the town mayor, head of security, and youth director - organizing educational and social activity, while also offering aid to at-risk teens and developing programs for them in the Shomron region (West Bank). He has published articles on these issues. In November 2018 Ha'ivri was elected to the Shomron Regional Municipal council. =2005 Gaza pullout= In the time leading up to the 2005 Gaza Disengagement, Ha'ivri, together with Yisrael Meir Cohen, founded Revava ( means ten thousand), an organization which initially aimed at preventing the Gaza expulsion by encouraging nationwide protests to tie up the Israeli security forces, based on a play on words, and on the concept that ten thousand activists could actually stop the Israeli pullout from Gaza and North of Shomron. As a toll to promote his ideas and tactics to oppose the disengagement plan, Ha'ivri developed a monopoly type board game called \\"Revava - Changing the rules of the game\\". =Temple Mount= In 2005, Ha'ivri headed a campaign calling for 10,000 Jews to ascend to the Temple Mount, the holiest place to the Jewish people and the most explosive location in the world. Later, he published Reclaiming the Temple Mount, a book on these events and the history of the site. Ideology =Annexing the West Bank= He advocates that all territory controlled by the Israeli government and army between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River rightfully belongs to the Jewish people, and should be officially annexed by the State of Israel, and that the non-Jewish population need to accept the Israel authority and be loyal to the State, therefore advocating the One-state solution. And for those Arabs unwilling to integrate into Israeli society, he offers a 22 State solution ... Palestinians could and should live in any of the other Arab states, rather than Israel. “Non-Jews who are willing to be loyal to the State of Israel ... can live in Israel. But if they intend to be disloyal to the country, then they need to find other places to live, and there are plenty [of those]\\", he said.The Australian Jewish News 2 Nov. 2009 Periodically, Ha'ivri goes on tour speaking on behalf of the settlements. In reply to US President Barack Obama's pressure on Israel to stop Jewish settlement growth in the West Bank, he said: \\"We are frustrated by the Chutzpah (audacity) of Obama and other world leaders to intervene and tell Israel what to do. The only country in the world where the international leaders can legitimately suggest ethnic cleansing is Israel. Anywhere else there would be an outcry.\\" He believes that Israel should annex all areas it has controlled since the 1967 war, and that Jews should be allowed to settle all parts of those lands. \\"Judea and Samaria are wrongly called 'settlements'. Yet the West Bank is actually the West bank of the Jordan River. All of Israel is the West bank. Both sides of the Jordan River belong to the Jewish people. That was the British Mandate. The British reneged and created Transjordan East of the river.\\" =Joseph's tomb= Ha'ivri is active in a campaign to restore Joseph's tomb in Shechem (Nablus) - a site holy to Christians, Muslims, and Jewish populations in the region. The site was overrun and demolished by Arab rioters in October 2000 during clashes between IDF forces during the al-Aqsa Intifada. He calls on the Israeli government to retake the site and allow Jewish settlers to rebuild the yeshiva that once occupied the site. He has been involved in organizing monthly visits for Jewish worshippers in cooperation with the local IDF command.

A founder of Workers' Fight in 1966, he is still a prominent member of the group, now called the Alliance for Workers' Liberty. Early life Matgamna was born in 1941 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, and grew up in the town, serving as an altar boy at Ennis Cathedral. He emigrated with his family to Manchester in 1954 and attended St Peter's Catholic School in Salford. Early political experience He joined the Young Communist League (YCL) as a teenager in Manchester and then, in 1960, Gerry Healy's Trotskyist Socialist Labour League, from which he was expelled in 1963. He joined another Trotskyist group, Militant, in 1965 and in 1966 co-authored a pamphlet, What We Are and What We Must Become outlining his views. When Militant refused to circulate it among the membership, he and his supporters left the organisation. Workers' Fight Matgamna, working with two supporters, formed the Workers' Fight group to act upon his views, central to which was a call for Trotskyist unity in Britain. They began publishing a journal for the Irish Workers Group and a handful of others joined the group before, in 1968, the International Socialists (later the Socialist Workers Party) also put out a call for unity. Responding to it, Workers' Fight joined the IS as the Trotskyist Tendency. With other dockers in Salford, he produced an industrial bulletin, The Hook. Around this time Matgamna, who believed that effective working class rule then existed in some Catholic-majority areas of Northern Ireland, proposed that in the probable event of attacks on this control, that those areas should secede to the Irish Republic as a way of making Northern Ireland ungovernable and forcing open the national question in Ireland. He later proposed granting the Protestant (overwhelmingly Unionist) community political autonomy within a united Ireland. Some commentators have argued that both of these positions are in fact calls for repartition although Matgamna and his supporters have always denied this. At the end of 1971, the Trotskyist Tendency was expelled by IS and reformed Workers' Fight with a much increased membership. Martin Thomas soon joined, working with Matgamna to take prominent roles in the group. Matgamna became a full-time theorist within the group, moving to London. Throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s the revived Workers' Fight became more and more associated with Matgamna's leadership. This was accentuated by the disputes that led to the short-lived fusion with the Workers' Power group, which had briefly joined Workers' Fight in a fused grouping known as the International-Communist League. Similarly, when the I-CL fused with the Workers' Socialist League, Matgamna was strongly identified as the central leader of one side in the factional fight that later erupted within, and then split, the fused group. One key area of disagreement in 1983 was that the inhabitants of the Falkland Islands were considered by Matgamna to have the right to autonomy, a position he worked through during the Falklands War. This approach to the national question has since been extended, in large part by Matgamna, to other communities. Matgamna has also, since 1986, argued strongly for a two state solution - that is states for both the Palestinians and Israelis - in the Middle East - even prior to the overthrow of capitalism in the region. \\"Third Camp\\" position In 1989, Matgamna, along with many other members of the group's national committee, by then known as the Socialist Organiser Alliance, came to reconsider some of its views on the Eastern Bloc. Rereading works by Hal Draper and Max Shachtman led him to conclude that Third Camp socialism offered an expression of many of the conclusions he had come to. It has been argued by some on the left that Matgamna's embrace of the politics of Shachtman and Draper, which he has described as \\"the other Trotskyism\\", merely reverses his embrace of the ideas of James P. Cannon in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Matgamna remains a prominent member of the Trotskyist group he founded, now called the Alliance for Workers' Liberty. Pseudonyms Over the years, he has used a large number of pseudonyms, including John O'Mahony, Seán Mac Mathúna, Paddy Dollard and Jack Cleary.

A typical ALS instrument consists of an HPLC/FPLC chromatography system coupled in-line with appropriate light scattering and refractive index detectors. The advantage of ALS over conventional steady-state light scattering methods is that it allows separation of molecules/macromolecules on a chromatography column prior to analysis with light scattering detectors. Accordingly, ALS enables one to determine hydrodynamic properties of a single monodisperse species as opposed to bulk or average measurements on a sample afforded by conventional light scattering.

The first three series of the show were a joint production of the Israeli Educational Television and the Sesame Workshop, a Worldwide American non-profit organization which has been co-producing the original American Sesame Street since 1969. The story line and casts of Rehov Sumsum are tailored to an Israeli audience. History Rechov Sumsum consists of four television series and one short lived spin-off: Rechov Sumsum, Shalom Sesame, Rechov Sumsum/Shara'a Simsim, Sippuray Sumsum and Rechov Sumsum. =Co-production Era: 1983-2015= The original series – Rechov Sumsum (1983–1986) This original Israeli version of the series was the most popular. 195 episodes were produced and broadcast between 1983 and 1986 on the educational television channel. Puppet segments were taken from the American series and dubbed in Hebrew (the same has been done in all other Israeli versions of the series). All other aspects of the production were local: The program took place in an Israeli neighborhood in which children and adults played together. Original connecting segments were added in which Israeli children shared a view of their lives. The series had a parallel character to Big Bird – a big hedgehog, by the name of \\"Kippi\\" and a parallel character to Oscar the grouch, by the name of \\"Moishe Oofnik\\". Oofnik was a punk and used to complain a lot and bother the neighborhood's residents, but even so, he soon became friends with the children in the neighborhood. The residents who lived in the street included Avner and Hanna, who were the owners of the coffee house near Kipi's apartment. After they moved to a different city they were replaced by a new coffee shop named Gabi (Gabi Amrani). Opposite to the coffee house lived Miki (Miki Kam) and Nathan (Nathan Dattner). Nathan lived in front of an older resident named Yona (Yona Atari). In front of Yona's apartment was Shmil's (Shmuel Shilo) electricity appliance repairing shop, where Miki worked as Shmil's assistant. Occasionally Albert (Albert Iluz) used to come over to the neighborhood for visits – a peculiar character with a French accent with whom Kipi used to consult on different issues. Salim (Salim Dau) used to explain to the children in the neighborhood the meaning of different words in Arabic and the show also included different famous Israeli guest stars, such as: the duo \\"HaDodaim\\", Haim Moshe, Gidi Gov and Rotem Abuhab. The opening theme song of the original series was written by Ali Mohar and composed by Yoni Rechter which also performed it together with Gidi Gov, Mazi Cohen, Dafna Armoni and a group of children from the Tzadikov choir. The series was broadcast repeatedly many times until 1996. Then, these broadcasts were suspended due to expiry of the co-production agreement between the Israeli Educational Television and the Sesame Workshop – the rights owner of the original American Sesame Street. The right to show the Hebrew-dubbed segments of the original American show produced by the Sesame Workshop were transferred to the private cable channel \\"HOP! Channel\\". Following the success of the series many products were marketed to the Israeli public based on the series, including: records of the songs and the sketches from the show, dolls of Kipi Ben Kipod, school supplies, clothing and beddings. A new fashion which started due to the show was the \\"Kipi shoes\\" – Plaided slippers in shades of brown and black, which although existed prior to the show, became much more popular following the show. The curriculum goals of the show were: Mutual Respect (human diversity, mutual respect); The Child's World (body parts, child's powers, health, reasoning, problem solving); Reading, Mathematics, and Writing (prereading and writing, numbers, geometric forms); and Cognitive Organization (perceptual discrimination, relational concepts, classifying). Although messages about mutual respect were always included in the curriculum of the original US show, it was the first time this area was a major focus of any version of Sesame Street. It was a priority because of the \\"profound political tension in the region\\". This production has been viewed as a model for the use of television to convey antisectarian messages.Cole, p. 174 The second series – Shalom Sesame (1989–1990) The program Shalom Sesame was an Israeli–American co-production which combined American actors, such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Bonnie Franklin, Anne Meara, and Jerry Stiller, and the original Israeli cast members which participated in the original Rechov Sumsum series. In addition, the renowned violinist Yitzhak Perlman participated regularly on the series. The series was produced in 1986 (its first season), in 1990 (its second season), and 1991 (its third season), and was broadcast in Israel between the years 1989 and 1990. The series was first intended for broadcast in the US and was therefore recorded completely in English. Only later it was dubbed in Hebrew for Israeli viewers (although the Shalom Sesame logo still showed up at the beginning). Following the big wave of immigration from Russia to Israel in those years, the series was also dubbed in Russian. In 2006 the series came out in the United States in a DVD bundle which included all episodes of the series (without the Hebrew dubbing). The third series – Rechov Sumsum/Shara'a Simsim (1998–2000) In 1998 the show's format was remade in a way which combined Israeli-Jews and Israeli- Arabs in order to generate a message of coexistence. This production included 50 episodes and featured new characters aside from Kipi and Oofnik. The new Israeli Muppet was named Dafi (a purple monster), and two Arab muppets named Hanin (an orange monster) and Kareem (a green rooster) were also introduced as a way to bring diversity into the cast. A new stage was built which included a garden, a promenade, a bookstore and an ice cream store. Moishe Oofnik's old car was \\"stuck\\" in the center of the neighborhood. Due to the disintegration of the original muppet of Kipi Ben Kipod and due to rights issues, Kipi's muppet was re-designed with a more \\"muppet-like\\" design. The American co- producers requested that Kipi would be played by an actor with a more masculine voice, so Guy Friedman was chosen to voice Kipi. The opening theme song was replaced with one composed by Shlomo Gronich and included a number of sentences in Arabic. The program received mixed criticism from the old fans of the show which were adults by then. When the co-production dissolved in 2002, it was split and was renamed Sippuray Sumsum (Sesame Stories) and Palestine would later receive their own version of the show. The spin-off – Sippuray Sumsum (2002-2006) In 2002, the spin-off series Sippuray Sumsum was broadcast on the Israeli HOP! Channel and it featured two new Muppets named Noah and Brosh. The hosts of the show were Tzahi (Dror Keren) and Aibtism (Hind Ayub). This series was largely funded by the European Union, and its goal was to promote messages of respect and understanding among Israeli and Arab children in the Middle East. Nowadays, this series is occasionally broadcast on Channel 33 with Arabic dubbing. The fourth series – Rechov Sumsum (2006–2015) =Season 1= In 2006, the show transitioned back to the Rechov Sumsum name and debuted on the HOP! Channel, mixing the Sippurei Sumsum cast, new characters, and returning favorite Moishe Oofnik from the original seasons. From December 2006 a new series called \\"Rechov Sumsum\\" was produced for the Israeli HOP! Channel. The new series featured the main Muppets from Sippuray Sumsum – Noah and Brosh, along with the hosts Tzahi (Dror Keren) and Aibtism (Hind Ayub), many other actors, and two new muppets, Avigail and Mahboub. Mahboub became a source of controversy as it was confirmed that he was a muppet of Arab origin. Sesame, Sumsum or Simsim : Everyone's Favorite Street Returns to TV, Haaretz There were also plans and negotiations to restore the original Muppets of Kipi Ben Kipod and Moishe Oofnik in this series, but eventually due to technical and economical considerations, only Moishe Oofnik was featured in the series. The opening theme is the original theme song of the show which was written by Yoni Rechter and sung by a new band of children called \\"Sharonit\\". The show also included a campaign against violence. The fourth series included 40 episodes. =Season 2= In December 2009, a new season for Rechov Sumsum was produced for \\"Hop! Channel\\". The new season featured the previous Muppets: Avigail, Brosh, Mahboub and Moishe Oofnik with new neighbors including Sivan, a Muppet in a wheelchair and Sesame Streets Grover, or Kruvi in Hebrew. =Season 3= In February 2012, another new season for Rechov Sumsum was produced for \\"Hop! Channel\\". The new season featured the previous Muppets: Avigail, Mahboub, Sivan and Moishe Oofnik with new neighbor called Sesame Street's Elmo. =Season 4= In March 2015, another new season for Rechov Sumsum debuted on \\"Hop! Channel\\". The new season featured the muppets: Avigail, Mahboub, Sivan and Elmo. The focus for the season is \\"Learn about science and curiosity.\\" Shani Cohen, Abigail's former Puppeteer, is going back to the show as a new human character called Ayelet, tour guide at the museum. The fifth series – Shalom Sesame (2009–2011) Between 2009 and 2011, 12 new Shalom Sesame direct-to-DVD episodes were produced. This is an Israeli–American co-production which combines various American actors, such as Anneliese van der Pol, Jake Gyllenhaal, Christina Applegate, Greg Kinnear, Debra Messing and Cedric the Entertainer, and is geared at teaching Jewish- American children about the Secular Jewish culture. The series was filmed in the United States and in several places in Israel, including the Western Wall.Big-name stars to appear on Shalom Sesame Dubbing Era: 2005-present During the 2000s and 2010s, The Cookie Thief is dubbed in Hebrew, but not all the season 45 episodes, however the segments are dubbed in Hebrew.

The resort is situated in a wedge between Route 70 and U.S. Route 40, with the David Force Natural Resource Area along the northern border. Construction contractor Samuel M Pistorio (1902-1998) purchased 1000 acres of farmland west of Ellicott City. He introduced the $1 million Turf Valley Country Club in 1958. The 1500 person club featured two 18-hole golf courses designed by Ault and Jaminson. The Clubhouse opened in December 1959. Turf Valley proposed falling under the \\"New Town\\" zoning proposed in 1965 or the creation of the Rouse Company development Columbia. Amendments were placed in the New Town Zoning increasing the minimum required acreage owned by a project from 750 to 2500 acres, effectively removing Turf Valley from immediate competition to the project. The Resort later was purchased by Nicholas B. Mangione of Mangione Enterprises. In 1979, Mangione in combination with the Gudelski family company Percontee, planner William P. Brendle and attorney Bernard F. Goldberg petitioned to rezone the 646 acre project from three-acre lots to half-acre lots claiming 50 acres would be open space. The property was redeveloped for housing units alongside the golf course with sewer service approved in 1989. In 1985, the Catholic Archdioceses sold Donald R. Reuwer Jr. the graveyard of St. Mary's Church for $10,000. In 1991, H. Allen Becker developed Turf Valley Overlook housing development on a 3.5 acre St. Mary's Church parcel that contained Doughoregan Manor worker graves. Protesters requested Charles I. Ecker purchase the land for open space, but the development and clearing were allowed to proceed.

The term was coined in 1988 by Benny Morris, one of the leading New Historians. According to Ethan Bronner of The New York Times, the New Historians have sought to advance the peace process in the region.Bronner, Ethan. \\"The New New Historians\\", The New York Times, 9 November 2003. Much of the primary source material used by the group comes from Israeli government papers that were newly available as a result of being declassified thirty years after the founding of Israel. The perception of a new historiographical current emerged with the publications of four scholars in the 1980s: Benny Morris, Ilan Pappé, Avi Shlaim and Simha Flapan. Subsequently, many other historians and historical sociologists, among them Tom Segev, Hillel Cohen, Baruch Kimmerling, Joel Migdal, Idit Zertal and Shlomo Sand have been identified with the movement.Erez Casif, Was the State of Israel ‘Really’ Established?, Cambridge Scholars 2013 p.15. Initially dismissed by the public, the New Historians eventually gained legitimacy in Israel in the 1990s. Some of their conclusions have been incorporated into the political ideology of post-Zionists. The political views of the individual historians vary, as do the periods of Israeli history in which they specialize. Main arguments Avi Shlaim described the New Historians' differences from what he termed the \\"official history\\" in the following terms: > *The official version said that Britain tried to prevent the establishment > of a Jewish state; the New Historians claimed that it tried to prevent the > establishment of a Palestinian state *The official version said that the > Palestinians fled their homes of their own free will; the New Historians > said that the refugees were chased out or expelled *The official version > said that the balance of power was in favour of the Arabs; the New > Historians said that Israel had the advantage both in manpower and in arms > *The official version said that the Arabs had a coordinated plan to destroy > Israel; the New Historians said that the Arabs were divided *The official > version said that Arab intransigence prevented peace; the New Historians > said that Israel is primarily to blame for the \\"dead end\\". Pappé suggests that the Zionist leaders intended to displace most Palestinian Arabs; Morris believes the displacement happened in the heat of war. According to the New Historians, Israel and Arab countries each have their share of responsibility for the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Palestinian plight. Influence on traditional Israeli historical narrative and public opinion Michal Ben-Josef Hirsch argues that, prior to the advent of the New Historians, \\"Israelis held to a one-sided historical narrative of the circumstances leading to the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem, and that any other counter-narratives were taboo.\\" According to Ben-Josef Hirsch, the conclusions of the New Historians, and the wide-ranging debate that they provoked, ended that taboo and changed the way in which the Palestinian refugee problem and its causes were viewed in Israel. Ben-Josef Hirsch says that the traditional Israeli narrative, that Arabs were responsible for the exodus of the Palestinians, held from 1948 to the late 1990s. She says that the arguments of the New Historians significantly challenged that narrative, leading to a broad debate both in academia and in the wider public discourse, including journalists and columnists, politicians, public figures, and the general public. Ben-Josef Hirsch believes that a significant change has occurred in how the Palestinian refugee issue is viewed in Israeli society since the late 1990s, with a more complex narrative being more accepted; it recognizes there were instances where Israeli forces expelled Palestinians with the knowledge and authorization of the Israeli leadership. Ben-Josef Hirsch attributes that change to the work of the New Historians and the resulting debate. The New Historians gained respect by the 1990s. A 1998 series on state television marking Israel's 50th anniversary drew much from their work, as did textbooks introduced to ninth graders in 1999. Critics of the New Historians have acknowledged this shift. Avi Beker, writing in the Jerusalem Post, states that the effect of the New Historians work on the history of the Arab–Israeli conflict \\"cannot be exaggerated\\". He says the work of the New Historians is now the mainstream in academia, and that their influence was not confined to intellectual circles. To illustrate his point he cites examples from changes to Israeli school text books to the actions of Israeli political leaders and developments in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.  Criticism  The writings of the New Historians have come under repeated criticism, both from traditional Israeli historians who accuse them of fabricating Zionist misdeeds, and from Arab or pro-Arab writers who accuse them of whitewashing the truth about Zionist misbehaviour. Efraim Karsh has accused them of ignoring questions which he says are critical: Who started the war? What were their intentions? Who was forced to mount a defence? What were Israel's casualties? Early in 2002, the most famous of the new historians, Benny Morris, publicly reversed some of his personal political positions,Morris, 2002 though he has not withdrawn any of his historical writings. Morris says he did not use much of the newly available archival material when he wrote his book: \\"When writing The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947–1949 in the mid-1980s, I had no access to the materials in the IDFA [IDF Archive] or the Haganah Archive and precious little to first- hand military materials deposited elsewhere.\\" Anita Shapira offers the following criticism: Israeli historian Yoav Gelber criticized New Historians in an interview, saying that aside from Benny Morris, they did not contribute to the research of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War in any way. He did however note that they contributed to the public discourse about the war. =Post- Zionism= Some commentators have argued that the historiography of the New Historians has both drawn inspiration from, and lent impetus to, a movement known as post-Zionism. Generally the term \\"post-Zionist\\" is self-identified by Jewish Israelis who are critical of the Zionist enterprise and are seen by Zionists as undermining the Israeli national ethos.Shlomo Sharan (Editor) (2003) Israel and the Post-Zionists: A Nation at Risk Sussex Academic Press p. 10 (Yoav Gelber, \\"Redefining the Israeli Ethos\\") Post-Zionists differ from Zionists on many important details, such as the status of the law of return and other sensitive issues. Post-Zionists view the Palestinian dispossession as central to the creation of the state of Israel. Baruch Kimmerling criticised the focus on \\"post-Zionism\\", arguing that debates around the term were \\"nonsense and semi-professional and mainly political\\". According to Kimmerling the term has been arbitrarily applied to any research on Israeli history, society or politics that was critical or perceived to be critical. Kimmerling saw this discussion as damaging to research in these areas because it took the focus away from the quality and merit of scholarship and onto whether the work should be characterized as Zionist or post-Zionist. Further, Kimmerling asserted that academics were diverted away from serious research onto polemical issues and that the environment this fostered inhibited the research of younger academics who were fearful of being labeled as belonging to one of the two camps. =Benny Morris= *The \\"Old Historians\\" lived through 1948 as highly committed adult participants in the epic, glorious rebirth of the Jewish commonwealth. They were unable to separate their lives from this historical event, unable to regard impartially and objectively the facts and processes that they later wrote about.Benny Morris,Making Israel, University of Michigan Press, 2007, pp.14–15. *The \\"Old Historians\\" have written largely on the basis of interviews and memoirs and at best made use of select batches of documents, many of them censored. *Benny Morris has been critical of the old Historians, describing them, by and large, as not really historians, who did not produce real history: \\"In reality there were chroniclers and often apologetic\\",Benny Morris 1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1994. . p.6 and refers to those who produced it as \\"less candid\\", \\"deceitful\\" and \\"misleading\\".Benny Morris 1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1994. . p. 2  Major debates  On a few occasions there have been heated public debates between the New Historians and their detractors. The most notable: * Benny Morris and Avi Shlaim versus Shabtai Teveth Teveth is best known as a biographer of David Ben-Gurion. Teveth: Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 26 (1990) 214–249; Morris: 1948 and After; Teveth: Commentary; Morris and Shlaim: Tikkun. * Benny Morris versus Norman Finkelstein and Nur Masalha This took place in three articles in the Journal of Palestine Studies Vol. 21, No. 1, Autumn, 1991. While acknowledging that Morris had brought to light a vast quantity of previously unknown archival material, Finkelstein and Masalha accused Morris of presenting the evidence with a pro-Zionist spin. Finkelstein wrote \\"Morris has substituted a new myth, one of the \\"happy medium\\" for the old. ... [T]he evidence that Morris adduces does not support his temperate conclusions. ...[S]pecifically, Morris's central thesis that the Arab refugee problem was \\"born of war, not by design\\" is belied by his own evidence which shows that Palestine's Arabs were expelled systematically and with premeditation.\\" Masalha accused Morris of treating the issue as \\"a debate amongst Zionists which has little to do with the Palestinians themselves\\", and of ignoring the long history that the idea of \\"transfer\\" (removal of the Palestinians) had among Zionist leaders. In his response, Morris accused Finkelstein and Masalha of \\"outworn preconceptions and prejudices\\" and reiterated his support for a multifaceted explanation for the Arab flight. * Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim and Ilan Pappé versus Efraim Karsh Efraim Karsh of King's College, London, is a founding editor of Israel Affairs. Starting with an article in the magazine Middle East Quarterly,Karsh, 1996 Karsh alleged that the new historians \\"systematically distort the archival evidence to invent an Israeli history in an image of their own making\\". Karsh also provides a list of examples where, he claims, the new historians \\"truncated, twisted, and distorted\\" primary documents. Shlaim's replyShlaim, 1996 defended his analysis of the Zionist-Hashemite negotiations prior to 1948. Morris declined immediate reply,Morris, 1996 accusing Karsh of a \\"mélange of distortions, half-truths, and plain lies\\", but published a lengthy rebuttal in the Winter 1998 issue of the Journal of Palestine Studies. Morris replied to many of Karsh's detailed accusations, but also returned Karsh's personal invective, going so far as to compare Karsh's work to that of Holocaust deniers. Karsh also published a reviewKarsh, 1999 on an article of Morris,Journal of Palestine Studies, Spring 1995, pp. 44–62 charging him with \\"deep-rooted and pervasive distortions\\". Karsh systematically rejects the methodology of new historians such as Morris in his book Fabricating Israeli History: The 'New Historians' (Israeli History, Politics and Society) (2000). * Teddy Katz versus Alexandroni Brigade In 1998, Teddy Katz interviewed and taped Israeli and Palestinian witnesses to events at Tantura in 1948 and wrote a master's thesis at Haifa University claiming that the Alexandroni Brigade committed a massacre in the Arab village of Tantura during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The veterans of the brigade sued Katz for libel. During the court hearing Katz conceded by issuing a statement retracting his own work. He then tried to retract his retraction, but the court disallowed it and ruled against him. He appealed to the Supreme Court but it declined to intervene. Meanwhile, a committee at Haifa University claimed to have found serious problems with the thesis, including \\"quotations\\" that were contradicted by Katz's taped records of interview. The university suspended his degree and asked him to resubmit his thesis. The new thesis was given a \\"second-class\\" pass. The Tantura debate remains heated, with Ilan Pappé continuing to support allegations of a massacre.

He derived the property's name from the short story \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\\". The building was destroyed in a 1923 fire, with a smaller replica built at the same site the following year. Conception, architecture, and construction Clemens met biographer Albert Bigelow Paine in 1906 while living in New York City. He decided to purchase 195 acres of land in Redding where Paine lived, purchasing his first parcel there March 24, 1906 and buying additional acreage in May and September that year. Clemens hired architect John Mead Howells of Howells & Stokes, son of the author William Dean Howells who was a friend and collaborator for 45 years. Clemens stipulated the house should be built in the style of a Tuscan villa, after having lived at Villa Viviani (1891-92) in Settignano and Villa di Quarto (1903-04) in Sesto Fiorentino outside Florence, Italy. Construction began in 1907; the project was nearly abandoned later that year due to cost and Clemens' misgivings about Redding's relative isolation, but the younger Howells convinced him that he would suffer a financial loss on work already underway. The house was completed in June 1908, built on elevated land known at the time as Birch Spray Hill on the west bank of the Saugatuck River. The exterior of the house featured a gray stucco finish and green- colored roof, with the foundation measuring 70 feet by 40 feet, flanked by wings measuring 20 feet by 18 feet. Howells designed the interior ground floor to include a central dining room, opening onto garden terraces and a fountain. In one wing was a drawing room opening onto an outdoor seating area; the other wing contained a billiards room decorated with caricatures of Clemens. The hand-carved mantel for the billiards room fireplace was a gift from the Sandwich Islanders. Twain had purchased a second, ornate mantel from Ayton Castle in Scotland that was installed in the living room; that mantel was damaged in the fire but restored, and is located today at the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, Connecticut where Clemens lived from 1874 to 1891. Residents of Redding met Clemens and Paine and Paine's daughter Louise at the West Redding train station on June 18, 1908 and accompanied them to the new house. It was the first time that Clemens had seen the house in person. Dan Beard was a nearby Redding resident whose illustrations appeared in several Mark Twain books. He helped set off fireworks to commemorate Clemens' arrival, describing a scene in which \\"sticks from the rockets fell in the pastures and sent the cattle and horses tearing around the fields.\\" Clemens' life and death at Stormfield Clemens initially named the villa \\"Autobiography house\\" and then \\"Innocence at Home\\" in reference to his European travel memoir The Innocents Abroad.http://cmgww.com/historic/twain/about/writings.htm He changed the name to Stormfield that autumn following a storm which alluded to his short story \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\\" and to the profits from it which he used to finance the construction. Two burglars broke into the house in September, 1908 and stole silver; they also exchanged shots with a deputy sheriff who was wounded. They were later apprehended aboard a train in Bethel, Connecticut and sentenced to prison. Clemens briefly met the men while they were in custody and subsequently posted a note on the front door of Stormfield addressed \\"To the next Burglar\\", advising them that the house contained \\"nothing but plated ware\\" which they could find \\"in that brass thing\\" by a basket of kittens; to make no noise to disturb the family; and to leave the kittens. He also added an entry in his guest book to note the burglars' arrival \\"without permission.\\" In his leisure time at Stormfield, Clemens enjoyed playing billiards and the card game hearts, reading, writing, smoking, and strolling the grounds. He hosted numerous famous visitors at Stormfield, including Thomas Edison who filmed the only surviving motion picture of Clemens, showing him walking the grounds of Stormfield. Others included Helen Keller, who lived in nearby Easton, Connecticut, and muckraker journalist Ida Tarbell, also an Easton resident. Clemens decided to endow a library in Redding, and he began charging visitors one dollar to raise funds for it. As a host, he was \\"dignified, courteous, and prodigal in his hospitality,\\" Beard wrote, \\"possessing all of the admirable characteristics of the best type of the old-fashioned Southern gentleman.\\" Snapshot taken at the marriage of Clara Clemens and Ossip Gabrilowitsch (from left to right: Samuel Clemens, Jervis Langdon, Jean Clemens, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Clara Clemens, Rev. Dr. Joseph Twichell) In 1909, Clemens purchased a nearby farm as a home for daughter Jean which he called Jean's Farm, who would serve as his secretary after the dismissal of Isabel Lyon. On October 6, 1909, Clara Clemens married pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch, with the ceremony held on the grounds of Stormfield. Clemens had given a farmhouse on property that he called the \\"Lobster Pot\\" to his secretary, household manager, and social companion Isabel Lyon as a Christmas present in 1907, only to dismiss her in 1909. He regained ownership of it in July 1909. Unfortunately, Jean died at Stormfield on December 24, the cause of death believed to be a heart attack during an epileptic seizure while taking a bath. Clemens subsequently wrote \\"The Death of Jean\\", believed to be the last work he ever completed. Clemens was suffering from a heart ailment in the spring of 1910 and sought to recuperate in Bermuda, but he returned to Stormfield April 12, 1910. He died April 21. Legacy Officials in Connecticut and New York estimated the value of Twain's estate at $471,000 ($11.9 million today). The Gabrilowitschs listed Stormfield for sale in 1910 for $50,000, and the Clemens' estate sold off several pieces of land between 1910 and 1923. Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch gave birth at Stormfield to daughter Nina on August 19, 1910 who was Samuel Clemens' last descendant; she died in 1966. Clara offered Stormfield for use as a convalescent facility for wounded soldiers and sailors in 1918. Margaret Given bought it and the remaining property in 1923. The mansion caught fire during renovations that year and was destroyed. An exterior garden stone wall is thought to be the lone remaining structure from the original Stormfield. Mary Millett bought the property in 1924 and built a small replica of Stormfield. She sold the house and property in 1927 to Doreen Danks. That house stands today on property totaling 28.5 acres on Mark Twain Lane in Redding. The town of Redding appraised the property at $1.9 million as of 2017. Stormfield Preserve Over the years, the Town of Redding spent some $575,000 to acquire more than 160 acres of the original Stormfield property, which today is maintained as a preserve including 4 miles of hiking trails open to the public. In 1986, a Redding town meeting voted not to commission a study assessing whether to designate the Stormfield area a historic district.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Human trafficking is the modern form of slavery, with illegal smuggling and trading of people, for forced labour or sexual exploitation. Trafficking is officially defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking is not synonymous with forced migration or smuggling. In the U.S., human trafficking tends to occur around international travel-hubs with large immigrant populations, notably California and Texas.CAST: Keys Statistics Freedom DeniedRescue & Restore Coalition. \\"Texas Facts on Human Traffickin.\\"Texasimpact.org/UMW/HumanTraffickFactSheet.doc. Web. February 22, 2012. The U.S. Justice Department estimates that 17,500 people are trafficked into the country every year, but the true figure could be higher, because of the large numbers of undocumented immigrants. The United States Department of State has also estimated that between 14,000-17,5000 people annually are trafficked for sex, labor, or other types of exploitation into the United States. Those being trafficked include young children, teenagers, men and women and can be domestic citizens or foreign nationals. The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 was based on a Minnesota state law called the Safe Harbor for Sexually Exploited Youth Act. The law \\"changed Minnesota's approach to meeting the needs of trafficked children by recognizing that prostituted children are victims of trafficking, not criminal perpetrators.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 would require each state, within three years, to have in effect legislation that: (1) treats a minor who has engaged or attempted to engage in a commercial sex act as a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, (2) discourages the charging or prosecution of such an individual for a prostitution or sex trafficking offense, and (3) encourages the diversion of such individual to child protection services. Authorizes the Attorney General to withhold specified Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds from a state that fails to comply with such requirement. The bill would increase the amount a victim of peonage, slavery, or trafficking in persons may recover in a civil action against the perpetrator to treble damages. Directs the Attorney General to establish a process to collect and analyze data relating to the issuance and enforcement of mandatory restitution orders with respect to such offenses. The bill would amend the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA) to require the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants annually for a national communication system to assist victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in communicating with service providers. The bill would amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to include victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons among those eligible for the Job Corps. The bill would direct the Attorney General to implement and maintain a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking that includes: (1) integrated federal, state, local, and tribal efforts to investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases; (2) case coordination within the Department of Justice (DOJ); and (3) interagency coordination regarding the prevention, investigation, and apprehension of individuals targeting and exploiting adults and children for human trafficking. The bill would amend the VTVPA to require the Attorney General's annual report on agency activities under such Act to including information on: (1) data relating to the issuance and enforcement of mandatory restitution orders with respect to peonage, slavery, and trafficking in persons; and (2) the number of sex and labor trafficking investigations that were opened by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the United States Department of Labor, or the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center or that were reported to the United States attorneys, the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit in DOJ's Civil Rights Division, and the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in DOJ's Criminal Division. The bill would amend the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to modify the definition of \\"tier III sex offender\\" to include a sex offender whose offense is: (1) punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, and (2) comparable to or more severe than sex trafficking committed against a minor or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such offense against a minor. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3610 would make several changes to laws related to human trafficking: :*Section 2 would allow the United States Attorney General to apply preferential treatment when making some public safety grants to states that have adopted certain laws related to trafficking victims, but would not change the funding level for those grants. :*Section 3 would require the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to expand its reporting on certain trafficking-related crimes. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects the provision would have little effect on the workload of the task force. :*Section 4 would require the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide funding for a national hotline for trafficking victims. Under current law, HHS already provides a multiyear grant that partially funds the National Human Trafficking Resource Center. :*Section 5 would make trafficking victims eligible to participate in the Job Corps if they meet the age and income requirements, but would not change total funding for the Job Corps program. The CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would have no significant effect on discretionary spending and would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3610 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 21, 2013 by Rep. Erik Paulsen (R, MN-3). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. On May 13, 2014, the bill was reported (amended) by the Committee on the Judiciary alongside House Report 113-447 part 1. It was scheduled to be voted on in the House on May 20, 2014 under a suspension of the rules. Debate and discussion According to the group Advocates for Human Rights, the legislation was needed because \\"trafficked children under age 18 continue to be adjudicated as 'delinquents' for engaging in prostitution, too often subjecting them to detention rather than providing services to help them recover from trafficking.\\" Shared Hope International also supported the legislation, offering a form letter on their website that citizens could sent to their members of Congress. The letter argues that the bill would help victims gain compensation and enable them to participate in the Job Corps training program, as well as improving laws to ensure that children are treated as victims and not criminals. The Seattle Times editorial board wrote an editorial in favor of the bill, calling on Congress to \\"strengthen U.S. laws to stop human trafficking.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Human trafficking in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3610 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3610 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3610 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3610 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3610 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3610 *House Report 113-447 part 1 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Human trafficking in the United States ","title":"Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013"},{"id":"42736287","text":"UOL DIVEO is an UOL group Universo Online owned firm that offers solutions in IT Outsourcing.

Life The son of Joseph Payne, a schoolmaster, and his wife Eliza Dyer who was also a teacher, he was born in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, on 10 Jan. 1840. After a school education under his father at Leatherhead, Surrey, he went to University College, London; and then gained in 1858 a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1862, taking a first class in natural science, and afterwards obtained the Burdett- Coutts scholarship in geology (1863), the Radcliffe travelling fellowship (1865), and a fellowship at Magdalen, which he vacated on his marriage in 1883, becoming an honorary fellow on 30 May 1906. He also took a B.Sc. degree in the University of London in 1865. Algernon Charles Swinburne with nine of his peers (including Payne) at Oxford, ca. 1850s Payne studied medicine at St. George's Hospital, London, and graduated M.B. at Oxford in 1867, M.D. in 1880. He became a member of the London College of Physicians in 1868, and was elected a fellow in 1873. His first post at a medical school in London was that of demonstrator of morbid anatomy at St. Mary's Hospital in 1869, and he became assistant physician there as well as at the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street. In 1871 he left St. Mary's on becoming assistant physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, a post which he held till appointed physician in 1887. In 1900 he had reached the age limit, and became consulting physician. He was also on the staff of the Hospital for Skin Diseases at Blackfriars. In September 1877 Payne was the chief medical witness for the defence at the sensational trial in London of Louis Staunton and others for the murder of Harriet Staunton, by starvation, and argued that cerebral meningitis was the cause of death, a view which later had support. In 1879 he was sent to Russia by the British government with Surgeon-major Colvill to observe and report on the epidemic of bubonic plague then in progress at Vetlanka, but illness prevented him from achieving much. He took an active part on a committee of the College of Physicians in 1905 on the Indian epidemic of plague and was chosen as the spokesman of the committee to the Secretary of State. In 1899 Payne was elected Harveian librarian of the College of Physicians, and gave many books to the library. He was for eight years an examiner for the licence of the College of Physicians, was a censor in 1896-7, and senior censor in 1905. He discharged in 1896 the duty of editor of the Nomenclature of Diseases and sat on: the Royal Commission on tuberculosis (1890); the General Medical Council as representative of the University of Oxford (1899-1904); the senate of the University of London (1899-1906); and the committee of the London Library. He lived at 78 Wimpole Street while engaged in practice, and after his retirement at New Barnet. Failing health interrupted Payne's writing in his last year. He died at Lyonsdown House, New Barnet, on 16 November 1910, and was buried at Bell's Hill cemetery. Works In accordance with the terms of Dr. Radcliffe's foundation Payne visited Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and made good use of their pathological opportunities. He described his experiences in three articles published in the British Medical Journal in 1871. Chosen to deliver the Goulstonian lectures in 1873, his subject was The Origin and Relation of New Growths. Pathology, epidemiology, dermatology, and the history of medicine were the subjects in which Payne took most interest. His first major contribution to the history of medicine was a life of John Linacre prefixed to a facsimile of the 1521 Cambridge edition of his Latin version of Galen, De Temperamentis (Cambridge, 1881). In 1896 he delivered the Harveian oration at the College of Physicians on the relation of William Harvey to Galen, and in 1900 wrote a life of Thomas Sydenham. He read (21 January 1901) a paper before the Bibliographical Society On the \\"Herbarius\\" and \\"Hortus Sanitatis.\\" In 1903 and 1904 Payne delivered the first FitzPatrick lectures on the history of medicine at the College of Physicians. The first course was on English Medicine in the Anglo-Saxon Times (Oxford, 1904), the second on English Medicine in the Anglo-Norman Period, covering Gilbertus Anglicus and the contents of his Compendium Medicinæ had never before been thoroughly set forth. The lectures of 1904 which Payne was preparing for the press at the time of his death address the writings of Ricardus Anglicanus and the anatomical teaching of the Middle Ages. Payne demonstrated that the Anatomy of the Body of Man, printed in Tudor times and of which the editions extend into the middle of the seventeenth century, was not written by Thomas Vicary, whose name appears on the title-page, but was a translation of a mediæval manuscript. Payne wrote articles on the history of medicine in the Encyclopædia Britannica, and in Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine (vol. i. 1905), besides several lives in this Dictionary. During the spring of 1909 he delivered a course of lectures on Galen and Greek medicine at the request of the delegates of the Common University Fund at Oxford. His last historical work was entitled 'History of the College Club,' and was privately printed in 1909. In 1907, Payne sought approval from the council of the Royal Society of Medicine to include regular discussions on the history of medicine. In 1875 Payne edited Charles Handfield Jones and Edward Henry Sieveking's Manual of Pathological Anatomy, and in 1888 published a Manual of General Pathology. He read papers before the Pathological Society, of which he became president in 1897. He delivered at the College of Physicians in 1901 the Lumleian lectures On Cancer, especially of the Internal Organs. Payne wrote articles on plague in the Encyclopædia Britannica, ninth edition, St. Thomas's Hospital Reports, Quarterly Review (October 1901), and Allbutt's System of Medicine, vol. 2, 1907. He printed in 1894, with an introduction on the history of the plague, the Loimographia of the apothecary William Boghurst, who witnessed the London plague of 1665, from the manuscript in the Sloane collection. He made contributions to the Transactions of the Epidemiological Society, of which he was president in 1892-3. In 1889 he published Observations on some Rare Diseases of the Skin, and was president of the Dermatological Society (1892-3); papers by him are in its Transactions. Family Payner married, on 1 September 1882, Helen, daughter of the Hon. John Macpherson of Melbourne, Victoria, by whom he had one son and three daughters.

The World Ophiuroidea Database - Astroboa nuda (Lyman, 1874) Naked Basket Star (Astroboa nuda) - Information on Naked Basket Star - Encyclopedia of Life Its large arms (up to armspread) are highly branched. It inhabits reef slopes exposed to current in diverse places such as the Red Sea and New Caledonia. During the day it coils into a tight ball. At night it spreads arms to form a basket to feed on plankton. They are part of the class Ophiuroidea, which is the largest class of echinoderms. The name Ophiuroidea comes from the roots, ophis, meaning snake and oura, which means tail, referring to the thin, spiraling shape of the basket stars’ arms.Stöhr S, O'Hara TD, Thuy B (2012) Global Diversity of Brittle Stars (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea). PLOS ONE 7(3): e31940. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0031940  Characteristics  The arms of basket stars are divided into five sections, with many smaller arms branching off of these sections. The arms can range throughout a variety of lengths both within and among individuals of Astroboa nuda. Shorter arms help the basket stars attach themselves to a substrate, and may also help carry food from the longer arms, which catch prey, to the mouth.Tsurnamal, M. & Marder, J.. (2013). Observations on the basket star Astroboa nuda (LYMAN) on coral reefs at Elat (Gulf of Aqaba). Israel Journal of Zoology. 15. 9-17. 10.1080/00212210.1966.10688225. A. nuda are usually dark violet, black, or dark brown in color, but can occasionally be pale yellow. Typically, the yellow A. nuda tend to be larger. However, these differences in color and size have not been shown to cause differences in behavior. A. nuda also serves as a host to large copepod populations. These copepods live in the stomach of the basket stars.Humes, Arthur. (2005). Two new species of Copepoda associated with the basket star Astroboa nuda (Ophiuroidea) in the Moluccas. Zoologica Scripta. 15. 323 - 332. 10.1111/j.1463-6409.1986.tb00233.x.  Feeding and Diet  Astroboa nuda is a filter feeder and usually feeds on plankton, along with larvae of decapods and copepods, as well as fish embryos. They may also occasionally obtain food from the surface of the substrate which they attach to. Typically, due to their light sensitivity, A. nuda hide in nearby shelters during the day, but branch out at night to feed. They feed from approximately two hours after sunset, to about one hour before sunrise. They usually return to the same spot every night, and are active during all seasons of the year. In addition, they try to place themselves near calm, barely touched waters. If the water in the area is heavily disturbed one night, they will usually stay sheltered behind coral heads, or other sections of the reef.  Predators  Basket stars generally have very few predators, as they are low in nutritional value, but are preyed upon by some fish.Matsumoto, H. (1915). A New Classification of the Ophiuroidea: With Descriptions of New Genera and Species. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 67(1), 57-58. Retrieved February 27, 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/4063659 Basket stars are often also caught by humans as part of by-catch during commercial fishing.Sink, Kerry & Boshoff, Willem & Samaai, Toufiek & Timm, P.G. & Kerwath, Sven. (2006). Observations of the habitats and biodiversity of the submarine canyons at Sodwana Bay. South African Journal of Science. 102. They may break off part or all of their arm in order to escape, but these arms will regenerate.  Habitat  A. nuda live in a variety of habitats, but are commonly found on the seafloor or at depths greater than twenty meters, burrowing into the sandy bottom. They are also found buried in mud, or within the holes of rocks or coral in tropical waters in areas such as Madagascar, Indonesia and Indo-Pacific regions, and occasionally in submarine canyons. Unlike some other species within Ophiuroidea that group together to form large clusters, Astroboa nuda are usually found alone or in groups of two to four.  Body Systems  In terms of the structure of A. nuda, they have no anus or intestines, and the mouth is found on the underside of the body. In addition, they have a simple digestive system consisting of an esophagus, along with a sac-like stomach. The waste product of basket stars comes in the form of ammonia, and is removed from the body through diffusion. The class Ophiuroidea usually reproduces sexually, although asexual reproduction by fission can occur as well. Typically, there are separate male and female basket stars, which release sperm and eggs into the water. The sperm and eggs then join, and the larvae develop in the water. This process is known as broadcast spawning.  Studies and Research  Not much research has been done regarding Astroboa nuda and basket stars in general. However, during one study, A. nuda were found to be very light sensitive. For this study, a high power electric torch was used to observe the basket stars, but once the torch was pointed directly towards the individuals, the arms began to coil inwards, with the thinner arms folding first and the entire organism eventually hiding, due to the resemblance between the light from the torch and daylight. When the discovery of basket stars and brittle stars began in the 18th century, the rate of research on these organisms reached its peak, however this rate leveled out and eventually lowered as time went on, with very little research being conducted currently. Furthermore, when looking at the fossil record, not much evidence has been found regarding the origin of basket stars, but some evidence shows they first began as brittle stars and diverged from there.

Approximately 20% of UK waters now have some protection although some conservation, fisherman and wildlife groups are concerned that there are no management plans for each zone.

It proceeds in the opposite direction to the so-called virtual screening (VS). In VS, the goal is to use a protein target to identify a high-affinity ligand from a search library typically containing hundreds of thousands of small molecules. In contrast, RS employs a known drug molecule to screen a protein library containing hundreds of thousands of individual structures (obtained from both experimental and modeling techniques). Accordingly, the extent to which this drug cross-reacts with the human proteome provides a measure of its efficacy and the potential long-term side-effects. RS is expected to play a key role in providing an additional layer of quality control in drug discovery.

Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.\\" is a phrase reportedly spoken by the commander of the Albigensian Crusade, prior to the massacre at Béziers on 22 July 1209. A direct translation of the Latin phrase is \\"Kill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own.\\" Papal legate and Cistercian abbot Arnaud Amalric was military commander of the Crusade in its initial phase and leader of this first major military action of the Crusade, the assault on Béziers, and was reported to have uttered the order by Caesarius of Heisterbach. Less formal English translations have given rise to variants such as \\"Kill them all; let God sort them out.\\" Some modern sources give the quotation as , evidently a translation from English back into Latin, and so omitting a biblical reference to 2 Timothy 2:19 evident in the original. Background Amalric's own version of the siege, described in his letter to Pope Innocent III in August 1209, states: > While discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of > those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other > persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders > from their leaders. To our amazement, crying \\"to arms, to arms!\\", within the > space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and > Béziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, > and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the > whole city was despoiled and burnt ... About thirteen years later Caesarius of Heisterbach relates this story about the massacre, with the papal legate quoted using the words : > When they discovered, from the admissions of some of them, that there were > Catholics mingled with the heretics they said to the abbot \\"Sir, what shall > we do, for we cannot distinguish between the faithful and the heretics.\\" The > abbot, like the others, was afraid that many, in fear of death, would > pretend to be Catholics, and after their departure, would return to their > heresy, and is said to have replied \\"Kill them all for the Lord knoweth them > that are His\\" (2 Tim. ii. 19) and so countless number in that town were > slain. Caesarius did not state definitively that this sentence had been uttered, he wrote that Amalric \\"was reported to have said it\\" (dixisse fertur in the original text). Whilst there remains doubt that the abbot said these words there is little if any doubt that these words captured the spirit of the assault, and that Arnaud and his crusaders planned to kill the inhabitants of any stronghold that offered resistance.William of Tudela, cited in Zoé Oldenburg, Massacre at Montségur, page 116 The crusaders (which Arnaud referred to as nostri, \\"our men\\") rampaged and killed without restraint. Meaning The Albigensian Crusade was intended to eliminate Catharism, a religious movement denounced by the Catholic Church as heretical. Béziers was not a Cathar stronghold but, according to contemporary Catholic records, home to almost 20,000 baptised Catholics and just over 300 baptised Cathars. Presented with the difficulty of distinguishing Catholics from the Cathars, especially if individuals might misrepresent their own beliefs, the phrase indicated that God would judge those who were killed, and accordingly \\"sort\\" them into Heaven or Hell. The phrase is generally recognised as a partial quotation from the Vulgate version of 2 Timothy 2:19 (). In the King James Version, the English translation of the verse is: \\"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His.\\" In culture The phrase has been adopted by members of the US military in various conflicts, such as the Vietnam War, and is used as an unofficial slogan by certain units. In parts of the War on Terror, the variant \\"Kill them all. Let Allah sort them out\\" has been used.

He later became a burlesque and vaudeville entrepreneur. Hill was one of the founders of the Columbia Amusement Company, an association of burlesque shows and theaters, and became president of the American Burlesque Association. He also staged drama and musical comedies. He launched a highly popular series of \\"cartoon theatricals\\", musical comedies based on comic strips or cartoons. At one time he was running fourteen different shows. Early years Gus Hill was born Gustave Metz in New York City on 22 February 1858. His parents, Gustave Metz and Martha E. Baecht Metz, were German immigrants. Gus was the oldest of three surviving boys. His father was the owner of a sawmill and furniture factory. Gus Hill was an amateur athlete. He became a wrestler and then a juggler with Indian clubs. He took the name \\"Hill\\" from a sporting resort at Broadway and Crosby Street in Manhattan called Harry Hill's. On 16 June 1876, when Hill was eighteen, he was listed as a club swinger on a bill for a vaudeville show at Tony Pastor's theater in New York. The show featured the \\"great Leonzo Brothers and their celebrated dog, Tiger.\\" He would travel around the country challenging local jugglers to compete. On his first appearance he would let the local win. He would challenge them to a repeat match when he returned, ensuring a full house, and would then defeat the local. He gained the title of \\"Champion Clubman of the World\\". There was some sharp practice involved, but the title was useful in his variety act billings. Vaudeville manager 1888 sports card Gus Hill soon moved into show business management, although he continued to perform for ten years or more. Hill produced Gus Hill's Mammoth Novelty Company in the 1885–86 season, and performed in the show with his Indian clubs. He produced Gus Hill's World of Novelties in the 1886–87 season, featuring the new performers Joe Weber and Lew Fields. Hill produced musical comedies priced low for unsophisticated audiences far from Broadway. The scenery was designed to fold up into specially designed trunks to save space. Hill was known for cost-cutting, using old scenery and costumes, and employing performers who could not demand high wages since they were not yet known, or were past their peak. In 1892 Hill added a second company, Gus Hill's New York Vaudeville Stars. Hill would put on shows from Monday to Saturday each week, including Wednesday and Saturday matinees. Hill made all the travel arrangements. Typically the show moved to a new city by train on a Monday morning, and were put up at a boarding house for performers at their destination. Hill owned several of these boarding houses, as did other variety company owners. The cast would share rooms, and would be given their meals at the boarding house. This kept expenses down, but conditions were acceptable for the performers. Hill signed up David C. Montgomery & Fred Stone in May 1896. By this time he was one of the richest of the variety show promoters. A reviewer described Hill's show at the Haymarket Theater in Chicago in 1896: For the 1896–97 season Hill added three burlesque companies and the cartoon theatrical McFadden's Row of Flats. Gus Hill's Ideal Minstrels first appeared in 1898. That year he produced a series of melodramas written by Owen Davis. The next year he introduced the Royal Lilliputians, a freak show. He managed to poach Billy Reeves from Fred Karno's show to appear in his own Around the Clock vaudeville company. Eddie Cantor also played in his vaudeville shows. Alice in Wonderland Burlesque and other enterprises Gus Hill's Aggregation and Gus Hill's Stars were burlesque shows, but included variety acts and were cleaner than others. Gus Hill was one of sixteen producers who incorporated the Columbia Amusement Company on 12 July 1902. With the \\"Columbia Wheel\\" a series of companies followed each other round a circuit of theaters, a concept for which he claimed the credit. Hill produced three burlesque shows each season for Columbia until the early 1910s, when he leased his franchise to other producers so he could devote more time to Mutt and Jeff. The Columbia Wheel came to operate two large burlesque circuits after buying a rival. In May 1915 the company arranged to transfer its No. 2 circuit, which had forty theaters and thirty-four touring companies, to a new corporation called the American Burlesque Association. Gus Hill was named president of the new entity. Hill funded a number of African American reviews. One of these was Gus Hill's Smart Set Company, which starred performers such as Billy McClain, Ernest Hogan, Tom McIntosh and Sherman H. Dudley. The troupe staged vaudeville-style shows with comedy sketches, songs, dances and specialty acts. Gus Hill's Smart Set put on the touring show The Black Politician, a musical comedy, in 1904–08. Music and lyrics were by James Reese Europe and Cecil Mack. It starred Jim Burris, Tom Logan and Irvin Allen. At this time Hill was running fourteen different shows. He had a mule which had appeared in McFadden Flats, and then was moved to other revues without success. Hill gave the mule to Dudley, who brought it on stage and created a sensation. Salem Tutt Whitney joined the Smart Set Company in 1905. In 1909 he and J. Homer Tutt organized the Whitney Musical Comedy Company, which toured under Hill's management as the Southern Smart Set Company. Hill ventured into film production with the Nonpareil Feature Film Company in 1914. The first film released was the pseudo-documentary The Line Up at Police Headquarters. Hill announced plans to make a series of single-reel Happy Hooligan episodes, but none appeared. Nonpareil released a version of Alice in Wonderland, starring Viola Savoy. The company appears to have then quietly folded. Poster for McFadden's Flats (1902), based on a series from The Yellow Kid Scene from Hill's 1914 production of Bringing Up Father Cartoon theatricals A \\"cartoon theatrical\\" is a live theater performance based on a comic strip or cartoon. More than two hundred cartoon theatricals were produced between 1896 and 1927, about fifty of them original and the others derivative. Gus Hill was involved in over half of them. In the 1890s Hill started producing a vaudeville act that was based on New York Sunday World's cartoon, The Yellow Kid. He later added characters from other cartoons such as Mutt and Jeff and the Happy Hooligan. He was also responsible for Alphonse and Gaston and Bringing Up Father among others. Most of the theatricals were musical comedies. Hill produced these \\"cartoon theatricals\\", or musicals based on comic strips, into 1920s. The theatricals would first play in legitimate road shows, then move to Hill's burlesque franchises. The Yellow Kid cartoon featured a series called McFadden's Row of Flats in the New York Journal in 1896. Gus Hill's McFadden's Row of Flats opened in London on 22 October 1896. The play was a broad comedy revolving around interactions between Dan McFadden and Sandy McTavish, stereotypes of the witty Irishman and the tight-fisted Scot. Another theme is McFadden's daughter, who is sent to finishing school and becomes too much of a lady to acknowledge her father in public. In the end McFadden's daughter marries McTavish's son and all ends well. The play was the basis for the silent film McFadden's Flats made in 1927 and another silent film with the same name made in 1935. The 1927 film featured Charlie Murray, Chester Conklin and Edna Murphy. The 1935 film, adapted by Casey Robinson, featured Walter C. Kelly, Andy Clyde and Richard Cromwell. It remained true to the play's vaudeville origins and received friendly reviews. Hill's Mutt and Jeff, and sequels such as Mutt and Jeff in Panama (1913–14) and Mutt and Jeff in College (1915–16), ran from the 1910–11 season through to the 1927–28 season, and at one time had six companies playing the show in different places. In 1922 Hill staged a version of Mutt and Jeff performed by Conoly's Colored Comedians at the Lafayette Theatre, New York. A reviewer in Billboard said :There is no reason why this show should not furnish a very complete evening's entertainment for either colored or white audiences. In the twenty- three song numbers and specialties one is certain to find several that will tickle any fancy. The chorus is fast and the wardrobe gorgeous.\\" Hill first staged Happy Hooligan in the early 1900s, and was still staging a version of that show in the 1923–24 season. Bringing up Father ran from 1913–14 to 1932–33, with up to three companies at one time. In April 1921 Hill spoke as president of the 110-member Touring Managers' Association, which employed about 6,000 actors. He said his group would strongly oppose the Actors' Equity Association. He said the increasing exactions of the actors, the musicians and the stage hands had made producing more and more unprofitable. By the 1927–28 season the Columbia Burlesque Circuit was struggling financially. This was the last season where cartoon theatricals were a significant part of the burlesque shows. Hill produced Gus Hill's Midgets in 1929, marking the end of his career as a producer. He continued to perform as a club swinger in charitable events and nostalgia shows. Gus Hill died of a heart attack in New York City on 20 April 1937. He was aged 79.

LST was founded by Vanderbilt Law School graduates Kyle McEntee and Patrick Lynch. LST describes its mission as \\"to make entry to the legal profession more transparent, affordable, and fair.\\"LST Mission, Law School Transparency.  History  Law School Transparency was founded in July 2009 by two law students at Vanderbilt University Law School, Kyle McEntee and Patrick J. Lynch. When Lynch obtained a job practicing environmental law with a nongovernmental organization in South America, he reduced his involvement in LST.Rachel M. Zahorsky, Legal Rebels: Kyle McEntee Challenges Law Schools to Come Clean, September 19, 2012 Derek Tokaz, a graduate of NYU Law School, also works on several LST projects. From the outset, one of the greatest challenges LST faced was securing funding and resources. Their goal was to improve legal education and the legal profession through increased access to high-quality post-graduation job-outcome information. The duo was motivated by Vanderbilt's comprehensive disclosure of job outcomes in early 2008. McEntee and several of his classmates decided to attend Vanderbilt in fall 2008 in part due to the information revealed by the law school.LST's Origins, Law School Transparency. In order to increase access to better information, McEntee and Lynch first identified two key problems with law school disclosure practices in a white paper originally published in April 2010.Kyle P. McEntee and Patrick J. Lynch, A Way Forward: Transparency at American Law Schools, SSRN, April 10, 2010.Karen Sloan, Law Students Push Schools for Better Employment Numbers, National Law Journal, April 21, 2010. An updated version of the white paper was published by Pace Law Review two years later. First, law schools provided misleading and incomplete employment information that took advantage of how students understand law schools and the legal profession.John Eligon, Jobs Data More Vital to Her Than Food, The New York Times, August 27, 2010.David Segal, For 2nd Year, a Sharp Drop in Law School Entrance Tests, The New York Times, March 20, 2012. For example, law schools advertised basic employment rates that included any job in the numerator, whether short-term or long-term, part-time or full-time, legal or non-legal. Schools even counted volunteer jobs funded by the law school, leading almost every school to report employment rates over 90%. In addition, law schools reported deceptively high starting salaries. Notably, law schools reported the median salary for a small percentage of the class without disclosing the response rate or sampling bias.Amanda Becker, Critics say law schools don't give students realistic career expectations, The Washington Post, February 18, 2011. Second, law schools did not share basic information they possessed that would have helped students better understand school offerings and career paths. The result was an information asymmetry favoring law schools that enabled law schools to raise tuition prices indiscriminately.Kyle P. McEntee and Patrick J. Lynch, A Way Forward: Transparency at American Law Schools, Pace Law Review (2012), available at SSRN. To solve these problems, LST asked law schools to voluntarily disclose basic employment information about recent graduates.Debra Cassens Weiss, New Nonprofit Asks Law Schools for Detailed Salary, Job Information, ABA Journal, July 13, 2010. Knowing that law schools would decline initially, McEntee and Lynch were actually targeting the American Bar Association's accreditation standards. By 2012, LST succeeded in reforming the ABA standards to better protect students and to hold law schools accountable, and in changing attitudes about how law schools interact with prospective students.David Yellen, Advancing Transparency in Law School Employment Data: The ABA's New Standard 509, The Bar Examiner, December 2012. David Lat contended that \\"Most observers are content just to complain about law schools not being forthcoming enough about employment information.\\"David Lat & Elie Mystal, Increasing Transparency in Employment Reporting by Law Schools: What Is to Be Done?, Above the Law, April 21, 2010. Elie Mystal added that \\"McEntee and Lynch are trying to fill a void left open by organizations with regulatory power (e.g. American Bar Association (the ABA)), organizations with public power (e.g. U.S. News & World Report (U.S. News)), and organizations with no power (e.g. National Association for Law Placement (NALP)).\\" Writing for American Lawyer Media's The Careerist, Vivia Chen observed that \\"It's not easy getting the attention of a mammoth organization like ABA, but LST did it. It deserves our kudos.\\"Vivia Chen, Law School Transparency Gets R-E-S-P-E-C-T, The Careerist, June 14, 2011.  Programs  = LST Score Reports = This web tool helps students make smart application and enrollment choices using admissions, employment, and cost information. While not rankings, they do serve as an alternative to conventional law school rankings. LST does not reduce complex data to a single metric. Instead, LST's tool focuses students on schools that have observable relationships to specific legal markets and job types. The result is a product that makes appropriate, useful comparisons and provides a thorough understanding of how schools stack up, how much they cost, and how they’re trending. = LST Transparency Index = This project affects how law schools disclose consumer information and impacts how the ABA enforces Standard 509, the accreditation standard LST played a major role in enhancing. In the most recent index, LST did a two-fold analysis of law school websites. First it asked whether law schools were violating any part of Standard 509. This portion of the index was designed to ensure law schools follow the rules and to ensure that the ABA is held accountable for its failure to enforce. Second it asked whether law schools were meeting transparency norms set by LST. This portion of the index was designed to change the norms under which law schools operate. = NALP Report Database = This project tracks whether law schools are disclosing an employment report that they receive from NALP. LST began tracking the publication of these reports for graduates from the class of 2010. At that time, no law schools published so-called NALP Reports. As of May 2014, 56% of ABA-approved law schools published their class of 2012 NALP Reports.Kyle McEntee, Transparency Review in Advance of New Law School Jobs Data, Law.com, April 4, 2014.  Leadership  LST is led by its executive director and co-founder, Kyle McEntee. Patrick J. Lynch, the other co-founder, is the chair of the board of directors. LST relies on many volunteers and on part-time consultants and employees.LST Team, Law School Transparency.

Many years before the internet and unfinished cable television system emerged, Hollander served as a prolific supplier of encyclopedias on every major sport. At this point, he edited, wrote or packaged around 300 books over a professional career that spanned 45 years. Born as Alexander Hollander in Brooklyn, New York, he grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens. At age 14, he found his emerging sports ability writing columns for a neighborhood newspaper, and then in high school, he wrote for the Long Island Daily Press and the New York World-Telegram. He later attended Queens College but left to serve in the Army Air Forces, assigned to an Army newspaper in Hawaii. After his discharge, he enrolled at City College of New York but did not graduate. The heavy workload never really ended for Hollander. In 1955 he founded Associated Features, a company which produced booklets that were distributed with assorted promotional products, but it was not a lucrative enterprise. Even when immersed in several editorial projects, he would occasionally take a freelance shift on the Daily News sports desk. After a stint with United Press International as an editor in New York, Hollander was hired as a sportswriter by the World-Telegram, originally to cover yachting. Before he committed full-time to his company in the mid-1960s, his day might consist of visiting potential clients and writing on a freelance basis for magazines, followed by phone calls to Western Union so he could meet the World-Telegram midnight deadline. Besides this, he reported for the Associated Press about his stay in the Soviet Union.IMDb.com – Zander Hollander biography Hollander decided to quit newspapers in 1966, when he rejected an offer to work as editor of the World-Telegram and Sun, as it had become after merging with two other New York newspapers, the Herald Tribune and the Journal-American. He then turned his attention to his Associated Features business in the years to come. From 1971 through 1997, Hollander found a niche in the bookstores by annually providing career statistics and profiles of players, team rosters, all-time records, articles with photos, scouting reports, schedules and predictions for the upcoming season, in the form of brick-size tomes, 400-plus pages, he titled Complete Handbooks. In them, he showed his experience and deep knowledge of professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey and tennis, as well as jai alai, soccer and college basketball and football. But the aforementioned yearbooks of Hollander were just one part his multifaceted sports knowledge. He also chronicled sports bloopers and wrote a history of Madison Square Garden, among other subjects. During his time as a journalist, he started a lifelong friendship with a then young lawyer, Howard Cosell, who represented the Little League of New York and had been asked by the local radio station WABC to host a show featuring youth ballplayers. Hollander agreed to collaborate by writing scripts and recruiting sports celebrities for the show. They were not paid for their services, but it was the beginning of a successful sports broadcasting career for Cosell.IMDb.com – Howard Cosell : Telling It Like It Is (1999 Documentary) In a 2001 interview, Hollander explained that as soon as he could hold a pencil and throw a ball, he dreamed of being a sportswriter. At the same time, he remembered that his first journalism effort was writing on a mimeographed newspaper in elementary school. Hollander suffered from Alzheimer's disease during his later life. He died on April 11, 2014 in Manhattan, New York, at the age of 91.

With origins in sociology, as well as in literary criticism, it argues that social problems are influenced and created more by societal structures and cultural assumptions than by individual and psychological factors. Maintaining that ideology is the principal obstacle to human liberation,Geuss, R. The Idea of a Critical Theory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ch. 4. critical theory was established as a school of thought primarily by the Frankfurt School theoreticians Herbert Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Erich Fromm, and Max Horkheimer. The latter sociologist described a theory as critical insofar as it seeks \\"to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them.\\"(Horkheimer 1982, 244) In sociology and political philosophy, the term Critical Theory describes the Western-Marxist philosophy of the Frankfurt School, which was developed in Germany in the 1930s and draws on the ideas of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Though a \\"critical theory\\" or a \\"critical social theory\\" may have similar elements of thought, the capitalization of Critical Theory as if it were a proper noun particularly stresses the intellectual lineage specific to the Frankfurt School. Modern critical theory has additionally been influenced by György Lukács and Antonio Gramsci, as well as second-generation Frankfurt School scholars, notably Jürgen Habermas. In Habermas' work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in German idealism and progressed closer to American pragmatism. Concern for social \\"base and superstructure\\" is one of the remaining Marxist philosophical concepts in much of contemporary critical theory.Outhwaite, William. [1988] 2009. Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers (2nd ed.). . Postmodern critical theory analyzes the fragmentation of cultural identities in order to challenge modernist-era constructs such as metanarratives, rationality, and universal truths, while politicizing social problems \\"by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings.\\" Overview Critical theory () was first defined by Max Horkheimer of the Frankfurt School of sociology in his 1937 essay \\"Traditional and Critical Theory\\", in which it is described as a social theory oriented toward critiquing and changing society as a whole, in contrast to traditional theory oriented only to understanding or explaining it. Wanting to distinguish critical theory as a radical, emancipatory form of Marxist philosophy, Horkheimer critiqued both the model of science put forward by logical positivism, and what he and his colleagues saw as the covert positivism and authoritarianism of orthodox Marxism and Communism. He described a theory as critical insofar as it seeks \\"to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them.\\"Horkheimer 1982, p. 244. Critical theory involves a normative dimension, either through criticizing society from some general theory of values, norms (or oughts), or through criticizing it in terms of its own espoused values (i.e. immanent critique). The core concepts of critical theory are that it should: # be directed at the totality of society in its historical specificity (i.e. how it came to be configured at a specific point in time); and # improve understanding of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology. = Kant and Marx = This version of \\"critical\\" theory derives from the use of the term critique by Immanuel Kant (18th century), in his Critique of Pure Reason; and Marx (19th century), through the concept that his Das Kapital forms a \\"critique of political economy.\\" For Kant's transcendental idealism, critique means examining and establishing the limits of the validity of a faculty, type, or body of knowledge, especially through accounting for the limitations imposed by the fundamental, irreducible concepts in use in that knowledge system. Kant's notion of critique has been associated with the overturning of false, unprovable, or dogmatic philosophical, social, and political beliefs. His critique of reason involved the critique of dogmatic theological and metaphysical ideas, and was intertwined with the enhancement of ethical autonomy and the Enlightenment critique of superstition and irrational authority. Ignored by many in \\"critical realist\\" circles, however, is that Kant's immediate impetus for writing his Critique of Pure Reason was to address problems raised by David Hume's skeptical empiricism which, in attacking metaphysics, employed reason and logic to argue against the knowability of the world and common notions of causation. Kant, by contrast, pushed the employment of a priori metaphysical claims as requisite, for if anything is to be said to be knowable, it would have to be established upon abstractions distinct from perceivable phenomena. Marx explicitly developed the notion of critique into the critique of ideology, linking it with the practice of social revolution, as stated in the eleventh section of his famous Theses on Feuerbach: \\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.\\" = Adorno and Horkheimer = One of the distinguishing characteristics of critical theory, as Adorno and Horkheimer elaborated in their Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), is a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence which gave rise to the \\"pessimism\\" of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom.Adorno, Theodor W., and Max Horkheimer. [1947] 2002. Dialectic of Enlightenment, translated by E. Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 242. This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, particularly the rise of National Socialism, state capitalism, and culture industry as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.Habermas, Jürgen. 1987. \\"The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment: Horkheimer and Adorno.\\" In The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures, translated by F. Lawrence. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. p. 116: \\"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer's circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions.\\"Dubiel, Helmut. 1985. Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory, translated by B. Gregg. Cambridge, MA. For Adorno and Horkheimer, state intervention in the economy had effectively abolished the traditional tension between the \\"relations of production\\" and \\"material productive forces of society according to traditional Marxism. The market (as an \\"unconscious\\" mechanism for the distribution of goods) had been replaced by centralized planning.Dialectic of Enlightenment. p. 38: \\"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism.\\" Contrary to Marx's famous prediction in the Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, this shift did not lead to \\"an era of social revolution,\\" but rather to fascism and totalitarianism. As such, critical theory was left, in Jürgen Habermas' words, without \\"anything in reserve to which it might appeal, and when the forces of production enter into a baneful symbiosis with the relations of production that they were supposed to blow wide open, there is no longer any dynamism upon which critique could base its hope.\\"\\"The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment,\\" p. 118. For Adorno and Horkheimer, this posed the problem of how to account for the apparent persistence of domination in the absence of the very contradiction that, according to traditional critical theory, was the source of domination itself. = Habermas = In the 1960s, Jürgen Habermas, a proponent of critical social theory,Katsiaficas, George N., Robert George Kirkpatrick, and Mary Lou Emery. 1987. Introduction to Critical Sociology. Irvington Publishers. p. 26. raised the epistemological discussion to a new level in his Knowledge and Human Interests (1968), by identifying critical knowledge as based on principles that differentiated it either from the natural sciences or the humanities, through its orientation to self-reflection and emancipation.Laurie, Timothy, Hannah Stark, and Briohny Walker. 2019. \\"Critical Approaches to Continental Philosophy: Intellectual Community, Disciplinary Identity, and the Politics of Inclusion.\\" Parrhesia 30:1–17. . (Discusses critical social theory as a form of self-reflection.) Although unsatisfied with Adorno and Horkheimer's thought presented in Dialectic of Enlightenment, Habermas shares the view that, in the form of instrumental rationality, the era of modernity marks a move away from the liberation of enlightenment and toward a new form of enslavement. In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in German idealism, and progressed closer to American pragmatism. Habermas is now influencing the philosophy of law in many countries—for example the creation of the social philosophy of law in Brazil—and his theory also has the potential to make the discourse of law one important institution of the modern world as a heritage of the Enlightenment.Bittar, Eduardo C. B. 2013. Democracia, Justiça e Emancipação Social. São Paulo: Quartier Latin. His ideas regarding the relationship between modernity and rationalization are in this sense strongly influenced by Max Weber. Habermas dissolved further the elements of critical theory derived from Hegelian German Idealism, although his thought remains broadly Marxist in its epistemological approach. Perhaps his two most influential ideas are the concepts of the public sphere and communicative action; the latter arriving partly as a reaction to new post-structural or so- called \\"postmodern\\" challenges to the discourse of modernity. Habermas engaged in regular correspondence with Richard Rorty and a strong sense of philosophical pragmatism may be felt in his theory; thought which frequently traverses the boundaries between sociology and philosophy. In academia =Postmodern critical social theory= Focusing on language, symbolism, communication, and social construction, critical theory has been applied within the social sciences as a critique of social construction and postmodern society. While modernist critical theory (as described above) concerns itself with \\"forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and corporate capitalism as a political-economic system,\\" postmodern critical theory politicizes social problems \\"by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings.\\" Meaning itself is seen as unstable due to the rapid transformation in social structures. As a result, the focus of research is centered on local manifestations, rather than broad generalizations. Postmodern critical research is also characterized by the crisis of representation, which rejects the idea that a researcher's work is an \\"objective depiction of a stable other.\\" Instead, many postmodern scholars have adopted \\"alternatives that encourage reflection about the 'politics and poetics' of their work. In these accounts, the embodied, collaborative, dialogic, and improvisational aspects of qualitative research are clarified.\\"Lindlof & Taylor, 2002, p. 53 The term critical theory is often appropriated when an author works within sociological terms, yet attacks the social or human sciences, thus attempting to remain \\"outside\\" those frames of inquiry. Michel Foucault has been described as one such author. Jean Baudrillard has also been described as a critical theorist to the extent that he was an unconventional and critical sociologist; this appropriation is similarly casual, holding little or no relation to the Frankfurt School. In contrast, Jürgen Habermas of The Frankfurt School is one of the key critics of postmodernism. Communication studies From the 1960s and 1970s onward, language, symbolism, text, and meaning came to be seen as the theoretical foundation for the humanities, through the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ferdinand de Saussure, George Herbert Mead, Noam Chomsky, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and other thinkers in linguistic and analytic philosophy, structural linguistics, symbolic interactionism, hermeneutics, semiology, linguistically-oriented psychoanalysis (Jacques Lacan, Alfred Lorenzer), and deconstruction. When, in the 1970s and 1980s, Jürgen Habermas redefined critical social theory as a study of communication, with communicative competence and communicative rationality on the one hand, and distorted communication on the other, the two versions of critical theory began to overlap to a much greater degree than before. =Pedagogy= Critical theorists have widely credited Paulo Freire for the first applications of critical theory towards education/pedagogy, considering his best-known work to be Pedagogy of the Oppressed, a seminal text in what is now known as the philosophy and social movement of critical pedagogy.For a history of the emergence of critical theory in the field of education, see Gottesman, Isaac. 2016. The Critical Turn in Education: From Marxist Critique to Postructuralist Feminism to Critical Theories of Race. New York: Routledge. Dedicated to the oppressed and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults to read and write, Freire includes a detailed Marxist class analysis in his exploration of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. In the book, Freire calls traditional pedagogy the \\"banking model of education,\\" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a piggy bank. He argues that pedagogy should instead treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge. In contrast to the banking model, the teacher in the critical-theory model is not dispenser of all knowledge, the sage on a stage, but a participant who learns with and from the students—in conversation with them; even as they are learning from the teacher. The goal is to liberate the learner from an oppressive construct of teacher versus student, a dichotomy analogous to colonizer and colonized. It is not enough for the student to analyze societal power structures and hierarchies, to merely recognize imbalance and inequity; critical theory pedagogy must also empower the learner to both reflect and act on that reflection to challenge an oppressive status quo. Criticism While critical theorists have been frequently defined as Marxist intellectuals,See, e.g., Kołakowski, Leszek. [1976] 1979. Main Currents of Marxism 3. W. W. Norton & Company. . ch. 10. their tendency to denounce some Marxist concepts and to combine Marxian analysis with other sociological and philosophical traditions has resulted in accusations of revisionism by classical, orthodox, and analytical Marxists, and by Marxist–Leninist philosophers. Martin Jay has stated that the first generation of critical theory is best understood as not promoting a specific philosophical agenda or a specific ideology, but as \\"a gadfly of other systems.\\" Critical theory has been criticized for not offering any clear road map to political action (praxis) following critique, often explicitly repudiating any solutions (such as with Herbert Marcuse's \\"the Great Refusal\\", which promoted abstaining from engaging in active political change).Corradetti, Claudio. \\"The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory.\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. A primary criticism of the theory is that it is anti-scientific, both for its lack of the use of the scientific method, and for its overt criticism of science as a tool used for oppression of marginalized groups of people.

It is owned and run by businessman Simon Stagg.  Fictional history  Stagg Enterprises was founded by CEO and billionaire Simon Stagg who has offices in New York City, Los Angeles and Gotham City. His company is responsible for pioneering new, innovative methods in the fields of engineering, chemistry and genetics. Stagg Industries had various subsidiaries; Stagg Mining Company, Stagg Cruise Lines, and Stagg Robotics. Simon Stagg used his business to concoct various schemes to keep Sapphire and Rex Mason apart – some of which, even put Metamorpho's life at great risk. Simon Stagg was responsible for genetically engineering the sentient Neanderthal man known as Java. He kept Java under his employ as his personal bodyguard and chauffeur. Stagg later manipulated events, forcing Sapphire Stagg to leave Rex and marry Java. Stagg Enterprises hired Rex Mason, a soldier for hire, was contracted by Simon Stagg to find the Orb of Ra. When he found it, his cohort, Java, stole it and left Rex in the light of an ancient meteor. This meteor transformed Mason into Metamorpho, the Element Man.Brave and the Bold No. 57 A disgruntled employee, Kurt Vornak, once turned himself into an atomic entity and sought to avenge himself against Stagg by turning one of his brand new corporate offices into molten slag. The incident endangered the life of Simon's daughter, Sapphire Stagg, but she was rescued thanks to the efforts of Simon's assistant Java.Metamorpho No. 1 Stagg Enterprises transforms an architect into a second Metamorpho to replace the original, who has left his employ, but the plan backfires.Metamorpho No. 5 The company was assigned by the president to investigate flying saucers buzzing the United States, and discover the \\"aliens\\" are really an Earth criminal and his gang out to conquer America.Metamorpho No. 11 Stagg Enterprises is one of the companies providing sponsorship to the superhero team The Conglomerate.

In the episode \\"Metamorphosis\\", the company's developments were becoming too dangerous as Simon Stagg wanted to create the ultimate soldier, a Metamorpho, for the U.S. Military. Simon had Java smuggle some chemicals for doing this into the country during which some of it leaked from a container and nearly caused a train wreck which was prevented by the Green Lantern. Like in the comics, his favorite employee Rex Mason was in love with Sapphire Stagg, of whom Simon was jealously protective. Simon decides to \\"protect\\" his daughter by testing the chemicals on Rex, transforming him into a shape- shifting mutant, and later tricks him into fighting Green Lantern and the Justice League. Upon learning the truth, Rex went after Simon in which the first attempt had Rex frozen to below zero temperatures. Simon's men dispose of Metamorpho but the metahuman later brakes free. During his second confrontation with Metamorpho at his company, an accident renders Simon mindless, with his base desires being transferred into some of his chemicals, creating a monstrous synthoid creature (with resemblance to Chemo) that rampaged throughout Metropolis. When the synthoid was destroyed by Metamorpho, Simon woke up in the hospital screaming. * Stagg Industries is a publicly traded company (STGG) in Beware the Batman where the corporate headquarters is in Gotham City and named Stagg Center. In \\"Hunted\\", the companies CEO Simon Stagg is kidnapped by Professor Pyg and Mister Toad for revenge after a land deal he was involved in resulted in severe damage to the environment. In \\"Toxic\\", Batman later broke into Stagg Industries to learn the origin of Metamorpho. Batman learned Stagg manipulated a security guard in love with Sapphire Stagg into being a test subject for a game changer dubbed Project Metamorpho. Stagg Industries found a way to weaponize genetic tissue and create an elemental super soldier. Batman's attempt to synthesize a cure failed but turned over all of the security footage of events that led to Rex Mason's transformation to the Gotham City Police Department. The Fightback Movement was in the midst of protests outside the Stagg Center. In \\"Allies\\", Tobias Whale's gang were robbing one of Stagg Enterprise's warehouses. In \\"Monsters\\", Batman suspects Simon of hiring and providing thugs with armor and weapons to drive people out of Old Gotham and buy the territory for profit. He visits Simon in his cell at Blackgate Penitentiary, but Stagg denies being involved in the scheme. The culprit is later revealed to be Sapphire who seeks to impress her father. Batman threatens Sapphire to stop while withholding Rex's survival from her. * In Arrow, Stagg is mentioned. In the episode \\"Legacies\\", it is one of Laurel Lance's law firm's CNRI biggest benefactors.

Formed in 2007, the group consisted of Malcolm Brickhouse (guitar, vocals, key songwriter, composer), Jarad Dawkins (drums), and Alec Atkins (bass). History Founding members Malcolm Brickhouse and Jarad Dawkins met each other at a birthday party in 2005. Sharing similar tastes in music, they decided to create a band. They felt their band needed a bassist but none of their friends were musicians. So they taught their pre-school friend, Alec Atkins, how to play the bass guitar from scratch. Their street performances in Times Square and around New York City led to people recording and uploading videos of them to YouTube and social media. The trio have since appeared on national television, including NBC's The Tonight Show, ABC's The View, CNN, Fuse, BET, and Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report. In 2014, they were the youngest group to perform at Coachella. They have performed at the Afropunk Festival, SXSW, and were the youngest band to play at the 2014 Vans Warped Tour. They have also performed at the music festivals Heavy Montréal and Bonnaroo. The group have supported Guns N' Roses, Motörhead, Queens of the Stone Age, Living Colour, Slash and Marilyn Manson, while also appearing in commercials for Airheads, AT&T;, Beats by Dr. Dre, Maybelline and Verizon. The band has been featured in Spin, Revolver, Guitar World, Rolling Stone, New York Daily News, Village Voice, New York Post, New York and Los Angeles Times The Huffington Post, Loudwire and Guitar World, all while attending middle school and now high school. In 2014, the band signed a $1.8 million contract for five albums with Sony Music Entertainment. Due to the age of the members of the band, the contract had to be approved through the New York Supreme Court. In 2015, the band successfully negotiated their release from the contract with the label. In April 2016, the band announced the release of their full-length debut album, Chaos. The album was released on June 17, 2016 via TuneCore. A feature-length documentary film about the band, entitled Breaking a Monster, was released in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer of 2016. On April 27, Loudwire premiered their first video \\"Take Control\\". They released a few more singles, \\"My Chains\\" (2017), \\"Come Closer\\" (2018), \\"Mama\\" (2018) and \\"Pretend\\" (2019). In January 2020, it was announced the band had ended and frontman Malcolm Brickhouse would be ensuing a solo career under the moniker Malxolm Brixkhouse.  Style and influences  Unlocking the Truth's sound has been described as \\"a salute to old-school metal that also blends modern influences.\\" In the Los Angeles Times, Randall Roberts wrote of their Coachella performance as \\"a hard, distorted blend of metal, speed punk and alternative rock on the main stage, they were as well-practiced as units three times their age.\\" Artist Direct says \\"they are the future of music.\\" The band has cited influences such as Metallica, Slipknot, Disturbed, Living Colour, Escape the Fate, Chelsea Grin, and Motionless in White.

The film, inspired by the One Thousand and One Nights, follows the adventures of a prince whose bravery and devotion are tested in a magical quest to win the hand of his beloved. Plot In a mythical Arabian kingdom, the noble but penniless Prince Sourire (French for \\"smile\\") loves the beautiful Princess Indigo, and asks her father, a mighty Rajah, for her hand in marriage. The Rajah angrily sends the Prince away; he has already promised Indigo's hand to an old friend of his, the wealthy usurer Sakaram. Indigo protests vehemently as Sourire is driven away by guards. Returning to his private chamber, Sourire weeps with grief and accidentally overturns an incense burner. Smoke pours out of the burner, from which appears the sorcerer Khalafar. After hearing the prince's story, the sorcerer takes him under his protection and presents him with a magic sword, promising that if the prince is courageous and determined, the sorcerer will lead him to an abundant treasure that will allow him to win his love. Sourire willingly agrees and sets off on the adventure, followed soon after by his friends, who wish to stop him from doing anything foolhardy. Arriving in a temple, the prince falls to his knees in supplication at an altar to a goddess, Siva (presumably inspired by the Hindu deity Siva). The statue of the goddess above the altar comes miraculously to life and sends Sourire off in an ornate boat driven by a blue dwarf. The boat navigates a sacred river and brings Sourire to an impenetrable forest, which magically opens up to reveal secret caverns guarded by a Fairy of Gold. Sourire and his friends descend into a Crystal Grotto, where their courage is tested by attacks from genii of fire, will-o'-the- wisps, phantom skeletons, a fire-breathing dragon, and a flock of monstrous toads. Sourire remains steadfast and puts the monsters to flight. Khalafar appears and congratulates the prince for passing the trial period; he will now be rewarded for his efforts. Sourire is led into the Palace of the Arabian Nights and given an enormous treasure. Back in the Rajah's kingdom, the day of Indigo's marriage to Sakaram has arrived. Just as the two are about to be married in the palace courtyard, trumpets sound and Prince Sourire appears, bedecked in his newly found finery and followed by a procession revealing his riches. The astounded Rajah allows Indigo to marry Sourire at last. The delighted crowd casts Sakaram out of the courtyard and celebrates the marriage of the Prince and Princess. Production Though clearly inspired by the One Thousand and One Nights, the plot of the film is not taken from any single story in that collection; rather, Méliès combined the visual iconography of the work and elements from various stories, including the liberated genie from the folk tale of Aladdin, into an original adventure narrative that would allow ample scope for spectacle and special effects. The result is a simple story full of exotic settings and spectacular moments, highly reminiscent of the plots of féeries, spectacular French stage productions popular in the nineteenth century. Méliès appears in the film as the sorcerer Khalafar. One of Méliès's costume sketches lists the other actors he planned to cast: \\"Mlles Calvière, Bodson, Billuart et Pelletier. MM. Docky, d'Hubert, Dufresne, etc.\\" The Palace of the Arabian Nights was the second Méliès film, after The Barber of Seville (1904), to be longer than 400 meters. The film, one of Méliès's most opulently designed, is notable for a stronger emphasis on spectacle, and slightly more relaxed pace, than Méliès's earlier films had shown; this change of style may have been influenced by Edwin S. Porter's 1903 film version of Uncle Tom's Cabin or by the lavish historical dramas then in vogue among Italian filmmakers. To costume his film, Méliès took advantage of the availability of a sizable stock of costumes he had purchased the same year from a bankrupt stage costuming house, the Maison Lepère. The film's numerous props include almost all of those that had previously been seen, or would later be seen, in other Méliès films: thus, the Moorish door for the Temple of Gold was borrowed from The Human Fly (1902), the puppet dragon returns in The Witch (1906), the ruins reappear in Sightseeing Through Whisky (1907), and so on. The Palace of the Arabian Nights itself looks exactly like the salle de glaces (hall of mirrors) featured at the Paris Exposition of 1900. (A very similar room was established more permanently in Paris six years later, as part of the Musée Grevin.) Along with the lavish costumes and scenery, another main focus of the film is the spectacular special effects. Méliès's techniques for creating these effects included stage machinery, pyrotechnics, substitution splices, superimpositions, and dissolves. The transparency effect of phantom skeletons was created through multiple exposure, with the images of the fighting protagonists and the ghostly skeletons recorded over each other so that both would be visible. Méliès's catalogue description for the film shows particular pride in the scene in which an apparently impenetrable forest, painted on flats arranged to show depth of space, magically parts to reveal a temple: \\"This decoration which was made only after considerable labor is a veritable marvel of achievement. It possesses a great artistic beauty.\\" Release and reception Pages from Méliès's promotional leaflet for the film The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 705–726 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a grande féerie orientale nouvelle.Malthête & Mannoni 2008, p. 180 Both a complete print running 28 minutes and an abridged version running 22 minutes were sold by Méliès; both versions were available in either black-and-white or hand-colored prints. (The running times listed in Méliès's catalogues indicate that he intended a frame rate of 14 frames per second for the film.) In a study of cinematic depictions of Arabic culture, the writer Jack Shaheen criticizes The Palace of the Arabian Nights for including some of the imagery that would become stereotypical in Hollywood versions of the Middle East, citing the opening scene in which \\"submissive maidens attend a bored, greedy, black-bearded potentate\\" while \\"a stocky palace guard cools the ruler\\" with a giant fan. By contrast, the historian Robert Irwin, in an essay on Méliès's film and other screen versions of the One Thousand and One Nights, argues that \\"not too much should be made\\" of this stereotyping, saying that \\"film-makers have treated British medieval history in a similarly cavalier fashion in films about the adventures of Robin Hood, while a fantasy history of the Old West has been conjured up by the thousands of cowboy films made in Hollywood.\\" Film critic William B. Parrill, reviewing silent films in the 2010s, highlighted the skeleton fight scene, saying it \\"foreshadows similar and not necessarily more imaginative scenes in the films of Ray Harryhausen\\". Academic theorist Antonia Lant, in an analysis of haptics in cinema, lauded the scene with the magically parting forest, writing: \\"Melies chose motifs that probed or highlighted the alluring yet illusory depths of the cinema, the impossible compressions and expansions of far and near, the unclear identities of figure and ground.\\" Cultural historian Richard Abel highlighted that the cultural milieu evoked by Méliès \\"turns into a kind of world tour, eclectically combining\\" various real and imaginary exotic locations across the Middle East and Asia, \\"and, in a clever twist that exposes the mask of the 'other' and its dangers, the Palace of the Arabian Nights, where the treasure is hidden, turns out to look much like the Musée Grévin in Paris.\\" References =Footnotes= =Citations= External links * Category:1905 films Category:French silent short films Category:French films Category:1900s fantasy adventure films Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:Silent films in color Category:French fantasy adventure films ","title":"The Palace of the Arabian Nights"},{"id":"42737036","text":"South Garden, Virginia may refer to: *South Garden, Albemarle County, Virginia *South Garden, Richmond, Virginia ","title":"South Garden, Virginia"},{"id":"42737067","text":"William Thomson (sometimes William Thompson) was a Scottish footballer of the 1890s.

A. R. Rahman composed all seven of the original songs as well as the score for the film. Artists Iggy Azalea, KT Tunstall, Wale, Sukhwinder Singh, Raghav Mathur have collaborated with the composer for the soundtrack. Kendrick Lamar also recorded a song that is featured only in the film. The soundtrack album was digitally released by Walt Disney Records on May 13, 2014, followed by a CD release on May 19. Development Director Craig Gillespie said that he had been hoping to recruit A. R. Rahman to do the music right from the time the former signed the Disney film to helm the project.Christopher John Farley (May 4, 2014)'Slumdog' Composer Steps Up to Bat for 'Million Dollar Arm'The Wall Street Journal Retrieved 13 May 2014 In an interview with CBS News, Rahman stated that the film's scale was very attractive to him. He began composing for the film's score in 2013, setting seven queues of score to be featured on the soundtrack album. Eventually, the number of tracks increased as per screenplay length. The recording of the score was completed by February 2014. On working for the film he stated, \\"For three years, I was avoiding Indian-based subjects in Hollywood as I was anyway doing them in Hindi. The last thing I wanted was to be typecast as a composer who'd only work on English films with an Indian setting. But when this script came along, I thought it was a good time to start again. It helped that the story was also hybrid in nature. Million Dollar Arm is more contemporary. In terms of music, it is more orchestral.\\" In regards to the soundtrack album, Rahman claimed, \\"The soundtrack we created together truly captures the beautiful culture and energy behind the film— reminding us all how important it is to be open to new possibilities in life.\\" As the film's music has Indian as well as Western sensibilities, Rahman wanted to strike a balance between the two. The track \\"Unborn Children\\" is the song \\"Thirakkadha Kaatu Kulle\\" sung by K. S. Chithra and P. Unnikrishnan, featured in the 1999 film En Swasa Kaatre scored by Rahman. As a score, it is featured in the ending of the film where two kids were running into an open field. Upon inclusion of such a track, in an interview with The Hindu Rahman said, \\"Frankly, I really didn't know how it landed there and the makers were researching my Indian music and must've stumbled upon this. When I saw the movie, I was like, 'Wow, where did that come from!' But it felt so good. I didn't feel any need to change it.\\" He added that he never wanted to use the soothing number from the Tamil film but the director and music supervisor loved the tune and they've used it as part of the soundtrack.AR Rahman: Movies with good music and song-and-dance routines have more longevityIBN Live Retrieved 13 May 2014. The track \\"Nimma Nimma\\" was recorded for Isles of Wonder, however, here the track is reused with slight changes in musical arrangement. On the collaborations with artists in the soundtrack, Disney listed names for featured collaboration whereas director Craig and composer Rahman made the choices together. On the score and the film plot analogy Rahman quotes, \\"The songs add to the energy of the scenes and the score in places...We were careful not to telegraph key emotions and gave way to the actors playing characters to lead the emotion.\\" On his collaboration with the rapper Wale, Rahman stated that he was writing a lot of song ideas and the film director was suggesting that they should have a mainstream rapper for certain sequences especially when the all the boys in film go to America. He was quoted saying, \\"So Wale's name popped up, we sent him the track and he loved it and did the rap and sent it back.\\" Singer Gaayatri Kaundinya has lent alaps to the score. She stated that she started interning with film composer A. R. Rahman at his studio in Los Angeles since 2012 and eventually got involved with the project. She added that it didn't take her long to record everything as she had many demo works with Rahman, earlier. In the album of the score her voice is featured in tracks \\"Farewell\\" and \\"Bobbleheads\\" but in the score itself she had about six to eight pieces. In the interview with Daily Bruin, she recalled, \\"Originally we just put it in for the part where they find the two men to pitch at the speed that (the baseball scouts) want. After months of looking for cricket players, they find players who can throw at this incredibly fast speed. That's what the track was recorded for. But the director liked (the track) so much that they ended up using it for the opening of the movie.\\" Reception The score received positive critical reception. Scott Foundas of Variety praised the score by comparing, \\"As far as the film's saturated color palette is concerned, jubilant wall-to-wall is the song score by Oscar-winning composer A. R. Rahman\\". Upon release of the single \\"Keep The Hustle\\", critic Sarah Polonsky for Vibe wrote, \\"A mishmash of elements that fuse Indian music with the big synth of electronica, all set under Wale's boss lyrics\\", reviewing the score as, \\"This is one of those film scores that come around every decade and knocks it out of the ballpark not only with powerful tunes, but also, through encompassing a generation's zeitgeist. In 2014, modern music is a sonic free- for-all, and Million Dollar Arm's soundtrack could easily serve as a blueprint to today's genre-varied ethos and creative landscape.\\" Critic Rajeev Masand for CNN-IBN writes, \\"AR Rahman's soundtrack fits in nicely with the narrative.\\"'Million Dollar Arm' review: The film is solidly staged, inhabited with richly-drawn characters Retrieved 13 May 2014 On contrary to positive reviews, at India Today, Suhani Singh noted, \\"AR Rahman's score is mishmash, drawing sounds from everywhere leaving the soundtrack with no standout track.\\"Suhani Singh (May 9, 2014)Million Dollar Arm is heart-warming but also predictable Retrieved May 13, 2014 Venky Vembu at The Hindu wrote, \\"A.R.

It is a spin-off of the Art Academy series featuring characters from the Pokémon media franchise, and was released in Japan on June 19, 2014, in Europe on July 4, 2014, in Australia the next day, and in North America on October 24, 2014. The game was made available as both a retail and downloadable release from the Nintendo eShop, and is the first 3DS title with built-in Miiverse support for sharing artwork. Gameplay Pokémon Art Academy is an educational art game designed to teach players how to draw various Pokémon characters through 40 advancing lessons. Players progress through three skill levels - Novice, Apprentice, and Graduate - while learning new techniques and art concepts, with additional tools such as pastel and paintbrush being unlocked along the way. The Novice course begins with skills such as drawing head-on portraits, angles, and construction shapes, while later stages introduce shading, hatching, opacity, and freehand sketches. Each drawing can be transferred to a Pokémon Trading Card Game card border upon completion, with the option to add a background image. The game also includes a Free Paint Mode that allows players to draw whatever they wish, with the option to load templates as reference, as well as Quick Sketch Mode, which requires making a simple drawing with limited tools. Additional templates can be obtained by progressing through lessons, or as downloadable content through special promotions over Nintendo Network. Pokémon Art Academy features Miiverse functionality that allows for drawings to be uploaded to Nintendo's Miiverse Community, as well as take part in art contests. Unlike the main Art Academy series, this title feature non-traditional tools such as layers and an undo function. These digital art tools are usually avoided in past titles to encourage an authentic experience with traditional art, albeit on a digital medium. Since Pokémon Art Academy is rather focused to educate in drawing Pokémon characters, a series geared for very young children (albeit not specifically), this title has some lenient liberties with these digital tools. Development Pokémon Art Academy was first announced by Nintendo Japan on April 29, 2014, along with a Japanese release date set for the following June. It was released officially in Japan on June 19, 2014. English releases were confirmed a month later. It was released in Europe on July 4, 2014 and New Zealand and Australia on July 5, 2014. The title was originally set to launch in North America some time in the fall, with a finalized October 2014 release date later confirmed for the region via a press release the following August. Reception Pokémon Art Academy entered the Japanese sales charts as the number-one selling title of its debut week with 31,080 copies, and by the following August would go on to sell a total of 91,232 copies in the region before falling from the weekly top 20 software rankings. It received a 31 out of 40 total from editors of Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine based on individual scores of 7, 8, 7, and 9, earning the publication's Silver Award. The game met with a mostly positive response in Europe, earning a 77% score from aggregate review website GameRankings and a 76 out of 100 average from Metacritic. While Official Nintendo Magazine found the title to be \\"challenging, fun and educational in the best of ways\\", the reviewer remarked that the game's lessons advanced too drastically, going from \\"extremely simplistic\\" early stages to requiring advanced drawing skills without explanation of proportions or expressions. The magazine also felt that experienced artists may be put off by the lack of tools or layering options, but nonetheless called the game \\"lovely to play, never punishing you for imperfect work, encouraging and helping you to better your drawing.\\" References External links * Category:2014 video games Category:Drawing video games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS-only games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Art Academy Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Headstrong Games Art ","title":"Pokémon Art Academy"},{"id":"42737234","text":"Apocalypse Pompeii is a 2014 American disaster film produced by The Asylum and directed by Ben Demaree. The film stars Adrian Paul, Jhey Castles, John Rhys- Davies, Dylan Vox, Dan Cade. It was filmed in Sofia, Bulgaria, and Pompeii, Italy. The film was released direct-to-DVD on 8 February 2014. In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, Apocalypse Pompeii is a mockbuster of the Paul W. S. Anderson film Pompeii. Premise When a Former Special Ops commando visits Pompeii, Italy, his wife and daughter are trapped as Mount Vesuvius erupts with massive force.

Previously he had been a cinematographer on numerous films, including the Sharknado franchise. Shooting took place for 12 days in Sofia, Bulgaria during the month of Sept., and then a few splinter unit days at the real Pompeii in Italy. Most of the crew were local hires, with only a handful of people flown in from the US, including the sound mixer and steadicam operator. The cast was a mix of US, UK, and local Bulgarians. There were financial advantages to filming in Bulgaria, allowing the film to do bigger stunts including full body burns, setting cars on fire, and using cork bombs for explosions from 'flying volcanic rock'. Reception Reviewer Frank Veenstra gave the film 4 out of 10 stars saying \\"The writing isn't all that great and to be honest, it's a very ridiculous movie but at the same time, it's also a pretty creative one.\\" Martin Hafer of Influx gave the film one out of five stars, citing that \\"the plot is stupid and the characters are shallow—often coming off as caricatures.\\" References External links * Official site at The Asylum * * Category:2014 direct-to-video films Category:The Asylum films Category:2010s action films Category:2010s adventure films Category:2014 independent films Category:American films Category:American action films Category:American adventure films Category:American disaster films Category:Films about volcanoes Category:Films set in Naples Category:Films shot in Bulgaria Category:American independent films Category:Pompeii in popular culture ","title":"Apocalypse Pompeii"},{"id":"42737240","text":"The Akademio Literatura de Esperanto (ALE; ) is an independent and neutral institution which aims to encourage the creative and artistic literary production in the Esperanto language.

The bill would make it a felony to post prostitution ads online. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Human trafficking is the modern form of slavery, with illegal smuggling and trading of people, for forced labour or sexual exploitation. Trafficking is officially defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking is not synonymous with forced migration or smuggling. In the U.S., human trafficking tends to occur around international travel-hubs with large immigrant populations, notably California and Texas.CAST: Keys Statistics Freedom DeniedRescue & Restore Coalition. \\"Texas Facts on Human Traffickin.\\"Texasimpact.org/UMW/HumanTraffickFactSheet.doc. Web. February 22, 2012. The U.S. Justice Department estimates that 17,500 people are trafficked into the country every year, but the true figure could be higher, because of the large numbers of undocumented immigrants. The United States Department of State has also estimated that between 14,000-17,5000 people annually are trafficked for sex, labor, or other types of exploitation into the United States. Those being trafficked include young children, teenagers, men and women and can be domestic citizens or foreign nationals. Existing federal law protects websites that \\"post third-party ads for massages, body rubs, escort services and other thinly veiled references to prostitution\\" from any \\"liability under the Communications Decency Act.\\" State laws in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Washington that attempted to stop online sex ads were overturned as unconstitutional. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014 or the SAVE Act of 2014 would prohibit knowingly benefitting financially from, receiving anything of value from, or distributing advertising that offers a commercial sex act in a manner that violates federal criminal code prohibitions against sex trafficking of children or of any person by force, fraud, or coercion. Subjects violators to a fine, imprisonment of up to five years, or both. The bill would grant U.S. courts extraterritorial jurisdiction over such an offense if an alleged offender is a U.S. national or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or if an alleged offender is present in the United States, irrespective of the offender's nationality. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4225 would have no significant cost to the federal government. Enacting the bill could affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, the CBO estimates that any effects would be insignificant. H.R. 4225 would clarify the current laws against sex trafficking with regard to the advertising of such acts. As a result, the government might be able to increase the number of successful prosecutions in these cases. The CBO expects that the bill would apply to a relatively small number of offenders, however, so any increase in costs for law enforcement, court proceedings, or prison operations would not be significant. Any such costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Because those prosecuted and convicted under H.R. 4225 could be subject to criminal fines, the federal government might collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. Criminal fines are recorded as revenues, deposited in the Crime Victims Fund, and later spent. The CBO expects that any additional revenues and direct spending would not be significant because of the small number of cases likely to be affected. Procedural history The Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 13, 2014 by Rep. Ann Wagner (R, MO-2). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. On May 15, 2014, it was reported (amended) by the Committee alongside House Report 113-451. It was scheduled to be voted on in the House on May 20, 2014 under a suspension of the rules. Debate and discussion Rep. Wagner said that Congress was \\"taking steps towards ending what I would call modern-day slavery.\\" Wagner argued that her bill had been reviewed by the Justice Department in an attempt to ensure that it did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's guarantee of the right to free speech. Wagner argued that the House had not passed any legislation on human trafficking in 13 years, and that \\"our efforts to combat sex trafficking need to be updated to match the problem as it stands today.\\" The Seattle Times editorial board wrote an editorial in favor of the bill, calling on Congress to \\"strengthen U.S. laws to stop human trafficking.\\" The American Civil Liberties Union has opposed the bill, arguing that it would \\"unintentionally shut down lawful speech\\" and apply not only to advertising sites like Backpage.com, but also to any site with user-generated profiles or content, including Facebook, Tinder, OK Cupid and Tumblr. The Center for Democracy and Technology has warned that the bill's overly broad language and strict sentencing guidelines would have a chilling effect on legal adult speech. The SAVE Act has also been opposed by sex worker rights organizations, including the Red Umbrella Project, the Desiree Alliance and the Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance, which argued that shutting down sites like Backpage.com paradoxically increases trafficking risks for sex workers, by removing one of the only ways an independent escort can reach clients. \\"Such actions are also likely to force them underground, which reduces their ability to report abuses, violence, or trafficking to the authorities.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Human trafficking in the United States *Commercial sexual exploitation of children References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4225 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4225 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4225 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4225 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4225 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4225 *House Report 113-451 on H.R. 4225 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Human trafficking in the United States ","title":"Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014"},{"id":"42737349","text":"Perimede annulata is a moth in the family Cosmopterigidae.

Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2014 Shortly before the riots the population of Fes learnt about the treaty, and in general viewed it as a betrayal by Sultan Abd al-Hafid who had travelled to Rabat to ensure his safety. After the riots he was forced to abdicate in favour of his brother Yusuf. Despite warnings of an uprising, most French troops left Fes, leaving behind 1,500 French troops and 5,000 Moroccan askars (local colonial infantrymen) commanded by French officers. On the morning of 17 April, the French officers announced the new measures to their askars. Many units immediately mutinied, causing a total loss of control. The soldiers attacked their French commanders, then left their barracks and attacked the European and Jewish quarters of the city. French artillery shelling was used to force the rebels to surrender, which took place after two days. The death toll included 66 Europeans, 42 Moroccan Jews and some 600 Moroccan Muslims. The first account of the riot was written by Hubert Jacques, a journalist at Le Matin, and a personal friend of Resident-General Hubert Lyautey.

It is located on the far right of the Ukrainian politics and built around the \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\". In late November 2013, both the S.N.A. and the \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" entered in an association with several other Ukrainian far-right groups which led to the formation of the Right Sector. The S.N.A. is also reported to be close to Svoboda, and Yuriy Zbitnyev, the leader of the nationalist political party \\"Nova Syla\\" (New Force).All-Ukrainian party \\"New Force\\" , Official site. The S.N.A.'s activities are largely Kyiv-based. History =2000s= The S.N.A. was founded in 2008 and maintained relations with the wider social-nationalist movement in Ukraine. In the late 2000s, Ukrainian president Victor Yushchenko and the Our Ukraine bloc bolstered the S.N.A. and other far-right groups by supporting an explicitly nationalist view of Ukrainian history. Following the 2009 death of Maksym Chaika, an S.N.A member who was killed in a fight with antifascists in Odessa, Yushchenko supported the far-right interpretation of Chaika's death, describing him and others as heroes and victims driven to violence for a just cause. In 2010, the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union reported on attacks by the S.N.A and \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" against Vietnamese and other foreign market stalls in Vasylkiv. Most attacks were carried out by youth and targeted Vietnamese, Uzbeks and Gypsies. According to the S.N.A website, they drove foreigners from the market within two weeks and replaced them with Ukrainians. The S.N.A states that some of their victims were hospitalized. Later that year, Ukrainian authorities shut down an S.N.A music festival near Kyiv that promoted neo-Nazism and chauvinism among Ukrainian youth. The music glorified the skinhead movement, Nazi aesthetics and the harassment of minorities. In August 2011, the Netherlands Institute of Human Rights warned about the growth of extremist organizations including the S.N.A and \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\", noting repeated attacks against foreigners and visible minorities. The institute also noted the government's inability or unwillingness to deal with extreme-right movements in Ukraine. In August 2011 Ukrainian police announced that they thwarted a bomb attack planned for the commemoration of Ukrainian Independence. The \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\", a part of the S.N.A, declared that some of their members had been detained by police but maintained no connection with any terrorist plan. Spokespersons for the S.N.A and \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" insisted that criminal action against them was a pretext for SBU repression against their organizations. =Involvement in Maidan= In 2013, the S.N.A, \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" and Autonomous Resistance all increased in popularity, contributing to the growth of Svoboda as well. The Social National Assembly helped to create an umbrella radical organization - the Right Sector (Pravy Sector). Other openly radical anti-semitic groups operating in Ukraine including the \\"White Hammer\\" and \\"C14\\", a neo-Nazi wing of Svoboda, joined it. During the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, the militants from the S.N.A and the \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" were on the front lines of the street riots in Kyiv. According to Igor Krivoruchko, the leader of the Kyiv's S.N.A. branch, its members started clashes with the police near the Presidential Administration Building (Kyiv) and also initiated the Hrushevskoho Street riots. They seized and burned on 18 February 2014 the central office of the ruling party - the Party of Regions - in Kyiv. A bystander, 57-year-old IT engineer who tried to stop the attackers from entering the server room, was beaten to death.

Oleh Odnoroshenko, the S.N.A and \\"Patriot of Ukraine\\" ideologue and also one of the \\"Right Sector\\" leaders, stated in February 2014 that the \\"Right Sector\\" would be hesitant to enter into the government following the departure of Viktor Yanukovych. Odnoroshenko thought that the politicians would try to use the Right Sector credibility and popularity while pursuing their own agendas. At the end of April 2014, S.N.A members marched with burning torches to the Independence Square and came into conflict with the Self-defense of the Maidan units. During the fight, the S.N.A. and Self- defense of the Maidan activists used rubber bullet guns and tear gas, and ambulances later arrived to treat wounded. Oleh Odnoroshenko volunteered to the press that the S.N.A members organized the attack on the Russian embassy in Kyiv on 14 June 2014.МИД Украины назвало погром под посольством РФ провокацией (The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called the pogrom at the Russian Embassy a provocation), Internet-newspaper Vesti.ua, 15 June 2014 = Azov Battalion = In March 2014 the Social-National Assembly created a volunteer group, Azov Battalion. In April, members were wounded in combat against separatists in eastern Ukraine. During the first week of May, Kyiv granted it official status and began delivering weapons. On 6 May, the Azov Battalion captured Donetsk People's Republic defense minister Igor Kakidzyanov. The next day the S.N.A. announced that it was interrogating the captive, and Radical Party (Ukraine) leader Oleh Lyashko posted photographs of him naked and bound. Lyashko confirmed that Azov had captured Kakidzyanov and some other separatist leaders. On 13 June, the Azov Battalion stormed separatists' barricades in Mariupol and seized control of the city center after a six-hour battle. The group has been assigned to patrol the Azov Sea coastline and prevent arms smuggling. Ideology According to the founder of the organization, Biletsky states that Social-Nationalism is based on three pillars: Racism, Socialism and Great Power.Biletsky, A. Word of the White Leader. Kharkiv The ideology stands in a strong opposition to any form of liberalism or democracy. Under Socialism in Social Nationalist ideology means third position in economics, authoritative power, and fair distribution among national producers. According to Biletsky, the main distinction between Nazism and Social Nationalism is the fact that Nazism is more socialist, while Social Nationalism is more nationalist. At the same time justification in Social Nationalism over Nationalism lays in importance of a social revolution to achieve national revolution. Political scientist Anton Shekhovtsov, Foreign Policy journalist Alec Luhn and Haaretz journalist Lolita Brayman describe the S.N.A as a far-right, neo-Nazi or racist group. The S.N.A is also a \\"street combat movement\\" hostile to ethnic and social minorities: according to researchers and its own website it has carried out physical attacks against them. Over half the membership of the Azov Battalion, a Social-National Assembly military group, is composed of Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians. A ministerial adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, denies neo-Nazi allegations, stating, \\"The Social-National Assembly is not a neo-Nazi organization… It is a party of Ukrainian patriots.\\" See also *Right Sector *Patriot of Ukraine *Svoboda *Tryzub References External links *S.N.A.Official site *S.N.A.

After Metamorpho vanishes, Simon Stagg attempts to pin the blame of Metamorpho's death on Batman, who shows Sapphire Stagg the footage of her father's role in Metamorpho's creation. Batman then leaves with plans to leave the incriminating footage of Simon Stagg's role in Metamorpho's creation to the police. In \\"Monsters\\", Batman suspects Simon Stagg of hiring and providing thugs with armor and weapons to drive people out of Old Gotham and buy the territory for profit. He visits Simon Stagg in his cell at Blackgate Penitentiary, but Stagg denies being involved in the scheme. The culprit is later revealed to be Sapphire, who seeks to impress her father. Batman threatens her to stop while withholding Rex's survival from her.

Description  The first Warsaw baroque church with a simple facade, it has a nave, a rectangular interior and two side chapels. The porch has a separated lattice (from the 18th century), and the side altars have images of St. Francis and St. Anthony of Padua, painted by Rafał Hadziewicz, and an image of Christ on the Cross painted by Annibale Vinici. Inside the galleries are numerous epitaphs for deserving people (including the writer Klementyna Hoffmanowa, the painter Rafał Hadziewicz, the poet Stanisław Jachowicz, the president of Vilnius Wiktor Malaszewski, and Stanisław Englert), people killed during World War II, people who died in Nazi concentration camps, and Polish soldiers who fought in defence of their country.  History  Construction of the first church at this site was funded by King Sigismund III Vasa, thankful for winning the Siege of Smolensk, in 1611. The date of the event (13 June) suggested St. Anthony of Padua as the choice of the patron saint for the church. A resolution in the Sejm entrusted the church to the Order of the Franciscans reformers. During the Swedish invasion in 1657, the original wooden church was destroyed by allied troops led by George II Rákóczi. Castellan Stanisław Skarszewski founded the new church between 1668 and 1680, this time built of brick. In 1679 the temple was consecrated by the Bishop of Poznań Stefan Wierzbowski. The church was probably built to a design by Simone Giuseppe Belotti. Sculptures inside the church are the work of Jan Jerzy Plersch. The temple was often visited by King John III Sobieski. From 1734 to 1735 King Augustus III of Saxony had a box built for him and his wife (the royal couple lived in a palace next door) on the right side of the chancel. In 1766, the monastery hid the famous Casanova, who was wanted by Franciszek Ksawery Branicki. From 1767 to 1781 the chapel of the Virgin Mary was built, and in 1792 the cloister was built perpendicular to the side arms to a design by Hilary Szpilowski. In 1850, a painting of the Virgin Mary, was added beside the tympanum at the front, and in 1851 a figure of Mary by Antoni Messing was placed on the pediment in the church. In 1866 the parish was founded. In 1867, in connection with the dissolution of the Order of the Franciscans in the repression following the January Uprising, the church was taken over Diocesan priests. In subsequent years, the main altar was moved to the wall of the chancel, and choir and sacristy were removed. In 1895 the chapel of the Holy Family was built with an altar made by Wincent Bogaczyk. In 1907 the chapel was built for the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The church was badly damaged by the German army during the battles with insurgents in 1944. Especially affected were the side altar, the pulpit and organ, the chapel of Holy Family, the grille, and a part of the chapel's stucco arches. There was considerable human cost too - as mentioned on a Tchorek plaque at the church, over 100 people were executed there. The church was rebuilt from 1950 to 1956 according to a design by Karol Szymański. The main altar was consecrated by Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński on 18 January, 1969. In 1949 the church and parish had again been transferred back to the Franciscan Order.  Bibliography  * Encyklopedia Warszawy, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN. Warszawa. 1994. Page 96. (in Polish).

Google, Inc. is a federal lawsuit between Ben Joffe and Google, Inc.. Joffe claimed that Google broke one of the Wiretap Legislation segments when they intruded on the seemingly \\"public\\" wireless networks of private homes through their Street View application. Although Google tried to appeal their case multiple times, the courts favored Joffe's argument. Ultimately the Supreme Court declined to take the case, affirming the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the Wiretap Act covers the interception of unencrypted Wi-Fi communications. Background In 2007, Google launched its Street View project, an addendum to the Google Maps feature which captured street-level images from various cities in the US and around the world. Street View vehicles had the ability to intercept and store a vast amount of Wi-fi data from nearby home network due to the intricate technological set up Google created in order to take the pictures in the first place. Google acknowledged in May 2010 that its Street View vehicles had been collecting fragments of payload data from unencrypted Wi-fi networks. This also included any information connected to the internet which was hacked, such as personal emails and passwords. In total Google collected about 600 gigabytes of information from 30 different countries. The Joffe v. Google court case was filed on in November 2010, when Ben Joffe called out Street View for breaching the Wiretap Legislation Act. Joffe, representing the voice of the complainants, configured that Google ruptured the Act, which regulates the collection of actual content of wire and electronic communications and prohibits the intentional interception, use, or disclosure of wire and electronic communications unless a statutory exception applies. The extensive procedure that involved an appeal by Google lasted until the conclusion in June 2013. The federal wiretap statute requires someone to get a wiretap order before they monitor or record an individual's or company's communication. It regulates the collection of actual content of wire and electronic communication. Under the act it is illegal to intentionally or purposefully: 1.Intercept, disclose, or use the contents of 2.Any wire, oral, or electronic communication Facts August 2010 cases were transferred to the judicial panel on a multi-district litigation to the Northern District of California . In 2013, Google tried to appeal the case and the court of appeal stood by their original decision because Google is not exempt from the Wire Tap Law. On September 10, 2013, the case entered federal judgment by A. Wallace Tashima, Jay S. Bybee and William H. Stafford, Jr.. It was affirmed by Judge: JSB Authoring. May 16, 2013 the case was filed and the hearing began. Attorney Michael H. Rubin represented the appellant Google. The trial takes place in San Francisco, the hometown of Google Corporations. Several punitive class actions lawsuits were filed shortly after. District Court The court had to address whether data transmitted over unencrypted Wi-Fi networks is an electronic communication that is readily accessible to the general public. Court determined that data transmitted over an encrypted Wi-fi Network is not readily accessible to the general public. This means that whatever information Google was housing was done illegally, without the consent of the owner of the network The exemption does not apply to Google's conduct. The exemption applies to radio communication, not electronic communication. Circuit Court The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's holding that the Wiretap Act covers the interception of unencrypted Wi-Fi communications. The court reasoned that such communications did not fall under the ordinary definition of \\"radio communication\\" because they were not primarily auditory. Furthermore, such communications did not fall under the \\"readily accessible to the general public\\" exception because, even unencrypted Wi-Fi communications are (1) geographically limited, and (2) accessible only with \\"some difficulty\\": \\"the \\"general public\\" because most of the general public lacks the expertise to intercept and decode payload data transmitted over a Wi-Fi network.\\" U.S. Supreme Court Google attempted to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, however, it declined to hear the case thus ultimately affirming the District's Court decision.

History In 1976, Planning Commission granted approval for the project. In 1986 environmental clearance was granted and construction on the tall dam began in 1987 by Jaypee Group under the supervision of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department, when the area belonged to Uttar Pradesh. In 1992, the construction was halted at 35 percent progress after Jaypee Group pulled out due to the lack of funding. In 2008, it was notified as a national project by the union govt and the union govt will bear the 90% cost. In November 2013, construction restarted on the Vyasi Dam and it once again received environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests in February 2014.

They were known for their politically charged lyrics, which usually discussed United States politics from a left-wing point of view, such as by mocking Rush Limbaugh. History Zimmerman originally started the band in 1990, after seeing a Wayfarers album in the bargain bin at a record store. He then recruited Doug Whitney and Andy Corwin—a guitarist and bassist, respectively—to join his newly formed band. The band released a live album, Sing it Loud, on Metaphor Records, and were signed to Reprise Records after Jim Ed Norman, then head of the Warner Bros. Nashville label, heard them at a party. Norman was so impressed that he signed the Foremen to a recording contract on Reprise, one of Warner Music's subsidiaries, and went on to produce their debut album. It was on Reprise that they released both of their studio albums, Folk Heroes and What's Left. They also released a single from the former album, \\"Ain't No Liberal\\", in 1995, which featured an image of Republican politician Phil Gramm on the cover. Reprise promoted by sending copies of it to presidential candidates in the 1996 US Presidential election, and mocking presidential candidate Pete Wilson in the single's cover art. Reprise's then-president, Howie Klein, admitted that their motivation for doing this was to provoke a \\"counterattack\\" from one of the politicians they were mocking. In February 1996, the band performed a song mocking Oliver North, entitled \\"Ollie, Ollie, Off Scot Free\\", on North's own radio show. While the band was nervous prior to this performance, North's reaction was not as negative as they had expected. He didn't care very much what the song said, only that it was about him, according to Zimmerman. North also described the band as a \\"very weird group\\" and agreed to pose for a picture with them. Style Zimmerman has said that the political views expressed in his band's songs are influenced in part by the activism popular in the 1960s, and has named \\"Tom Lehrer and Phil Ochs and, to a lesser degree, I guess,...Pete Seeger and the honest-to-God activism that was going on in music at that time [i.e. the 1960s]\\" as his band's influences. Whitney has also described the band as \\"partly a goof on the lesser folk groups of the late '50s,\\" while Billboard magazine has compared the satirical aspects of the Foremen's music to Allan Sherman. Jim Walsh has concurred with Zimmerman that the Foremen's music resembles that of Phil Ochs, as well as naming Steve Goodman as one of their influences. Mark Jenkins of the Washington Post wrote that \\"Though the Foremen's \\"Folk Heroes\\" arrives with an endorsement from '60s musical satirist Tom Lehrer, it's not especially folkie—nor so biting as Lehrer's best.\\" Discography =Studio albums= *Folk Heroes (Reprise, 1995) *What's Left?

Origin On 8 May 2014, Bank of China Limited, Luxembourg Branch, launched its first offshore-RMB “Schengen” bond, for an amount of RMB 1.5 billion. The transaction was done under the US$10 billion MTN programme of the Bank of China Group. With the support from international and local institutional investors, the issuance was around 2 times oversubscribed. It was priced at 3.50% for the 3-year bond. On 15 May 2014, it was listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This first offshore-RMB bond was originally named ‘Schengen’ bond due to the fact that ‘Schengen’ has a particular meaning in European countries. It is a reference to the name of a small village in Luxembourg that borders France and Germany where the Schengen agreement permitting the free movement of movement of persons within the Schengen area was signed. Additionally, the pronunciation of ‘Schengen’ in Chinese represents the meaning of “root here and develop here”. Significance Compared to Dim sum bonds, which were originally the offshore RMB bonds listed in Hong Kong and later came to refer to offshore RMB bonds listed elsewhere, Schengen bonds are the offshore RMB bonds listed in Europe, featuring a new trend of the internationalization of RMB and establishing a brand name for the RMB bonds in the Eurozone.

It was first published on May 13, 2014 through Metropolitan Books and details Greenwald's role in the global surveillance disclosures as revealed by the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden. The documents from the Snowden archive cited in the book are freely available online. Synopsis The book consists of five chapters; Contact, Ten Days in Hong Kong, Collect It All, The Harm of Surveillance, and the Fourth Estate, plus an introduction and an epilogue. In the introduction Greenwald explains how his background as a blogger on surveillance practices of the American government attracted Edward Snowden's attention, and he summarizes the nature, legality, and evolution of such practices. Greenwald concludes by discussing how a global surveillance network has been created with the assistance of technology companies and the unique role of the internet in human history as a facilitator of such surveillance. In the body of the book, Greenwald discusses how he became involved with the 2013 global surveillance disclosures. He began by traveling to Hong Kong to meet Edward Snowden, who had contacted Greenwald as an anonymous source purporting to have evidence of government surveillance. As Greenwald continued to investigate he uncovered more information that he later published, to much controversy. In the book Greenwald also discusses establishment media, which he states will traditionally avoid publishing anything that would put them at odds with the government and as such, are less helpful when it comes to the interests of the general public. Reception In his review for The Washington Post, law professor David Cole called No Place to Hide an important and illuminating book but wrote, \\"It would have been more important and illuminating were Greenwald able to acknowledge that the choices we face about regulating surveillance in the modern age are difficult and that there are no simple answers.\\" Slate gave a mostly positive review, stating that while the book \\"doesn’t offer an in-depth portrait of the leaker\\" it does serve as a good \\"primer\\" on \\"what was at stake when he downloaded the government’s most precious secrets onto a thumb drive\\". The book was positively reviewed by Henry Porter in The Guardian. Porter said that he found \\"reacquainting myself with the details of surveillance and intrusion by America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ was simply shocking. As the stories rolled out last year, there was almost too much to absorb...Greenwald's book is a tough read if you find these things disturbing.\\" Porter said that reading No Place to Hide he had wondered \\"...how we let the spies probe our lives with such inadequate controls, and how on earth we fell for the propaganda that this massive apparatus was there to protect, not control, us.\\" Critically Porter felt that the book lacked \\"...a chart or timeline of the major revelations as well as a proper index. And I did feel the argument lost momentum in the middle...\\" concluding that \\"...on the whole this is a vigorously executed and important book.\\" Porter reserved criticism for what he felt was a lack of appreciation by Greenwald of the importance of the efforts of Ewen MacAskill and his fellow Guardian writers in bringing the disclosures to publication. Glenn Greenwald received the 2014 Geschwister-Scholl-Preis, an annual German literary award, for the German edition of No Place to Hide.

Life He was the son of Hugh, 12th MacLean of Ardgour (1736-4 September 1768) and Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Houston of Jordan Hill. He entered the army as an ensign in the 2nd battalion of the Royals, in 1780, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in the same corps, from which he afterwards exchanged into the (later the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot). He subsequently attained to the rank of captain and major in the 8th Regiment of Light Dragoons (later the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars). After leaving the regular service, he became a captain in the Hopetoun Fencibles (7th regiment of fencibles) sometime between 2 February 1793 to 1799 under James, the 3rd Earl of Hopetoun. On 29 May 1795, he was appointed Major in the Fencible cavalry of the Lothian (East and West) Regiment. He was subsequently appointed, circa 1811, lieutenant-colonel of the third regiment of local militia of the county of Argyle, the command of which he held until the regiment was disbanded. He was a splendid horseman and the most accomplished and daring rider in the Royal Caledonian Hunt, amongst whose members was Robert Burns. In June 1805 he was appointed Receiver General of Landrents, Paymaster of the Civil Establishment and Receiver General of the land tax, and assessed taxes in Scotland. This was apparently under the patronage of John, 2nd Earl of Hopeton, his brother-in-law, on a salary of £1,500. Just a year later, in June 1806, he was succeeded by Sir William A. Cunynghame of Milncraig (formerly of Livingston), Bart. He gifted the site of Ardgour Church in 1826, which is still the centre of local worship. It was built by Thomas Telford in 1829, one of forty-two in the Highlands which were part of a Parliamentary Project for The Church of Scotland. Alexander became blind several years before his death in 1855, and was buried in Cill Mhoadain Graveyard, Ardgour alongside his wife. Alexander was succeeded by his fourth son, Alexander Maclean, 14th MacLean of Ardgour. Family He married Lady Margaret Hope, who died 16 September 1831, daughter of Sir John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun, and by her had issue: :Hugh, who died in infancy. :John Hugh Maclean FRSE (1796-1826), educated at the Scottish bar, and died in Romehttp://www.houstoun.org.uk/Gene/tree/50593.htm :Archibald, who died in Edinburgh in 1832 after having served as a naval officer ; severely wounded ; captured by the American war vessel, Prince de Neufchatel; and in 1822, promoted to the rank of captain and commander of of twenty-six guns. :Alexander, heir and successor. :Henry Dundas entered the army, became a major in 1832, and at different periods was resident governor of Ithaca, Cephalonia, Santa Maura, and Lante ; died in 1863. :James Charles entered the military service of the East India Company, and died of fever at Calcutta in 1829. :Charles Hope was educated for the English bar, and died in 1839. :Elizabeth Margaret. :Charlotte Margaret died in 1824. :Thomas entered the East India Company's service, and died in 1840. :William entered the navy, changed his name to Gunston, and died in 1851. :George became a colonel in the army, and married, in 1842, a daughter of Sir Colin Campbell. :Robert died in 1835. :Peter, who served in the artillery and rose to the rank of Major-General, married, in Graham's Town, Cape of Good Hope, a daughter of Lieutenant General Sir Henry Somerset, by whom he had four sons and three daughters.

She won a team silver medal in the 2013 European Fencing Championships in Zagreb and a bronze medal in the 2013 World Fencing Championships in Budapest. Biography Udrea's first sports were swimming and tennis. She discovered fencing at the age of seven at Olimpia Bucharest, and took to the sport. She first competed in foil. In this weapon, she won a silver medal in the 2008 Cadet European Championships at Novi Sad, a gold medal in the Junior World Cup in 2009, a bronze medal in the Junior European Championships at Odense that same year, and a silver medal in the 2010 Romanian Championship. In the 2008–09 season, she joined the national senior team, which placed 4th in the World Championships in Antalya after being defeated by Italy in the semi- final, then by Germany in the match for the bronze medal. The year after, Romania were knocked out by Venezuela in the first round of the World Championships in Paris. The lack of results and funds pushed the Romanian Fencing Federation into dissolving the national foil team in early 2011. Udrea then turned to épée. Udrea joined the national Romanian épée team after the reshuffling that followed the London 2012 Summer Olympics. In December 2012 she won the gold medal in the Belgrade Trophy, a satellite event of the Fencing World Cup. In 2013, she earned a bronze in the team competition of the Saint-Maur World Cup. With her club, CSA Steaua București, she ranked second in the European Cup in Naples. In March 2013, she won a silver medal in the Romanian national championship after being defeated in the final by teammate Ana Maria Brânză, with which she won a team gold medal. In July, Udrea won a silver team medal with Brânză, Simona Pop and Amalia Tătăran in the 2013 European Championships in Zagreb. In the 2013 World Championships at Budapest, she was defeated in the table of 32 by Italy's Rossella Fiamingo, but earned the team bronze. She ended up 47th in the 2012–13 Fencing World Cup. In the 2013–14 season, Udrea was selected as reserve for the 2014 European Championships in Strasbourg. In the individual event, she was stopped in the table of 64 by France's Marie-Florence Candassamy, who eventually won the silver medal. In the team competition, No.2 seed Romania received a bye, then disposed of Ukraine 45–31, beat Italy 29–24 in the semi-final and overcame Russia 38–34 in a very tight and tactical final, allowing Udrea to win her first international gold medal. Udrea did not compete in the World Championships in Kazan as Ana Maria Constantin was selected as reserve in her place.

Focused on strengthening the health workforce needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, the project assists countries to improve accessibility and quality of health services by addressing deficits in human resources for health (HRH). The specific goals of the project are: * Fostering global leadership and advocacy for HRH * Enhancing HRH policy and planning, including HRH management and HRH information systems * Improving health workforce development, including pre-service education, in-service training, and continuing professional development * Strengthening support to health workers to improve retention and productivity * Generating and disseminating knowledge about HRH * Fostering partnerships to improve HRH, including private-sector and faith-based partners and partners outside the health sector  Background  CapacityPlus started in 2009 and works to address many of the key human resources for health (HRH) issues that have been highlighted globally. In 2006 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated a global shortage of over four million health workers and identified 57 countries as having a health workforce crisis.World Health Organization. The world health report 2006: working together for health, Geneva, 2006 A 2013 report issued by the Global Health Workforce Alliance and the World Health Organization found that 83 countries fall below a threshold of 22.8 skilled health professionals per 10,000 population.Global Health Workforce Alliance and World Health Organization. A Universal Truth: No Health Without a Workforce. The constraint issues surrounding HRH include: * Shortages of health workers, especially in rural and underserved areas * Poor distribution of the health workforce compared to need * Mismatches between health needs and the composition of the health workforce * Insufficient skills tied to inadequate education and training capacity * Low retention and productivity * Weak human resources management systems A trained, motivated, and accessible health workforce can provide access to vital health information, services, and commodities. CapacityPlus works in Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Laos, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. The project has completed activities in Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Peru, and Zimbabwe.  Activities  = Health Workforce Development = CapacityPlus’s Bottlenecks and Best Buys approach has been used in over 50 health professional schools in eight countries. The approach enables schools to identify critical bottlenecks to providing quality pre-service education for health workers and prioritize affordable actions for increasing the quantity of graduates while maintaining or improving the quality of education.Tulenko K, Bailey R, Seifman R. \\"Scaling Up Health Worker Production: The Bottlenecks and Best Buys Approach.\\" CapacityPlus technical brief no. 9 To help health professional schools improve their management, CapacityPlus co-developed with schools a series of management tools as well as the Dean’s Dashboard, free open source school management software. CapacityPlus also partnered with the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank, and the Global Health Workforce Alliance in an exploration of innovative solutions for the financing of education to increase the number of health workers available to provide care to growing populations.Tulenko K, Preker A. \\"Innovative Financing Options for the Preservice Education of Health Workers.\\" CapacityPlus technical brief no. 8 CapacityPlus is a partner with the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) to improve graduate tracking, community-based education, and distance learning in African medical schools, as well as a partner with the Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) to conduct capacity assessments and costing analyses of African nursing and midwifery schools. = Rural Health Workforce Retention = The World Health Organization issued 16 global recommendations for improving the recruitment and retention of health workers in rural areas—a challenge faced by most countries and a barrier to universal health coverage. In Laos, the Ministry of Health partnered with CapacityPlus and the WHO to apply the Rapid Retention Survey Toolkit (developed by CapacityPlus using the WHO recommendations) and iHRIS Retain costing software to assess which of the recommendations would be most effective in the Laotian context and subsequently inform a new national policy for recruiting and retaining health workers.Jaskiewicz W, Deussom R, Wurts L, Mgomella G.

Human Resources Management Assessment Approach. January 2013 The approach promotes the collection and analysis of information on defined HRM challenges, and informs development of effective policy, strategy, systems, and process interventions in response. Working with the Dominican Republic to compare health worker payrolls with facility staffing, CapacityPlus helped identify over 10,000 ghost workers and helped the government save $7 million per year in lost wages that are now being reinvested in the Dominican health system to increase health worker wages and eliminate service fees. = Human Resources Information Systems = CapacityPlus supports the iHRIS platform, free, open source software that assists countries to maintain accurate information on their health workforce and to use that information to make decisions and develop policies that strengthen HRH systems.iHRIS: Open Source Health Workforce Information Solutions Because it is built on a flexible framework and distributed under an open source license, iHRIS can be customized and extended to address local needs.Peter Groen. \\"Latest news on the 'open source' Integrated Human Resource Information System (iHRIS)\\" Open Health News August 26, 2013 Currently, almost 20 countries are using the iHRIS software applications in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and other languages.

Life  His family worked in the local iron foundry and he attended the nearby primary schools. From an early age, he was considered to be a loner who preferred walks in the woods to playing with friends. His drawings attracted the attention of his headmaster and his parents soon received letters inviting them to send him for studies in Prague, with financial support. In 1887, at the age of fifteen, he began his studies at the School of Applied Arts, where he initially worked under František Ženíšek, but was later allowed to pursue his studies independently. Spring (1906) After graduating, he shared a studio with . During his time at the school, he had made contact with the Mánes Union of Fine Arts and became involved in its journalistic activities. In 1896, he provided the cover for the first issue of the association's magazine Volné Směry (roughly, Free Directions) and served as its editor for several years. He travelled to Italy in 1902, helped design the posters for the Edvard Munch exhibition of 1905 in Prague and visited Paris in 1906, where he was influenced by the work of Paul Gauguin. In 1903, he became a teacher of nude drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts and served as a Professor there from 1913 until his death. In 1914, he married Božena Pallas, from a local family involved in the production of handicrafts. They had two children. He died of pneumonia in 1918 and was interred in the family vault.  Work  Black Lake (c.1900) He originally painted in a Neo-Romantic style, but later came to prefer the allegorical approach of symbolism. In the late 1890s, under the influence of Alfons Mucha and Vojtěch Preissig, he experimented with Art Nouveau. After the turn of the century, he attempted to express the ineffable and mysterious depths of the soul, filled with melancholy and desire, finding his inspiration in poetry. In addition to his canvases, he provided decorations for several buildings, including the Municipal House and the Hotel Central.

Stretching 450 miles from Shasta to Kern County, California’s Central valley encompasses the Sacramento Valley in the North and the San Joaquin Valley in the South. Of its 5 million residents, 1 in 5 residents are unemployed, and on average 12.8% of the population works in agriculture related industries. Located in the agricultural city of Parlier, CA, United Health Centers of San Joaquin Valley is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) whose main purpose is to be “committed to the lifetime wellness of our communities by providing accessible, comprehensive quality health care to everyone, including farm worker families and the underserved, with compassion and respect, regardless of ability to pay.” Beginning in 1971, United Health Centers of the San Joaquin Valley (UHC), a private non-profit organization, was established from a grass root movement by people trying to improve access to healthcare in their rural communities. They focused on ways to address the high infant morbidity and mortality rates, lack of medical and dental services, and the paucity of accessibility and affordability to health care. With clinics located in Parlier, Orange Cove, Huron, Earlimart, Mendota, Kerman, Sanger and Corcoran, United Health Centers is staffed by more thank 600 health professionals consisting of physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse, pharmacists, lab and x-ray technicians, dentist, dental hygienists, nutritionists, and certified ancillary personnel, the majority of whom are bilingual.  History  Starting in 1970, the residents of Orange Cove convened to addresses growing health concerns in the city. When they formed a committee, the closest county health department was the county hospital’s emergency room in Fresno, 50 miles away. With the assistance of the Fresno Economic Opportunities Commission, the committee formed and incorporated the Orange Cove Family Health Center, Inc. in January 1971 with the first clinic opening in Orange Cove that October. At this same time, a group of citizens in close by Parlier used funds from the Migrant Health Act that Fresno County had denied to form the Parlier Family Health Center Inc. By 1975 these two organizations that formed under similar circumstances merged and officially became the Orange Cove-Parlier Family Health Centers, Inc. In 1976 after working with CHEPA, Inc. to help one of its clinics in Five Points, California apple for Rural Health Initiative, Orange Cove-Parlier Family Health Centers, Inc. merged with CHEPA to form the United Health Centers of the San Joaquin Valley, Inc. This name represented their varied patient cohort areas ranging from the Western foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Orange Cove to the eastern slopes of the Coastal Range in Five Points. In 1977, UHC received a grant to construct permanent facilities at the Orange Cove and Parlier locations. The abandoned portables were then transferred to a labor camp in Huron to serve as their health center. A public health clinic had once stood there until the Fresno County Health Department discontinued it. After 8 years of use, a permanent facility was built for the Huron Health Center. By 1982, UHC was offered ownership of a health center located in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, thus making the Earlimart Health Center the fourth UHC health center. In succeeding years, UHC health centers were established in the communities of Mendota in 1993, Kerman in 1994, Sanger in 1995, and Corcoran in 2012. Currently, UHC is working on adding centers in Lemoore, Reedley, and a school based clinic in Raisin City.  Locations  United Health Centers currently operates 19 Health Centers and 15 WIC sites serving 28 rural communities in the following counties: Fresno County, Tulare County and Kings County. UHC sites are located in Dinuba, Fresno, Parlier, Mendota, Sanger, Orange Cove, Huron, Kerman, Earlimart, Corcoran, Lemoore, Reedley, Raisin City, Selma, and Fowler.  Population  The Central Valley's fertile soils have made it a world recognized center for agriculture; on 1% of the nation's farm land, the Central Valley produces 25% of the nations table food. 9 of the valley's 18 counties have 20% or more of the working population involved in the agriculture industry. The valley's population is set to increase to almost 12 million people by 2040. This growth is fueled by the influx of immigrants into the valley. 58% of the Central Valley's growth is due to domestic and international migrant. In the San Joaquin Valley approximately 26% of migrants were foreign born with 67% being from Mexico. 39.8% of the Central Valley residents identified as Latino in the 2000 census. The towns of Huron, Parlier, Mendota, San Joaquin, Orange Cove, Arvin, Firebaugh, McFarland, Woodlake, and Sanger, all San Joaquin Valley cities, have above 80% Latino population. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, the \\"San Joaquin Valley’s high incidence of poverty among immigrants, generally low levels of education, and limited English language skills present challenges for the region’s social service providers, particularly in health care and education.\\" One problem that this focus on agriculture causes in the Central Valley, especially the San Joaquin valley is the migratory patterns of its people both into and out of the valley. According to 2000 census data, the San Joaquin Valley saw a large influx of roughly 20,000 immigrants with a high school diploma or less, and an outflux of approximately 3,000 persons with a college degree. All of the counties in the San Joaquin Valley have a larger percentage of children in poverty, with Fresno and Tulare Counties having 32% and 33% of the child population in poverty, respectively. 80% of the children of immigrant parents in the valley live in homes that income is less than 200% of the federal poverty level. All of the San Joaquin Valley's counties have less than the national average of 235 physicians per 100,000 residents, with the lowest county being Madera County with 73 physicians/100,000 patients. Kern, Fresno, Tulare, and Merced counties were included in the American Lung Association's list of top 10 most ozone-polluted counties in the US in 2007. This is related to residents in the Valley have the thirdrd highest asthma prevalence in the nation. The migratory nature of its residents complicates the utilization and access to regular healthcare in the valley.  Meeting Needs of Population  In order to serve its rural population, UHC offers an array of health services to make sure that the isolated and often impoverished communities have access to all forms of health care. Currently UHC offers general and family medicine, pediatrics, general dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, pharmacy, clinical laboratory, x-ray, dermatology telemedicine, integrated behavioral health, and preventative medicine programs. To supplement these programs, UHC also offers perinatal health, nutrition counseling, WIC services, health education and promotion, family planning, immunizations, translation, community outreach, maternal and child health, and transportation services. To help ease the burden on its patients with out insurance, UHC bases its fees on a sliding scale based on income and family size. With the medicare expansion under ACA, UHC is reaching out to its patents without insurance to sign up all that are eligible. In an effort to increase mental health, all UHC centers offer behavioral/mental health services. Once a patient is viewed as being under mental distress, the primary care provider will inform the patient of the services that they offer to help them cope, and will bring in the Case Manager into the room and introduce them. UHC refers to this a \\"warm handoff,” allowing trust to be built immediately stemming from the patients trust of the physician. By offering this service immediately, they have decreased the amounts of no shows for behavioral/mental Health appointments. UHC hosts a variety of community engagement events to increase service awareness, inform local populations about pertinent information, and provide free health screenings to isolated populations. Throughout the year, UHC host health fairs to offer health screenings, vaccinations, and flu shots as well as inform people to possible new benefits available to them through the Affordable Care Act. Every year, in coordination with JG Boswell Company, a large farming company, UHC goes to the fields and offers health screenings to the farm workers to allow them to receive health services they need for free without having to miss work. UHC is taking advantage of the fact that the ACA has increased funds for school based clinics by opening one in the town of Raisin City. Currently, the closest clinic would be in Fresno, 17 miles away. School base clinics act offer inexpensive primary care, vaccinations, and prescriptions to the children while allowing them to miss less school than a usual doctors visit or urgent care would require. Other community members are also able to use these clinics. UHC Foundation The UHC Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization that commits to providing quality health supportive services with a variety of resources to enhance the well-being of rural San Joaquin Valley communities. In 1971, UHC originated in the farm working communities where residents expressed the need to have improved access to healthcare. These communities envisioned having the most comprehensive families oriented health care system to address the lack of medical and dental services thereby addressing such concerns as high infant morbidity and mortality rates and the affordability of healthcare. After 49 years, UHC serves over 100,000 patients with 450,000 clinical appointments a year, from 19 Health Centers covering 3 Central Valley counties across Fresno, Kings and Tulare. In 2012, the UHC Foundation was formed to dedicate additional resources to support community programs with a high level of assistance towards enabling greater accessibility and improving community wellness for healthier lives in rural communities. The UHC Foundation supports many programs beyond the scope of healthcare including the UHC/YMCA Summer Youth Camp where over 80 children attend camp each year, the UHC Patient Transportation Program, a fleet of 5 transportation vehicles utilized throughout the year to service over 13,000 patients and the UHC Prom Treasures Program for Prom Dresses which supports valley teens by providing dresses for less fortunate students.

Completed in 1972, it was the first upscale, indoor shopping mall in Jerusalem. Built as part of a plan to revitalize Jaffa Road, it enjoyed a brief period of high occupancy until many tenants relocated to malls and office buildings in new suburbs in the 1990s. It is widely viewed as a commercial and architectural failure. Location The Clal Center is located in Jerusalem, Israel, at the southeastern corner of Jaffa Road and Kiah Street, one block east of the Mahane Yehuda Market. Its northern facade faces Jaffa Road and Davidka Square and its southern facade faces Agrippas Street. The building has several entrances opening onto Jaffa Road, Kiah Street, and Agrippas Street, as well as an underground parking garage accessible from Kiah Street. History =Alliance Vocational School campus= Alliance Vocational School Mural depicting the Alliance School; the Clal Center can be seen in the background, right The land on which the Clal Center stands was formerly part of the campus of the Alliance Vocational School (Kol Yisrael Haverim School), the first Jewish trade school in Jerusalem. Enrolling mostly Sephardic Jewish students, the school offered courses in tailoring, shoemaking, carpentry, blacksmithing, mechanics, engraving, sculpting (of stone, wood, and shell), coppersmithing, weaving, dyeing, stonecutting, and masonry. Founded in 1882 by the Alliance Israélite Universelle of Paris, the school occupied of land and consisted of a main building surrounded by long workshop buildings and landscaped gardens. Most of the school buildings and garden were razed in 1970 to make way for the Clal Center. In 1976 a memorial to the demolished school was placed to the side of the Clal Center, facing Jaffa Road. The memorial consists of a decorative iron gate etched with the name of the school in French. The gate is mounted between two stone pillars; (subscription) it is not standing in its original location. Another memorial to the destroyed school appears in the form of a mural in the Mahane Yehuda Market parking lot to the west. This mural depicts paintings of the main building and garden, and pictures of teachers and students. =Project goals= The Clal Center was envisioned as a means to increase commercial activity and pedestrian presence between Mahane Yehuda Market to the west and the city center and Ben Yehuda Street to the east. According to Jerusalem architectural historian David Kroyanker, the Clal Center was \\"the first attempt to create a luxurious roofed shopping center in Jerusalem\\". It was also the first project to have an additional wing. The city granted the planners \\"exceptional building rights\\" in the hope that the project would boost business and commercial activity on Jaffa Road. Design Rescue nets installed around the building's exterior The Clal Center, completed in 1972, reflects the 1970s trend in Israeli architecture that moved away from small- scale buildings toward projects that contained \\"everything under one roof\\". The 15-story tower block was designed by Israeli architect Dan Eitan, who planned many large-scale public buildings and office towers in Israel, notably in Tel Aviv. The shopping levels in the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated around the perimeter of a large, central atrium. Originally the atrium was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices. The exterior of the building reflects modern architecture with \\"straight lines, sequential windows, and a smooth, white stone facing\\". Because of the building's height, the Clal Center quickly became a popular venue for suicide jumpers who leaped from the upper-story windows. Rescue nets were subsequently installed on the outside of the building. After the Clal Center was erected, a popular legend sprung up in Jerusalem that two criminals had murdered a third and buried him in the concrete foundations of the Clal Center. This rumor may have been started by parties interested in the project's failure. Partial view of shopping levels and food court inside the Clal Center Use The Clal Center enjoyed a high occupancy rate from government offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated the exodus of many private and government firms in the 1990s, leaving entire floors of the office tower unoccupied. Stores on the commercial level also began closing due to lack of customers; as of 2010, many stores were being used as storerooms by Mahane Yehuda Market merchants. In the winter of 2011–2012, 25 homeless families that had been living in tent encampments in Independence Park and the Kiryat Yovel neighborhood were housed in empty offices in the Clal Center. (subscription) Current tenants include the following government offices: Israel Police Accidents Division – Jerusalem District, Ministry of Transport and Road Safety, Ministry of Justice Corporations Authority, and the Collection and Enforcement Agency. Other major tenants are the Jerusalem Light Rail customer service center, and branches of Bank Hapoalim and Israel Discount Bank. The King of Kings, a non- denominational messianic Christian congregation, opened a \\"Jerusalem Prayer Tower\\" on the 14th floor of the Clal Center in 2004, affording panoramic views of the city. In 2011–2012, as part of the conversion of Jaffa Road into a pedestrian-only zone, a small parking area between the Clal Center and Jaffa Road was redeveloped into a public square. The project, costing over 4 million shekel, added a granite pavement, public seating, trees, and decorative lighting. (subscription) Criticism Clal Center (arrow) with Nachlaot neighborhood in foreground Almost from its inception, the Clal Center was the target of criticism. Some critics decried the decision to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School in order to build the project in the first place. Others pointed out that the style and height of the building were incompatible with typical low-rise Jerusalem architecture in the surrounding neighborhood. Kroyanker notes that the building has not aged well; some of the stone tiles have fallen off and the rest appear weather-beaten and grimy. Inside, on the shopping levels, the \\"maze\\" of staircases that connect the levels are difficult to navigate, and the \\"wide granite surfaces create a very mournful effect\\". Poor lighting and parking accessibility have also been cited as problematic. Eitan, the architect, candidly added the Clal Center to a 1992 Israeli exhibition titled \\"Bad Jobs\\". The goal of increasing commercial and business activity on Jaffa Road never materialized. Several attempts were made to bring a pedestrian presence to the street, such as the construction of the Windows residential tower next door, but to date nothing has been successful and the project has been deemed a commercial failure. Kroyanker contends that not only did the Clal Center fail to revitalize Jaffa Road, it \\"actually accelerated its degeneration\\". In particular, he points to the lack of anchor stores, the lack of continuity of small businesses, and the cessation of activity in the stores and banks in the Clal Center in the early afternoon for making the project \\"a typical Jerusalem commercial failure\\". Incidents On June 11, 2003, a suicide bomber dressed as a Haredi Jew detonated an explosive pack on an eastbound #14 bus in front of the Clal Center. The attack killed 16 and injured more than 100. In July 2013, a man entered a law office in the Clal Center and shot dead a father and daughter who worked as a legal team over an apparent business dispute.

Since 1913, the entire treasure has been at the British Museum.British Museum Collection Discovery and original ownership In the early 1900s, a rich collection of silver articles was unearthed from a tomb near the city of Bursa in the Marmara Region of Turkey. The exact circumstances of the treasure's discovery remains unclear but soon after it was found it was sold to the British Museum by the London art dealer W. C. Bacon & Co. The lack of provenance has made it difficult to determine who the hoard originally belonged to, but most of the extant objects indicate that it was probably part of an elite Roman lady's toiletry from the 1st century AD. Description The Bursa Treasure is composed of seven silver cosmetic objects that include a distaff, a toilet vessel, a small pyxis with lid, a simpulum or ladel, a spoon with a handle in the shape of a swan, a large mirror and a patera or libation bowl, the back of which has the faint impression of a Chinese silk garment from the Han dynasty.

It is a parasite of primates which was first described in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) in 1940. The intermediate host are oribatid mites, which ingest the eggs, and are themselves ingested by the vertebrate host. Oribatid mites infected with Bertiella transfer the developmental cysticercoid stage to a human host through tissue feeding. This is one of two species of Bertiella that cause Bertielliasis in humans (the other being Bertiella mucronata). The majority of human cases occur in individuals who have some level of contact with non-humanprimates.https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/bertiella/index.html Geographic distribution of cases demonstrate Bertiellia infection within countries from Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Morphology An adult B. studeri tapeworm measures 10–30 cm long, and is 1 cm wide. The adult develops in the small intestine of the primate host. Once the adult develops in the small intestine, section of proglottid are expelled through the anus every 2 to 3 days. The average length of a B.

It belongs to the genus Bertiella, family Anoplocephalidae. This is one of two species of Bertiella that can cause the condition in humans (the other being Bertiella studeri).  Epidemiology  The genus Bertiella has 29 cestode species that infect primarily non-human primates. B. studeri and B. mucronata can cause the condition in humans. It usually occurs in children with close contact to non-human primates. This is known to occur in Africa, Asia, Oceania, South America and Cuba.  Life Cycle/Reproduction  The life cycle of Bertiella species has a two-host life cycle. An arthropod (such as a mite) serves as the intermediate host, and a vertebrate serves as the definitive host. First, the eggs and proglottids are passed in the feces of the definitive host. There oncospheres are ingested by the arthropod intermediate host. Once ingested, the oncospheres develop into cysticercoids. The definitive hosts then become infected after ingesting arthropod intermediate hosts infected with cysticercoids. The cysticercoid everts an unarmed scolex, which it uses to attach to the small intestinal wall. Adults remain in the small intestine of the host, releasing eggs and repeating the cycle.  Symptoms/Treatment  Human cases are exceptionally rare, but most patients have reported no symptoms or some mild gastrointestinal symptoms, ranging from constipation, loss of appetite and weight, to general fatigue. Treatment consists of various anthelminthic agents, such as Quinacrine34, niclosamide, praziquantel, and albendazole34.

Diplomatic changes After the war, Chile had obtained military hegemony at the Pacific Coast of South America. Chile's expansion was seen with concern across the continent, and Chilean diplomats responded by fomenting rivalries between Chile's neighbors and other South American countries and promoting friendly relationships between countries with disputes with Chile's neighbors. Examples are the Chilean attempts to establish friendly relationships between Ecuador and Colombia, both countries with serious territorial disputes with Peru in the Amazon. Military co-operation with Ecuador grew considerably, and Chile sent instructors to the military academy in Quito and sold superfluous arms and munitions to Ecuador.Burr , Robert N. 1955. The Balance of Power in Nineteenth-Century South America: An Exploratory Essay. The Hispanic American Historical Review. Despite Chile's overall good relations with Ecuador, both countries had a minor diplomatic crisis resulting from the capture of the Peruvian torpedo boat Alay in Ecuadorian territorial waters during the war. Argentina, the only country not at war with Chile despite a common border, had tensions with Chile since but, unlike Peru and Bolivia, successfully maintained peace with Chile but almost fought a war over the border in 1982.

The national treasury grew by 900% between 1879 and 1902 because of taxes coming from the newly-acquired lands.Crow, The Epic of Latin America, p. 180 British involvement and control of the nitrate industry rose significantly,Foster, John B. & Clark, Brett.

The growth of Chilean economy sustained in its saltpetre monopoly and meant that compared to the previous growth cycle (1832–1873), the economy became less diversified and overly dependent on a single natural resource. In addition, Chilean nitrate, used worldwide as fertilizer, was sensitive to economic downturns, as farmers made cuts on fertilizer use one of their earliest economic measures in the face of economic decline. It has been questioned whether or not the nitrate wealth conquered in the War of the Pacific was a resource curse. During the Nitrate Epoch, the government increased public spending but was accused of squandering money.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 25–29. Rise of Bolivian and Peruvian anti- Chilean sentiment Eduardo Abaroa's statue pointing to the sea. The mural reads: \\"What once was ours, will be ours once again\\" and \\"Hold on rotos [Chileans], because here come the Colorados of Bolivia.\\" Historical and current anti-Chilean resentiment in Bolivia, Peru, and Argentina was caused by the 19th-century Chilean expansionism. The War of the Pacific contributed decisively in the first two of those countries. In Bolivia, a common political discourse attributes that country's underdevelopment to its loss of seaports in the War of the Pacific becoming a landlocked country. Bolivia lost its Litoral Department and its outlet to the Pacific Ocean, following that war. Currently Chile's huge copper vein in the Atacama Desert, which makes Chile the largest copper exporter in the world, is held in the lands claimed by Bolivia; the same lands lost during the war. In Peru, a strong anti-Chilean sentiment exists because it lost \\"a large chunk of its southern territory to Chile\\" in the War of the Pacific. Peru lost its provinces of Tarapaca and Arica and then suffered the indignity of having its capital, Lima, occupied by Chile at the end of the war and even essentially ransacked. For Argentina, since they failed to get involved in the conflict and were also colonizing the less inhabited South, mainly in fear of Brazil's possible support for Chile in the war, Chile's victory in the conflict stemmed tensions that Chile was trying to take land from the Argentines. Although that never happened and both finalized their border, both countries remained belligerent and came close to war in 1982. On the other side, Argentina's unsupportive action for Bolivia and Peru also made their relationships very tense, and there is a sense of distrust towards Argentina among many Peruvians and Bolivians. Rise of superiority ideas During and after the war there was a rise of racial and national superiority ideas among the Chilean ruling class.Ericka Beckman Imperial Impersonations: Chilean Racism and the War of the Pacific University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Chilean historian Gonzalo Bulnes (son of president Manuel Bulnes) once wrote, \\"What defeated Peru was the superiority of a race and of a history\\". During the occupation of Tacna and Arica (1884–1929) the Peruvian people and nation were treated in racist and denigrating terms by the Chilean press.William E. Skuban Lines in the sand: nationalism and identity on the Peruvian-Chilean frontier page 79: : \\"because it is undoubtedly preferable to be Chilean than Peruvian, because has a cleaner and more glorious history, and its better to belong to the phalanx of the conquerors than that of the conquered, because the Chilean race is more virile, valiant, prouder, nobler and more enterprising than the Peruvian race, which due to reasons of climate will always be enervated\\" Chilean newspaper El Corvo quote in page 80 During the war Peruvians were disrespectfully referred to as \\"cholos\\" (a slur for persons of mixed European and non-European ancestry) by Chilean officers. Indigenous peoples After the occupation of Lima, Chile diverted part of its war efforts to crush Mapuche resistance in the south. Chilean troops coming from Peru entered Araucanía where they in 1881 defeated the last major Mapuche uprising. Chile's newly-acquired Aymara population was seen after the war as a \\"foreign element\\" contrasting with the also newly-conquered Mapuches who were seen as \\"primordial\\" Chileans. Following the occupation of Lima, Chilean newspapers published extremely patriotic, chauvinist, and expansionistic material. An extreme example of such journalism is Revista del Sur, which stated that firearms obtained in Peru, while useless in the hands of Peruvian \\"fags\\" (Spanish: maricas), would be useful by Chileans to \\"kill indians\\" (Mapuches). After the war, the indigenous peoples in Peru became scapegoats in the narratives of Peruvian criollo elites, exemplified in the writing of Ricardo Palma: > The principal cause of the great defeat is that the majority of Peru is > composed of that wretched and degraded race that we once attempted to > dignify and ennoble. The Indian lacks patriotic sense; he is born enemy of > the white and of the man of the coast. It makes no difference to him whether > he is a Chilean or a Turk. To educate the Indian and to inspire him a > feeling for patriotism will not be the task of our institutions, but of the > ages.Larson, Brooke. 2004. Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race and > Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810–1910. Page 196. Anti-Chinese sentiment in Peru Because the Chinese supported Chile in the conflict, it had stemmed a sense of Sinophobia in Peru, the first of its kind ever existed in Latin America. Armed indigenous peasants sacked and occupied haciendas of landed elite criollo \\"collaborationists\\" in the central Sierra, most of whom were of ethnic Chinese descent, and indigenous and mestizo Peruvians murdered Chinese shopkeepers in Lima. In response, the Chinese coolies revolted and even joined the Chilean Army.Taylor, Lewis. Indigenous Peasant Rebellions in Peru during the 1880sBonilla, Heraclio. 1978. The National and Colonial Problem in Peru. Past and Present Even in the 20th century, the memory of Chinese support for Chile was so deep that Manuel A. Odría, a dictator of Peru, banned Chinese immigration as a punishment for their betrayal.Dragons in the Land of the Condor: Writing Tusán in Peru Today, however, Sinophobia has been less relevant, and the Chinese are widely accepted as Peruvian citizens, but distrust of China and the Chinese still remains.  Unrest and war trauma in Peru  During the occupation of Peru civilians were directly involved in the war. This mural reads: \\"In this town six compatriots were executed by firing squad and history cannot be changed. Eternal glory to the heroes and martyrs of Quequeña!\\" The War of the Pacific also sparked an indigenous peasant guerrilla movement throughout the central Sierra against Chileans and collaborationist landlords. In 1884, Cáceres turned against his former guerrilla allies to defend the old order. In 1886 and 1888, the Cáceres sent troops to the central Sierra to disarm the peasants. The lack of rule of law in central sierra was such that in one particular case, a landowner was able to recover his occupied estate only in 1902 after a massive mobilization of military, police, and gunmen. Rise of war heroes =Eduardo Abaroa= =Miguel Grau= Miguel Grau became an important figure in Peru because of his alleged gallantry during the conflict, especially his treatment of Prat's family and rescue of Chilean sailors in Iquique, which gained him recognition as the Caballero de los Mares (\\"Gentleman of the Seas\\").Jose Vargas Valenzuela, Naval Tradition of the Peoples of Bolivia (Editorial Los Amigos del Libro, 1974), 61 =Arturo Prat= Overall  = Bolivia = With the loss of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean in mind, the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship granted Bolivia the right to tax-free transport of goods and duty-free access to northern Chilean ports. It also obliged the Chilean government to build two rail-lines linking La Paz to Antofagasta and Arica. Despite the concessions, the loss of the litoral (the coast) remains a deeply-emotional and political issue for Bolivians,http://www.coha.org/boliviachile-pacific-access as was particularly evident during the 2003 natural gas riots. Undeterred by the seaport concessions granted to Bolivia via the 1904 treaty, Bolivian popular opinion still attributes problems to the landlocked condition, and getting a sovereign piece of the seacoast via Chilean land is often seen as the solution to the problems. Numerous Bolivian presidents pressured Chile for sovereign access to the sea. Diplomatic relations with Chile were severed on March 17, 1978 in spite of considerable commercial ties. The leading Bolivian newspaper El Diario featured at least every week an editorial on the subject, and Bolivians annually celebrate a patriotic \\"Dia del Mar\\" (Day of the Sea) to remember the crippling loss. = Chile = During the war, Chile dropped its claims on more than of Patagonia in the 1881 Chile-Argentina treaty to ensure Argentina's neutrality. After the war, the Puna de Atacama dispute grew until 1899 since both Chile and Argentina claimed former Bolivian territories. On August 28, 1929, Chile returned the province of Tacna to Peru. In 1999, Chile and Peru at last agreed to implement the Treaty of Lima (1929) fully by providing Peru with a port in Arica.Dominguez, Jorge et al. 2003 Boundary Disputes in Latin America. United States Washington, D.C.: Institute of Peace. = Peru = According to Bruce W. Farcau, \\"in Peru, the wounds run less deep than in neighboring Bolivia\\". After the War of the Pacific, Peru was left without saltpeter production, the Chilean controlled production decreased to 15%, and production controlled by British investors rose to 55%.British Influence on the Salt: The Origin, Nature and Decline, Soto Cárdenas, Alejandro. Santiago : Ed. University of Santiago de Chile, 1998. Page 50 According to military historian Robert L. Scheina, the Chilean plunder of Peruvian national literary and art treasures contributed to \\"demands of revenge among Peruvians for decades.\\" Scholar Brooke Larson pointed out that the War of the Pacific was the \\"first time since independence wars\\" that \\"Peru was invaded, occupied and pillaged by a foreign army\\" and that \\"no other Andean republic experienced such a costly and humiliating defeat as Peru did in the hands of Chile\\".Larson, Brooke. 2004. Trials of Nation Making: Liberalism, Race and Ethnicity in the Andes, 1810–1910. Page 178. The war and afterward had profound political and social instability in Peru. The war shook the whole social order of Peru: armed indigenous peasants sacked and occupied haciendas of landed elite criollo \\"collaborationists\\" in the central Sierra, Chinese coolies revolted and even joined the Chilean Army, indigenous and mestizo Peruvians murdered Chinese shopkeepers in Lima, Peruvian mobs sacked Chiclayo, and different criollo elite remained deeply divided in opposing camps. The fear of disorder, opposing factions, and armed peasants was for many Peruvians larger than that of the Chilean invaders. In some cases, the delegations of European countries and of the US provided safety during riots and persecutions. References Bibliography *Salazar, Gabriel; Pinto, Julio (2002).

They are known primarily from copies dating to the Old Babylonian period, ca. 1800-1600 BCE; their original date of composition and their historical accuracy are debated. Copies of the letters The CKU letters are known only through copies written on clay tablets as school exercises by students learning to write cuneiform. All but one of the known copies have been dated to the Old Babylonian period, and were found in cities of Mesopotamia or the broader Near East, including Nippur, Ur, Isin, Uruk, Kish, Sippar, and Susa. A single tablet bearing copies of two of the letters and dating to the Middle Babylonian period was also found at Susa.Michalowski, Piotr. 2011. The Correspondence of the Kings of Ur: An Epistolary History of an Ancient Mesopotamian Kingdom. Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns. p. 22, pp. 36 ff.

Some of the topics that show up include: difficulties in dealing with particular officials, the building and repair of fortifications, reports about securing the provinces and the completion of other assignments, and accusations of disloyalty or injustice directed towards other officials.

Reading and Writing in Babylon. Translated by Jane Marie Todd. First published as Lire et Écrire à Babylone, Presses Universitaires de France, 2008. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 116-117. For many years, the letters were treated as one of the best sources of information for reconstructing political events of the Ur III period, especially the end of the kingdom. The modernistic account of the end of the Ur III dynasty, for example (catastrophic collapse due to factors such as Amorite invasions, environmental disasters and crop failures, and the rise of bloated bureaucracy), is largely based on CKU.Michalowski, Piotr. 2011. The Correspondence of the Kings of Ur: An Epistolary History of an Ancient Mesopotamian Kingdom. Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns. pp. 170-171, p. 216 However, the historicity of the letters has recently been called into question, sparking at times intense debate among scholars over the past decade. In 2001, Fabienne Huber published an article entitled “La Correspondance Royale d’Ur, un corpus apocryphe,” in which she argued that the corpus was entirely apocryphal. This argument was based primarily on the occurrence of post-Ur III linguistic features,Huber, Fabienne. 2001. “La Correspondance Royale d’Ur, un corpus apocryphe.” Zeitschrift für Assyriologie 91: 169-206. pp. 171-179. of borrowings between the letters,Huber, Fabienne. 2001. “La Correspondance Royale d’Ur, un corpus apocryphe.” Zeitschrift für Assyriologie 91: 169-206. pp. 180-187. and of post-Ur III personal names and place names.Huber, Fabienne. 2001. “La Correspondance Royale d’Ur, un corpus apocryphe.” Zeitschrift für Assyriologie 91: 169-206. pp. 188-205 . In response to Huber's article, W. W. Hallo wrote an adamant defense of the CKU's authenticity, arguing that nearly all of the letters were copied from Ur III archival letters and can be used as invaluable historical sources.Hallo, William W. 2006. “A Sumerian Apocryphon? The Royal Correspondence of Ur Reconsidered.” In Approaches to Sumerian Literature: Studies in Honour of Stip (H. L. J. Vanstiphout), edited by Piotr Michalowski and Niek Veldhuis, 85-104. Leiden: Brill. Piotr Michalowski, in his 2011 publication of the entire CKU, presented an argument against both viewpoints. Instead, he took the position that some elements of authentic Ur III letters were incorporated into the Old Babylonian curriculum, but that these were extensively redacted; in some cases it is possible to tell that a letter was fabricated, while in others, it is more likely that the core of the letter represents original Ur III content.Michalowski, Piotr. 2011. The Correspondence of the Kings of Ur: An Epistolary History of an Ancient Mesopotamian Kingdom. Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns. pp. 218-219. In a review of Michalowski's book, Pascal Attinger defended Huber's position against Michalowski's critiques.Attinger, Pascal. 2012. “Une nouvelle edition de la corrsepondance royale d’Ur.” Orientalia 81: 355-385. pp. 357-385.

Gulf Cryo was founded by Salim Huneidi in 1953 as the Kuwait Oxygen and Acetylene Company. It was the first gas manufacturer in Kuwait to provide industrial gases such as oxygen and nitrogen to the local petroleum industry. History In the early 1950s, Salim Huneidi, who worked as an agent for an international Steel Structure and Construction company felt that there was a shortage of supply of cutting and welding gases in Kuwait. He began researching the industrial processes to supply to the growing demand of industrial gases and built the Arabian Gulf’s first oxygen separation plant in 1953 in Kuwait City, under the name Kuwait Oxygen and Acetylene Company (KOAC). Salim Huneidi signed a deal with the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) (earlier known as Amen Oil), which led KOC to shut down their small Oxygen plant and start outsourcing this product from local suppliers; that was the base that Salim Huneidi built on for his Industrial gas project in Kuwait. In 1971, KOAC expanded its operation to the Shuaiba Industrial area in Kuwait and established The Kuwait Industrial Gases Company (KIGC). KIGC would primarily supply its products to the oil and refining infrastructure being built in the Shuaiba area. KIGC built a pipeline between the company and the refineries i.e. The KNPC Group, to provide a continuous supply of Nitrogen to cover their demand. The Arabian Industrial Gases Company (AIGCo) was formed in 1977 in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. In 1998, Amer Huneidi, son of Huneidi was appointed as Chairman and soon afterwards he led to the consolidation and creation of The Huneidi Group of Companies. By 2006, Gulf Cryo Qatar was established and in 2007 Gulf Cryo became a holding company. In 2008, Gulf Cryo Saudi Arabia was established. In 2009, Investcorp purchased 20% of the organisation. In late 2009, Gulf Cryo Oman was established. By 2012, Gulf Cryo was established in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan. In 2013, EQUATE Petrochemical Company, as part of its sustainability initiatives, launched its second CO2 recovery project in Kuwait in partnership with Gulf Cryo. The next year, Gulf Cryo announced expansion of its CO2 business. The company invested in four CO2 hubs in Dubai, Kuwait, Dammam and Amman. Gulf Cryo acquired Deniz Gaz, a gas company based in Turkey and entered the Turkish market in 2014. The same year, Gulf Cryo acquired a minority stake in Tyczka Air Austria. Yaliz Gaz, another Turkish gas company, along with its affiliates was acquired by Gulf Cryo in 2015 increasing the company's coverage in Turkey. In February 2016, Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Company, the investment arm of the Kingdom of Bahrain, announced that it has acquired a minority equity stake in Gulf Cryo. Gulf Cryo in partnership with EQUATE Petrochemical Company also launched the first commercial carbon dioxide (CO2) plant in Kuwait.  Products  Gulf Cryo produces and supplies industrial gases namely Acetylene, Air, Argon, Carbon Dioxide, Helium, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. The company also produces medical gases including Entonox, Medical Air, Medical Carbon Dioxide, Medical Nitrogen, Medical Nitrous Oxide and Medical Oxygen. It also produces Dry Ice. The management systems at Gulf Cryo are complaint to ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 FSC 22000 standards.

It was written by Ray Davies. It was released as the debut single from Preservation Act 2 in the U.K. only, but a version that was rerecorded for the American release was released as a single in both America and Britain. Lyrics and Music \\"Mirror of Love\\" makes use of a New Orleans jazz, with Ray Davies on the majority of the instruments on the album/U.K. single version (guitar, piano and drums) with the only other people playing on the song being Dave Davies on mandolin as well as horns. Like many tracks of the era, Davies is singing as one of the characters in the Preservation storyline. This time he portrays Belle, who is the lover of Flash (the main character of the Preservation saga), who complains of Flash's cruel treatment toward her (for example, she says that Flash would \\"slap [her] down, treat [her] bad\\".) However, \\"through the mirror of love\\" she still loves him, with Belle calling him her \\"dream lover\\", saying that she \\"would kill for\\" him. Reception \\"Mirror of Love\\" was one of the more positively reviewed tracks from the Preservation saga. Andrew Hickey wrote in his book Preservation: The Kinks Music 1964-1974 that \\"musically, the song is a rather good effort at trad jazz\\" and that it is \\"a simple but effective song.\\" He also claimed that \\"[Ray] Davies' vocals are probably his best on the album, with some wonderful jumps into a trilling falsetto a la Rudy Valee\\" and went on to say that it \\"is easily the best track on the album.\\" Jason Josephes of Pitchfork Media called \\"Mirror of Love\\" \\"a psychedelic Dixieland number that could have only sprouted from the whimsical noggin of Ray Davies.\\" AllMusic cited the track as a highlight from the album. Band Version Although the original album version was released as a single in Britain, it was rerecorded with the rest of the band participating for the track's single release in the United States. It was not successful (it did not chart in either Britain or America), but this version was released as a bonus track on the Velvel reissue of Preservation Act 2 (as well as the outtake \\"Slum Kids\\"). Andrew Hickey said that this version and the original edit \\"differ in a few points of arrangement and vocal performance, but are very similar.\\" This version also appeared on Picture Book.

Formed by bandleader Nick Gregg in 2008, the group has grown to include a collective of more than twenty musicians playing strings, horns, guitars, and percussion. History = 2008–2009: Formation = Nick Gregg formed Mother Falcon in 2008 with members of the Red Armada String Quartet, a high school ensemble that had studied with the noted Austin composers Graham Reynolds and Peter Stopschinski at the Austin Chamber Music Center. Additional members came from McCallum High School, Westlake High School, St. Edward's University, and the University of Texas at Austin, where Gregg graduated in architecture. = 2010–2012: First releases and regional acclaim = As Mother Falcon grew in number, live performances could include as few as eleven and as many as twenty musicians. The core group of vocalists came to include Gregg, as well as guitarist Claire Puckett and accordionist-pianist Tamir Kalifa. The collective self-released their debut EP Still Life in 2010. In 2011, the collective released their first full-length album Alhambra. Their music was reviewed positively by the local press and placed twice on the cover of the Austin Chronicle. At the 2010, 2011 and 2012 Austin Music Awards, Mother Falcon won the \\"Best None of The Above\\" award. In 2011, the group performed at the abandoned Seaholm Power Plant in Austin at the opening of the Fusebox Festival. In 2012, Mother Falcon headlined The Austin Chamber Music Festival. Around this time, the band began to perform in all black clothing with red accents, which bandleader Nick Gregg says allows audiences to focus on the music but is also an homage to the band's classical roots. = 2013–2016: You Knew and national prominence = In May 2013, Mother Falcon released their sophomore album You Knew. The release coincided with many of the members' college graduations. The band began to garner national attention, including press from NPR, The Daily Beast, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Texas Monthly. After the release of You Knew, Mother Falcon began touring regularly. In June 2013, the band relocated to New York City for the month where they had residencies at Joe's Pub in Manhattan and Littlefield in Brooklyn, followed by residences at The Echo in Los Angeles and Soda Bar in San Diego later in the year. While in New York, the band collaborated with other composers and performers including Jherek Bischoff, Amanda Palmer, Raul Midon, Tony Trischka, Ben Sollee, Kelli Scarr, and Gary Lucas. They toured the West Coast in August 2013 and again in February 2014, and headlined the IdeaFestival in Louisville, Kentucky in September 2013. The band returned to the Northeast in January 2014, playing as a part of the Winter Jazz Festival at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. During some of these shows, Mother Falcon would play two sets; the first set focused on the collective's original music and the second set would see them play Radiohead's OK Computer in its entirety. In March 2014, the band released their reimagining of OK Computer as a digital album. In October 2015, Mother Falcon released a new studio album Good Luck Have Fun. Originally slated to be released in August 2015, the record was picked up and released through Universal Music Group's Classics division in the Fall; Good Luck Have Fun was Mother Falcon's major label debut, despite not being signed to the label at the time. The first half of the record is a collection of symphonic pop songs while the second half is the contemporary classical Starnation Suite, a seven-song score written for the independent e-sports documentary ProGamer. In 2015, Mother Falcon co-headlined a major American tour with Ben Sollee called The Fall Migration. The last show they played during this album cycle outside of their hometown was a show at Joe's Pub in New York City in July 2016. = 2017–Present: New projects and transformation = The beginning of 2017 marked a new era for Mother Falcon. Around this time, the band faced crossroads as a whole and as individuals. Some members wanted to or had already moved cross country while others planned to pursue further degrees or focus more on their professional careers. Ultimately, the group had to redefine its goals and the scope of the collective. In December 2016, the group turned down a recording contract with Universal Music Classics which would have required the group to produce three more albums after Good Luck Have Fun. That same month the band played a retrospective show in Austin to mark the end of this era. From 2017 through 2019, the group was involved a smaller but more diverse set of projects. These included members continuing to conduct the Mother Falcon Music Lab, composing and performing scores for live theater, and continuing to perform from time to time around Austin, particularly at the SXSW music festival. Many of the members were involved in Lionheart Youth Theatre/Glass Half Full Theatre's original production Petra and the Wolf. Mother Falcon composed the score which is performed live by the band at the shows. Petra and the Wolf premiered in Austin in December 2015. The following December, the production ran in Austin again. Following this, the entire production began to tour nationally. This included one-off shows for different organizations as well as a November 2017 East Coast Tour and a January-April 2018 Midwest/West Coast tour. Mother Falcon plans to release the score in late 2019. On Valentine's Day 2018, Mother Falcon released a new single, a reworking of their 2015 song \\"You Are\\" on the small We Are: The Guard record label. In March 2019, the group released their cover of \\"I Can't Stand the Rain\\" as a single and hinted at new music to come. During the first half of August 2019, Mother Falcon performed original music for Trouble Puppet Theater Company's American Blood Song: A Puppet Operetta of The Donner Party. Mother Falcon performed as a cello-guitar- saxophone trio. Summer camp Since 2011, Mother Falcon has hosted a summer camp, the Mother Falcon Music Lab, for middle and high-school aged musicians in Austin, Texas. The band has played and curated a series of benefit shows over the years to support the camp's need-based scholarship program.

The headwaters of the River Rhondda are to the south-west. It is a burial monument dating to the Bronze Age, and is sited on the edge of a steep scarp slope, with a wide field of view to the north. The long distance footpath Coed Morgannwg Way runs close by the cairn. Conifer plantations of the Rheola Forest surround the site. Cairn The cairn is a mound roughly across and high, made up of small stones. The visible ones appear to be slabs of the locally occurring sandstone, although much of the mound is grass covered, so most stones are obscured and the edge is very indistinct.Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust: , accessed 12 May 2014 In 1977 the mound was reported to have received some damage during 20th century forestry activity, and received a partial excavation around this time, which confirmed its size, but revealed neither any burials nor any other finds. The cairn is a Scheduled Monument. Situation The scarp edge on which the cairn was built is at above sea level, on a ridge that culminates half a mile (1km) to the south at the summit of Craig y Llyn, the highest point in Glamorgan It is a large tract of unnocupied land, with nor roads, now substantially planted with conifers.Neath Port Talbot Landmap: Landscape Assessment, Final Report, 2003, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council and Countryside Council for Wales. p.63.

The scarp winds its way east-west between Rhigos and Mynydd Resolven, and various Bronze Age cairns are strung out along its length. For example to the west are Craig-y-Pant and Garn Fach, and to the east, Twyn Canwyllyr, Craig-y-Bwlch and Rhondda Fach Cairns, all occupying similar locations on the scarp.RCAHMW: Coflein map search.

The long-distance Coed Morgannwg Way runs east-west from there along the scarp, immediately past the cairn before turning south to Cwm Afon. Other tracks and paths and cycle paths within the woodland also provide easy access to the monument.

The term can also be used to refer to the act of showing support for a cause through a like, share, etc. on any social media platform, such as Facebook or Twitter. The point of hashtag activism is arguably to share certain issues with one's friends and followers in the hopes that they will also share the same information. This leads to a widespread discussion and allows for change to occur. However, hashtags have also been used to debate and make people aware of social and political issues. They can be seen as a way to help or start a revolution by increasing the number of supporters from across the world who have not been in contact with the issue. It allows people to discuss and comment around one hashtag. Hashtag activism is a way to expand the usage of communication and make it democratic in a way that everyone has a way to express their opinions. Especially it provides an important platform for historically disenfranchised populations, enabling them to communicate, mobilize and advocate on topics less visible in mainstream media. The concept of hashtag activism has received critique from both critics and supporters. Some supporters argue that using social media for activism is a good idea because it allows one to connect with people from all over the world in a short amount of time. Critics, on the other hand, question whether hashtag activism leads to real change as users are simply indicating that they care, rather than taking specific action to make a difference. History Hashtags were created by Chris Messina, former Google developer, in 2007. He wanted to create a platform where people can have organized conversations. This platform would be easy to access on a phone and easy to use. His goal was to have an open source where people would be encouraged to express their opinions freely on what they thought over the topic. His vision can now be seen through hashtag activism. The oldest known mention of the term is from The Guardian in 2011, where it was mentioned in context to describe Occupy Wall Street protests. The hashtag was used as means to coordinate conversation online, find supporters, and arrange spontaneous protests. Since then, the term is used to refer to the use of hashtags on multiple social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr. There has been a shift among activists to participate in interactive communication on the Internet.  Notable examples  The following notable examples are organized by categories: human rights, awareness, political, and trends. = Anti- discrimination = #BlackLivesMatter The Black Lives Matter movement calls for an end to police brutality and the killings of African-Americans in the U.S. The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag was first started by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi as a response to the trial and later acquittal of George Zimmerman who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The hashtag saw a revival in 2014, after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and after a grand jury did not indict police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner.  #IStandWithAhmed  IstandwithAhmed: In 2015, a teenage student named Ahmed Mohamed was arrested at his high school in Irving, Texas after his teacher mistook his reassembled clock for a bomb. Ultimately, he was not convicted of any crimes, but he was suspended from school. Shortly after his story hit the news, a tech blogger named Anil Dash tweeted a picture of Ahmed being arrested in his NASA T-shirt along with the \\"#IstandwithAhmed.\\" His tweet went viral and drew accusations of racism and Islamophobia against the school. It sparked an online movement where many individuals, including scientists and engineers, tweeted their support for Ahmed under the same hashtag.  #TakeAKnee  #TakeAknee has been a movement since 2016 and was created with the intention of calling attention to the police brutality and racial inequality taking place in America. This movement was enacted primarily by NFL athletes, most notably Colin Kaepernick, through kneeling for the duration of the national anthem; this act has stirred significant controversy because it is interpreted by nationalists as being a disrespectful act that insults the American flag, veterans, and the values the flag represents. This movement ultimately led to #BoycottNFL and controversy that resulted in the NFL ban requiring players to stand for the national anthem, or stay in the locker room. #TakeAKnee is often known as “the U.S. National Anthem Protest”, and is often compared to protests during the civil rights era, lending to a chain of protests led by athletes in different sports. While the police brutality being faced by African Americans was being protested, white American athletes were also seen taking a knee. As a whole, the #TakeAKnee movement created controversy questioning the legal and constitutional rights of individuals and their ability to protest the U.S. National Anthem.  #MyAsianAmericanStory  In August 2015, \\" a 15-year- old high student named Jason Fong created #MyAsianAmericanStory to highlight immigration stories of Asian Americans after presidential candidate Jeb Bush made a remark about Asian people and their \\"anchor babies.\\" Fong stated that he started the hashtag to show that \\"Asian-Americans are part of the American narrative.\\" Users of the tag tweeted about their diverse family immigration histories and encounters with racism. Fong said he was inspired to start #MyAsianAmericanStory in part by hashtags such as #BlackLivesMatter and participated in other hashtag campaigns such as #Asians4BlackLives in order to show his support for dismantling “a broken system that protects police misconduct.”  #thisis2016  In October 2016, following an anti-Asian incident in New York City and the subsequent open letter to the victim from Michael Luo, The New York Times released a video entitled \\"#thisis2016: Asian- Americans Respond\\". The video featured Asian Americans who had experienced racism. #thisis2016 subsequently emerged as a hashtag to highlight racism Asian Americans faced. Eventually, #BrownAsiansExist came to prominence following an open letter written to The New York Times expressing their disappointment in the lack of South and Southeast Asian Americans in their \\"#thisis2016\\" video. #BrownAsiansExist more broadly highlights the erasure of South Asian and Southeast Asian Americans in the American media's portrayal of Asian Americans.  #OscarsSoWhite  #OscarSoWhite is a hashtag campaign started by BroadwayBlack.com managing editor April Reign and was sparked by the Oscars nominees in 2016. All of the 20 actors nominated for lead and supporting actor categories were white, despite multiple films that year starring African American leads that had received critics' prizes and guild awards. The campaign sparked a conversation about diversity, representation, and racism in the film industry. The movement is connected to causing enough external pressure to significantly change the racial composition of Academy membership. Following the peak of the hashtag's popularity, the Academy instated 41% minority voters and 46% female voters. Production companies felt the pressure as well, and subsequently diversified their casting and staffing decisions as well, hiring Ava Duvernay, an African-American female director, to head the production of A Wrinkle in Time and hiring non-white actors in the traditionally white Star Wars series. = Women's rights = #YesAllWomen #YesAllWomen is a Twitter hashtag and social media campaign in which users share examples or stories of misogyny and violence against women. #YesAllWomen was created in reaction to another hashtag #NotAllMen, to express that all women are affected by sexism and harassment, even though not all men are sexist. The hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of misogyny and sexism. The hashtag was popular in May 2014 surrounding discussions of the 2014 Isla Vista killings. #ShoutYourAbortion #ShoutYourAbortion is a hashtag and social media campaign used on Twitter that encourages women who have experience with abortion to break the silence surrounding it.Norris, Alison, et al. \\"Abortion Stigma: A Reconceptualization of Constituents, Causes, and Consequences.\\" Women's Health Issues 21.3, Supplement (2011): S49-54. Web. The hashtag was created by American writer Lindy West and friends Amelia Bonow and Kimberly Morrison in response to the US House of Representatives efforts to defund Planned Parenthood following the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy.  #ilooklikeanengineer  In August 2015, the #ilooklikeanengineer campaign started. The movement was started by Isis Anchalee to promote discussion of gender issues. Anchalee created the hashtag in response to backlash regarding her face being featured in an ad campaign for the company she works for. One year after the creation of #ilooklikeanengineer 250,000 people had used the hashtag.  #MeToo  #MeToo is a Twitter hashtag that raises awareness about sexual assault by encouraging survivors to share their stories. The hashtag was initially first used in 2007 by Tarana Burke but was later popularized and brought to the attention of the media on October 15, 2017, when Alyssa Milano, using Twitter, encouraged individuals to speak up about their experience with assault and say 'Me Too'. Initially meant to simply raise awareness but has developed into a movement and as of October 2018, the hashtag has been used 19 million times. The movement has sparked many other movements like #HowIWillChange and has also led to certain punishments towards the perpetrators. As a reaction, the #HimToo hashtag was created. It that refers to the social media campaign for false rape allegation.  #MosqueMeToo  In February 2018, the Mosque Me Too movement started, following the Me Too movement which gained worldwide prominence in October 2017 and the following months. Muslim women started sharing their experiences of sexual abuse at Muslim holy sites and on pilgrimages such as Hajj, Mecca, Saudi Arabia, using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo.  #WomensMarch  On January 21, 2017, an estimated 2.6 million individuals marched around the world in response to the rhetoric of newly- elected President Donald Trump. The march was organized primarily online through Facebook. Now occurring annually, the goal of the Women's March is to raise awareness and advocates for human rights through peaceful protest. Similar to other hashtag movements, #WomensMarch has an online presence. The movement has a Facebook page that is active, verified under the name Women's March, that was created on November 20, 2016. As of April 2, 2019 the page is liked by over 800,000 individuals and has a following of more than 850,000 users. Outside of the official page, there are multiple pages defined by geographic region including but not limited to Women's March on Connecticut, Women's March on San Diego, and Women's March Milan. In addition to Facebook, the Women's March Movement has an active profile on Instagram and as of April 2019 the page has 1.2 million followers.  #EleNão  Protester in Porto Alegre, Brazil, participating in the Ele Não movement.On September 19, 2018, the Ele Não movement (\\"Ele Não\\" is Portuguese for \\"not him\\"), also known as the protests against Jair Bolsonaro, were demonstrations led by women which took place in several regions of Brazil and the world. The main goal was to protest against Bolsonaro and his presidential campaign and his sexist declarations.  Other examples  A 2012 Twitter discussion among women working in games, collated under the hashtag #1reasonwhy, indicated that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female video game characters, workplace harassment and unequal pay for men and women were common in the games industry. The hashtag #NotYourAsianSidekick was initiated by Suey Park and Juliet Shen in December 2013 on Twitter. Suey Park is a freelance writer who is most known for her Twitter campaign to cancel the Colbert Show, while Juliet Shen ran a blog on Asian American feminism. They started the hashtag town hall as a way to create a platform for structured conversation around misogyny and issues specific to Asian American women. In less than 24 hours, #NotYourAsianSidekick had been used over 45,000 times. = Awareness = #Kony2012 alt= Kony 2012 is a short film produced by Invisible Children, Inc. (authors of Invisible Children). It was released on March 5, 2012. The film's purpose was to promote the charity's \\"Stop Kony\\" movement to make African cult and militia leader, indicted war criminal and the International Criminal Court fugitive Joseph Kony globally known in order to have him arrested by the end of 2012, when the campaign expired. The film spread virally through the #Kony2012 hashtag.  #WhyIStayed  In 2014, a media release of security camera footage that appeared to show NFL player, Ray Rice, punching his then-fiancée, Janay Rice, sparked public conversation on why victims of abuse stay in abusive relationships. In response to this question, writer and domestic abuse survivor Beverly Gooden started the #WhyIStayed campaign via Twitter in an effort to \\"change the tone of the conversation\\". The hashtag began to trend nationally five hours after its creation and was used more than 46,000 times that day. Beverly appeared on NPR's All Things Considered to discuss hashtag activism. #BringBackOurGirls First Lady Michelle Obama initiated the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag. Boko Haram kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, Nigeria in May 2014, refusing to return the girls. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls was created and used in hopes of keeping the story in the news and bringing international attention to it. The hashtag was used by first lady Michelle Obama to raise awareness for the kidnapped girls. The hashtag in itself has received 2 million retweets.  #AmINext  In the Fall of 2014, a Canadian Inuit woman named Holly Jarrett created the #AmINext hashtag campaign to raise awareness about the Canadian Government's lack of response to the high rate of violence against Indigenous women. The campaign involves people taking photos of themselves with signs holding \\"#AmINext\\" and posting it to social media. The campaign was meant to encourage a national conversation about the invisibility and vulnerability of the female Indigenous demographic and call attention to the minimal efforts of the Government in investigating the murders and disappearances. Holly was personally inspired to carry out the campaign as her cousin, Loretta Saunders, an Inuit woman from Labrador, went missing and was ultimately found dead in a wooded area. After the campaign, the government filed a national DNA missing person's index and introduced 30 safety initiatives to help indigenous women.  #PrayforParis  The epicenter of Paris encountered unexpected terrorist attacks, leading to worldwide efforts to spread awareness about this incident. During this event, terrorists were wearing suicide belts and the subsequent violence was shocking. The terrorists were planning to enter the stadium along with other people. Despite the person being prevented from entering, it demonstrated the severity of how people are risking their own lives, indirectly affecting others. Following the incident, more than 70 million people began to share this news on various social media platforms in order to reach a broader audience. For example, on Facebook, the social media platform enabled users to change their profile picture to a transparent overlay of the French flag. The purpose of changing a user's Facebook profile picture was to indicate support to the victims of this unfortunate event. Twitter was also utilized. However, rather than creating a transparent overlay on a Twitter's user profile, a hashtag was created to emphasize support. This simple hashtag of #PrayforParis allowed users to spread support so that audiences were not only informed about the event, but could also click on a hyperlink to learn more about the cause and other user's perspectives. Although social media platforms were useful in spreading awareness, the effect of younger individuals were just as notable. For example, a young child drew his thoughts on paper, including the message: \\"Shot after shot, bang after bang, wasting innocent lives!\\"  #FakeNews  While \\"fake news\\" or politically-motivated disinformation (PMD) is not a new occurrence, the sentiment and spread of distrust of news coverage has become more notable since the 2016 U.S. elections cycle. The hashtag, #FakeNews, gained major popularity in 2016 when Donald Trump claimed that the negative press coverage he received was due to the spread of false stories. Since the emergence of this hashtag, there has been an increase in policy- related bills and laws regarding the proliferation of inaccurate information globally, which further politicized the issue and raised concerns of impending censorship. The emergence of social media has allowed for \\"fake news\\" to spread much quicker than regular news and information, pushing technology companies to take a more active role in detecting and removing \\"fake news\\".  #ProtectOurWinters  Protect Our Winters is a movement and a nonprofit organization started by snowboarder, Jeremy Jones and other winter sport athletes to raise awareness about global warming and climate change. The movement started in 2016 as a response to it being one of the hottest years. The movement demonstrates the effects of global warming with data about the winter sports industry and rise in carbon dioxide percentage. Protect Our Winters or POW calls for people to not only be aware of the effects global warming but to take action by volunteering, voting for legislature or donating to the cause.  #flygskam  Flygskam is a Swedish word that literally translates as “flight shame”. It's the name of an anti-flying movement that originated in Sweden last year, which encourages people to stop taking flights to lower carbon emissions. The idea was originally championed by Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and gained momentum after teenage activist Greta Thunberg's mother, the opera singer Malena Ernman, publicly announced she would stop flying, with various Swedish celebrities the following suit. Thunberg herself traveled largely by train during her recent two-week tour of Europe. The activism has seen real results in Sweden as the sales of airline ticket sales declined by 4% in January 2020 due to the increasing public awareness to the carbon footprint resulted by commercial flights.  #CoronaVirus  #Coronavirus, #Covid19, and #Covid_19 represent a few of the most common hashtags referring to Coronavirus 2019 that started in Wuhan, China. The Hashtag has increased rapidly with the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of the virus as pandemic on the 11th of March, 2020. Looking at the trajectory of this Hashtag on Twitter from Symplur, it shows a notable decrease in the number of Hashtags from 50763 on 13 April 2020 to 35795 on 18 April 2020. = Political =  #ArabSpring  #ArabSpring spread across social media early 2011, spreading awareness of the anti-government protest in the North Africa and the Middle East. The #ArabSpring is Twitter hashtag used in anti-government protests across the Middle East in 2010.A memorial service held at Harder Stadium after the Isla Vista killings  #NotOneMore  The hashtag #NotOneMore developed shortly after the May 23, 2014, shooting in Isla Vista, Santa Barbara, California. During this incident, six students attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, lost their lives. Richard Martinez, the father of one of the victims, quickly spoke out about gun control, calling for stricter gun control during memorial ceremonies and rallies, chanting \\"Not One More!\\" The phrase became a hashtag on social media afterwards. Richard also worked with Everytown's digital team to create a tool to allow participants to send postcards to their senators, congressional representatives, and governor containing the phrase \\"Not One More.\\" #NODAPL The #noDAPL hashtag used in real life, outside social media. The #NODAPL, also referred to as the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, is a Twitter hashtag that refers to the social media campaign for the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline construction. The role social media played in this movement is so substantial that the movement itself is now often referred to by its hashtag: #NoDAPL. The hashtag reflected a grassroots campaign that began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in the northern United States. The Standing Rock Sioux and allied organizations took ultimately unsuccessful legal action to stop construction of the project. Youth from the reservation began a social media campaign in opposition of Dakota Access Pipeline, which gradually morphed into a larger movement with dozens of associated hashtags. The campaign attempted to raise awareness on the threat of the pipeline on the sacred burial grounds as well as the quality of water in the area.  #Oromoprotests  In 2014, IOYA (The International Oromo Youth Association) created the #Oromoprotests hashtag to bring awareness to Oromo student protests against the Ethiopian government's plan to expand Addis Ababa and annex areas occupied by Oromo farmers and residents. The hashtag was utilized again starting in late November/December 2015 to bring attention to renewed Oromo protests and the Ethiopian government's violent crackdown on students, journalists and musicians. While the Oromo held protests before, this was the first time the Oromo could be united across the country by using new social media platforms.  #Sosblakaustralia  In March 2015, an activism campaign took hold in Australia. #Sosblakaustralia was a campaign started in a small aboriginal town in Western Australia. This campaign was to combat an initiative that would close down 150 rural aboriginal communities. Though this movement started in a rural community of 200 #Sosblakaustralia with poor Internet connection, it eventually spread to thousands of followers including Australian celebrities such as Hugh Jackman, this caused the movement to expand as far as London. In 18 days this movement had over 50,000 followers and had reached over 1,000,000 people worldwide.  #IdleNoMore  In the Winter of 2012–2013, in Canada, a campaign was started by Canadian indigenous activists using #IdleNoMore in order to combat future legislation that would threaten indigenous land and water. The movement has continued to grow and unify native communities and the hashtag has made expansion possible. Idle No More started in Canada it has spread to native people around the world including the United States and Australia where indigenous people face similar issues. The use of the hashtag and social media has been instrumental in spreading Idle No More's message to indigenous people around the world giving those who otherwise would be voiceless a means to participate in activism.  #UmbrellaRevolution  A sign of the Umbrella Revolution protest in Hong Kong The response of the umbrella became a symbol in Admiralty, Mong Kok and Causeway Bay districts, Hong Kong to protest about the free election systems in China. The protestors had been camped on the streets and the public parks. The umbrella was used to protect the protesters in defence of the democratic political process in 2014 when police used tear gas in attempts to get them to leave. \\"Umbrella Revolution\\" and \\"Umbrella Movement\\" have been used to identify this event through British media outlet BBC. through social network services such as Twitter and Instagram made the events in Hong Kong reach many other people not directly involved with the protest with the use of #UmbrellaRevolution and created a worldwide social awareness to how Hong Kong was responding to support of the democratic process.  #MarchforOurLives  The March for Our Lives protest began after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018. In response to a surge of gun violence in schools and the 17 dead after the Parkland shooting, people began to rally around the hashtag #neveragain. The hashtag, indicative of the larger movement against gun violence, spread across social networks and went viral in early 2018. Additionally, the movement organized walkouts in remembrance of the lives lost due to gun violence. In March 2018, hundreds of marches were organized across the country in support of stricter gun laws, many of which were met with resistance from anti-protesters. Since February 2018 there have been 123 laws passed nationwide at the state-level to address concerns of gun control. On February 17, 2018 a Facebook page was started by students to encourage their participation in the movement; and as of April 2019 the page has been liked by more than 280,000 individuals and has a following of more than 300,000. The instagram page @marchforourlives is live and as of April 2019 has over 200 posts and just over 360,000 followers.  #PutItToThePeople  The United Kingdom-based People's Vote campaign group was launched in April 2018 and calls for a confirmatory public vote on the final Brexit deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union and uses #PutItToThePeople as its activism hashtag.  #EndFathersDay  In 2014, some editors spoofed being black feminists, spreading the meme, #EndFathersDay. Fox News picked the hoax to denounce. After much research, the fake accounts were outed.  #NoBanNoWall  #NoBanNoWall is a hashtag and social media campaign created in response to Donald Trump's Muslim ban and 2016 presidential campaign promises to build a physical wall on the US-Mexico border. In 2017, President Donald Trump issued multiple executive orders threatening to break up families and turn away refugees. Saki Barzinji and Imraan Siddiqi started #NoBanNoWall in an effort to rally Muslim, Latino, and other communities to stand up against xenophobic immigration policies. On January 25, 2017, protestors gathered at Washington Square Park and chanted, “No ban; no wall,” which inspired the Twitter hashtag #NoBanNoWall to protest Trump's travel ban. The impact of the movement was seen in airports immediately after the hashtag started trending. A judge in New York accepted a request from the ACLU to provide a warrant blocking deportation in airports. The movement became a platform for people to share stories of them or their families immigrating to the US, and worked to combat the growing public fear of certain foreigners. #FireDrillFridays Inspired by Greta Thunberg and started by Greenpeace and Jane Fonda, #FireDrillFridays brings awareness to the climate change crisis. Calling for a Green New Deal in the United States government, the movement organized protests on the Capitol every Friday beginning in October 2019. The campaign also advocates for complete stoppage of new fossil fuel projects and to phase out existing fossil fuel projects. #FireDrillFridays gained popularity with celebrity arrests.Joaquin Phoenix and Martin Sheen arrested in Jane Fonda's weekly climate change protests - CNN Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fonda moved #FireDrillFridays online to continue rallying for government action.  #WalkAway  The WalkAway campaign, also styled #WalkAway, is a social media campaign that was launched ahead of the United States 2018 mid-term elections by Brandon Straka, a hairstylist from New York City.[1][2] According to the campaign's website, the campaign \\"encourages and supports those on the Left to walk away from the divisive tenets endorsed and mandated by the Democratic Party of 21st Century.\\"  Other examples  In September 2014, The Hokkolorob Movement (Let The Voice Raise Movement) started. It is a series of protests initiated by the students of Jadavpur University in Kolkata, India that began on September 3, 2014. The term \\"hok kolorob\\" (\\"make some noise\\") was first used as a hashtag on Facebook. = Trends =  #icebucketchallenge and #ALS  UC Berkeley's ex-chancellor Nicholas Dirks participates in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. The #icebucketchallenge is an act where a bucket of ice water is dumped over the head of an individual and documented by videos or pictures, and a \\"challenge\\" is issued to another person (or persons) to do the same. The \\"challenged\\" individual then either has to respond by dumping ice water on their head, or donate money to a Motor neuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease) charity. However, doing both is also an option. The encouragement of the challenge is to circulate the video or photo on social media websites and applications with their community, friends, and family to show their support in raising awareness of ALS/MND. The involvement of #icebucketchallenge with the global audience of social media generated so much awareness and support that in early August 2014, the national ALS charity foundation president Barbara Newhouse, directly attributed the movement to a fundraising \\"surge\\" of $168,000 that accumulated in just a week. That figure contrasted with the $14,000 raised in the same time the year prior prompted the CEO and her 38 years in the industry to view the difference in support as \\"crazy.\\" A month after the August 2014 fundraising week the number of videos that were directly associated with the #icebucketchallenge was tallied on the Facebook website from June 1 to September 1 at 17 million, according to the Facebook Newsroom. As the videos continued to climb, so did the challenges. Eventually, public figures such as James Franco, Charlie Rose, and even former president George W. Bush took an activist role in raising money for research and awareness of the ALS disease.  #Hallyu  The Hallyu Wave, which literally translates to “flow of Korea” (or more commonly known as the Korean Wave) represents the social movement in connection to South Korean culture and entertainment. Economically, Hallyu is tremendously profitable, attracting millions of tourists and fans per year and produces many forms of entertainment, such as Korean pop music and television drama series, ultimately generating billions of US dollars in annual revenue which further strengthens its economic prosperity and stability. Furthermore, being a powerful social movement in its own right, Hallyu holds considerable influence in politics as well. The ninth president of South Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, once stated that Hallyu can be used to improve or repair the tense relations between the Koreas. Still, North Korea does not have its own rendition of Hallyu and even rejects it; for example, when Psy's \\"Gangnam Style\\" was released in 2012, North Korea viewed the song with contempt because while South Korea was attracting positive attention, it was also undermining the impoverished conditions of North Korea at the same time. = LGBT rights = In 2014, protests of the then-recently enacted anti- gay laws included targeting the corporate sponsors for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia. Among the sponsors was McDonald's, whose marketing included the hashtag #CheersToSochi, which was hijacked by the queer activist group Queer Nation. In June 2015, The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide. This led to the creation of the hashtag #lovewins. This hashtag earned over 4.5 billion impressions on Twitter. President Barack Obama even joined in and tweeted using the hashtag. = Publishing =  #DignidadLiteraria   #OwnVoices   #PublishingPaidMe  Criticism Hashtag activism has been criticized by some as a form of slacktivism. Chris Wallace, George Will, and Brit Hume of Fox News commented that hashtag activism was a \\"useless exercise in self esteem and that ... I do not know how adults stand there, facing a camera, and say, 'Bring back our girls.' Are these barbarians in the wilds of Nigeria supposed to check their Twitter accounts and say, 'Uh oh, Michelle Obama is very cross with us, we better change our behavior'?\\" The ease of hashtag activism has led to concerns that it might lead to overuse and public fatigue. Critics worry that hashtag activism allows participants to be satisfied with a public symbol of concern, rather than actually be concerned and take additional action. Other criticism for hashtag activism includes the argument that online social movements are often started by privileged individuals, rather than by those who the causes are supposed to help. Critics will often use the Kony 2012 movement as an example, as the film was directed by an American film and theater director. People also believe that hashtag activism lacks the passion displayed by movements that preceded it. Notable critics of hashtag activism include Sarah Palin, who in regards to the Boko Harem abductions and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, wrote in a caption: > Diplomacy via Twitter is the lazy, ineffectual, naïve, and insulting way for > America’s leaders to deal with major national and international issues… If > you’re going to get involved anyway, Mr. President, learn to understand this > and believe it, then announce it: Victory is only brought to you ‘courtesy > of the red, white and blue.’ It’s certainly not won by your mere > ‘unfriending’ the bad guys on Facebook. Leading from behind is not the > American way. Palin is one of many critics who believe hashtag activism to be lazy and inefficient. Malcolm Gladwell, in an article titled “Small Change: Why the Revolution will Not be Tweeted,” has also criticized hashtag activism for lacking the close ties he felt was necessary to inspire large action. Another critic is the Nigerian-American writer, Teju Cole, who argued that hashtag activism for #BringBackOurGirls actually oversimplified and sentimentalized the issue, and stated: \\"For four years, Nigerians have tried to understand these homicidal monsters. Your new interest (thanks) simplifies nothing, solves nothing.\\" Sarah Palin and Teju Cole both believe hashtag activism is a form of slacktivism, where it only has people talk about the situation, but no real action is being done to solve the issue.  Support  An online digital survey conducted in 2014 found that 64% of surveyed Americans said that they were more likely to support social and environmental issues through volunteering, donating, sharing information etc. after they liked a post or followed a non-profit online. The same study also showed that 58% of the surveyed Americans felt that tweeting or posting is an effective form of advocacy. While critics worry that hashtag activism results in a lack of true action offline, supporters of hashtag activism believe it to be effective because it allows people to easily voice their opinions and educate themselves on numerous issues. By adding a hashtag in front of an influential phrases that has sentence structures with verbs that show \\"a strong sense of action and force\\", people can find information on a specific movement and follow the different events that are occurring for that movement. It is easier to press on the link of the hashtag and see what others have said and to interact with others on the subject. Supporters will argue that it is through hashtag activism that people can learn more about ways to be civically engaged and attend protests. Because hashtag activism occurs on social media platforms with millions of daily users, it is also argued to expose individuals to more personal stories, thereby shifting public opinions and helping victims find support. Hashtag activism can be seen as a narrative agency because it brings in readers to participate in a co-production of the different hashtags. Each hashtag has a beginning, conflict, and end as a narrative would. People are able to share their stories relating to the hashtag, emotions, and personal thoughts. All this creates a huge narrative for the hashtag that stimulates confrontation and encourages participation, by reading, commenting, and retweeting. Identifying shared experiences builds rhetorical connections between people who would never otherwise meet, enabling users of hashtags such as #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to support and validate each other. Twitter alone has 330 million active users who are able to see trending contents from all over the world. Hashtag activism encourages debate and insight from people living the experience instead of the limits of news outlets. Hashtag activism is the first step into debates and ideas that lead to significant political movements. According to the Pew Research Center, there were a total of 11.8 million tweets on #BlackLivesMatter from 2013–2016. There was an average of 58,747 tweet of BLM, but after Brown's death it increased to 172,772 times on an average day. This illustrates that by initiating conversations and confronting problems, hashtags serve as a digitally-informed extension of the role language has always held in generating political action.Walls, Douglas M., & Vie, Stephanie (Eds.). (2017). Social Writing/Social Media: Publics, Presentations, and Pedagogies. The WAC Clearinghouse; University Press of Colorado. Retrieved from https://wac.colostate.edu/books/perspectives/social/ Hashtag activism has also been shown to impact policies and decisions made by organizations. It is able to achieve this because it provides organizations with a quick and easy way to view public opinion and outcry. For instance, in 2012 when the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation decided to stop funding mammograms through Planned Parenthood, the Internet created an uproar and tweeted, \\"standwithpp,\\" and \\"singon.\\" That same week, Komen has reversed its decision. Hashtag activism has received support from key social media activists like Bev Goodman, who initiated the #WhyIStayed movement for women who suffered from domestic abuse. She stated in an NPR interview that, \\"the beauty of hashtag activism is that it creates an opportunity for sustained engagement, which is important for any cause.”  See also  * Call-out culture * Netizen * Slacktivism * Social desirability bias * Social justice warrior * Twitter diplomacy * Virtue signaling References Category:Internet activism ","title":"Hashtag activism"},{"id":"42739023","text":"HM hired armed tender United Brothers was under contract to the Royal Navy from 5 June 1803 to 6 January 1807, though a French privateer captured her on 9 December 1806 off the Lizard. United Brothers had a burthen of 143 tons (bm). She was lightly armed, carrying four 3-pounder guns and six ½-pounder swivel guns. In May 1805 she was on the Bristol station under the command of Lieutenant John Forbes. At some point Lieutenant William McKenzie replaced Forbes. On 9 December 1806, the French privateer Glâneur captured United Brothers. United Brothers was carrying new recruits to Plymouth when at first light McKenzie sighted a ketch. He lost her in the haze, but suddenly she appeared off the weather quarter. McKenzie cleared for action and returned fire when the ketch attacked. He was killed after about 40 minutes and the master, Francis Hernaman, took command. After another 40 minutes the British saw an approaching sail, which they believed to be a second privateer. United Brothers had had most of her rigging shot away and Hernaman decided to strike. In the fight, United Brothers lost two men killed, one being McKenzie, and one man wounded. Glâneur is variously described as having 10 to 16 guns. Glâneur took her prize into Perros, Brittany. Almost a year later, on 3 December 1807, captured Glâneur, putting an end to her career.

The simplest case of market power is a monopoly, a firm that lacks any viable competition and is the sole producer of the industry's product. Because a monopoly has market power, it can set a monopoly price that is above the firm's marginal (economic) cost. Since marginal cost is the increment in total (economic cost) required to produce an additional unit of the product, the firm is thus able to earn positive economic profits if its fixed cost is low enough. The monopoly will ensure a monopoly price will exist when it establishes the quantity of the product it will sell. As the sole supplier of the product within the market, its sales establish the entire industry's supply within the market, and therefore the monopoly's production and sales decisions can establish a single monopoly price for the industry without any influence from competing firms.John Black, \\"Oxford Dictionary of Economics\\", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. The monopoly will always consider the demand for its product as it considers what price is appropriate; such that it will choose a production supply and price combination that will ensure a maximum economic profit. It does this by ensuring the marginal cost (determined by the firm's technical limitations that form its cost structure) is the same as the marginal revenue (as determined by the impact a change in the price of the product will impact the quantity demanded) at the quantity it decides to sell. The marginal revenue is solely determined by the demand for the product within the industry, and is the change in revenue that will occur by lowering the price just enough to ensure a single additional unit will be sold. The marginal revenue is positive, but it is lower than the price associated with it because lowering the price will: :(a) increase the demand for its product, thereby increasing the firm's Sales Revenue, and :(b) Lower the price paid by those who were willing to buy the product at the higher price, thereby ensuring a lower sales revenue on the product sales to those who were willing to pay the higher price. ::Marginal Revenue = MR = P + P'(Q) * Q ::where 0 > P'(Q)Reduction in Price increases the Quantity Demanded, but Reduces Payments by those who would be willing to pay a higher price - MR < P Marginal cost solely relates to the firm's technical cost structure within production, and indicates the rise in total (economic) cost that must occur for an additional unit to be supplied to the market by the firm. The marginal cost is higher than the average cost because of diminishing marginal product in the short run. ::Marginal Cost = MC = C'(Q) ::where 0 < C'(Q)Henderson, James M., and Richard E. Quandt, \\"Micro Economic Theory, A Mathematical Approach. 3rd Edition\\", New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980. Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresmand and Company, 1988. :Usually, in many Text Books, Economic Cost, here presented by C(Q), is divided into 2 Categories; Labor Costs and Capital Costs: ::C(Q) = L * w + K * R :where ::L = Labor hired, ::w = Wage Rate, ::K = Total amount of Capital financed by both Debt and Equity, ::R = \\"Cost of Capital\\", including both \\"Interest Expense\\" and the minimum required \\"Rate of Return on Equity\\" ::Q = Q(L,K) = a function of the quantity of Labor and Capital employed in productionDiminishing Marginal Product ensures the Rise in Cost from producing an additional Item (Marginal Cost) is always greater than the Average Variable (Controllable) Cost at that level of production. Since some costs cannot be controlled in the \\"Short Run\\", the Variable (Controllable) Costs will always be lower than the Total Costs in the \\"Short Run\\". Samuelson indicates this point on the Consumer Demand curve is where Price is equal to one over one plus the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand.Samuelson; Marks (2003). p.104 This rule does not apply to competitive firms since such firms are price takers, and don't have the market power to control either prices or Industry-Wide Sales. Although the term \\"markup\\" is sometimes used in economics to refer to difference between a Monopoly Price and the Monopoly's Marginal Cost (MC),Nicholson, Walter and Christopher Snyder, Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extensions, Mason, OH: Thomson/South-Western, 2008. the term markup is frequently used in American Accounting and Finance to define the difference between the Price of the Product and its per unit Accounting Cost. Accepted Neo-Classical Micro- Economic Theory indicates the American Accounting and Finance definition of markup, as it exists in most Competitive Markets, solely ensures an \\"Accounting Profit\\" that will be just enough to solely compensate the Equity owners of a \\"Competitive Firm\\" within a \\"Competitive Market\\" for the \\"Economic Cost\\" (\\"Opportunity Cost\\") they must bear when they decide to hold on to the Firm's Equity. The \\"Economic Cost\\" of holding onto Equity at its Present Value is the \\"Opportunity Cost\\" the Investor must bare when he gives up the Interest Earnings on Debt of similar Present Value (He holds onto Equity instead of the Debt). Economists would indicate a Markup rule on Economic Cost used by a Monopoly to set a \\"Monopoly Price\\" that will maximize its Profit, is excessive markup that leads to inefficiencies within an economic system.Henderson, James M., and Richard E. Quandt, \\"Micro Economic Theory, A Mathematical Approach. 3rd Edition\\", New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980. Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresmand and Company, 1988.Bradley R. chiller, \\"Essentials of Economics\\", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991. Mathematical Derivation - How a Monopoly Sets the Monopoly Price Mathematically, we derive the general rule a Monopoly uses to maximize Monopoly profit through simple Calculus. We first depict the basic equation for \\"Economic Profit\\", in which the Total Economic Cost varies directly with the quantity produced: :: \\\\pi = P(Q)*Q - C(Q) :: where :Q = quantity sold, :P(Q) = inverse demand function, and thereby the Price at which Q can be sold given the existing Demand :C(Q) = Total (Economic) Cost of producing Q. : \\\\pi = Economic Profit This is done by setting the derivative of \\\\pi with respect to Q equal to 0, Profit of a firm is given by total revenue (price times quantity sold) minus total cost: ::P'(Q)Q+P-C'(Q)=0 :: where :Q = quantity sold, :P'(Q) = the partial derivative of the inverse demand function, and thereby the Price at which Q can be sold given the existing Demand :C'(Q) = Marginal Cost, or the partial derivative of the Total (Economic) Cost of producing Q. This yields: ::P'(Q)*Q + P = C'(Q) or \\"Marginal Revenue\\" = \\"Marginal Cost\\". This is usually called the \\"First Order Conditions\\" for a Profit Maximum. A monopolist will set a price and production quantity where MC=MR, such that MR is always below the Monopoly Price set. A Competitive Firm's MR is the Price it gets for its product, and will have Price=MC. According to Samuelson, ::P(P'(Q/P)+1)=MC By definition P'(Q/P) is the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand (or 1/ \\\\epsilon). Hence ::P(1+1/{\\\\epsilon})=MC This gives the markup rule: ::P=\\\\frac {\\\\epsilon} {\\\\epsilon+1} MC or, letting \\\\eta be the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand, ::P=\\\\frac {1} {1+\\\\eta} MC Thus the monopolistic firm chooses the quantity at which the demand price satisfies this rule. Since for a price setting firm \\\\eta<0 this means that a firm with market power will charge a price above marginal cost and thus earn a monopoly rent. On the other hand, a competitive firm by definition faces a perfectly elastic demand, hence it believes \\\\eta=0 which means that it sets price equal to marginal cost. The rule also implies that, absent menu costs, a monopolistic firm will never choose a point on the inelastic portion of its demand curve. Furthermore, for an equilibrium to exist in a monopoly or in an oligopoly market, the price elasticity of demand must be less than negative one (1/{\\\\eta}<1)(Mas-Colell) simply because the price elasticity of demand must be less than negative one for Marginal Revenue (MR) to be positive. The Mathematical Profit Maximization Conditions (\\"First Order Conditions\\") ensure the price elasticity of demand must be less than negative one; since no \\"Rational Firm\\" that attempts to maximize its profit would incur additional Cost (a positive Marginal Cost) in order to Reduce Revenue (when MR < 0).

Since 1953 water was pumped from the dunes and transported to Amsterdam through a pipeline. Pumping up the fresh water from the dunes caused the ground water level to drop so in 1957 it was decided that river water had to infiltrated to replenish the supply. After the sand filtered the river water, it was pumped up and purified for human consumption. This Dutch process is unique in the world. Since 1975 the water is purified before infiltration. By using ozonisation and charcoal the Dutch purify their water without using chlorine. Tap water in the Netherlands is considered to be amongst the highest quality municipal waters in the world.

Although her work has appeared in numerous publications, she had a long affiliation with The Washington Post newspaper. She was hired in 1968 by Post executive editor Ben Bradlee to write for the paper's Style section, and remained with the Post for over two decades until 1991. While there, she profiled the Watergate criminals, covered five presidential campaigns, women's rights issues and wrote a series on Vietnam veterans that led to her 1984 book Long Time Passing: Vietnam and the Haunted Generation. It was the first trade book to examine post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and, according to Vietnam expert Arnold R. Isaacs, one of the first to \\"break the long national silence\\" about the war and remains one of the most moving and important works on the Vietnam bookshelf.” Joseph Heller, Catch 22 author, wrote: “MacPherson’s book belongs with the best of the works on Vietnam.” Her 2006 biography of I.F. Stone, All Governments Lie! The Life and Times of Rebel Journalist I. F. Stone, won the 2007 Ann M. Sperber Award for media biography, and was a finalist for a 2008 PEN Center USA literary award; it was also named a best book and best biography of the year by the Boston Globe, Rocky Mountain News and BookList.com. In 2016, All Governments Lie: Truth Deception and the Spirit of I. F. Stone, a 2016 documentary featuring today's best investigative reporters was based in part on her Stone book. The documentary premiered at the International Toronto Film Festival; Oliver Stone is the executive producer and veteran journalist Fred Peabody directed the film which showed internationally. MacPherson’s latest book, The Scarlet Sisters: Sex, Suffrage and Scandal in the Gilded Age (Hachette, 2014; paperback 2015) exposes Victorian hypocrisy on sex and women through the true story of two feminist sisters who broke all the rules in 1870 and fought for rights still denied women. \\"MacPherson's enchanting dual biography…the epilogue \\"hammers home that even [today] men use women's bodies as political bargaining chips.\\" - The Washington Post; “MacPherson brings these outrageous and inspiring women to brilliant life.” - History Book Club selection; \\"A lively account of the unlikely lives of the 'two most symbiotic and scandalous sisters in American History.\\" New Yorker Website. Her first book, The Power Lovers: An Intimate Look at Politicians and Their Marriages was an instant best seller when published by Doubleday in 1975. She Came to Live Out Loud: An Inspiring Family Journey through Illness, Loss and Grief was published in 1999 and won health care hospice awards. MacPherson has also written for the New York Times, numerous national magazines, and for blogs such as Salon.com, Huffington Post and Harvard’s Nieman Watchdog blog on journalism. She has been on the advisory board of the Harvard Nieman I.F. Stone Award. She continues her interest in helping young journalists through the I.F. Stone Award project and the Molly Award, given annually in remembrance of Molly Ivins. While doing book research MacPherson has been a fellow at Rutgers University, a Ford Foundation fellow in Bellagio, Italy and a recipient of a Fulbright Grant to study in Japan. Biography The granddaughter of a coal miner, raised in a town of less than 1,000, MacPherson never stopped marveling at the ability to thrive in journalism, despite one’s background, and even in the Mad Man era of overwhelmingly white male colleagues. A few years after graduating from college she interviewed President Kennedy, for example. She credits her editors, Sid Epstein at the Washington Star and later Ben Bradlee at the Washington Post, for ignoring a long-established bias against women covering politics, sports and major news during the sixties. (Still the Star refused to send her to the South to cover the civil rights movement because it was “too dangerous for a ‘girl.’”). And employment discrimination against women affected her early career. After writing for Michigan State University’s award-winning State News student daily, she looked for a job at the Detroit Free Press. The executive editor said he was sorry “but we have no openings in the women’s section.” MacPherson replied, “I wasn’t applying for the women’s section.” Looking aghast as if she had just said she had shot her mother, he sputtered, “we have NO women in the city room.” MacPherson took a job running copy to the printers from the editorial writers, working her way up to by- lined articles that led to a job at the Detroit Times, where she was assigned to the 1960 Indy 500. She was the only woman in the country covering it. She could not interview the racers in gasoline alley and was banned from the sports box. A male colleague quipped “How much does your editor hate you?” As for females, she interviewed such disparate women as Helen Keller, Nicaraguan president Violeta Chamorro, and the mother of famed serial killer Ted Bundy. She wrote about murderers and slain Civil Rights leader Medgar Evers, covered JFK’s funeral, Presidential campaigns and specialized in in-depth profiles of politicians, including a martini-drinking Fidel Castro. However even in 1969 she was banned from the sports box while the Miracle Mets won their smashing victory. When she wrote about the banning, and another women reporter sued, famed Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times sports columnist, Red Smith, wrote that it was about time such silly rules ended, thus paving the way for the vast number of women in sports media, including MacPherson’s daughter, Leah Siegel, who became a three-time Emmy award-winning ESPN producer. She had practically grown up in the sports box with her legendary sports writer father Morrie (Mo) Siegel. Decades before, Morrie had introduced her mother to a host of sports characters and hangers on, including New York restaurateur Toots Shor who told MacPherson at an all-male-except-her dinner, \\"We're not interested in what you think, you're only here because of Morrie… As far as I am concerned all broads are a piece of raisin cake.\\" The weird phrase meant nothing to her but it was enough to tell Toots off and to exit the restaurant. MacPherson’s biggest joy are her two children, Leah, and Mike, who has had a fascinating career in politics. Leah inspired thousands as she battled breast cancer, while continuing her career and raising three toddlers. She left all who loved her in 2010. * Leah Siegel Obituary - Dallas, TX  Dallas Morning News http://obits.dallasnews.com/obituaries/dallasmorningnews/obituary.aspx?n=leah- siegel&pid;=144327129 But Myra felt like many mothers juggling children and careers; that she was never doing enough as a mother in a time when maternity leave was limited to a few weeks, for example. She continues to empathize with women today, one reason why pushing for women’s rights has been a long time effort. She met her second husband, liberal Florida State Senator, Jack Gordon, when she covered the Equal Rights Amendment for the Washington Post in 1977 and he was the only male sponsor. It turned out to be a great omen.

History Hope Air was founded in 1986 by Joan Rogers and Jinnie Bradshaw under the name Mission Air Transportation Network. In the early years, corporations signed up with Mission Air to use their planes. However, soon after launching Mission Air attracted commercial airlines, with over 90 per cent of flights taking place through airline partners currently. By 1993, the organization had provided over 10,000 flights.http://hopeair.ca/wwd/HAAnniversaryBro.pdf Retrieved 2014-08-05 In 1995, Romeo Leblanc, then-Governor General of Canada, became Hope Air's first Viceregal patron. Every Governor General of Canada since has been the charity's patron. In 1996, WestJet was founded and immediately donated its first flights to Hope Air. Its donations increased and WestJet is Hope Air's largest airline partner. In 1999, Mission Air changed its name to Hope Air. Also in 1999, Hope Air began to partner with private pilots who began flying Hope Air clients on their aircraft, as part of the charity's Volunteer Pilot Program. In 2001, Marc Garneau became a National Honorary Patron of Hope Air. He served in this role until 2015, when he resigned after being appointed Minister of Transport. In 2006, the charity celebrated its 20th anniversary and arranged its 50,000th flight. In 2010, British Columbia struck a partnership with Hope Air to provide flights to residents of the province who need to travel for healthcare. The province solidified its partnership with the charity by investing $1.5 million in 2015. That same year, the organization arranged over 10,000 flights, the most ever in a single calendar year. On December 3, 2015, Hope Air celebrated its 100,000th flight. In 2016, Hope Air celebrated its 30th anniversary. In the same year, Hope Air partnered with PEI's provincial government to provide Confederation Bridge Passes to Islanders who must travel off the Island to healthcare. This marks the first time in its history that Hope Air provided ground travel to patients. How Hope Air operates Hope Air provides flights under four main flight programs: Commercial Airline Donation Program, Flight Purchase Program, Volunteer Pilot Program and the Volunteer Program. The charity has a mixed donor base made up of individuals, foundations and corporations. A number of Canadian airlines provide in-kind donations of seats on scheduled flights. The Commercial Airline Donation Program is based on partnerships with various Canadian airlines that donate seats on flights to Hope Air clients. In these cases the charity covers the cost of taxes and regular fees associated with airline tickets, while commercial airlines provide flight tickets. The Flight Purchase Program entails Hope Air purchasing seats on commercial flights for Hope Air clients. The Volunteer Pilot Program partners with private pilots who use their aircraft to fly Hope Air clients to medical appointments. The Volunteer Program comprises over 160 volunteers across Canada who assist in Hope Air's office and contribute remotely. In 2018, volunteers donated over 5000 hours to sustaining Hope Air's mission in the areas of Client Care, Fund Development, Marketing & Communications, and Ambassadorship.  Hope Air's impact  About 35 per cent of Hope Air Clients say that they would cancel or postpone their appointment if Hope Air had not been able to help them. Another 34 per cent say they would have to travel at least four hours – and, for some, up to eight or 12 hours - to get to their appointment without Hope Air's help. The charity estimates that for every single person it helps, it positively impacts 45 other people in their community.

It was named after Vice admiral Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume (1755–1818) by the Baudin expedition to Australia during 1803. It is currently located within the protected area known as the Cape Gantheaume Wilderness Protection Area. Description Cape Gantheaume is the most southerly point on the south coast of Kangaroo Island. It is the termination for a pair of cliffed coastlines – one extending from Vivonne Bay in the north west and the other extending from D'Estrees Bay in the north east. Its cliff top is above sea level. When viewed from the south on a platform such as a ship, the cape is reported as being 'steep on its W(est) side and sloping on its E(ast) side.' Formation, geology & oceanography  Cape Gantheaume was formed when the sea reached its present level 7,500 years ago after sea levels started to rise at the start of the Holocene. The cliff line which includes Cape Gantheaume consists of a metamorphic rock belonging to the Kanmantoo group bedrock called Middleton Sandstone. The cliff at Cape Gantheaume is described as having 'spectacular re-entrants' due to the 'differential weathering of near vertical basic dykes.' The water adjoining Cape Gantheaume drops to a depth of within of the coastline. In addition to wave-cut platforms along its west and east sides, a reef extends about in a west south-west direction from the cape. Flora and fauna =Flora= A coastal heath occupies the cliff top from Cape Gantheaume eastward to D'Estrees Bay for a distance from to inland from the cliff edge. The heath has a cover of 70 to 80% with exception of the immediate cliff edge and grows on soils varying from shallow sand to sheet limestone where plants will form mats over the bare rock surface. The heath does not exceed in height with the exception of hollows sheltered from the prevailing weather. As of 1977, the main species found in the heath were Acaena anserinifolia, Acrotriche patula, Bitter bush, Goodenia varia, Phyllota pleurandroides, Lasiopetalum discolour, Lasiopetalum schultzenii, Logania crassifolia and Muehlenbeckia adpressa. =Fauna= Cape Gantheaume and the coast immediately to its east is notable as a haul out area and breeding colony for New Zealand fur seals. A colony of Little penguins once existed at Cape Gantheaume, but is now extinct. History =Aboriginal use= As of 1999, the literature had not cited any archaeological discoveries specific to Aboriginal use of land in the immediate vicinity of Cape Gantheaume. =European use= Cape Gantheaume was discovered and named after Vice Admiral Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume (1755–1818) by the Baudin expedition to Australia during 1803. In 1954, Cape Gantheaume became the eastern end of a closed area proclaimed under the Animals and Birds Protection Act 1946 extending from Nobby Islet in the west for the purpose of protecting sea lions. Cape Gantheaume was part of the parcel of land which was initially dedicated in 1971 as the Cape Gantheaume Conservation Park and which was re- dedicated again in 1972 following the enactment of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. In 1993, a large portion of the conservation park including Cape Gantheaume was excised to create a new protected area called the Cape Gantheaume Wilderness Protection Area. Economic activity As of 2014, the sole economic use of the land at Cape Gantheaume is the use of an unmarked trekking trail for which a fee is charged. The trail extends along the coast from near D'Estrees Bay within the Cape Gantheaume Conservation Park in the east to Bales Bay within the Seal Bay Conservation Park in the west. Protected area status Cape Gantheaume is currently located within the protected area known as the Cape Gantheaume Wilderness Protection Area. As of 2012, the waters surrounding its shores are part of a habitat protection zone located within the boundaries of the Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park.

History In 1840, the penal colony at Moreton Bay was being prepared to be turned into a free settlement (which ultimately became the city of Brisbane). As there was settlement already occurring on the Darling Downs, there was a need for Lieutenant Owen Gorman, the last commandant of the penal colony, to find a wagon route between the two locations, but the obstacle was the mountains of the Great Dividing Range. There was a route already known at Cunninghams Gap but it was not able to be used by a wagon. A convict John Sterry Baker had escaped from the penal colony in 1826 and had lived among the Goomburra Aboriginal people in the Lockyer Valley area and walked with them on a track to the top of the range. Having returned to the penal colony in 1840, Baker told Gorman of the track up the range and modified an Irish jaunting car to test as a wagon on the route. Together Gorman and Baker ascended the range with their wagon on 17 October 1840 arriving at Eton Vale. Despite the fact that Gorman did not discover the route, it nonetheless became known as Gorman's Gap Road. The route which runs between Upper Flagstone in the west and Flagstone Creek in the east was marked by blazing a line of trees. It became the first gazetted road in Queensland. Today, the road no longer officially exists and is overgrown but can still be followed. There are three monuments along the route, one at each end and the other along the route at Camel's Hump where Gorman took his compass bearing. Flagstone Creek Provisional School opened on 18 January 1886, becoming Flagstone State School in 1904. In the 2011 census, Flagstone Creek had a population of 213 people.

The tibia of the subject is very sturdy indicating that it belonged to a strongly-built adult around tall, weighing about . The exceptional structural strength suggests a cold-adapted body with proportions paralleling those of the Neanderthals. Archaeological evidence indicates that these early humans had the ability to hunt or at least scavenge with stone tools as the team discovered hundreds of Acheulean flint tools at the site. The two teeth found show scratches, suggesting an eating technique in which food was cut with a tool whilst gripped between the jaws.  Wildlife found at the site  Also present at the site where the human fossil was discovered, were the remains of now extinct species of rhinoceros, bears, and voles. It is most likely that H. heidelbergensis hunted these animals for sustenance with the aid of the stone tools also discovered at this site. There is clear evidence on the animal remains that they were butchered, but it cannot be proven that the species whose fossil was found in association with them hunted these animals or scavenged them. Teeth marks on the tibia fossil may be evidence that he or she was scavenged as well, either by cannibalism or scavenging by another animal.A History of Britain, Richard Dargie (2007), p. 8–9  See also  *Eartham Pit, Boxgrove  References  Category:Prehistoric Britain Category:Pleistocene primates Category:Homo heidelbergensis fossils ","title":"Boxgrove Man"},{"id":"42739734","text":"Leaders International Christian School of Manila (or \\"Leaders-ICS\\") is located inside of Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City, Philippines.

Zahm Hall was built in 1937 and is located directly east of St. Edward's Hall and is directly west of North Quad. Zahm Hall has 202 undergraduate students, its mascot is Ignats the moose, and its residents are called Zahmbies. The coat of arms is black and red, the colors of Zahm, and the interlaced pattern represents both the Z and the X, symbols of the hall, and the antlers of the moose, the mascot of the hall. The residents of Zahm refer to it as Zahm House. History Zahm Hall Construction began in the spring of 1937. The new dorm was built just east of Saint Edward’s Hall on the site of a temporary dorm called Sophomore Hall (built in 1923), a wooden-framed structure that was demolished around 1935.New Residence Hall in Honor of Rev. Zahm,” Notre Dame Scholastic magazine, 28 May 1937, p. 5. Zahm was the third building constructed on North Quad – at the time called the “east campus.” The Boston architecture firm of Maginnis and Walsh designed it, together with Cavanaugh hall and the Biology hall (now Haggar Hall). Damaine Vonada, \\"Notre Dame – The Official Guide,\\" Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 163-68. The designs of Cavanaugh and Zahm Halls are nearly identical. They were erected despite the lack of funds during the Great Depression. The dorm, with its brick exterior, limestone stone, and slate roof, was finished in time for the opening of school in September 1937 and housed 193 men. At its construction, it joined Brownson and Cavanaugh halls to host freshmen, while Carroll, Lyons, Morrissey, and Badin were for sophomores, Howard, Dillon, and Saint Edward’s for Juniors, and Sorin, Walsh, and Alumni for seniors. “University Begins Its 96th Year,” Notre Dame Alumnus magazine, October 1937, p 1-2. The first rector of the hall was Reverend John A. Molter, C.S.C. Other rectors included Charles I. McCarragher (1945-1953), James L. Shilts (1960-1967) and, Thomas Blantz (1967-1970). The hall also housed U.S. Navy officers in training from 1942 to 1945. Zahm Hall was dedicated to Rev. John Augustine Zahm, CSC. Zahm was a priest, naturalist and scientist at Notre Dame, and was the pioneer of the study of natural sciences at the University. During World War II, Zahm Hall hosted naval officers. Traditions Zahm Hall is best known for its practice of streaking during the Bun Run. The Zahm residents run naked across various campus locations, usually the weekend before final exams. This practice has led to controversy and debate. Zahm also hosts their formal dance, known as \\"Zormal\\" in the fall semester and their SYR (Screw Your Roommate) dance, Decade Dance, in the spring semester. Zahm is known for its raucous reputation on campus. This no-good stereotype comes from the early days of the university, when Zahm Hall had the least desirable reputation and was always picked last by students. Since picks were in order by GPA, Zahm often hosted the least accomplished students. In the 1960s, the University dropped academic requirements for first housing picks, and students were henceforth assigned randomly to residence halls before they arrived on campus their freshman year. The \\"Here Come The Irish\\" gameday sign Zahm Hall exhibits a large \\"Here Come The Irish\\" sign on the side of the building facing the North Quad during home football games. The mascot of the hall is Ignats, a stuffed moose's head acquired in 1979. There are also numerous secret rituals such as 145, 113, Torquemada, the Shake, and many others.

The locality is dominated by an east/west valley containing Flagstone Creek. The valley remains mostly covered in natural vegetation. In the southeast Flagstone Creek Conservation Park has been established. History In 1840, the penal colony at Moreton Bay was being prepared to be turned into a free settlement (which ultimately became the city of Brisbane). As there was settlement already occurring on the Darling Downs, there was a need for Lieutenant Owen Gorman, the last commandant of the penal colony, to find a wagon route between the two locations, but the obstacle was the mountains of the Great Dividing Range. There was a route already known at Cunninghams Gap but it was not able to be used by a wagon. A convict John Sterry Baker had escaped from the penal colony in 1826 and had lived among the Goomburra Aboriginal people in the Lockyer Valley area and walked with them on a track to the top of the range. Having returned to the penal colony in 1840, Baker told Gorman of the track up the range and modified an Irish jaunting car to test as a wagon on the route. Together Gorman and Baker ascended the range with their wagon on 17 October 1840 arriving at Eton Vale. Despite the fact that Gorman did not discover the route, it nonetheless became known as Gorman's Gap Road. The route which runs between Upper Flagstone in the west and Flagstone Creek in the east was marked by blazing a line of trees. It became the first gazetted road in Queensland. Today, the road no longer officially exists and is overgrown but can still be followed. There are three monuments along the route, one at each end and the other along the route at Camel's Hump where Gorman took his compass bearing. In the , Flagstone was included within the count for neighbouring Preston which had a population of 763 people.

The Western Railway Line travels over the bridge, enabling freight movement to/from the major Container ports of Burnie and Devonport and the rest of the state. In 1978, it was listed in the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.  History and technical details  The iron bridge was fabricated in England and shipped to Australia. It was designed by the Irish-born railway engineer, W.T. Doyne. The bridge cost . It was opened in 1871, on the railway line from Launceston to Deloraine. Constructed of a through Lattice truss, continuous over two spans of . These were the longest spans in an Australian bridge until 1880, when it was surpassed by the Fitzroy River suspension bridge at Rockhampton. Contemporary report From The Cornwall Chronicle, April 23, 1870: > \\"The Longford iron bridge has been constructed and erected under contract by > Mr. C. de Borgue from designs prepared by the company's engineers, Messrs. > Doyne, Major, and Willett. It is on the principle known as the double Warren > girder, and consists of two spans, each of . The girder is continuous, fixed > in the centre but expanding and contracting at both ends, upon an apparatus > invented by Mr. Doyne. The girders are of lattice work, formed by building > at top and bottom, strings of plate iron wide on the bottom, and deep. These > are connected together by vertical and diagonal bars, the vertical bars > being placed apart, and the diagonals crossed between these. The size of > each of these bars is arranged according to its position in the bridge, and > in exact proportion to the amount of work it is to perform, a much smaller > bar being used in tho centre than at the ends of each span. The top and > bottom strings, on the contrary are much stronger in the centre than at the > ends. The space between the upper and lower strings is . The two main > girders are connected together by cross girders at every , and upon these > are rivetted the beams which carry the permanent rails. The cross girders > are rivetted to the sides of the lower strings, and the top strings arc > connected by strong angle irons, thus giving great stability to the whole > structure, which represents, in section, a square of . A feature in this > Bridge is the fact that the rivet holes instead of being punched as is the > ordinary process, have all been drilled as true as a gun barrel; the > consequence being that not a single hole required alteration, even where two > or three plates had to be bolted together. The rivets were all made to fit > the holes cold, and as they were put in at a red heat, and driven up by > means of a circular steel cap, they all fit- as tight as though the holes > had been rammed with some soft substance. Hence the extreme rigidity and > elasticity of the structure. The ends of the bridge are to be set off by > four massive fluted columns of cast iron, having handsome basements, and > relieved by ornamental capitals, and over the centre also is a massive > ornamental casting, which will agreeably break the line and relieve the > appearance of the structure. These are the only pieces of ornamentation in > which tho engineers have indulged. The height of the bridge and of the > viaduct immediately beyond were both deter mined after a careful survey of > the country and the most minute enquiries respecting the various flood > levels. The bridge is now clear above the level of the highest recorded > flood, and as it offers no impediment whatever to the passage of the waters, > it is regarded almost as an everlasting structure. The abutments and centre > pier are not yet quite complete, inasmuch as they have to be built up to the > sides of the bridge, but the brick work and masonry of which they are > composed, is very massive. They are sixteen feet thick, and stand upon a > foundation of stiff clay. We are informed that a bed of cement concrete was > laid thick, upon which the brickwork was commenced. The average depth of the > concrete bed from the surface of the ground is , so that the foundations are > imbedded or more below the river level. The abutments and piers are composed > of brick, with ponderous blocks of hard blue stone, dove-tailed together > under the girders, with quoins, caps, and copings of freestone quarried in > the immediate neighbourhood, of the quality of which the engineers speak > very highly. We have referred above to an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne, > the object of which is to supply a means of compensation for the expansion > or contraction in tho length of long iron girders, produced by variations of > temperature ; and also to remove the pounding of the girder upon its > support, caused by tho uudulatory motion produced in the girder by the > passage of a heavy load. This has hitherto been effected by means more or > less imperfect, and it is believed that this invention will prove a great > improvement upon those which have hitherto been in use. The apparatus > consists of a cast-iron circular plate seven feet in diameter and four > inches in thickness, which rests on the top of the abutment. From the upper > surface of this plate, five vertical ribs or jaws project upwards to the > height of one foot nine inches. They are three inches in thickness and ten > inches apart, running along the plate, in the direction of the girder, for > its whole diameter. The upper edges of these ribs are grooved across the > line of the girder, and in these grooves there rests a cast-steel turned pin > long, and three inches in diameter. From this pin two steel links depend > between each pair of ribs, making eight in number : they are three inches > square, and are furnished with eyes at each end three inches in diameter, > and bushed with brass. They are long from centre to centre of the eyes, and > hang nearly touching the ribs on one side, and leaving a space of nearly > three inches between them on the other. This completes the description of > the lower or abutment member of the apparatus. The upper girder member is > nearly similar, but inverted; its plate, instead of being circular, is > oblong. The ribs are four in number, and project downwards. They are placed > between the links with the grooves opposite to the eyes. Through these, and > through the eyes, a steel pin similar to the one described passes. Thus, the > lower portion of the upper member is suspended from the upper portion of the > lower member. The girder rests upon the iron plate, and as it increases or > diminishes in length, through changes of temperature, it pushes forward or > draws backward the whole upper member, causing it to swing freely on the > suspending links, as if it rested on the tray of an ordinary swing. There is > also a third motion, which takes place in the girders, which must be > provided for in the bearings on the abutments, or serious vibration is > produced. It is the undulatory or wave motion, produced by the changing > deflections of the girders under the action of a moving load, which causes > the ends of the girders to rock on their bearings. This motion is also > perfectly provided for by Mr Doyne's apparatus, as the plate, on which the > girder rests rolls freely on the lower pin, and thus destroys all pounding > action on the abutment plate. It will be seen that when longitudinal > expansion or contraction takes place in the girder, the lower pin moves > forwards and backwards through the ribs of the lower member, and > consequently the holes in these arc so formed as to give free play to this > motion; they are of a radial oblong form, which has been termed > \\"balanoidal,\\" or bean-shaped.\\" See also * Rail transport in Tasmania  References  This article incorporates public domain text (published in 1870) as cited.

In the film, Chan plays Huo An, the commander of the Protection Squad of the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty. Dragon Blade was released in IMAX 3D on 19 February 2015, the first day of the Chinese New Year holiday period. The film was released in the United States on 4 September 2015 by Lionsgate Premiere. Plot In northwest China, 48 BC (50 BC on screen in the English version), a security company under Han China's current government called The Silk Road Protection Squad is committed to stopping battles and promoting the idea of peace. Huo An (Jackie Chan), the captain, successfully averts a battle. The group returns to their unnamed home city, where Huo An's gentle Uyghur wife Xiuqing (Mika Wang) serves as a schoolteacher for orphans. However, the government uncovers evidence that someone in the group is corrupt, causing the entire group to be sentenced to construction work at Wild Geese Gate, a ruined fortress. Once they arrive, the group pays respects at the shrine of a fallen Chinese general. They originally were child-slaves of Han descent, but the general had later rescued them. Not long after, Wild Geese Gate is threatened by a legion from the Roman Empire in need of water and supplies, among which is a blind boy named Publius (Jozef Waite). After a stale-mated duel between Huo An and Lucius (Cusack), the Roman general, the latter agrees not to assault the city in return for being let inside. The legion uses its superior engineering skills to speed up the construction work, an act which boosts the morale and happiness of the inhabitants, who are divided among several different ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Uyghur, and Turkic. Huo An returns the favor by sending men to assist Lucius's envoys in reaching the Parthian Empire. A celebration is later held and Huo An is made an honorary centurion. Lucius reveals that he and Publius are fleeing from Publius's brother Tiberius (Brody), a corrupt soldier who murdered their father, a Roman consul, and blinded Publius so Tiberius could become consul. As Tiberius approaches with 100,000 soldiers, Huo An insists on helping Lucius, pointing out that Tiberius is a threat to the Silk Road in its entirety. Shortly after Huo An leaves to find reinforcements, the corrupt group member from earlier sends Chinese soldiers to murder Xiuqing and attack Wild Geese Gate. The legion is imprisoned in the non-Chinese trading city of Kroran, where Tiberius has chosen to camp. Tiberius proceeds to murder Publius. Huo An and the few loyal Chinese soldiers travel to Kroran, pretending to surrender, but once they are inside, they destroy the Roman legion's cages. Huo An breaks into Lucius's special solitary cell, but is unable to free him. A fire breaks out, whereupon Lucius calls out to Huo An to 'take me home', and Huo An shoots an arrow to kill Lucius before the fire gets him. As Huo An's and Lucius's soldiers are surrounded, the armies of several other nations arrive and fight against Tiberius, including the Indians, Han, Uyghurs, and Turkics, all of whom are determined to preserve the Silk Road's safety. However, even their combined forces are unable to gain the upper hand. Finally, the envoys from earlier return with a massive host of Parthians, who had signed a special treaty with Publius's father and who intend to avenge his memory. Tiberius's soldiers lose their will to fight. Huo An challenges Tiberius to a duel and kills him. Upon hearing about the bravery of Lucius's legion, the Chinese emperor grants them the right to establish their own city, which they choose to name Regum. They accept Huo An as their commander, and Huo An, in turn, honors the deceased Roman general by relocating the shrine to that city. As the centuries go on, the city fades from collective memory. However, in the modern day, a team of Asian American archaeologists stumble upon the site and uncover the dual Chinese and Latin inscriptions.

The site's consensus reads, \\"Dragon Blade is beautifully staged and choreographed, but between the battles, its talented cast is overwhelmed by a dull story and choppy editing.\\" Varietys Maggie Lee applauded the film for its overall technical details and concluded it to be \\"a colossal entertainment with solid technique and terrific storytelling smarts\\". Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter complimented Dragon Blade for its filmmaking quality and screenplay for a primarily mainland Chinese production. IGN awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying \\"The story is rubbish, but Dragon Blade has some cool fight scenes thanks to Jackie Chan's action direction.\\" In a negative review, Gabriel Chong from MovieXclusive.com panned Dragon Blade as being \\"utterly awful in every respect\\", criticizing the performances of the starring cast and inconsistent changes in tone. He writes: \\"Indeed, Dragon Blade is a hot mess and a spectacular misfire, not just by its star but also by its director, and if anything, further confirms that the once-promising careers of Hollywood stars John Cusack and Adrien Brody are going the way of Nicolas Cage\\". Indian media gave overwhelmingly negative review on the movie. Claiming the movie to be \\"a Chinese propagandist film\\", The Hindu's Venky Vembu criticized the film's lack of subtle messages and disapproved of the characterizations, writing: \\"I watched this film in 3D, but given the two-dimensional nature of the cardboard characters, I don't think the third D would have vastly enhanced my view experience.\\" IANS also labeled the film as \\"Chinese torture\\", but did commend the film for its action choreography and Jackie Chan's performance as the Chinese General Huo An: \\"With ample footage in action and emotional scenes, [Huo An] is one of the best characters Chan has portrayed in recent years.\\" Historic Basis Marcus Licinius Crassus invaded Parthia in 53 BC, but most of his entire army was destroyed. The historian Homer H. Dubs speculated in 1941 that Roman prisoners of war who were transferred to the eastern border of the Parthian empire might later have clashed with Han troops there.Dubs (1941), pp. 322–330. Similar claims, and even a Roman force defecting to China, have been made since. These include a supposed Roman town near modern Liqian. But most historians do not accept this.https://archive.archaeology.org/9905/newsbriefs/china.html The first undisputed contact was much later, in 161 AD. An embassy from Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius or his successor Marcus Aurelius reached the Chinese Emperor Huan of Han at Luoyang.

Whitcomb was born in Hanover, Massachusetts. As an adult, he moved across the early United States more commonly than most people of his time. He served in the War of 1812. In 1817 he married Mary Simmons Joy. He held several jobs and careers that included book, peddling, landowner, clerk, and journalist. It was his business of selling books' subscriptions that allowed him to travel the country extensively, giving him opportunities to purchase land at bargaining prices, gather a unique knowledge of the common US people, and to meet interesting and prominent people, including President Thomas Jefferson. Visit to Monticello Two of those he met in 1824 were Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, while trying to sell subscriptions of William Mitford's multivolume book on The History of Greece. Though he did not sell any to Jefferson, he was able to interview him. This conversation has been memorialized in Monticello. It gives a critical, yet kind view of the octogenarian President, from the perspective of a common northerner—as opposed to the majority of scenes recorded from the perspective of Jefferson's peers or other slave-owners and political figures. Whitcomb's wife accompanied him on these business travels. Activist and reformer During his lifetime Whitcomb was better known for his journalism, and his untiring work for public schools and the rights of the common individual. He read the books he sold; information and data from them are used all through his writings and speeches. Early on, he joined the Massachusetts temperance movement. In the 1830s he became a member of the Dorchester Workingmen's Party According to him, one of the party's aims was \\"to promote the distribution among the producers of wealth, of a more equitable proportion of the comforts and enjoyments resulting from their individual joint labours.\\" Whitcomb was notable as a representative of the Northern, antebellum White; he was a self-educated working-class man who was politically active in several reform movements and had a deep sense of historical identity. His writing places him as belonging to the anti-slavery camp, but he was not an abolitionist. Whitcomb did not believe in equality of races. He criticized William Lloyd Garrison after Nat Turner's rebellion for supporting abolition. His speeches and writings advocating democracy rooted in working-class values made him an influential figure in other ways. In September 1833, the Monthly Traveler of Boston wrote the following about Whitcomb after one of his speeches: \\"Mr. Whitcomb, it will be recollected, has not reaped the advantages of an academic education; he has made himself what he now is,-- which, to our view, goes more to his credit, than though his name were put forth with all the honors of a college diploma.\\" His enthusiasm for the opportunities available to common citizens in the new republic inspired him to write, advocate and speak for the common person. In 1847, while living in Washington D.C. and working as a revenue clerk for the Office of the Treasury, Whitcomb became a correspondent for the Boston Journal. He researched and wrote mainly about topics concerning populist politics and the public school system. From 1845 to 1849 he worked for the Teachers Placement Agency. His activist and journalist work garnered him friendships with influential people such as Edward Everett and Horace Mann. Later Days In 1879, Whitcomb died in Vermont, on an estate he bought years before, but not before leading the defense for the Vermont veterans of the 1812 War, and actively promoting industrialization, fair wages and the expansion of the U.S. into Native American territories.

It supported a simple task processing oriented developer API called TaskBeans based on the Echo web application framework. JobServer gradually evolved from there and now has features that include: * Distributed job processing and scheduling. * Support for complex scheduling rules and repeating time patterns. * All web based interface with command line interface and web services API. * Jobs are composed of modular Tasklets in a job chain using open source developer API. * Multi-level notifications and alerts. * Support for real-time and historical tracking of job runs. * Audit trail for accountability. * Manage roles and rights. There is a basic version of JobServer and more advanced version that connects to wider array of databases.  Open source developer API  JobServer supports the soafaces developer API for modeling, configuring and deploying jobs. Jobs are composed of Tasklets and Weblets. Tasklets implement the backend processing of a job and Weblets implement the optional GUI customization for a job. A job can be composed of one or more Tasklets in a workflow chain. The GUI developer Weblet API, within soafaces, depends on GWT to support front-end HTML web application development. See Weblets implement a unique features with GWT, by supporting dynamic GWT compiling of java source code into javascript, similar to how JSPs are compiled into Java.  Distributed Agents  Distributed job processing in JobServer is enabled using an agent model where remote nodes communicate with a central pair (primary/secondary) of master nodes. The master nodes are responsible for the job scheduling and distribute the job processing across a cluster of agent nodes.  Mesos clustering  Mesos is a cluster management platform that manages distributed hardware resources into a single pool of resources that can be used by application frameworks to efficiently manage workload distribution for both batch jobs and long-running services. JobServer functions as a Mesos application framework to distribute jobs on a cluster of servers. JobServer integrates with Mesos by sending jobs to Mesos for execution and for efficient resource allocation.  Hadoop and SOA integration  JobServer supports some connectivity with Hadoop and can be used as a way of launching and monitoring Hadoop job processing activity. JobServer also includes support for the open source community distribution of Mule which can allow jobs and tasks to work with ESB and SOA platforms such as Mule.

Performing & Recording Artist: 1994-Present =Work with Gongs= Gong Panorama at the Dunrobin Sonic Gym Welsch has been recording and performing with a large collection of gongs since 1994. In approaching the gong he pays special attention to the instrument's dynamic range and frequency spectrum. He typically develops soundscapes which come out of and return to silence. While the amplitude increases the gong gradually unfolds its frequency spectrum, beginning with low frequencies (fundamental), and subsequently develops a wide array of overtones (harmonics). He prefers large acoustic spaces for his performances.Adapted from Welsch's commentary of the \\"Cymbal Setup Of The Year\\" on the online drummer collective www.DrumSoloArtist.com.Elaine Keillor quotes Welsch in her album liner notes. =Sound Creation Album= His album \\"Sound Creation\\", an example of his solo performances, features the entire \\"Sound Creation series of gongs\\" made by Paiste. Released on the Deep Listening label in 2012 the album received a number of favorable reviews.

It was originally classified as a stone-curlew, but subsequently it was argued to be a member of the extinct family Presbyornithidae instead. It is either the oldest known burhinid or the youngest known presbyornithid. The type species is Wilaru tedfordi; genus also includes the second species Wilaru prideauxi. The type species was described from fossil material collected from Lake Pinpa, Lake Palankarinna and Billeroo Creek, in the Lake Eyre Basin of north-eastern South Australia. The genus name Wilaru is the term for “stone curlew” in the Diyari language of the Lake Eyre region. The specific epithet of the type species honours American palaeontologist Richard H. Tedford (1929–2011) of the American Museum of Natural History, who led the 1971 expedition to Lake Pinpa during which much of the descriptive material was collected. Description and ecology Compared to other presbyornithids, Willaru appeared to have been specialised to a more terrestrial lifestyle, based on its tarsometatarsal morphology. In particular, the latter W. prideauxi appears to have been more specialised towards terrestriality than the earlier W. tedfordi, being larger and more robust, indicating a clear speciation towards this lifestyle and therefore a direct species sequence. Like many modern waterfowl, the Willaru species had spurs and knobs on their carpals. Like the closely related modern- day screamers, these were almost certainly used to fight, indicating perhaps territorial habits, as opposed to the more gregarious nature of earlier presbyornithids. Willaru co-existed with several anatid and anseranatid species, indicating that there was little ecological competition. It is possible that a speciation towards terrestriality might have spared it from competition with more derived waterfowl, allowing it to live longer than other presbyornithids.

The organization consists of ten different chapters, each with up to eight branches, that all operate a medical clinic in Baja California. Volunteer students, doctors, nurses, pilots, and other health professionals travel with their Flying Samaritans branch to their respective clinic locations and run anywhere from one-day to weekend long clinics on a monthly basis. Now with more than 1500 members the Flying Samaritans mission has spread broadly across California, Arizona, and Baja California. The Flying Samaritans' organization has four main principles: to provide primary care, specialty care, education, and emergency care. Each branch operates slightly differently, however, all strive to attain the same goal in improving healthcare outcomes for the underserved populations of Baja California. To enliven the first tenant of their mission each branch provides quality primary care to those populations that would otherwise have none. Most of the Flying Samaritans clinics are located in areas in which medical services are sparse, and therefore primary care through their clinic is essential. Those branches that do provide specialty care, such as surgery, operate in areas in which follow up is provided to ensure quality services are implemented. In order to attain educational outcomes the Flying Samaritans' branches work both to educate their volunteers, who in many instances are pre-health professionals, but also to educate their populations in order to provide more preventative and sustainable care. Some branches work specifically with pasantes who are first-year Mexican medical students that must fulfill a one-year government requirement in order to graduate medical school. Finally, emergency care is provided through disaster relief and other critical medical needs at various clinic locations.\\"Sue Roberts: 'Flying Samaritan' to Mexico's Rural Poor.\\" American Journal of Nursing. Sept 1981: 1694-1696.Peters, S. \\"South of the Border: The Flying Samaritans Offer Health.\\" April 1, 1997. http://nurse- practitioners-and-physician-assistants.advanceweb.com/Article/South-of-the- Border.aspx  History  On November 16, 1961, a group of six passengers, and a pilot by the name of Aileen Saunders, took off from La Paz, Baja California, Mexico. Headed for San Diego, the crew was forced to stop short when they unexpectedly encountered adverse weather along their course. After a stop in Bahia de Los Angeles, Aileen hit dust storms preventing her from landing in Tijuana or San Diego. She decided to land in Ensenada for the time being, but within three minutes of landing she suddenly could not see the ground as well as the 5,000 to 7,000 foot peaks in the area. Forced to circle the area avoiding the peaks, they eventually flew over the storm, and decided to land on a strip outside of the El Rosario community. In El Rosario the general store's proprietor, Anita Espinosa, acted as a translator for the group while giving them accommodations and hot chocolate. Anita told the travelers about the village's recent devastation from flooding, and the somber spirits in the community. She told them that the people would be grateful for clothing donations, and also mentioned the poor health of many community members. Returning to San Diego, Aileen and the two other pilot passengers, Leah Hanlon and Polly Ross, began collecting donations. They returned to El Rosario the Saturday prior to that year's Christmas carrying with them a surplus of clothing, food, and toys. On the excursion was also a doctor who brought with him his medical bag. Upon arriving in the community the doctor was mobbed by sick villagers, and so was born the Flying Samaritans, originally named by the people of El Rosario the Flying Angels. This same doctor not long after returned with nurses and other medical professionals, making trips every other week to provide the community with much needed medical care. They first operated out of the virtually abandoned local hospital, Hospital Civil de El Rosario, and worked to turn it into a facility they could use to treat patients. Expanding to over 20 clinic locations in more than 50 years, now the Flying Samaritans has grown to serve many populations like El Rosario across Baja California, Mexico. With the many additional chapters and branches in California, Arizona, and Baja California the organization now consists of a much larger population that provides the same quality healthcare by motor vehicle. Each branch is made up of a unique group of leaders and volunteers that travel to their respective clinics operating under the same mission founded by the original Flying Angels.Spira, A. \\"The Flying Samaritans.\\" Armchair World. 1997. http://www.armchair.com/info/spira3.html Map of the Flying Samaritans Clinics in Baja California, Mexico  Chapters and branches  = Central Valley Chapter (Modesto): San Felipe = The Central Valley Chapter operates an ENT, optometry, and ophthalmology clinic, in San Felipe, Baja California Mexico.

They travel with volunteer medical professionals, pilots, and students spending Friday morning through Sunday in San Quintin. = Mother Lode Chapter (Fair Oaks): Los Pinos = The Flying Samaritans Mother Lode chapter was founded in 1977 and is composed largely of volunteers from the Central and Northern parts of California. They operate their monthly clinic, Alma Luminosa, on the second Saturday of each month in San Quintin, Rancho Los Pinos, roughly 200 miles south of the border. = Palomar Chapter (Bonsall) = The Palomar chapter of the Flying Samaritans is divided into eight branches: Chapultepec, El Hongo, El Testerazo, Eréndira, Tecate Eye Clinic, Valle Redondo, El Florido, and Colonia Margarita Moran. Made up largely of Southern Californian volunteers as well as many student-run groups, this chapter consists of a mostly driving population of Flying Sams.  Colonia Margarita Moran: The Flying Samaritans at UCLA  http://www.flyingsamaritansatucla.org The Flying Samaritans at UCLA was founded in 2012 by Rebecca Barber and Lyolya Hovhannisyan, two undergraduate pre-health students. This Flying Samaritans clinic operates in Colonia Margarita Moran, Mexico every third Saturday of the month. It is roughly a three-hour drive from Los Angeles just east of the Otay Mesa border crossing. Also an organization at UCLA with over 200 members, the UCLA Flying Samaritans branch has grown rapidly since its formation. The Flying Samaritans at UCLA strives to provide its community with more than just immediate health care. They have devoted additional resources towards improving the overall quality of life for the community, and have conducted community needs assessments in order to better understand how to help the people of Colonia Margarita Moran. With the $10,000 scholarship Lyolya and Rebecca received in 2012 from the Donald A. Strauss Foundation they have been able to implement even more comprehensive health education projects at their clinic. Each month Flying Sams at UCLA travels to their clinic in the community and provides roughly 30 patients with free medical care, as well as, provides educational seminars for adults and children about health topics such as diabetes, cholesterol, hygiene, and exercise. The Flying Samaritans at UCLA has a goal to improve the lives of the people in Colonia Margarita Moran by working directly with community leaders and members to address more than just their health needs.Kendall, R. \\"UCLA students bring much-needed medical aid to Mexican community.\\" UCLA Newsroom.

They operate their clinic in a Centro de Desarollo owned by the Mexican Family Health Department (DIF). Raj Chudassama, Lori Lamb, and Ritesh Bhayani founded the UCSD Flying Samaritans clinic. In 2012 President Anelah McGuiness won the Donald A. Strauss Scholarship giving her $10,000 to create a dental clinic for their Flying Samaritans branch. In 2013 they also formed a collaboration with the Rancho El Faro Orphanage in El Porvenir, an orphanage operated by the non-profit organization Corazon De Vida. They have worked on public health projections, given many check-ups, hosted donation drives, and are working to construct a chicken coop at the orphanage.Autman, S. \\"On a mission to heal Baja's poor.\\" The Union Tribune. http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/solutions/20020505-9999_mz1m5baja.htmlMartina, M. \\"Healing Trips to Ensenada: The Journey of UCSD's Flying Sams.\\" La Prensa San Diego.

El Hongo is roughly 30 minutes east of Tecate where they travel to their clinic every third Saturday of the month.  Eréndira  The Eréndira branch of the Flying Samaritans is operated largely by students from Palomar College, UC San Diego, San Diego State University, and Cal State San Marcos. They travel roughly 3 hours past the United States border to reach their clinic in Eréndira where both dental and medical services are provided to the community.  Tecate Eye Clinic  The Tecate Eye clinic provides free optometry and ophthalmology services to patients in the Tecate area, as well as, referral patients from other local Flying Samaritans branches. Operating on the third Saturday of each month, volunteer ophthalmologists, optometrists, and medical assistants travel to their clinic, owned by the Mexican Family Health Department (DIF), in Tecate to provide free surgeries and eye care to as many patients as possible.  Ejido Matamoros: The Flying Samaritans at San Diego State University  The Flying Samaritans at SDSU was founded in 2010 by Matthew Schrader, an undergraduate pre-health student at SDSU. Operating their clinic in Ejido Matamoros, roughly 15 minutes over the Otay Mesa border crossing, they travel on the second Saturday of each month to run their free medical clinic.

Phoenix: Lopez Mateos and Laguna San Ignacio  The Phoenix chapter of the Arizona Flying Samaritans, based out of the Phoenix Metropolitan area, was founded in 1991. This chapter provides medical and dental care to Puerto Adolfo López Mateos and Laguna San Ignacio.  Tucson: El Rosario  The Tucson chapter operates a clinic in El Rosario, which is 25 miles south of San Qunitin. In 2008 this chapter began a collaboration with the University of Arizona to create a clinic in Agua Prieta just over the border in Agua Prieta, Sonora. = Playas de Rosarito Chapter: Rosarito Beach = The Rosarito Beach Flying Samaritans clinic was founded in 1994 by Nancy Callison, R.N., and B.J. Carpenter. At first operating out of Luis Menjare's family home then moving through various clinics donated by local doctors, the branch is now in the process of building its own facilities. Providing primary care to 300 patients a month as well as hearing and eye care to roughly 50 patients a month, this branch has grown rapidly to best serve the roughly 1.5 million residents of Rosarito Beach. = Southern California Chapter (Long Beach) = The Southern California Chapter of the Flying Samaritans, previously known as the Foothill Chapter, was founded in 1977 by Gordon Gray a retired US Marine pilot. Bill and Boz French founded the first clinic in El Arco, a remote mining village 25 miles east of Guerro Negro. After ten years of servicing the community the mines closed down and most residents left the village and therefore the Flying Samaritans closed their clinic.Newton, E. \\"Flying Samaritans Do Good Turns in Baja.\\" LA Times.

They travel on the second Saturday of each month to provide dental and medical services and occasionally optometry and gynecology services. Other branches in the Southern California chapter include Bahia De Los Angeles, Hacienda Sinaloa, Santa Ynez, El Niño, and El Testerazo.  El Niño  The El Niño branch of the Flying Samaritans is run by UC Irvine medical students in the community of El Niño about 30 minutes south of the US border. Medical students have the chance to practice their clinical skills while helping the community and gaining an understanding of the culture of El Niño.  El Testerazo: The Flying Samaritans at UCI  The UC Irvine undergraduate branch of the Flying Samaritans operates in El Testerazo, Baja California, Mexico about 30 miles southeast of Tecate. They also now run a dental clinic, as well as, provide public health education and projects to their community. Traveling the third Saturday of each month students from UCI along with health professional volunteers make their way to the clinic to see as many patients as they can.

Definition The concept of moral injury emphasizes the psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual aspects of trauma. Distinct from psychopathology, moral injury is a normal human response to an abnormal traumatic event.Rita Nakashima and Gabriella Lettini, Soul Repair: Recovering from Moral Injury After War (Boston: Beacon Press, 2012). According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the concept is used in literature with regard to the mental health of military veterans who have witnessed or perpetrated an act in combat that transgressed their deeply held moral beliefs and expectations.. Among healthcare professionals, moral injury refers to unaddressed moral distress leading to the accumulation of serious inner conflict that may overwhelm one's sense of goodness and humanity. It is important to note that, despite the identification of moral traumas among both veterans and healthcare professionals, research has remained oddly independent between these two groups, and as such, the terminology is not uniform.  Historical development In 1984, the term moral distress was first conceptualized by philosopher Andrew Jameton in his book on nursing issues, \\"Nursing Practice: The Medical Issues\\" to describe the psychological conflict nurses experienced during, \\"ethical dilemmas.\\" He wrote that \\"moral distress arises when one knows the right thing to do, but institutional constraints make it nearly impossible to pursue the right course of action.\\".Jameton A. Nursing practice: the ethical issues. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice Hall, 1984 In the 1990s the term moral injury was coined by psychiatrist Jonathan Shay and colleagues based upon numerous narratives presented by military/veteran patients given their perception of injustice as a result of leadership malpractice. Shay's definition of moral injury had three components: 'Moral injury is present when (i) there has been a betrayal of what is morally right, (ii) by someone who holds legitimate authority and (iii) in a high-stakes situation. As of 2002, Shay defined moral injury as stemming from the \\"betrayal of 'what's right' in a high-stakes situation by someone who holds power.\\" In 2009, the term 'moral injury' was modified by Brett Litz and colleagues as \\"perpetrating, failing to prevent, or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations may be deleterious in the long term, emotionally, psychologically, behaviorally, spiritually, and socially\\" (2009, p. 695). According to Litz et al, the term moral injury had been developed in response to the inadequacy of mental health diagnoses e.g., Post-traumatic stress disorder, to encapsulate the moral anguish service members were experiencing after returning home from war. Unlike PTSD's focus on fear-related symptoms, moral injury focuses on symptoms related to guilt, shame, anger, and disgust. The shame that many individuals face as a result of moral injury may predict symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. In 2011, with the inability of current diagnoses to account for moral anguish, research began to encapsulate moral conflict in warriors. As of 2017, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses exist on the construct of moral injury, although a literature review of the various definitions since the inception of moral injury has been undertaken.  Military perspective  To understand the development of the construct of moral injury, it is necessary to examine the history of violence and the psychological consequences. Throughout history, humans have been killing each other, and have shown great reluctance in doing so. Literature on warfare emphasizes the moral anguish soldiers feel in combat, from modern military service members to ancient warriors. Ethical and moral challenges are inherent to warfare. Soldiers in the line of duty may witness catastrophic suffering and severe cruelty, causing their fundamental beliefs about humanity and their worldview to be shaken. Service members who are deployed into war zones are usually exposed to death, injury, and violence. Military service members represent the population with the highest risk of developing Post-traumatic stress disorder . PTSD was first included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the manual classifying mental health disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association, to begin to address the symptoms that Vietnam veterans exhibited after their wartime experiences. As PTSD has developed as a diagnosis, it requires that individuals are either directly exposed to death, threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, witness it in person, learn about it occurring indirectly to a close relative or friend, or are repeatedly exposed to aversive details of traumatic events. PTSD includes four symptom clusters, including intrusion, avoidance, and negative mood and thoughts, and changes in arousal and reactivity. Individuals with PTSD may experience intrusive thoughts as they re-experience the traumatic events, as well as avoiding stimuli that reminds them of the traumatic event, and have increasingly negative thoughts and moods. Additionally, individuals with PTSD may exhibit irritable or aggressive, self-destructive behavior, and hypervigilance, amongst other arousal-related symptoms. Moral injury can also be experienced by warriors who have been transgressed against and thus also in circumstances other than combat. The injury may in those cases include a sense of betrayal and anger. For example, when one goes to war believing that the purpose of the war is to eradicate weapons of mass destruction, but finds that not to be the case, the soldier can experience moral injury. Those who have seen and experienced death, mayhem, destruction, and violence and have had their worldviews shattered – the sanctity of life, safety, love, health, peace, et cetera – can also suffer moral injury. The exposure to violence during war times make military and veteran population at a higher risk of developing moral injury. According to statistics collected in 2003, 32% of American service members deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were responsible for the death of an enemy, 60% had witnessed both women and children who were either ill or wounded whom they were unable to provide aid to and 20% reported being responsible for the death of a non-combatant. Similar work has been conducted in a Canadian military context – out of Canadian Armed Forces personnel deployed to the mission to Afghanistan, more than half endorsed a traumatic event that was conceptually linked to moral injury. Specifically, 43% saw ill or injured women or children who they were unable to help; 7% felt responsible for the death of Canadian or ally personnel, and 38% had difficulty distinguishing between combatants and noncombatants. Controlling for other fear-based deployment related stressors, exposure to such potentially morally injurious events have been related to increased prevalence of PTSD and depression in military personnel. During times of war a service member's personal ethical code may clash with what is expected of them during war. Approximately 27% of deployed soldiers have reported having an ethical dilemma to which they did not know how to respond. Research has shown that longer and more frequent deployments can result in an increase in unethical behaviors on the battlefield.Mental Health Advisory Team (MHAT-IV). (2006, November 17). Operation Iraqi Freedom 05- 07. Retrieved December 18, 2008, from http://www.armymedicine.army.mil/reports/mhat/mhat_iv/mhat-iv.cfm This is problematic considering deployment lengths have increased for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. During times of war the military promotes an ethical pardon on the killing of an enemy, going against the typical moral code for many service members. While a service member is deployed, killing of the enemy is expected and often rewarded. Despite this, when a service member returns home the sociocultural expectations are largely different from when they were deployed. The ethical code back home has not changed, making the transition from deployment to home difficult for some service members. This clash in a personal ethical code and the ethical code and expectations of the military can further increase a service member's deep-seated feelings of shame and guilt for their actions abroad. Psychological perspective Brett Litz and colleagues define moral injury as \\"perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations.\\" Litz and colleagues focus on the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional aspects of moral injury, positing that cognitive dissonance occurs after a perceived moral transgression resulting in stable internal global attributions of blame, followed by the experience of shame, guilt, or anxiety, causing the individual to withdraw from others. The result is increased risk of suicide due to demoralization, self-harming, and self-handicapping behaviors. Psychological risk factors which make an individual more prone to moral injury include neuroticism and shame-proneness. Protective factors include self-esteem, forgiving supports, and belief in the just-world hypothesis. Social and cultural perspective As of 2018, research by anthropologist Tine Molendijk has shown that as unresolved conflicts at the political level create potentially morally injurious situations for soldiers on the ground, \\"experiences of institutional betrayal\\" and \\"a resultant search for reparations\\" by veterans can also be part of moral injury. She claims, both public condemnation and public heroification of veterans may contribute to moral injury, given that both are generally experienced by veterans as alienating distortions of their war experience, meaning that both may entail an \\"injustice\\" being done to the experience. Spiritual perspective Rita Nakashima Brock and Gabriella Lettini emphasize moral injury as \\"…souls in anguish, not a psychological disorder.\\" This occurs when veterans struggle with a lost sense of humanity after transgressing deeply held moral beliefs. The Soul Repair Center at Brite Divinity School is dedicated to addressing moral injury from this spiritual perspective.  Treatment According to Shay, the process of recovery should consist of \\"purification\\" through the \\"communalization of trauma.\\" Shay places special importance on communication through artistic means of expression. Moral injury could only be absolved when \\"the trauma survivor... [is] permitted and empowered to voice their experience....\\". Fully coming \\"home\\" would mean integration into a culture where one is accepted, valued and respected, has a sense of place, purpose, and social support. According to Litz for this to occur, there needed to be openness on the part of civilians to hear the veterans' experiences without prejudice. The culture in the military emphasizes a moral and ethical code that normalizes both killing and violence in times of war.Litz and colleagues (2009) have hypothesized a modified version of CBT that addresses three key areas of moral injury: \\"life-threat trauma, traumatic loss, and moral injury Marines from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\\" Despite this, decisions made by service members who engage in killing or violence through this cultural lens would still experience psychological and spiritual impact. It is hypothesized that treating the underlying shame associated with service member's symptoms of PTSD is necessary and it has been shown that allowing feelings of shame to go untreated can have deleterious effects. This can make the identification of moral injury in a service member difficult because shame tends to increase slowly over time. Shame has been linked to complications such as interpersonal violence, depression, and suicide. In 2015, Gaudet and colleagues wrote that interventions are lacking and new treatment interventions specific to moral injury are necessary, and that it was not enough to treat moral injury in the same way that depression or PTSD are commonly treated. In spite of the lack of research on the treatment of moral injury, factors such as humility, gratitude, respect and compassion have shown to either be protective or provide for hope for service members. Treating moral injury has been described as \\"soul repair\\" due to the nature of moral anguish. While moral injury can be experienced by people other than military service members, research has paid special attention to moral injury in military populations. Seeking professional mental health help for moral injury may present with some challenges, particularly for military personnel. Moral injury is frequently associated with socially-withdrawing emotions, such as guilt and shame. These emotions may further reduce the likelihood of individuals reaching out for help in the fear of being rejected or judged by others. Additionally, military personnel may be hesitant to seek help due to actual or perceived career repercussions. Recent research on this topic showed that among active deployed military personnel, those who were exposed to potentially morally injurious experiences were more likely to avoid military mental health services and instead seek help from a professional in a civilian health care system.  In healthcare professionals  Moral distress among healthcare professionals was first conceptualized in 1984 by Andrew Jameton. The concept was gradually explored over the subsequent 30 years in both nursing and veteran literature, though as above the definitions were slightly different. In the healthcare literature, moral injury refers to the accumulation of negative effects by continued exposure to morally distressing situations.Rushton, C. H. (2018). Moral Resilience: Transforming moral suffering in healthcare. New York: Oxford City Press. In 2000 the concept of moral distress being generated by systemic issues had been termed, \\"the ethical canary\\".Sommerville, M. (2000). The ethical canary: Science, society and the human spirit. New York, NY: Viking. to draw attention to the sensation of moral distress signaling a need for systemic change. In 2018 it was suggested that moral injury can occur among physicians and other emergency or first responder care providers who engage in traumatic high-impact or resource-limited work environments which can affect their mental health and well-being. The concept of moral injury in healthcare is the expansion of the discussion around compassion fatigue and 'burnout' was first discussed by Dr. Simon G. Talbot and Dr. Wendy Dean. Physicians in the United States were caught in situations that prevented them from doing what they perceive is the right course of action, i.e. taking care of the patient well. Instead, they were caught in double and triple and quadruple binds between their obligations of electronic health records, their own student loans, the requirements for patient load through the hospital and number of procedures performed. As of 2018, moral injury has been studied in medical students working within the NHS. In her TED talk in October 2019, Dr Sammy Batt-Rawden argued that doctors come to psychological harm as a result of not being able to give patients the care that they need in an under-resourced NHS.  Moral injury of other professions  The concept of moral injury has more recently also been discovered among police, and likely exists among firefighters as well. Professions with non-human subjects such as veterinarians are also beginning to be studied.

Heard was shot and wounded by Charles Whitman on August 1, 1966, while covering Whitman's attack on the University of Texas at Austin for the Associated Press. Heard received widespread praise for his series of reports on the integration of the Texas Longhorns football team. He also authored several books, focusing on sports and politics.  Early life  Robert Heard was born on April 10, 1930, in Big Spring, Texas. His father was a Baptist preacher. He had three older brothers. Heard's parents, who had expected a baby girl, did not know what to name him. They decided to call him Robert Lee after General Robert E. Lee, at the urging of his two older brothers, who had just learned about the Civil War general in elementary school.  Career  Heard served in the United States Marines in the Korean War from 1951 to 1952. He returned to Texas after the war, where he obtained a law degree from Baylor University. He practiced law in Houston for two years before pursuing a career change to journalism. He initially worked as a journalist at the Waco Tribune-Herald in Waco, Texas, and the AP Long Beach, California. Heard was then hired as a reporter by the Associated Press in 1964. On August 1, 1966, Heard, who was 36 years old at the time, was shot in the arm while covering the mass shooting at the University of Texas at Austin. Heard, who had arrived on scene as a reporter for the Associated Press, was attempting to follow to Texas highway patrol offices across a parking lot when he was wounded by a bullet fired by Charles Whitman. In a 2006 interview with Texas Monthly, Heard recalled, \\"Just before I reached the curb, I was shot down. I'd forgotten my Marine training; I hadn't zigzagged.\\" He continued to grant interviews on the anniversary of the shooting, but attempted to distance his professional and personal life from the tragedy. According to his wife, Betsy Heard, \\"He lived his whole life hoping to get that out of the first paragraph of his obituary.\\" Heard eventually left the Associated Press, but continued to work in journalism and public relations. He worked as a press secretary for Joe Christie, a Democratic U.S. Senator candidate, during his campaign. Heard also wrote for the Texas Lawyer and served as the Texas State Capitol correspondent for the San Antonio Express News. Heard founded Inside Texas, a newsletter which covered athletics at the University of Texas. His books included \\"Dance With Who Brung Us: Quips & Quotes from Darrell Royal,\\" which compiled quotes from Darrell Royal, a former Texas Longhorns football coach. Heard also authored \\"Miracle of the Killer Bees: 12 Senators Who Changed Texas Politics,\\" which focused on twelve Texas state senators who fled Austin in 1979 and went into hiding to stop a bill.  Personal life  Robert Heard died from complications of hip surgery on April 15, 2014, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, Betsy Heard; a son, Tom Heard, from his first marriage to, Mary Lou Custer Heard, (another son, Dan, died in 1993) and brother, Wyatt Heard.

In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. =19th century= In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Oursler.The History of Marion County and Courthouse As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence.

He played as midfielder and was the head coach of the Super Reds FC in the Singapore S.League. He currently serves as an manager of Jeonnam Dragons. Jeon has represented South Korea both at the youth (U-20) and Olympic (U-23) levels. At club level, he initially enjoyed more international successes (winning the Asian Champions Cup in 1997 and 1998 with Pohang Steelers) than domestic ones. However, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors did manage to win two FA Cups (2003, 2005) despite average form in the league. In 2006, Jeon left Jeonbuk to play for Home United in Singapore. It was not seen as a wise choice as Jeonbuk won the AFC Champions League that year, while the Protectors only managed a fourth-placed finish in the S.League, but Jeon scored 13 goals. He joined the Bruneian club DPMM FC for the 2007 Malaysian Super League season, but only stayed a year before returning to Singapore as a player-coach for the Super Reds. He successfully led the team to an impressive runners-up finish in the 2008 season, two points below champions SAFFC, and barely missed out on the MIKASA Coach of the Year award at the S.League Awards Night. Under Jeon, the Super Reds have been known to play a brand of quick-paced football with effective short passes. In 2019, he replaces Fabiano as manager of Jeonnam Dragons in K League 2.

The album's lyrics are a slight departure from Some Kind of Zombie, as they focus more on missions and the word of God being spread, as shown in \\"Hands and Feet\\" and \\"Jesus Movement\\"; a theme that would reappear in Worldwide. Other songs, such as \\"Get Down\\" and \\"Good Life\\", reflect on God's influence in a Christian life. The album also contains a more upbeat rerecording of \\"DC-10\\" (which had originally appeared on the band's debut album), a cover of \\"Let My Love Open the Door\\" by Pete Townshend, and a recording of \\"It Is Well With My Soul\\", the only recording of a traditional worship song on any of the band's albums.  Concept and development  According to guitarist/songwriter Bob Herdman, the idea for the album was to \\"have more fun — not take this music so seriously — and just make songs that people like\\". The title of the album comes from the belief that Christians are usually seen as \\"underdogs\\" or \\"weak . . . but we're not. We're just the opposite. God's empowered us because we've become less for Him,\\" says Herdman. The album includes two unoriginal songs and a new version of a song previously recorded by the band. The song \\"Let My Love Open the Door\\" was written and recorded by Pete Townshend in 1980. The album also features the band's version of the popular hymn \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\", which features the guest vocals of Jennifer Knapp. The band also decided to record a new version of one of their first songs, \\"DC-10\\". The song, which was featured on the band's debut album, was a live staple of the band and is considered one of their most popular songs. According to Herdman, they \\"wanted to do something that kinda touched back with our roots, our very beginning. We were gonna do it like the Beastie Boys — more modern stuff … we were just goofin' around and the swing thing came around. Swing's such a big thing and we thought we would just make a joke of it. And do our song swing.\\" One of the songs, \\"The Houseplant Song\\", features guitarist/keyboardist Bob Herdman on the lead vocals. The lyrics were inspired by a story Herdman read on the Internet about the effects of music on plants. It features a number of pop culture references, including a line that says \\"the second one you play that Petra or that Megadeth\\", and the closing line which says \\"we listen to Audio Adrenaline, cranked to eleven\\", in reference to a line from the film This Is Spinal Tap.Get Down with the Underdog on Jesus Freak Hideout (8/20/99)  Recording  The album was recorded on several studios in Nashville, Tennessee: Tejas Studios, Dark Horse Studio, The Battery, 16 Ave Sound, and The House of Insomnia. Most of the recording was handled by Aaron Swihart at Tejas. However, recording at Dark Horse was handled by Shane D. Wilson and Richie Biggs, while recording at The House of Insomnia was handled by F. Reid Shippen and Todd Collins. Strings were also recorded by Swihart at Sound Stage Studio, in Nashville, and mixed at Castle Recordings. Most of the mastering was done by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound Studio, while digital edition was done by Paul Angelli. Mixing was done at East Iris Studio, Castle Recording Studios, and Masterphonics in Nashville. Shippen, Collins, and David Leonard where in charge of mixing.Underdog slip cover; Audio Adrenaline (1999)  Promotion  Audio Adrenaline performed songs from Underdog during the Underdog Tour, the Diverse City Worldwide Tour, the Until My Heart Caves In Tour and the Kings & Queens Tours.  Critical reception  Underdog was generally well received by critics. Steve Huey, of AllMusic, gave the album 3 stars out of 5, writing that overall, the album would please especially fans of the band. However, he writes that \\"the funk riffs still sometimes feel grafted onto the songs, which are melodic AOR at heart, and there are a few musically awkward moments here and there\\".Underdog on AllMusic; Huey, Steve John DiBiase, of Jesus Freak Hideout, gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, and claimed it was the best album from the band since Don't Censor Me. He also wrote that Underdog surpasses \\"each album in talent, song craftmanship, tightness, bold message, and overall greatness.\\"Underdog on Jesus Freak Hideout; DiBiase, John (8/16/99) Both \\"Get Down\\" and \\"Hands and Feet\\" were later featured in WOW 2000 and WOW Hits 2001 respectively, which features chart-topping and/or critically acclaimed Christian songs. Also, \\"Mighty Good Leader\\" was sampled by rapper Aceyalone for his song \\"Superstar\\", which was featured heavily in the 2004 video game ESPN NFL 2K5.  Commercial performance  Underdog peaked at No. 76 on Billboard 200.[ Underdog] on Billboard  Music videos  Music videos were made for the songs \\"Get Down\\" and \\"Hands and Feet\\".

The British Empire Exhibition Tour Major Belcher with Archie (far left) and Agatha Christie on the British Empire Exhibition Tour in 1922 In 1921 Belcher became Assistant general manager of the British Empire Exhibition which was to be held in 1924 and 1925. He invited Archie and Agatha Christie to join him on a tour of the Empire counties to promote the forthcoming exhibition. Christie outlined the tour in her autobiography and letters. She describes Belcher as an insufferable man who was prone to temper tantrums. A good description of him is given in a recent book. \\"Belcher's presence dominated the tour, to an extent that Agatha could not have imagined, that she found insufferable at the time and comical in retrospect. He was a very modern type, for all his old- school-tie manner. He would have thrived on quangos or talking impressive- sounding nonsense on television; he was one of nature's politicians, although not from any sense of public duty: again, his sense of duty was directed towards his own advancement.\\"Thompson, Laura (28 March 2013). Agatha Christie (Kindle Locations 2461–2464). Headline. Kindle Edition. Christie also felt that it was difficult to know whether to believe his stories or not. In her autobiography she said: “He was a man with terrific powers of bluff. He had, according to his own story, bluffed himself into the position of Controller of Potatoes during the war. How much of Belcher’s stories was invented and how much true, we never knew.”Christie, Agatha (14 October 2010). An Autobiography (Kindle Locations 5525–5526). HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition. Christie’s assessment of Belcher seems to have been supported by an incident that happened in 1915, seven years before the tour when Belcher was invited as part of a group to visit former United States President Theodore Roosevelt at his home for a very short informal social gathering. Belcher wrote up the event as if Roosevelt had given him an exclusive interview on foreign policy and gave it to the London Morning Post and several other newspapers. The article was a complete fabrication of what Roosevelt had said and was so bad that the former President issued a statement to the New York Times rebutting the whole event.New York Times, 7 January 1915.

Marriage Notice of Major Belcher and Gladys Greenwood in 1926. Belcher was 51 and unmarried when he led the British Empire Tour. During his visit to Australia he needed some work done. One of the officials Harold Greenwood suggested that his daughter Gladys Greenwood could act as Belcher's personal secretary while he was in Australia. After Belcher returned to England at the end of 1922, his engagement to Gladys was announced in The Times in January 1923.The Times (London) 3 January 1923; pg. 11 At this time he lived at The Mill House at Clewer near Dorney where the Christies visited him occasionally. Gladys still lived in Australia with her parents. In 1925 Belcher moved to Lake End House in Dorney, which was a large Queen Anne house surrounded by five acres. In 1926 Belcher went to Canada on business and while he was there Gladys travelled from Australia to Vancouver on the ship AorangiCanadian Passenger List for the ship Aorangi leaving Sydney on 9 April 1926 to meet him. They were married in Montreal in September 1926. The Times marriage notice is shown. Shortly after they returned to England and lived for some time in Dorney.

She was an ambitious lady who threw out the Naib Subadar and ruled Kabul on her own, once leading her army in person and defeating Munim Khan at Jalalabad. Early years Mah Chuchak Begum's parentage is not mentioned in any of the contemporary chronicles. She was the sister of Bairam Oghlan of Arghun and Faridun Khan Kabuli. Humayun married Mah Chuchak in 1546. She had two sons, Muhammad Hakim Mirza and Farrukh Fal Mirza, and three daughters, Bakht-un-Nissa Begum, Sakina Banu Begum, and Amina Banu Begum. As Empress dowager She was one of the Mughal ladies who gave a lot of trouble to Akbar during the initial portion of his reign. Her son was Mirza Muhammad Hakim. In 1554, Humayun nominated this boy, then three years old, as the governor of Kabul under the charge of Munim Khan. In 1566, Akbar confirmed the appointment. Munim Khan came to the court in 1561 and his son Ghani took his place. Mah Chuchak was politically ambitious. She was advised by Fazli Beg and his son Abdulfath, who hated Ghani Khan, to close the doors of Kabul, when Ghani Khan was once temporarily absent at Faliz. Ghani Khan, not finding adherents to oppose her, went to India. Mah Chuchak Begum then appointed Fazli Beg as Vakil and Abdulfath as Naib (regent), but being dissatisfied with them, she killed them both, at the advice of Shah Wali, one of her nobles. When Akbar heard of this, he sent Munim Khan with an army against Mah Chuchak. Mah Chuchak met him and defeated Munim khan at Jalalabad. Mah Chuchak ruled Kabul with the help of three advisers, two of whom were killed earlier. Now, even the third one was killed. In their place came Haidar Qasim Kohbur, whom Mah Chuchak Begum had made Vakil. Munim fled to the Ghak'hars, and ashamed and hesitating he joined Akbar, who appointed him Commander at the fort of Agra. Around this time a certain Shah Abul Maali, who belonged to the family of the great Sayyids of Termez, who had escaped from the prison at Lahore, arrived at Kabul and approached Mah Chuchak Begum for refuge. The Begum welcomed him, was generous to him and gave her daughter Bakht-un-Nissa Begum in marriage with him. Death and aftermath Shah Abul Maali soon grew tired of the dominating and interfering ways of Mah Chuchak Begum. He wanted Kabul for himself. So, he killed the Begum and Haidar Qasim in 1564. Akbar's half-brother and Mah Chuchak's son was luckily rescued by Mirza Sulaiman of Badakshan, who defeated Abdul Maali and helped Mirza Hakim keep his hold over Kabul. The activities of Mah Chuchak Begum and her political ambitions certainly proved to be a headache for Akbar and troubled him like a sore thumb, just when he was trying to consolidate his father's inherited, lost and finally gained empire in India. But he was soon freed of Mah Chuchak Begum and her ambitious ways. In popular culture Since 2013, a television series, called Jodha Akbar airs on Zee TV, in which the role of Mah Chuchak Begum is played by actress, Mita Vashisht.

If contact of ice to bottom rocks is lost seaward of the grounding line, the ice sheet becomes significantly thinner (some 100 m), forming a shelf ice. John H. Mercer (Cheltenham, England, 19 October 1922 – Columbus, Ohio 3 July 1987) was a glaciologist, chiefly known for his theoretical work on, and field studies of Antarctic ice streams, especially in the Transantarctic Mountains and in West Antarctica. Following John T. Hollin's work (1962) suggesting that climatic warming and rising sea-level cause Antarctic ice shelves to retreat, Mercer postulated that the West Antarctic ice sheet, being grounded well below sea- level and terminating in floating ice shelves, was vulnerable to these changes and may have collapsed altogether during the last interglacial when Antarctica may have been warmer and sea-level may have been higher. In 1978, in the science magazine Nature, Mercer pointed out that \\"green-house\\" warming from burning fossil fuel could have the same effect during the present interglacial. Two studies published 12 May 2014 confirm Mercer's assumption. Climate scientist James Hansen has coined the term, \\"John Mercer effect.\\" After Mercer published his paper suggesting that the West Antarctic ice sheet could collapse in response to warming, he struggled to get funding. Others, including Hansen, had similar problems. Many climate scientists censor their own work to avoid losing funding, especially regarding prospects for limiting warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial temperatures.\\"The real climate conspiracy: What you’re not being told\\"; New Scientist, November 27, 2015. John H. Mercer was the third child of Harriet and John W. Mercer. He was educated at private schools in Cheltenham and, later, at Gordonstoun in Scotland. During World War II he served in the British Merchant Marines (1940–46) as a radio man. After the war he went to University of Cambridge and studied geography. At that time he came under the influence of William Vaughan Lewis. After finishing his B.A. in 1949 Mercer went to Canada, where he received his PhD in geography from McGill University in 1954. He was a Research Scholar from 1954 to 1956 at the Australian National University in Canberra, where he studied land use and population in western Samoa. He returned to Canada and worked in the Canadian Hydro-graphic Office in Ottawa as a geographer in 1957 and 1958. During 1959–60, 1961–62, 1964, and 1966, the American Geographical Society employed him at its World Data Center A for Glaciology in New York. The turning point in his career as a glaciologist was in 1960, when he became a Research Associate at The Ohio State University, in the Institute of Polar Studies (renamed the Byrd Polar Research Center). He remained at The Ohio State University until his death, becoming its first Senior Research Scientist.Obituary of John H. Mercer; Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 34, No. 116, 1988.

Company  Doremir Music Research AB is a Musical Intelligence Company based in Stockholm, Sweden. The company's name is derived from the syllables \\"do, re, mi\\" in solmization (solfège) and the abbreviation of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) – a computer science field whose objective is to automatically extract information out of audio music signals. The company was founded by Sven Ahlbäck, Professor at Royal College of Music in Stockholm and Sven Emtell. Its self-declared mission is to \\"make music creation and communication easier through advanced technology based on music intelligence”.  History  In 1995, Sven Ahlbäck presented a doctoral thesis on the idea that all people understand music on a deeper organized level involving more than just the element of chance or pure emotions. Sven Emtell, MSc at the Royal Institute of Technology, started together with Ahlbäck to analyze on how to realize the music cognition model digitally, but for different reasons the project ended. In 2008, the two met again and decide to continue with the project. * 2011: The first beta version of ScoreCleaner is available. * 2013: ScoreCleaner is launched in Europe, Asia and the United States. * 2013: Gold and Silver medals at Cannes Lions Festival in June. * 2014: ScoreCleaner changes name to ScoreCloud. * 2018: ScoreCloud 4 is released.

Biography The son of Sir Sidney Abrahams KC and Ruth Bowman , and nephew of Sir Adolphe Abrahams OBE FRCP and of the Olympic sprinter Harold Abrahams CBE, Tony Abrahams was born in Zanzibar on 16 June 1923 and educated at Bedford School. After serving in North Africa, Italy and Greece during the Second World War, he read law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar by Middle Temple in 1951. In 1954, Abrahams established the British Centre, an agency for teachers of English language working abroad, and then, in 1964, working with the Royal Society of Arts, he helped to devise and establish a certificate for teachers of English as a foreign language. In 1968, he established CfBT Education Trust to provide professional structure, practical support and general guidance for teachers of English language working overseas. One of the top thirty charities by revenue registered in the United Kingdom, CfBT Education Trust has employed more than 10,000 teachers.

His Hours of the Muses went through six editions. Life Born at Wigan, Lancashire, on 21 June 1808, Prince was the son of a poor reed-maker for weavers. He learned to read and write at a Baptist Sunday school, and at age 9 of age was set to help his father, with whom he worked for ten years, living in Wigan, Manchester and Hyde, Cheshire. Towards the end of 1826 or beginning of 1827, Prince married Ann Orme (baptised 1808, died 1858) of Hyde, near Manchester, when they were both just 18. By 1830 they had two daughters and a son. In 1830 he went to St. Quentin in Picardy to look for work, but the revolution of July 1830 disrupted his plans, and after two months he made his way via Paris to Mülhausen, where again he was disappointed. He returned on foot to Calais, Dover and Manchester, where he found his wife and children in the Wigan poorhouse. In 1840 Prince brought out Hours with the Muses, with the help of a prominent patron. It attracted attention partly because he was a factory operative at Hyde at the time. He gave up that work, and for a time kept a small shop in Manchester, but his life from that point did not go well, as he tried to live mainly by selling his poems, and took to drink. He gained a grant from the royal bounty and from 1845 to 1851 he was salaried editor of the Ancient Shepherd's Quarterly Magazine, published at Ashton-under-Lyne. Prince remarried, to Ann Taylor (born 1813 or 1814), on 30 March 1862 at Mottram in Longdendale, Lancashire. Ann was illiterate, but more thrifty, and tidy than his first wife. Soon after the wedding, Prince had a stroke. He died on 5 May 1866 at Brook Street, Hyde, and was buried in St George's churchyard, Hyde. One daughter survived him.J. Sambrook (2004), \\"Prince, John Critchley (1808–1866), poet\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, OUP). Retrieved 30 September 2019. Works Prince began to write verse in 1827, and from the following year he was an occasional contributor to the Phœnix and other local periodicals. In 1841 he took part in a short-lived Literary Association, which met at the Sun Inn, Manchester. The next year he undertook a journey on foot to London, recording his impressions and experiences in a series of letters to Bradshaw's Journal, edited by George Falkner. Besides the Hours with the Muses, of which six editions were issued between 1840 and 1857, Prince published: *Dreams and Realities, Ashton-under-Lyne, 1847 *The Poetic Rosary, Manchester, 1850 *Autumn Leaves, Hyde, 1856 *Miscellaneous Poems, 1861 A collected edition of his poetical works was published, in two volumes, by Robert Alexander Douglas-Lithgow in 1880. According to a present-day critic, Prince \\"disapproved of socialism and Chartism and his verse rarely touches on social issues; it consists mostly of anodyne lyrics on religion and nature, and, considering the circumstances of his life, is astonishingly sunny and optimistic.\\" Notes Attribution External links * Category:1808 births Category:1866 deaths Category:People from Wigan Category:English male poets Category:19th-century English poets Category:19th-century British male writers ","title":"John Critchley Prince"},{"id":"42741694","text":"Direct to Disc is the second studio album by Australian jazz-fusion band Crossfire released on the Trafalgar Records label and distributed by Warner Music in 1978.\\"Crossfire - Direct to Disc\\" [Discogs] Retrieved 4 April 2014.

Therefore we would prefer to have the passengers on land rather than on board the ship,\\" police chief Tor Andre Franck said. After about five hours, 100 passengers had been evacuated, with at least four helicopters involved in the airlift. \\"It will take time to evacuate everyone,\\" Franck said. The incident occurred mid-afternoon off the Møre og Romsdal area of western Norway. One expert said that the ship had been around from grounding. Around 19:00, two helicopters were diverted to rescue the crew of the cargo ship ', which had been going to the aid of Viking Sky and also suffered an engine failure. The Hagland crew bailed into the sea and were picked up by helicopters in the dark. Sky's anchors were released (one pulled on board, one left behind) to move the ship further offshore. The concentration of Norwegian helicopters in the Hustadvika area caused rescue responsibility for Skagerrak to be transferred to Denmark and Sweden, and a Danish rescue helicopter was repositioned to Kristiansand in South Norway. Great Britain was ready to supply assistance if needed. At 24:00 local time, roughly 170 passengers had been evacuated by helicopter. The ship was moving heavily in the storm with furniture sliding back and forth. On 24 March, after three of the four engines had been restarted during the night, evacuation was stopped at 9 Sunday morning, and Viking Sky got under way and headed for Molde. Four hundred and seventy-nine people had been airlifted off the ship during 30 helicopter trips. Sixteen people had been taken to hospital; three of them suffering serious injuries. Viking Sky went to Molde under her own power but attached to a tug, as Sky's anchors were no longer operable, and reached Molde at 16:30 on 24 March. On 27 March she arrived at a shipyard in Kristiansund for repairs, and its next cruise was cancelled. The Accident Investigation Board Norway has opened an investigation, including why the ship sailed despite storm warnings having been issued. The corresponding agencies of the United Kingdom and United States will participate. Norwegian police are conducting a separate inquiry and both Lloyd's Register of Shipping and the engine makers are involved onboard. It was published in a preliminary report on 27 March that the reason for the engine failure was that the boat movements caused problems with supply to the lubricating oil pumps which stopped.

He helped create the stable line up of Serenity in 2004, and has releases 4 full-length albums and 1 demo with the band. He has also appeared as guest vocalist on several albums, including Score to a New Beginning by Fairyland and The Human Contradiction by Delain.  Musical career  = The Beginning = Georg was born on 22 February 1982, and grew up in Innsbruck, Austria. He began his musical career early at the age of four, singing at home traditional folk music with his mother. It wasn't until he received the heavy metal album \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" by Iron Maiden on his sixth birthday that heavy metal and power metal would greatly influence his life. He states that, \\"Since then I have been a rock and metal maniac.\\" He formed his first real band in 2000 with Thomas Buchberger, who would later join him as the guitarist for Serenity. Together with Thomas, they eventually made a demo CD in 2003 and tried to find others to join their metal project. Members of the then Serenity band came in contact with Georg and Thomas, and after listening to the demo CD, decided integrating them into the band. Bass player and guitarist, Stefan Wanker and Stefan Schipflinger, decided to leave the band, paving way for Georg and company to establish a consistent line up, formed in Tyrol, Austria. Georg and the newly reformed Serenity's first crucial test took place on 2 August 2004, when they successfully supported Ronnie James Dio in concert. = Engraved Within and Fallen Sanctuary = Soon after, the band started recording a demo album, Engraved Within, on their own. The album was released in the spring 2005 and immediately received outstanding reviews all over Europe. Among these honors was ‘’Demo of the Month’’ in German Rock Hard and Metal Hammer magazines. Although some record labels were interested in Serenity, they decided to head back on their own to the studios, recording their first full-length album, a self-release, entitled Words Untold & Dreams Unlived. Georg wrote the album along with fellow band members Thomas Buchberger and Mario Hirzinger, and continued to be the lead vocalist. Napalm Records finally signed Georg and Serenity to a contract on 1 Dec. 2006. Georg stated, \\"We decided to sign with Napalm Records because, first of all, they are a very good label, have good distributors, and they are from Austria so it’s easier to work with them. You know, when I have a problem or a question, I just call them, and you will always reach someone in the company, so it’s quite easy to handle.\\" Words Untold & Dreams Unlived was released on 27 April 2007 with Kamelot, Threshold, and Adagio began. In December 2007, Serenity hit the studios again, recording their next full-length album Fallen Sanctuary. After five months of recording, the album was complete. Fallen Sanctuary hit the stores on 29 August 2008 in Europe and on 9 September 2008 in the US and Canada. = Guest Appearance and Tour = Georg was called up to provide supporting vocals to the French power metal band Fairyland on their album Score to a New Beginning, providing a voice for five different song. Here, he would meet bassist Fabio D’Amore, who would later join Serenity in 2010. \\"Serenity toured again with Kamelot in spring of 2009 to promote the new album.\\" Later that year, they were featured as special guests on Threshold’s \\"Essence Of Progression\\" Tour. = Death & Legacy = Neuhauser performing in a duet with Lisa Middelhauve, 2011 In late 2010, Serenity went back to the studio for their follow up album, Death & Legacy. The band again called on some guest musicians, including Amanda Somerville of Epica and Lanvall of Edenbridge, to help in making the album a Serenity masterpiece. Georg was interviewed for the metal site Nocturnal Euphony International about the new album, saying, \\"It’s another step forward in our career and we are grateful to all our fans and everybody who’s helping Serenity growing. We came up with the historical theme seen our passion about this topic, especially as regarding my personal formation. I’ve always been involved into history and historical characters, and their legacies. It was a clear and natural line we decided to follow, and I can say the result was awesome. I’m sure we will bring this on in the future...\\" Death & Legacy was released on 25 February 2011 through Napalm Records. After a brief stint of shows in the UK and Switzerland, and a headlining show in Germany on 9 September, the Death & Legacy tour began. Serenity hit the road with bands including Delain, Van Canto, and Xandria, then followed up with a show at the legendary Prog Power USA festival in 2012 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The band then embarked in the \\"Out of the Dark Festival Tour,\\" again with Van Canto, Xandria, Tristania, and Amberian Dawn. This helped Serenity to reach out for new fans and gain headliner status across European venues. Serenity continued to tour all over Europe, gaining reputation as a music force within the symphonic metal genre. Again praised by fans and magazines, the band continued to attract new fans worldwide. = War of Ages and Another Guest Appearances = Georg and the band headed back to the studio for another album, War of Ages, in 2012. This time, Serenity added a second vocalist to the band in Clémentine Delauney. Clémentine added a dynamic and melodic female counterpart to Georg, broadening Serenity’s sound even more. Announcement for the official release of the new album came via the band's website, stating, \\"While staying true to all ‘’Serenity’’ trademarks such as symphonic orchestras, heavy rhythms, amazing melodic vocals & bombastic choirs we also brought in some new elements in form of various new sounds in the ‘’Serenity’’ universe and a constant implementation of female vocals supporting outstanding singer Georg Neuhauser.\\" War of Ages was released on 22 March 2013 in Europe and in April across North America and Asia, via Napalm Records. The album contains 10 songs with 2 additional songs on the Limited Edition Version. The album also continues the historical concept with songs about Beethoven, Napoleon, among others. A music video was shot for the lead off single \\"Wings of Madness\\" and released on 28 March 2013. The music video shows Clémentine in the role of Elizabeth Bathory, as portrayed in the legend, and lead vocalist Georg Neuhauser as her husband, who is off at war. \\"Wings of Madness\\" is War of Ages only single up to this point. Georg and Serenity began their The War of Ages Over Europe tour across the nations of Europe with various acts, including Visions of Atlantis, Souldrinker, Beyond the Bridge, Midriff. The band later announced that they would be joining Within Temptation on a small tour in March, stating \\"Serenity is going to support Within Temptation in Bratislava on March 12th and in Vienna (Gasometer) on March 15th!\\" Other tour stops will be Mons, Budapest, and the Masters of Rock in the Czech Republic. Georg once again used his talents and appeared as a guest vocalist on Delain's 2014 album \\"The Human Contradiction\\", which was released on 5 April 2014 in Europe, and on 8 April 2014 in North America, as well as Edgedown's debut album \\"Statues Fall.\\" Edgedown's album debuted in April 2014.

Family background and early career Zhang Wen was from Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. The Zhang clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in Wu Commandery at the time. His father, Zhang Yun (), was famous in Wu Commandery for valuing friendship and having a low regard for material wealth. Zhang Yun also served as an assistant officer under the warlord Sun Quan,(張溫字惠恕，吳郡吳人也。父允，以輕財重士，名顯州郡，為孫權東曹掾，卒。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. who became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu later. At a young age, Zhang Wen was already known for his good moral conduct and for having a dignified appearance. When Sun Quan heard about him, he asked his subjects: \\"Among his contemporaries, who is Zhang Wen comparable to?\\" Liu Ji said: \\"He is comparable to Quan Cong.\\" However, Gu Yong had a different opinion: \\"Liu Ji doesn't know him well enough. No one is comparable to Zhang Wen.\\" Sun Quan said: \\"If it is so, Zhang Yun must be still alive.\\" When Zhang Wen was summoned to the Wu court to meet Sun Quan and his subjects, he impressed them with his demeanour and his eloquent responses to their questions. As he was about to leave, Zhang Zhao held his hand and said: \\"I entrust my plans to you. You should understand what I mean.\\" Zhang Wen was then appointed as a Consultant () and Master of Writing in the Selection Bureau (). He was promoted to Crown Prince's Tutor () later and was highly regarded by Sun Quan.(溫少脩節操，容貌奇偉。權聞之，以問公卿曰：「溫當今與誰為比？」大司農劉基曰：「可與全琮為輩。」太常顧雍曰：「基未詳其為人也。溫當今無輩。」權曰：「如是，張允不死也。」徵到延見，文辭占對，觀者傾竦，權改容加禮。罷出，張昭執其手曰：「老夫託意，君宜明之。」拜議郎、選曹尚書，徙太子太傅，甚見信重。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Diplomatic mission to Shu In the summer of 224,(三年夏，遣輔義中郎將張溫聘于蜀。) Sanguozhi vol. 47. when Zhang Wen was 31, he was appointed as General of the Household Who Upholds Righteousness () and sent on a diplomatic mission to Wu's ally state, Shu Han. Before he left, Sun Quan told him: \\"I actually didn't want to send you on this mission. I did so because I was worried that Zhuge Liang might misinterpret my dealings with the Caos. We should work more closely together with Shu after eliminating the threat of the Shanyue. As an envoy, you have a mission to complete but you have no restrictions on what you can say.\\" Zhang Wen replied: \\"I have never held great responsibilities in the imperial court before, nor do I possess the ability to handle diplomatic affairs well. I am afraid I can neither spread Wu's fame as well as Zhang Zhao did, nor make decisions as well as Zichan. However, Zhuge Liang is wise, discerning and good in long-term planning, so I believe he will definitely understand your intentions and the reasons behind your dealings with Wei. With the blessing of the imperial court, I believe it won't be difficult to understand what Zhuge Liang is looking out for. There is nothing to worry about.\\"(時年三十二，以輔義中郎將使蜀。權謂溫曰：「卿不宜遠出，恐諸葛孔明不知吾所以與曹氏通意，以故屈卿行。若山越都除，便欲大搆於蜀。行人之義，受命不受辭也。」溫對曰：「臣入無腹心之規，出無專對之用，懼無張老延譽之功，又無子產陳事之效。然諸葛亮達見計數，必知神慮屈申之宜，加受朝廷天覆之惠，推亮之心，必無疑貳。」) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Upon arriving in Shu, Zhang Wen received a warm welcome and was invited to the imperial court to meet the Shu emperor, Liu Shan. He praised Liu Shan for having many talents in his imperial court, and compared him to the Shang dynasty ruler Wu Ding and King Cheng of the Zhou dynasty. He then explained that Wu actually wished to maintain friendly ties with Shu, but had to unwillingly submit to Wei because it lacked the military power to resist Wei. He also expressed his gratitude to the people of Shu for their hospitality. The Shu imperial court was very impressed with him and regarded him highly.(溫至蜀，詣闕拜章曰：「昔高宗以諒闇昌殷祚於再興，成王以幼沖隆周德於太平，功冒溥天，聲貫罔極。今陛下以聦明之姿，等契往古，總百揆於良佐，參列精之炳燿，遐邇望風，莫不欣賴。吳國勤任旅力，清澄江滸，願與有道平一宇內，委心協規，有如河水，軍事興煩，使役乏少，是以忍鄙倍之羞，使下臣溫通致情好。陛下敦崇禮義，未便恥忽。臣自入遠境，及即近郊，頻蒙勞來，恩詔輒加，以榮自懼，悚怛若驚。謹奉所齎函書一封。」蜀甚貴其才。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Shortly after he returned to Wu, Zhang Wen was sent to serve in the military garrison in Yuzhang Commandery () but did not do anything significant there.(還，頃之，使入豫章部伍出兵，事業未究。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Downfall and death Sun Quan was not only unhappy with Zhang Wen for praising the Shu government, but also jealous of his growing popularity. He feared that Zhang Wen would win over the hearts of the people and eventually take over his throne, so he thought of ways to depose Zhang Wen. His opportunity arrived when Zhang Wen was implicated in an incident involving Ji Yan, an official whom Zhang Wen recommended to serve in the Wu government. Ji Yan incurred much resentment from his colleagues when he came up with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy – a move that would affect over 90 percent of all Wu officials.(權旣陰銜溫稱美蜀政，又嫌其聲名大盛，衆庶炫惑，恐終不為己用，思有以中傷之，會曁豔事起，遂因此發舉。豔字子休，亦吳郡人也，溫引致之，以為選曹郎，至尚書。豔性狷厲，好為清議，見時郎署混濁淆雜，多非其人，欲臧否區別，賢愚異貫。彈射百僚，覈選三署，率皆貶高就下，降損數等，其守故者十未能一，其居位貪鄙，志節汙卑者，皆以為軍吏，置營府以處之。而怨憤之聲積，浸潤之譖行矣。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. In 224, Ji Yan and his colleague Xu Biao () were arrested and removed from office based on allegations of unprofessional conduct. They committed suicide later. Zhang Wen was implicated in this incident because he not only recommended Ji Yan, but was also a close friend of both Ji Yan and Xu Biao. Like them, he was removed from office, arrested and imprisoned.(競言豔及選曹郎徐彪，專用私情，愛憎不由公理，豔、彪皆坐自殺。溫宿與豔、彪同意，數交書疏，聞問往還，即罪溫。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. In the autumn of 224,(秋八月，赦死罪。) Sanguozhi vol. 47. Sun Quan wrote an order listing out Zhang Wen's offences. The order read: The general Luo Tong wrote a long memorial to Sun Quan, speaking up for Zhang Wen and attempting to persuade the emperor to pardon Zhang. Sun Quan did not accept his advice.(將軍駱統表理溫曰：「 ... 」權終不納。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Zhang Wen died of illness six years after he was deposed.(後六年，溫病卒。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Family Zhang Wen had two younger brothers, Zhang Zhi () and Zhang Bai (), who were also known for being talented. They lost their offices along with their brother.(二弟祗、白，亦有才名，與溫俱廢。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Zhang Bai married Lu Ji's daughter, Lu Yusheng ().(績於鬱林所生女，名曰鬱生，適張溫弟白。) Annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Zhang Wen also three sisters who were known for their good moral conduct. His second sister married Gu Yong's grandson, Gu Cheng. After Gu Cheng's death, she was arranged to be married to a man whose family name was Ding (). She committed suicide on her wedding day by consuming poison. The Wu imperial court praised her for remaining loyal to her deceased husband. The people in her hometown drew a portrait of her to commemorate her.(文士傳曰：溫姊妹三人皆有節行，為溫事，已嫁者皆見錄奪。其中妹先適顧承，官以許嫁丁氏，成婚有日，遂飲藥而死。吳朝嘉歎，鄉人圖畫，為之贊頌云。) Wenshi Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Appraisal Once, there was a man called Yu Jun () from Yuyao County () who commented on Zhang Wen as follows: \\"Zhang Huishu is talented but not wise, and flashy but not realistic. Judging from the growing resentment towards him, I foresee that he will meet his downfall one day.\\" Zhuge Liang did not agree with Yu Jun's view initially, but later he praised Yu Jun for having foresight when his prediction came true. He also pondered over the causes of Zhang Wen's downfall for several days before concluding: \\"I know already. He was too clear when he made distinctions between integrity and corruption, and good and evil.\\"(會稽典錄曰：餘姚虞俊歎曰：「張惠恕才多智少，華而不實，怨之所聚，有覆家之禍，吾見其兆矣。」諸葛亮聞俊憂溫，意未之信，及溫放黜，亮乃歎俊之有先見。亮初聞溫敗，未知其故，思之數日，曰：「吾已得之矣，其人於清濁太明，善惡太分。」) Kuaiji Dianlu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Chen Shou, who wrote Zhang Wen's biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, appraised Zhang Wen as follows: \\"Zhang Wen was talented and good-looking, but he lacked wisdom and caution. That resulted in him getting into trouble.\\"(評曰： ... 張溫才藻俊茂，而智防未備，用致艱患。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Pei Songzhi, who annotated Zhang Wen's biography, remarked that Zhang Wen's downfall was due to his widespread fame, which incurred Sun Quan's jealousy. Zhang Wen's fame was attested by Luo Tong's memorial to Sun Quan, in which Luo Tong mentioned that \\"Zhang Wen had no equal\\".(臣松之以為莊周云「名者公器也，不可以多取」，張溫之廢，豈其取名之多乎！多之為弊，古賢旣知之矣。是以遠見之士，退藏於密，不使名浮於德，不以華傷其實，旣不能被褐韞寶，杜廉逃譽，使才映一世，聲蓋人上，沖用之道，庸可暫替！溫則反之，能無敗乎？權旣疾溫名盛，而駱統方驟言其美，至云「卓躒冠羣，煒曄曜世，世人未有及之者也」。斯何異燎之方盛，又撝膏以熾之哉！) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Zhang Wen appeared in Chapter 86 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. Sun Quan orders him to accompany Deng Zhi back to Shu after Deng Zhi convinces Sun Quan to reestablish the Wu–Shu alliance against Wei. Zhang Wen meets the Shu emperor Liu Shan. Before he leaves, Liu Shan prepares a farewell banquet for him and orders Zhuge Liang and other senior officials to see him off. During the feast, Zhang Wen debates with the Shu official Qin Mi. Qin Mi responds tactfully to Zhang Wen's questions; Zhang Wen, however, cannot respond to Qin Mi's question. He tells Zhuge Liang later that he is very impressed that Shu has such talents.

In September 2016, the Inspector General's final report found Selig received unjustified reimbursements on multiple occasions for luxury hotel stays and premium car service expenses associated with his trips; that he used a staff member for handling his personal business and provided knowingly false information about his travel arrangements; that the commerce department paid $50,000 for a questionable office renovation exceeding the $5000 limit Because Selig and his assistant had left before the report was published, the OIG did not recommend the Department to take administrative action. Selig claimed in a letter to the editor that he had \\"followed proper protocol\\" and delegated the handling of his travel expenses. Personal life Selig is married to Heidi Selig.

James Prior, from 1832 drawing Life The son of Matthew Prior, he was born at Lisburn about 1790. He entered the Royal Navy as a surgeon, and sailed from Plymouth in the frigate HMS Nisus on 22 June 1810. His ship was stationed at Mauritius from November 1810 to April 1811, when he had charge of the wounded; and, after visiting the Seychelles Islands, Madras, Mauritius, Java (at the reduction of which by the British in September 1811 he was present), and Batavia, returned to the Cape of Good Hope. His next expedition, also in the Nisus, was to Table Bay (February 1812), St. Helena (January 1813), Rio de Janeiro (October 1813), and Pernambuco (December 1813). Prior was present at the surrender of Heligoland, which was confirmed to the United Kingdom by the treaty of Kiel on 14 January 1814. In the same year he was ordered to accompany the first regiment of imperial Russian guards from Cherbourg to St. Petersburg, and in 1815 he was on the coast of La Vendée, and was present at the surrender of Napoleon on 15 July. He then became staff surgeon to the Chatham division of the Royal Marines, and to three of the royal yachts. His next appointment was that of assistant to the director-general of the medical department of the navy, and on 1 August 1843 he was created deputy-inspector of hospitals. Prior was elected member of the Royal Irish Academy and Athenæum Club in 1830, and made a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 25 November that year. He was knighted at St. James's Palace on 11 June 1858. For many years before his death he resided at Norfolk Crescent, Hyde Park, London. He died at Brighton on 14 November 1869. Works Prior's major works were biographies of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith. The Memoir of the Life and Character of Edmund Burke appeared in 1824, and was reissued, enlarged to two volumes, in 1826. The third edition came out in 1839, the fourth in 1846, and, after it had been revised by the author, the memoir was included in 1854 in \\"Bohn's British Classics\\". His Life of Oliver Goldsmith, from a variety of original sources, was published in 1837 in two volumes; and in the same year he edited in four volumes the Miscellaneous Works of Goldsmith, including a variety of pieces now first collected. When John Forster brought out in 1848 his Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith, he was accused by Prior of wholesale plagiarism. The case was debated in the Literary Gazette, 3 June, 17 June, and 29 July 1848, and The Athenæum, 10 June 1848; the accusation was further rebutted by Forster in 1854 in the second edition of his work. Washington Irving, in his Life of Goldsmith (1849), admitted his obligations to Prior; but Prior's short tract Goldsmith's Statue denounced Irving for having stolen his materials. Prior's other works were: *Voyage in the Indian Seas in the Nisus frigate during 1810 and 1811, published by Sir Richard Phillips in 1820, and included in the first volume of a collection of New Voyages and Travels. *Voyage along the Eastern Coast of Africa (1819), included in the second volume of Phillips's Voyages. *The Remonstrance of a Tory to Sir Robert Peel, 1827, in which Prior attacked Peel's position on Catholic emancipation. *The Country House and other Poems, 1846. *Invitation to Malvern, a poem with introductory poetical epistle to Charles Phillips, 1851. *Lines on reading Verses of Admiral Smyth, 1857. *Llangothlen, a sketch (no place or date). *Life of Edmond Malone, with Selections from his Manuscript Anecdotes, 1860. Family Prior married, in 1817, Dorothea, widow of a Mr. E. James. She died at Oxford Terrace, Hyde Park, on 28 November 1841. In 1847 he married Carolina, widow of Charles H. Watson, who died on 14 December 1881, aged 85.

Biography Julius Mayr was born in Rotthalmünster (Lower Bavaria) as the fourth child of the district court physician Dr. Karl Mayr. His mother died from typhoid fever in 1856 when Mayr was only 14 months old. Mayr attended primary school in Rotthalmünster (1861 to 1865), and the Ludwigs- Gymnasium (high school) in Munich from 1869 to 1873. In 1873, he began his military service as a one-year volunteer. Following that year, he started medical studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, completing his education in 1878. One year later, in 1879, he obtained a PhD, with a dissertation on “Historical Sketches of Erysipelas.“ He continued his medical education at the universities of Vienna, Berlin, Prague and Budapest. From 1880 to 1897, he was a general practitioner and ophthalmologist in Rosenheim (Upper Bavaria), a community insurance doctor, a medical officer of the Royal Bavarian Landwehr,a railway doctor,a factory doctor of the match factory Hamberger, and a general practitioner at the Marienbad. During this time, he lived in a house located at Innstraße 11 in Rosenheim. In October 1880, Mayr married Auguste Hiedl, daughter of a country judge in Passau. Together they had two daughters: Helene (surname Weller after her first marriage, and Wohnlich after her second marriage) and Luise (surname Hundt after her marriage). From 1887 to 1897 and from 1907 to 1912, Julius Mayr was the Chairman of the Rosenheim branch of the German Alpine Club; which, at that time, was called the \\"German and Austrian Alpine Club\\". Between 1885 and 1900, he developed friendships with people including Wilhelm Leibl, Johann Sperl, and Max Liebermann. Julius Mayr became acquainted with the Steinbeis family (industrial owners of the Wendelstein Rack Railway) and others. Between 1890 and 1891, Wilhelm Leibl painted portraits of Julius Mayr as well as of Auguste Mayr. The portrait of Julius Mayr is in the Museum Georg Schäfer, Schweinfurt; the portrait of Auguste Mayr has gone missing. Timeline of important events in Mayr's life 1894: Inauguration of the Brünnsteinhaus, the construction of which was supervised by Mayr. 1898: Inauguration of the secured mountain path, \\"Dr Julius Mayr Weg\\", which leads from the Brünnsteinhaus (1,360 m) to the summit of the Brünnstein (1,634 m). 1897-1903: Royal Bavarian districts medical officer first class in Bogen (Lower Bavaria); upon his written application, Mayr was appointed in this function by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. 1901-1903: Leave of absence due to serious illness of esophagus and gastric problems. 1 January 1904: retirement. 1901-1935: Julius Mayr is residing in Brannenburg am Inn (Upper Bavaria). 1906: The first edition of Julius Mayr's biography of the painter Wilhelm Leibl appears. Three more editions follow until 1935, all of which published by F. Bruckmann publishers, Munich. 1920s/early 1930s: Friendship with amongst others Josef Hofmiller, Eduard Stemplinger, Ludwig Steub. 1924: Publication of a selection of Mayr's stories under the title Auf stillen Pfaden (Along quiet paths), published by Rudolf Rother Alpine Publishers, Munich. Ca. 1930: Tragedy in five acts \\"Sigbot von Falkenstein\\" (unpublished). 1932: August Mayr dies of leukemia. Julius Mayr dedicates to her a biographical sketch/essay \\"Sie. Eine bürgerliche Frau von Adel\\" (She. - A middle-class woman of nobility). Auguste Mayr was buried in the cemetery of Rosenheim. 1935, 8. May: Julius Mayr dies. He is buried at the cemetery of Rosenheim. The physician Due to his education as a court physician, a surgeon, and his additional specialisation in ophthalmology, Julius Mayr was able to perform laparotomies, amputations, squint and cataract surgeries. He was highly regarded as a competent physician and his patients came from far. The routine assessments carried out by the Royal Governments of Upper and Lower Bavaria attest to his outstanding educational and medical qualifications and hence his aptitude for the position of Royal District Medical Officer, First Class, for which Julius Mayr had successfully applied (job location Bogen/Lower Bavaria). Diverticula in his esophagus and the daily need to self-introduce a probe and flush his stomach forced him to give up his profession. Mayr published many medical papers and gave many lectures, always taking care to implement the latest medical and technical knowledge, and to preserve medical empathy and the \\"arts of medicine\\". The hiker, mountaineer and Alpine Club official Memorial plate on the \\"Dr Julius Mayr Weg\\" While living in Rotthalmünster, young Julius must have inherited a strong love for the mountains, for hiking and nature from his father. At the age of only 17 years, Julius Mayr reached the summit of the Großvenediger (3,666 m). After that, Rosenheim and the Inn Valley became the starting point for \\"mountaineering trips\\" throughout the entire Eastern Alps, the Pre-Alps, and also the Mountains of Abruzzo (Gran Sasso d'Italia). For him the mountains were not so much a challenge for physical or sporting excellence, but he considered them to be the places par excellence to experience creation in all its diversity, size and beauty, both living and (seemingly) inanimate in nature. As the Chairman of the Rosenheim branch of the German and Austrian Alpine Club, Julius Mayr became the founding father of the Brünnsteinhaus (the location of which he had chosen, the construction of which he had supervised and the construction of which he had organized in its inauguration in 1894). The secured mountain path from the Brünnsteinhaus (1,360 m) to the summit of the Brünnstein (1,634 m), completed in 1898, still bears his name: Dr Julius Mayr Weg. The writer Julius Mayr's biography of his friend, hunting and hiking companion Wilhelm Leibl (title: Wilhelm Leibl. His Life and His Work) has been for a long time the most important biography of that famous painter. The biography first appeared in 1906, almost six years after Leibl's death. It not only describes the life and work of the master, but it also recounts the friendship between Johann Sperl, Leibl and Julius Mayr. The 4th edition of the biography was published by Bruckmann publishers, Munich in 1935 - shortly after the death of its author, Julius Mayr. His many mountain walks (for example on the mountains of the Chiemgau, in the Inn Valley or the Mangfall Mountains), and also his hikes across the Pre-Alps (in the Adige Valley or in the Wachau) have not only inspired Julius Mayr's lectures (for the members of the Alpine Club), but also inspired his story writing. Only part of these stories has been published in the collection Along Quiet Paths() (published by Rudolf Rother Alpine Publishers, Munich 1924). Many of his remaining publications are scattered throughout various magazines and newspapers, notably many of the bulletins of the Alpine Club. In his stories Julius Mayr drew vivid, often lyrical and moody images, partly sketched in romantic hues. His accounts describe in a loving, even humorous, manner mostly simple people, mixing high German with colloquial German and slightly stylizing the Bavarian dialect, but also introducing historical / cultural / historical knowledge, sober facts and humanistic reflections. Mayr often cited Goethe, and inserted for example quotations of Goethe's Faust or the West-Eastern Divan. Julius Mayr's lyrical talent is recorded in numerous poems. The play that he had written that remained unpublished (entitled Sigbot von Falkenstein) is largely unknown. It concerns the tragic end of the last representative of the once powerful dynasty of the Counts of Falkenstein, during the second half of the 13th century. In it, Mayr used in a creative manner the historical sources of which he had such excellent knowledge. The language, rhythm and motifs he used distinctly echo known classics, especially Schiller (William Tell, Die Piccolomini) and Goethe (Gretchen Tragedy). A visionary critic of his time In his diary Julius Mayr condemned Kaiser Wilhelm II and the aristocratic cliques of that era. As early as 1905, he felt the approach of World War I. In the early 1930s, Mayr spoke out passionately against the hypocritical, demagogic and ruthless activities of the Nazis. In 1934, Julius Mayr predicted the coming of the Holocaust. Even in the final scene of Sigbot von Falkenstein he alludes to arson, murder and the terror taking place at that time. Publications (selection) * Wilhelm Leibl. Sein Leben und sein Schaffen.

EET has been described as a theory of social stratification, as it analyzes how stratification has changed through time across different societies. It also has been viewed as a synthesis of the structural functionalism and conflict theory. Proposed by Gerhard Lenski, the theory perhaps is best articulated in his book, Ecological-Evolutionary Theory: Principles and Applications (2005).Elwell (2013), p.91 His major collaborators, Jean Lenski and Patrick Nolan, also are said to have contributed to EET. Theory Lenski notes that society and culture evolve through symbols, which makes this process much more rapid, deliberative, and purposeful, compared to biological evolution. However, just like in the biological survival of the fittest, in sociocultural evolution there is a process of intersocietal selection, where less fit sociocultural systems became extinct, replaced by more efficient ones. In another analogy to biological evolution, Lenski argues that the sociocultural systems that survive do so primarily on the virtue of their level of technological advancement, which otherwise is \\"blind and purposeless as the outcome of the biological process of natural selection and just as indifferent to humans beliefs and values\\". Thus, Lenski does not argue that societies that survive are morally superior to those that are defeated—simply that they were more efficient at technological progress. This, in turn, helps those societies survive and grow. Technologies can thus be compared to genes of a society, providing it with new abilities, as new technologies allow it to do things that it could not have done before. Technology is a factor whose importance Lenski stresses above all others, and he differentiates societies by their technology level, into hunter gatherers, simple and complex horticulture, agrarian societies and industrial societies. At the same time, characteristics of a society go beyond technology, into its demographic and genetic characteristics; culture, including material; social organization and institutions. Natural environment also plays a role, as does geographical location in general; as isolated societies have less chance to benefit from interaction with others. Lenski's theory focus on material infrastructure of societies (growth in population and economic relations), and as such has been described as materialist.Elwell (2013), p.100 It builds on classic theories of Thomas Malthus and Herbert Spencer in seeing society and culture a products of nature (human beings), thus subject to natural law.Elwell (2013), p.94 Lenski argues that humans often act against the interests of the society, which he attributes to self-interest and individualism, themselves products of differing life experiences.Elwell (2103), p.95 He notes that different societies survive thanks to their subsistence strategies, which allow them to draw resources (energy) from the environment; those strategies are determined by technologies possessed by those societies, itself significantly determined by demography (population and its growth) and economy systems (division of labor).Elwell (2013), p.96 Technology, defined by him as \\"information about the ways in which resources in the environment may be used to satisfy human needs and desires,\\" is the most important element of the sociocultural system.Elwell (2013), p.97 Lenski further argues that sociocultural change is an effect of either interaction with a different society and culture, or a result of environment change (from natural ones, like ice ages, to man-made ones, like resource depletion). Humans primary way of dealing with changing environment is a self-reinforcing development of technology, through innovation is in general less common than copying solutions invented by others (cultural diffusion).Elwell (2013), p.98 All societies share two partially competing goals: maximization of production and minimizing of political change (maintenance of powers by the elites). The higher the social stratification, the more dominant the second goal is. Lenski theory can be thus used to analyze the changes of social inequality. Lenski notes that some level of social inequality is expected in all societies, as it is related to differences in abilities of individuals and the tasks they chose to perform for the society; but he also observes that inequality in all societies has always been higher than ideal, as elites usually try to preserve their dominant status. Lenski argues that inequality reached its peak levels in agrarian societies or industrial ones, and have been slowly declining since.Elwell (2013), pp.99-100 Lenski observes that the forces of technological change (innovation) are in constant conflict with forces of continuity and stability, such as traditions, conservatism, opposition of vested interests to disruptive technologies, and general tendency of humans to resist change. He concludes, however, that usually technological progress overcomes any obstacles, forcing sociocultural systems to change. Lenski also observes that technological change accelerates over time. The theory has been praised as \\"a synthesis of key insights of the founders of sociology and of contemporary macrosociology and anthropology\\".

Cohen (born 1953) is a former United Nations advisor on Bosnia and Herzegovina who has written several works on the history of the former Yugoslavia. Cohen was educated at the New College of Florida and University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and is a qualified dermatologist. He authored a noted book Serbia’s Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History, first published in 1996 by Texas A&M; University Press to mixed reviews. He followed this in 1997 with the publishing of The World War II and contemporary Chetniks: Their historico-political continuity and implications for stability in the Balkans by Ceres. In 1998, he received an award from Franjo Tuđman the President of Croatia for his \\"contribution in spreading the truth about the aggression against Croatia\\" and \\"exposing Great Serb and anti- Croat propaganda\\" through his books. Biography Philip J. Cohen attended New College of Florida in Sarasota where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating in 1975. In 1983, he completed his Doctor of Medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He is a practicing dermatologist. In 1993, he wrote a position paper on ending the war in the former Yugoslavia for President Bill Clinton's transition team. The following year, he was Advisor for Policy and Public Affairs with the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Yugoslav Wars, Cohen had close ties with Croatia's ruling party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). In 1998, Franjo Tuđman, the President of Croatia, awarded Cohen the Order of Danica Hrvatska (for culture), the 13th highest award in the Croatian honours system, for his \\"contribution in spreading the truth about the aggression against Croatia\\". Book \\"exposing Great Serb and anti-Croat propaganda\\" through his books, Serbia’s Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History and The World War II and contemporary Chetniks: Their historico-political continuity and implications for stability in the Balkans. Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History Texas A&M; University Press published Cohen's Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History in 1996. The foreword was written by David Riesman, Professor Emeritus of Social Sciences at Harvard University. Its front cover included a reproduction of an anti- Semitic postage stamp printed in January 1942 to mark the Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibition that opened in Belgrade on 22 October 1941. On its back cover, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher described the book as \\"a useful counter to current myths about Serbia's history during the Second World War\\", and the Library Journal recommended it highly as an \\"impressive, scholarly book offering a wealth of new information\\". On 7 October 1996, the book was reviewed by Professor Brendan Simms, Fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in the Times Higher Education Supplement. Simms observed that Cohen's book was \\"a revisionist work in that it overturns conventional wisdom, but not in the murky or dubious sense connoted by Holocaust \\"revisionism\\". First of all, Cohen never disputes that hundreds of thousands—but not millions—of Serbs died horribly, and often for no other reason than that they were Serbs. Second, despite the fact that Cohen is not a trained historian, his central thesis of extensive Serbian collaboration with Nazi Germany is well supported by the evidence\\". Simms mentioned that Cohen \\"somewhat blurs\\" but does not suppress the fundamental qualitative difference between the Croatian and Serbian involvement in The Holocaust, in that the Croatian involvement was led by the Croatian fascist Ustaše with German assistance, but the Serb involvement was led by the Germans with support from collaborationist Serbs. Simms noted that \\"in places Cohen gives the Croats the benefit of the doubt\\", but states that \\"[N]one of this affects Cohen's central argument: \\"Serbia\\" and many Serbs collaborated with Nazi Germany\\". alt=black and white photograph of a man in military uniform In December 1997, Cohen's book was reviewed by Professor Charles W. Ingrao of Purdue University's History Department in Nationalities Papers. Ingrao described the book as a \\"well-written, heavily footnoted narration\\" which \\"details the degree to which the Serbs of what is today Rump-Yugoslavia collaborated with the Nazis, both before and immediately after the April 1941 German invasion\\". He noted that, \\"It is difficult to refute his contention that it was the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Jews of multiethnic Bosnia and the Krajina that provided the backbone to the anti-fascist war effort at a time when both the Četniks and Nedić regimes of Serbia were pursuing their own agenda of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia\\". Ingrao observed that while scholars were already familiar with a great deal of the material included in the book, Cohen's exposé on the Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society founded by Slobodan Milošević was new evidence about an organisation that was used to convince the international community of the common bond between Serbs and Jews. Ingrao concluded that, while Cohen overplayed the evidence at a couple of points in the book, he was impressed by both its factual accuracy and balanced judgements. In February 2000, Dennis Reinhartz, Professor of History and Russian at the University of Texas at Arlington reviewed Cohen's book in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. Reinhartz stated that Cohen's book belonged to \\"the current popular-historical and journalist literature that seeks to demonize and condemn more than to chronicle and elucidate fairly\\". He added that the book was \\"in danger of degenerating itself into an irrational conspiracy history and belongs to those history works of the Balkans that contribute little to our understanding of past events and their impact on the present\\". The French journal Cahiers de l'URMIS published in its 2000 issue a paper by Marko Živković, an associate professor in the Anthropology Department at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, which criticised Cohen's book. In it, Živković, himself a Serbian Jew, stated that Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History was the culmination of a two-track strategy by the Croatian media aimed at \\"damage control\\" regarding Croatian atrocities against Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II. Živković stated that this strategy involved presenting anti-Semitism in the NDH as an import from Nazi Germany, and in trying to show that the Serbs were no better, and possibly worse in their treatment of Jews during World War II than the Croats. Živković observed that Cohen had not lied or distorted the sources, but had failed to weigh the evidence regarding whether anti-Semitism was marginal or dominant in Serbia during the war. In 2002, Professor David Bruce MacDonald of the University of Otago published his Balkan Holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian Victim-Centered Propaganda and the War in Yugoslavia. In it, he described Serbia's Secret War as \\"a controversial pro-Croatian revision of Serbian history\\". MacDonald cites Cohen as a \\"good example\\" of a \\"non-Croatia[n] propagandist who became intimately involved with the [Tuđman] regime.\\" Cohen's book was mentioned in Yugoslavia and its Historians, published by Stanford University Press in 2003. In a chapter titled Clio amid the Ruins. Yugoslavia and Its Predecessors in Recent Historiography, Dušan J. Djordjevich observes that \\"the quantity and quality of new historiography on Serbs and Serbia are disappointing\\", and states that \\"[e]fforts to reinterpret or fill gaps in the literature are often subject to obtrusive, distorting agendas of apology or condemnation\\". In a footnote to these observations, Djordjevich describes Cohen's and another book as ones which explore important topics, but \\"in which censorious zeal trumps balanced scholarship\\". In 2011, Miroslav Svirčević of the Institute for Balkan Studies of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts reviewed Cohen's book in its journal Balcanica. Svirčević was highly critical of the book, and stated that it belongs to \\"pseudo-scholarly publications, not infrequently swaying on the verge of ugliest war and racist propaganda\\". Svirčević further pointed that \\"In fact, the Cohen's book teems with forgeries, half-truths, incompetent use of historical sources, overstrained theses and ill-intended inferences.\\" In the same year, the historian Klaus Buchenau criticised Cohen for drawing heavily on contemporary press accounts to demonstrate the \\"fascism\\" of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and failing to take into account \\"the omnipresent censorship and manipulation\\" in the Nedić-controlled newspapers. In March 2011, Marko Attila Hoare, an associate professor of economics, politics, and history at Kingston University posted a personal blog entry which dealt with a number of issues regarding Cohen's book. He wrote that denial of the genocide at Srebrenica in July 1995 \\"tends to go hand-in-hand with the denial of the genocidal crimes carried out by Serbian Nazi quislings and collaborators during World War II\\". He stated that \\"Great Serbian nationalists of the 1990s waged a hate campaign against Croats and Bosniaks, seeking to equate the entire Croat and Bosniak nations with the Ustashas\\". He observed that Cohen wrote his book as a response to this propaganda. Hoare recounted meeting with Cohen in the mid-1990s, and stated that the book was \\"very good\\". He also noted that attacks on Cohen by Serb nationalists have continued for 15 years, extending to a claim that Cohen hadn't even written the book. Hoare dismissed this claim as a \\"complete fabrication\\", stating that he had met Cohen at Yale University during the book's writing, had read the manuscript and discussed it with Cohen at length, and seen Cohen's library and archive. The following year, an article by Alexander Mirkovic of Northern Michigan University was published in Balcanica. He stated that it is common to find an opinion, even among experienced United States Department of State officials, that the Yugoslav Partisans were mainly supported by anti-fascist Croats and Slovenes. In a footnote to this observation, he states that page 95 of Cohen's book contains the false claim that \\"[o]verall, from 1941 to 1945, the Partisans of Croatia were 61 per cent Croat and 28 per cent Serb\\". In 2013, Raphael Israeli, Emeritus Professor of Middle Eastern, Islamic and Chinese history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem published his book The Death Camps of Croatia: Visions and Revisions, 1941-1945. In that book he referred to Cohen's work as \\"seminal\\", and noted that Cohen had \\"copiously documented\\" the large amount of anti-Semitic press in the German-occupied territory of Serbia. He also observed that Cohen had \\"definitively demonstrated\\" that the head of the German-appointed puppet regime, Milan Nedić, along with other members of the Serbian Orthodox Church, \\"were aware and supportive of the German extermination plan and execution [of Jews], and were not loath to lend a hand when asked\\". Further, Israeli referenced and quoted Reinhartz's review of Cohen's book, and noted that at least one Belgrade Jewish author on the Holocaust in Serbia considered Cohen to be propaganda from \\"Tudjman's kitchen\\". The sociologist Jovan Byford lists Serbia's Secret War among a \\"series of propagandist pieces of quasi-historical writing\\" written by pro- Croatian authors during the 1990s. Byford emphasizes that Cohen belongs to group of authors whose works support Croatian side in propaganda war with Serbia also by intentionally depicting Serbs as genuine \\"genocidal nation\\".: \\" S hrvatske strane, najaktivniji u ovom svojevrsnom ratu rečima bili su bili autori poput Tomislava Vukovića, Ljubice Štefan, Josipa Pečarića, Anta Kneževića i američkog publiciste Filipa Koena (Philip Cohen). U svojim delima oni su nastojali da predstave Srbe kao stvarni „genocidni narod“, ...\\" In a June 2018 review of a work on a similar topic, the historian Luke Gramith from University of West Virginia referred to Philip Cohen's Serbia's Secret War as a polemical and even anti-Serbian work.

It is currently a ghost town that was located approximately 3.5 miles north of Lehigh next to a railroad. No buildings remain of this former community. History 1915 Railroad Map of Marion County =Early history= For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. =19th century= In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Waldeck.The History of Marion County and Courthouse From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the United States was the Santa Fe Trail. The Santa Fe Trail was active across Marion County from 1821 to 1866.History of the Cottonwood Crossing Chapter, Santa Fe Trail Association. Along the Santa Fe Trail, French Frank's Road Ranch and Cottonwood Holes (for watering) were original located on the land south of 245th Street. A Santa Fe Trail marker is located on the trail near Waldeck on 245th Street.1997 Survey of DAR Markers in Kansas Also, the Chisholm Trail crossed Marion County from 1867 to 1871. Amazingly, Waldeck was near the junction of the Santa Fe Trail and Chisolm Trail, possibly within 1 mile.Detailed map of the Chisolm Trail through Kansas; Kansas Historical Society. In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Waldeck to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Waldeck was a coal and water stop for the railroad during the steam era. To allow for continuous train passage for those not needing to stop, a siding in excess of one mile was built. The siding continues this function for east and westbound commerce to pass in the present day. The construction of this line meant that the Chisholm Trail no longer needed to go the additional 40 miles to Abilene, Kansas (the former northern terminus). Among the last usable structures at Waldeck, cattle corrals were operational until the early 1950s, when diesel locomotives became dominant. The town was most likely named by a Swiss Brethren after the former Waldeck sovereign principality in the German Empire. The land on which Waldeck would stand was sold to the Golden Belt Town Co in October 1887. The railroad was routed through the land and a depot was built, but the \\"boom spirit\\" of the 1880s turned downward, so the land was sold at a loss to the Kansas Town and Loan Company in the 1890s. A town with two block where platted on December 7, 1899. A small general store and school were located in the community, but the town didn't grow. =21st century= Currently no buildings exist in Waldeck, thus it's considered a Ghost Town. There is a Santa Fe Trail marker nearby on 245th Street. Geography Waldeck was located at , located on the north side of 245th Street between Bison Road and Chisholm Trail Road in Marion County, Kansas. It was bordered between 245th Street on the south side and the railroad on the north side. Its platted location was the NW 1/4 of Section 4, Township 19, Range 1. A Stock yard was located on the north side of the tracks.Marion County Kansas : Past and Present; Sondra Van Meter; MB Publishing House; LCCN 72-92041; 344 pages; 1972.Atlas of Marion County Kansas - Lehigh Township (page 25); Geo A.

Life Throughout her life Hallowell was an avid seeker of knowledge and began a teaching career as soon as she graduated from Colby College. Susan Hallowell pioneered in higher education for women. Wellesley.edu: \\"Wellesley’s Women of Botany\\" She was the first woman to be admitted to the botanical lectures and laboratories of the University of Berlin, although this was not achieved with ease, as arriving in Europe she found that the universities on the continent were closed to women. She taught in Bangor High School for more than 20 years, while continuing her own education in her spare time. In order to further her knowledge, she worked in the Boston laboratories of renowned botanists Asa Gray and Louis Agassiz. =Wellesley College= By 1875, Henry Durant, the founder of Wellesley College, had become familiar with Hallowell's work in the Gray and Agassiz laboratories. He appointed her as Chair of Natural History, which she then divided into zoology and botany departments. Hallowel formed the original Botany Department, and became the first Chair and Professor of Botany in 1877.Wellesley.edu: \\"Wellesley's botanical legacy\\" The many botany courses she developed rarely changed in format, only needing additional or new scientific knowledge and discoveries incorporated into them. She built up a botanical library, which at the time was only excelled in the U.S. by those of the best universities. It is said that she cultivated her 'disciples', inviting her pupil Margaret Clay Ferguson from the class of 1891: to major in botany; gave her a position as instructor in 1893, and appointed her as the Head of the Botany Department in 1894. Ferguson later oversaw the creation of the arboretum and botanic garden as well as the 1925 greenhouse complex, the present day Margaret C. Ferguson Greenhouses. Wellesley.edu: Margaret C. Ferguson Greenhouses In 1902, when Miss Hallowell was 67 years old, she retired from her position as professor. From that time on she was Emeritus Professor of Botany at Wellesey.

It was named by Captain Francis Harding, RN after HMS Pelorus. Description Pelorus Islet is about east south-east of Cape Gantheaume. It consists of three separate islets - a main round topped peak of height with a reef with several rocks sitting above water level to its east and another exposed rock to its south-west. It is inaccessible by boat as it is subject to continuous swells. Formation, geology and oceanography Peloris Islet was formed between 7500 and 8900 years ago after sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene when Kangaroo Island became separated from Yorke and Fleurieu Peninsulas. Pelorus Islet is the remains of a volcanic intrusion reported as being some 506 million years old. The islet rises abruptly from a depth of . Flora and fauna As of 1996, no terrestrial vegetation was present as the islet has been ‘scoured of any soil and small eroded fragments, leaving only a few large boulders’ while the only vertebrate animals observed were New Zealand fur seals and crested terns. History Nicolas Baudin is reported as being the first European to describe the islet, however he did not name the islet. The islet was surveyed in May 1838 by HMS Pelorus under the command of Captain Francis Harding RN. It is reported that Harding named the islet after the ship. The Pelorus Islet is reported as being the site of the wrecking of You Yangs on 14 June 1890. You Yangs was a 672 gross tonnage barque rigged screw steamer owned by Howard Smith and Sons. Protected areas status Pelorus Islet originally obtained protected area status as a fauna reserve under the former Fauna Conservation Act 1964 As of 1996, it was described as being vacant crown land. It obtained status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967. As of 2016, the islet is part of the Cape Gantheaume Conservation Park. As of 2012, the waters surrounding its shores are part of a habitat protection zone located within the boundaries of the Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park.

Bell in 1987.  History  Bell composed \\"The Summons\\" after being accepted into the Iona Community in 1980. It was first included in the Iona Community's Heaven Shall Not Wait: Songs of Creation, the Incarnation, and the Life of Jesus, published by their Wild Goose Resource Group in 1987. \\"The Summons\\" has been published in many hymn books beyond the Iona Community and the United Kingdom, including those by the United Church of Canada and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). It also appears in “Wonder, Love, and Praise,” the addendum hymnal of the Episcopal Church (United States) and \\"The Faith We Sing\\", a supplemental hymnal of the United Methodist Church.  Composition and usage  \\"The Summons\\" is set to the tune of Kelvingrove, a traditional Scottish melody. Its text contains thirteen questions asked by Jesus in the first person. The initial four stanzas with the questions are in Jesus' voice, and the fifth stanza is the singer's response to them. The hymn is based on Mark 1:16–20 and alludes to Jesus calling his disciples to follow him. C. Michael Hawn calls it a prophetic Christian hymn and mentioned that it contains words uncommon to other hymns. It has been used as an example of how a Christian should react to fear and love as well as being written as an example of covenantal discipleship. The hymn is used as a vocational and youth hymn because the words are easier to learn for younger people compared with other hymns. In 2014, the hymn was used at Blackburn Cathedral at a service performed by the Bishop of Blackburn to commemorate 20 years since the first ordination of women in the Church of England as well as the Diocese of Blackburn's decision to support the ordination of women as bishops in the Church of England.

It is produced by WestDev, which is headquartered in Gloucestershire, England, with additional sales and distribution offices overseas. It was first released in 2001, and runs on Windows. Development The British software house WestDev created electronic design automation (EDA) software Pulsonix in 2001. Some development team members had formerly worked at Racal–Redac on computer-aided design tools. A key aim of the developers was that the software be easy to use, without the need for extensive training that they believed existing EDA products at that time required. The software formed part of the €14 million euros EU-funded project \\"\\". The three-year project (2008-11) sought to embed components within a circuit board's inner layers, to minimize use of design space. Traditionally, wire leads of components were inserted through holes in a circuit board then soldered in place; more recently, components and chips are surface-mounted flush with the board and heat-set. Although the concept of embedding components directly within layers of a circuit board itself had existed for some time, technical difficulties meant it was experimental, unsuited for use in mass production. An increased demand for miniaturization, for products such as smartphones or medical devices that have to be swallowed to explore inside the body, led the EU to create the three-year project to develop embedding for \\"industrialization\\" (mass production use). No EDA software was suitable for embedding. The taskforce working on HERMES approached the \\"most important EDA tool suppliers and convinced them to support [the project]\\". Pulsonix was one of those contacted, the others being Cadence, Mentor Graphics, and Zuken. Features Pulsonix is a Windows application for schematic capture and layout design. It is produced in three variants, from 1000 pins up to an unlimited component pins version suited to larger designs. All three have autorouter capability. Within a dual monitor setup, schematic and layout design processes can each be assigned to a single screen, with changes synchronized as needed. =Schematic capture= Schematic capture layout functionality, including: * Hierarchical schematic design * mixed-signal circuit simulation * Netlist export * Reporting and BOM creation * Sketch Routing =PCB design= * Push, shove and hug routing * Manual routing, with support for differential pairs, multi-trace routing, pin-swapping and gate-swapping * Automatic trace routing * Apply layout pattern for component placement * Layer spans * Via stitching within custom shapes and pads * Component footprint library management * Support for Flexi-Rigid Design * Support for Embedded Components * STEP support * Manufacturing files generation with support for Gerber and ODB++ formats * Import and export among various file formats * 3D visualisation and clash detection Reception Chris Anderson, then Wired editor-in-chief, gave it a generally positive review, at DIY Drones – an online portal for unmanned aerial vehicle (\\"drones\\") enthusiasts, in which he praised its user interface plus range of features such as 3D views, and, while noting it is an expensive product, deemed it \\"the best competitor to the aging Cadsoft Eagle\\" software. Neil Gruending, columnist at long-running electronics magazine Elektor, on board design among the maker subculture, reviewed around seven EDA products on his blog in late 2012. Gruending found Pulsonix's user interface straightforward, singling out how \\"copper pours work properly\\" for praise. He considered for range of features and cost, its closest relation was Altium. Contrasting the two products Gruending wrote Pulsonix had comparatively low market share in North America, though he found support from vendors significantly better for Pulsonix there.

ILPKL officers once again underwent training in Osaka, this time is High Skilled Machinist Course at Higashiyodagawa Advanced Vocational Training Centre. There were Japanese lecturers from ILO and American lecturers from BISCO. The three first programmes taught at ILPKL are electrical, building construction and printing with infrastructures from Japan and Australia. ILPKL also have been visited by numerous VIPs and organizations in its history including Malaysia's first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, fourth Prime Minister Tun Mahathir, V. Manickavasagam and Datuk Richard Ho. The government later realized that the country is lacked of skilled workers, and as a developing country, the need for more proficient tradesmen is crucial for country's growth and to eliminate the dependability on foreign workforces. The government is also trying to reflect advanced countries such as Germany and Japan where students who are good in academic pick vocational field as their career. This leads to renovation, upgrade and expansion of ILPKL. =List of directors= Here is a list of all ILPKL directors from 1965 to 2014: #Peru Mohamed bin Asan Mydin #Ibrahim Mohamad #Wan Seman bin Wan Ahmad #Rosti Saruwono #Amir bin Abdullah #How Chin Chong #Abdullah bin Ali #Syed Mohamad Noor bin Syed Ali #Nik Othman bin Daud #Mohd Hashimi bin Abd Hadi #Mohamad Manoj bin Jumidali #Eng.

I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse. It was co-written by Carey in collaboration with Hit-Boy, Denesia Andrews and MaryAnn Tatum. Carey and Hit-Boy also produced it, with co- production from Rey Reel. The alternate version of \\"Thirsty\\", featuring one rap verse from American rapper Rich Homie Quan, received its radio premiere on Power 105.1 on May 13, 2014, a day before the album version featuring just Carey was made available to stream. It has been described as a \\"club-friendly\\" R&B; song influenced by hip hop, which makes use of a minimal synth beat. The song was met with a mixed reaction from music critics; some were complimentary of her decision to work with Hit-Boy and Rich Homie Quan, while others felt that Carey was trying too hard to appeal to a mass audience by doing so. Electro pop band Purple Crush also claimed that Carey used the hook from their 2013 song of the same name. Following the release of the album, \\"Thirsty\\" debuted on the South Korean International Gaon Single Chart at number 78 due to strong digital download sales. Background During an interview with Power 105.1 radio in a segment called The Breakfast Club, the host asked Carey if she had made a \\"bounce, gentleman's club\\" song due to the recent popularity of artists choosing to record \\"strip-club\\" songs, such as \\"Drunk in Love\\" by Beyoncé and \\"Pour It Up\\" by Rihanna. She confirmed that she had recorded a song for Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse called \\"Thirsty\\", which embodies the same feel. Carey revealed that she had collaborated with Hit-Boy on the track. \\"Thirsty\\" was co-written by Carey in collaboration with Hit-Boy, Denesia \\"Blu June\\" Andrews, and MaryAnn Tatum. Production of the song was carried out by Carey and Hit-Boy. It was co-produced with Rey Reel. Jeremy Cimino, Nico Essig, Rob Katz, Rob Suchecki, Matt Weber assisted in the song's recording, at Rapture Studios, Metrocity Studios, Studio at the Dunes, Beach House Studios, Henson Recording Studios, Studio at the Palms and Jungle City Studios, with mixing from Hazebanga and assistant mixing from Kevin Matela, Dave Rowland and Kenta Yonesaka at Germano Studios. The vocals were arranged by Carey, who also added background vocals along with Kaylana Tatum and Maryann Tatum. Tatum carried out additional background vocal production. An alternate version of \\"Thirsty\\", featuring one rap verse from American rapper Rich Homie Quan, was released first and received its official radio premiere on Power 105.1 on May 13, 2014, while the solo album version featuring only Carey was made available to stream a day later. The single artwork for \\"Thirsty\\" was released on May 13, 2014. In the colourful picture, Carey is making a \\"sultry\\" pose in a strapless bikini top with matching lower half wrapped around her, with her midriff on show. Brett Maloc for E! thought that Carey looked \\"skinnier than ever\\". Despite Carey and Def Jam both confirming \\"Thirsty\\" as the fourth single to be released from the album, no release date was set. \\"You Don't Know What to Do\\" featuring Wale was released to urban contemporary radio on June 30, 2014 and rhythmic contemporary radio on July 1, 2014, as the fourth single instead. Composition \\"Thirsty\\" is a \\"club- friendly\\" R&B; song with an influence of hip hop music, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 26 seconds. \\"Thirsty\\" is about how Carey's lover has a thirst for fame which causes her to drown in her own misery. Billy Johnson, Jr. for Yahoo! Music described the track as \\"[dissing] those desperate for attention.\\" The singer is \\"taking center stage as she takes aim at a starfucker\\" as she performs her \\"nonchalant\\" verses over a \\"skittering\\" minimal synth beat. The songs begins with the sound of a drink being poured into a glass, after which the instrumental begins to play and Carey sings line \\"You used to be Mr. All About Me, now you're just thirsty for celebrity\\" in her upper register, then continues to ask her suitor \\"Why you try so damn hard?\\" During the chorus, Carey repeatedly sings the hook \\"Uh, you're Thirs- tay/ Uh, you're Thirs-tay\\". Rich Homie Quan performs background chants on \\"Thirsty\\", although he is not credited on the album track list. He does, however, appear as a featured artist on an alternate version of the song, and performs one rap verse. For his part, he adds a \\"comedic element\\" by performing the line \\"Somebody get this girl a class of water/ I say she six nickels, not a dime past a quarter.\\" The minimalist synth line of \\"Thirsty\\" has garnered comparisons to that of \\"Niggas in Paris\\", a song performed by Kanye West and Jay-Z, which was also produced by Hit-Boy in 2011. Critics have noted that although it is Hit-Boy's signature style to include a \\"steering background\\" beat in his production, that \\"Thirsty\\" is too \\"busy\\" compared to \\"Niggas in Paris\\" and that it comes off as \\"less appealing\\" and \\"watered-down\\" in comparison. Gerrick D. Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Thirsty\\" lacks the \\"heft\\" of a song that Hit-Boy produced called \\"Flawless\\" for Beyoncé's self-titled album in 2013. Critical reception While some critics thought Mariah was trying too hard with \\"Thirsty,\\" the song has garnered mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Christina Lee for Idolator was complimentary of the song, describing it as a single which her record label most probably wanted to release from the album in the first place. She went on to say that it is \\"tailor-made\\" for radio airplay \\"right now.\\" Writing for the same publication, Mike Wass wrote that he thought the solo version was better than the alternate version featuring Rich Homie Quan's rap verse, writing \\"It's an improvement on the original. Not that there's anything wrong with the slick Hit-Boy production—I just don't like being distracted from Mimi’s mesmerizing vocals, not even for a verse.\\" Writing for Yahoo! Music, Bill Johnson, Jr. praised Carey for collaborating with Rich Homie Quan and for \\"working with rappers who are on the cusp of going mainstream.\\" He explained that it is her \\"consistency and emphasis\\" on exposing up and coming rappers who are yet to release their own album that allows her to appeal to younger audiences, noting that they both benefit from the exposure. MTV writer Nadeska Alexis commented that it was \\"unexpected\\" to hear a song whereby Carey, Hit-Boy, and Rich Homie Quan featured on the same song, but continued to write that it \\"sounds like a blend of classic Mariah- pop.\\" Slant Magazine's Alexa Camp described the track as a \\"corrective of sorts\\" to her 2012 urban single release \\"Triumphant (Get 'Em)\\", a collaboration with Rick Ross and Meek Mill, noting that \\"Thirsty\\" is not \\"littered\\" with guest features. She continued to write that although it does not possess the memorability of some of her past releases, such as \\"Fantasy\\" or \\"Emotions\\", it serves as \\"a reminder of the pop gold Mimi can mine when she's on top of her game.\\" Gerrick D. Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times was less impressed with \\"Thirsty\\", writing that although the song is not a \\"dud,\\" he believes that Carey deserves better considering that it was her \\"who set the blueprint for mashing ethereal pop-R&B; melodies with speaker-rattling hip-hop beats.\\" He continued to criticize Carey for being too \\"desperate\\", writing: Controversy A couple of days after \\"Thirsty\\" premiered, Los Angeles based pop duo Purple Crush posted a picture on their Instagram account which showed a picture of themselves on the left and a picture of Carey on the right, claiming that the song bares similarities to a single they released of the same name in 2013. Mike Wass from Idolator noted that the only similarity appears to be the name of the song and two words used in the hook. Purple Crush have previously sued Lady Gaga and her manager Rob Fusari for allegedly using their work without the duo's permission for Gaga's debut studio album, The Fame (2008). Live Performances The song was performed on James Corden's late-night show's Carpool Karaoke by Carey and Corden. The song was included on Carey's 2014 tour, The Elusive Chanteuse Show. Charts and commercial performance Upon the release of the album, \\"Thirsty\\" debuted at number 78 on the South Korean International Digital Singles chart, and number 50 on the Download chart, with sales of 3,679 units.

The group became SMFS in 1992, driven by a desire to establish more formal networks for communication, funding, and with a view to producing publications. Since 1999, SFMS has produced Medieval Feminist Forum, a peer-reviewed journal which became an online-only journal in 2009. The organization is affiliated with the MLA and the AHA and has sponsored sessions at annual meetings of these societies. SMFS has also sponsored sessions at other major international conferences, including the International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, the International Medieval Congress at the University of Leeds, the Medieval Academy of America's annual meeting, and the Australia & New Zealand Association for Medieval & Early Modern Studies.

She was the first recipient of the imperial title Padshah Begum, a formal designation of being the first lady of the Mughal court. Maham Begum is also frequently mentioned in the Humayun-nama by her adoptive daughter Gulbadan Begum, who refers to her as \\"lady\\" and \\"my Lady\\" (aka and akam). She was the mother of Babur's eldest surviving son and eventual successor, Humayun. Family and lineage Contemporary records give no specific information regarding Maham Begum's parentage. Babur's autobiography, the Baburnama, makes little mention of their wedding and says nothing about Maham's family. However, there is evidence to suggest that a certain Khwaja Muhammad Ali (referred to as \\"uncle\\" by Gulbadan) was Maham's brother. He appears several times in the Baburnama in association with the city of Khost, i.e being employed in the government of Khost, coming from Khost for orders etc. One of Maham's children was born in the city and Humayun was later recorded as visiting his maternal grandparents in Khost. Historian Annette Beveridge calls this family \\"quiet, unwarlike Khwajas\\". Babur also references a certain Abdul Malik Khosti who may also have been a relation of Maham's, though this is not certain. Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the vizier of her grandson Akbar, states that Maham was from a noble family of Khorasan, descendants of the 11th century Sufi mystic Sheikh Ahmad Jami. This was a lineage that she shared with her daughter-in-law, Hamida Banu Begum. He also mentions that she was a relation of Sultan Husayn Bayqara, the Timurid ruler of Herat. Though the exact relationship is not given, the wording used by Abu'l Fazl (nisbat-i-khwesh) may imply a blood-relation on her father's side. Consequently, Babur's marriage with Maham shortly after Sultan Husayn's death may have been a sign of condolence to her grieving royal relations. There are also hints to further Timurid relationships. Gulbadan, Maham Begum's adopted daughter, states that the empress was related to the owners of the New Year's Garden in Kabul, originally constructed by Ulugh Beg II, a paternal uncle of Babur. In addition, some considerations suggest that Gulbadan's mother, Dildar Agacha Begum, was also a relation of Maham's. Dildar herself is theorised to have been a daughter of another of Babur's uncles, Sultan Mahmud Mirza. Marriage Babur married her in 1506 at Herat, when on the death of Sultan Husayn Mirza, he paid a condolence visit to Herat capital of Khosran. She was mentioned as \\"the one who was to Babur\\" what Aisha was to Muhammad. She played an active role in the political affairs of Babur as well as in the royal household. She had the qualities of extreme intelligence and good looks. She accompanied her husband to Badakhshan and Transoxiana and stood by him through thick and thin. She was the chief lady of the royal household. Upon the birth of the couple's first child, Humayun. Another four children were born to her and unfortunately all died in infancy. They were Barbul, Mihr Jahan, Aisan Daulat and Faruq. As Babur's chief consort, she had well defined rights over other inmates of his harem. She herself took her own guardianship of, two Dildar Begum's children, Hindal Mirza and Gulbadan Begum in 1519 and 1525 respectively and Babur's affirmation of it, though she already possessed five children. A devoted mother, Maham spent all her spare time to educate the prince in values dear to her. She would narrate to him stories connected with her ancestor Shaikh Ahmad Jam and other renowned holy personages of his time. =As Empress= In 1528, Maham Begum came to Hindustan from Kabul. When she reached Aligarh, Babur sent two litters with three horsemen. She went on post haste from Aligarh to Agra. Babur had intended to go as far as Aligarh to meet her. At evening prayer time someone came and said to Babur that he had just passed Maham Begum on the road, four miles out. Babur did not wait for a horse to be saddled but sat out on foot. He met her near the house of Maham's advance camp. She wished to alight, but he would not wait, and fell into her train and walked to his own house. Nine troopers with two sets of nine horses and the two extra litters which the Emperor had sent, and one litter which had been brought from Kabul, and about a hundred of Maham Begum's servants mounted on fine horses. After staying three months at Agra, Maham Begum went to Dholpur with Babur. Maham Begum was the chief queen and the only one, privileged to sit by the side of Babur on the throne of Mughal Empire. She was powerful, moody and spoil and it seems Babur denied her nothing. It is worth of noticing that “Babur speaks of his favorite wife, Maham Begum’s edict as a farman.” During Humayun's illness Babur walked round him and turned his face. He also exclaimed that he loved Humayun because he was the son of his favourite wife, Maham by saying, \\"Although I have other sons, I love none as I love your Humayun. I crave that this cherished child may have his heart's desire and live long, and I desire the kingdom for him and not for the others, because he has not his equal in distinction.\\" As Empress dowager After Humayun was restored to health, Babur became ill and died. Humayun ascended the throne at twenty three-years of age. Maham Begum made an allowance of food twice daily. In the morning an ox and two sheep and five goats, and at afternoon prayer time five goats. She gave this from her own estate during the two and a half years. During Babur's illness, he laid a command on Maham Begum, the charge to arrange marriages of Gulrukh Begum and Gulchehra Begum. Maham Begum received her cleverness of the conspiracy and bade Humayun to return from Badakhshan. She played an important role in promoting successfully the cause of Humayun. She continued to be Padshah Begum and participated in the affairs of the imperial household organization of social functions and the maintenance of her husband's tomb, until her death. After Humayun's return from Chunar, Maham Begam, gave a great feast. They lit up the bazaars. Then she gave orders to the better class and to the soldiers also to decorate their places and make their quarters beautiful, and after this illumination became general in India. With all her stores of replenishing, she made an excellent and splendid feast. She gave special robes of honour to 7,000 persons. The festivities lasted several days. Death In April Maham Begum was attacked by a disorder of the bowels. On the 16th of the same month she died. After the death of Maham, Khanzada Begum, Babar's sister, became the first-lady of the Empire. It is not known where she was buried and which place was chosen to be her tomb by her son Humayun who was then reigning. She seems to have been buried alongside the grave of Babur. It is certain, however, that her body was never transferred to Kabul.

Walker (October 8, 1913 – February 5, 1994) was an American graphic artist, twice named to the 100 Best New Talent List by Art in America. Walker was particularly noted for his mixed media surrealist images, which he called \\"magic realism.\\" Walker was also an influential teacher.Schmitt, Anne (February 9, 1994). Daily Herald. p. 9. His work has been exhibited in America, as well as in Germany and in France. Biography Walker was born in Kirksville, Missouri, to James Franklin Walker Sr. and Mable Azalea Hunt. Walker's father was a landscape artist and an early influence, and his brother is also an artist. Walker's passion for art evolved over his lifetime into a career as artist and teacher. He studied at the University of Iowa in Iowa City receiving a BFA. He then moved to New York City, where he studied at the American Artists School and at the studio of Nahum Tschacbasov. His work was influenced by Tschacbasov's surrealist images. Walker joined the army in 1941, serving in the Aleutian Islands until 1945. During the war, he married Leona Buchanan. They had one child, Joy Walker Hall. After World War II, he returned to the University of Iowa for an MA in art history and an MFA in studio printmaking. At that time, he studied under Mauricio Lasansky, considered \\"one of the fathers of twentieth-century American printmaking.\\" Lasansky had brought his printmaking skills and techniques from Stanley William Hayter's New York Atelier 17 to the University of Iowa School of Art and History (1945–1986). \\"If there is such a thing as a printmaking capital of the U.S., it could well be the Department of Graphic Arts at the State University of Iowa in Iowa City.\\" After an interval teaching art in Kansas, Walker took a teaching position at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1954–1959). While at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Art in America twice named him to the 100 Best New Talent List, 1956 and 1959. Many years later, Santa Fe artist Lorraine Dickinson remembered her time in Walker's drawing and collage classes at the School of the Art Institute. Her work was \\"all in the representational mode,\\" she said. \\"I didn't get into abstract until I studied with James F. Walker in Chicago. He was determined that we were all going to stop painting traditionally. It was like pulling teeth but I finally got it. A few times I tried to revert back to representational, but I get so bored with it.\\" In 1960, Walker accepted a teaching position at Arlington High School and later at Elk Grove High School, both in Northwest Suburban High School District 214. When interviewed by the Arlington High School newspaper, The Cardinal, Walker explained his philosophy of education: \\"The art department isn't run especially for the talented student, but rather to enrich the cultural background for all students.\\"The Cardinal. October 21, 1960 He retired from teaching in 1975 and moved with his family to Gravette, Arkansas, where he continued to work as an artist until his death in 1994. Richard Calisch, division head of English and Fine Arts at Elk Grove High School said, \\"[Walker] was that special combination who had his own career and was also a fine teacher. The kids loved him.\\" Work Walker's work builds on the legacy of his teacher, Mauricio Lasansky. Walker combines a spectrum of Lasansky's graphic techniques, including collage, monoprints, aquatint, pencil, brush, rubbings, etchings, and silkscreen. All combinations of these techniques appear in Walker's work. In a statement to the Chicago Society of Artists, Walker described his own work: > My paintings project my intense concern for, and interest in, the nature of > texture surfaces within the context of meticulously rendered forms, > revealing the essence of Magic Realism, a microscopic view of every > infinitesimal area upon the canvas. As he said to a reporter from Algonquin Life, an Algonquin, Illinois, community newspaper, > A good artist paints what he sees, lives, thinks, and feels, although his > finished product may not have the slightest congruency to what the ordinary > person visualizes. In other words, he doesn't invent pictures—he portrays > impressions—again, by what he sees, how he thinks, how he feels. The mistake > that a young art student continues to make is this example: the country boy > treks to the big city to attend art school. He decides that now he must > paint with sophistication—rejecting all of his past association with country > life, the hills, the trees, the farm animals, etc. This is a mistake. =Walker's L.H. Double O.Q.= Walker's painting L.H. Double O.Q. stirred controversy. Walker is perhaps best known for L.H.

Double O.Q. won the Award for Collage, Casein, and Drawing in the 1964 Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago and Vicinity Show. It is a satirical image of one of America's greatest heroes. His painting is a reference to Marcel Duchamp's 1919 painting L.H.O.O.Q. In this work, Duchamp simply painted a mustache and beard onto a postcard reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Walker went further. Walker's painting—probably his most famous and controversial work—caused a media stir. It was a satirical portrait of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in drag with a Mona Lisa smile. > The big hit or most popular outrage, if you prefer—at this year's exhibit is > a picture starkly titled, L.H. Double O.Q. It has the smiling face of > President Eisenhower in a Mona Lisa pose, complete with headdress. A pair of > false teeth floats in the sky. Somebody's antique hands—not Ike's—are in > repose. A standalone photo in the Chicago Daily Defender called it \\"a 'kooky' portrait of Dwight D. Eisenhower in a Mona Lisa pose…\\"Chicago Daily Defender (May 4, 1964). p. 12. According to a caption from UPI Telephotos, Walker \\"titled it L.H. Double O.Q. for what was 'no special reason at all.'\\" Wide World Photos and UPI Telephotos broadcast photos of L.H. Double O.Q. to the world. Opinions on the piece fell roughly into two categories: \\"I like Ike,\\" or \\"I don't like Ike.\\" From the critics \\"I found James Walker's collage, Creation of Eve, particularly good with its curious integration of old objects and new movement.\\" Collections Walker's works are included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Kansas Friends of Art, University of Iowa, and numerous private collections. Three pieces by Walker are in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago: Pygmalion (1950), Birds in a Landscape (1952), and Landscape (1961).

It was formed by then Minister of Munitions Winston Churchill to produce mustard gas during World War I. After World War I, it was bought by private business interests. From 1929 it became part of Australia's Imperial Smelting Corporation. A.E. Higgs Esq. became the Director of the National Smelting Co. in 1948. The site – also known as the Britannia smelting works – was where the Imperial Smelting Process was developed. From 1967, the Avonmouth Works was home to the largest and most efficient zinc blast furnace in the world. The site remained operational until 2003 when the production of Zinc, Cadmium, Lead and sulphuric acid ceased. The site is being redeveloped as a supermarket distribution centre for Asda, and a recycling plant for SITA UK. Background During the later part of World War I, it was proposed to make Avonmouth Docks the UK centre of production of dichloroethyl sulphide, also known as mustard gas. However, its production was against the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which explicitly forbade the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare. Hence covered by the Official Secrets Act, as a cover the Ministry of Munitions under its then Minister Winston Churchill nationalised many small smelting works under the new National Smelting Company (NSC). Before the outbreak of World War I, much of Britain's zinc had originated in Australia, but had been smelted in Germany. The NSC was hence publicly commissioned to build a new zinc smelting works and sulphuric acid plant at Merebank, Avonmouth Docks. Mustard gas Having already built the nearby No.23 filling factory at Chittening, operated by Nobel Explosives, shells there were already being filled with chloropicrin. Construction of the chemical plant began in 1917, but did not finish until 1923, costing £800,000. The plant came into operation from Spring 1918, producing of dichloroethyl sulphide using the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process per day. The chemical product was than shipped to the main filling factory production site at Banbury, plus secondary sites at Chittening and Hereford. Although the first shells did not arrive in France until September 1918, two months before The Armistice, it was used that same month during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line within the Hundred Days' Offensive. By November 1918, Chittening had produced 85,424 mustard gas shells. The human cost of producing mustard gas was high. In December 1918 the chemical plant's medical officer reported that in the six months it was operational, there were 1,400 illnesses reported by its 1,100 mostly female workers – all medically attributable to their work. Three people died because of accidents, four died from associated illnesses, and there were 160 accidents resulting in over 1,000 burns. At Chittening there were reported 1,213 cases of associated illness, including two deaths which were later attributed to influenza. Operational history After World War I, demand for zinc and sulphuric acid greatly fell, and after running into commercial difficulties it was taken over by a group of British industrialists with interests in metals and chemicals, who succeeded in reviving its business under the name Commonwealth Smelting Company. In 1929 the NSC was bought by Australia's Imperial Smelting Corporation, which in 1949 merged with Zinc Corporation to become Consolidated Zinc. Throughout the consolidation, the smaller NSC plants were closed down to concentrate production on Avonmouth – now known as the Britannia smelting works – where the Imperial Smelting Process was developed. From 1967, the Avonmouth Works was home to the largest and most efficient zinc blast furnace in the world. Consolidated Zinc, having failed to develop suitable new mining projects, merged from 1962 with the Rio Tinto Company, a mining company. The resulting company, known as The Rio Tinto – Zinc Corporation (RTZ), and its main subsidiary, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia (CRA), would eventually become today's Rio Tinto Group. With smelting cheaper elsewhere in the world, the site ceased production in the 1990s, but remained open as a stock-holding and distribution centre until 2003. Plants and support services in operation during the late 1960s include: 12\\\\. The Sulfuric Acid Plant 3\\\\. The Vertical Retort Plant – a zinc plant 4\\\\. The Sinter Plant 5\\\\.

Redevelopment In 2012 SITA UK started redevelopment of the site, but after construction workers were affected by mustard-gas type symptoms, the Ministry of Defence were called in to test and approve the site. However, after MoD approval, a few months later construction workers found a mustard gas shell, which was disposed of by the 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC at Porton Down. The site was closed off for a year while experts from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory conducted a series of tests. In late 2013 MoD clearance was given, allowing the site to be redeveloped as a supermarket distribution centre for Asda, and a recycling plant for SITA UK.

The film premiered on 17 May 2014, as part of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film follows the mixed-breed dog Hagen, who befriends 13-year old Lili and comforts her in her confusion as she goes to live with her strict, estranged father, who has not seen Lili since she was a small child. Because Hagen is a mixed-breed, he is subject to a large \\"mongrel\\" fee imposed by the Hungarian government, which Lili's father is unwilling to pay, offering instead to buy Lili a purebred dog if only she will get rid of Hagen. Lili is angry that her father thinks Hagen can be so easily replaced, and the incident underscores the lack of understanding between father and daughter. Fearful that her father will get rid of Hagen while she is away, Lili takes the dog to her music class, where his appearance causes chaos. The teacher threatens to kick Lili out of music class unless she takes the dog outside and remains in the class. Instead, Lili strikes out with Hagen into the city, but they are found by her father, who left work to look for them after the music teacher phoned him. Lili's father is embarrassed by the incident, and in his anger, he drives Hagen to the outskirts of the city and abandons him on the side of the road. Hagen chases after their car but is unable to follow them. Hagen begins a lonely journey wandering the city. He eventually befriends a white dog after it saves him from an angry butcher. After spending the night with other street dogs, a dog catcher pursues Hagen and the other street dogs. After a long chase, Hagen avoids the dog catchers with the help of a homeless man. However, the man sells Hagen to a dog fighting ring, where he is chained, starved, and trained to kill. In his first fight, he kills his opponent and escapes. He is caught by animal control officers and brought to the city dog pound. Meanwhile Lili, still angry with her father and upset by the loss of Hagen, goes to a party where she drinks alcohol. The party is raided by the police, and Lili is taken to the station and her father called. Arriving to pick her up, her father breaks into tears and admits that he was wrong to get rid of Hagen and that while he does not understand the now-teenage Lili, he still loves her. The two reconcile and her father, in a gesture of getting reacquainted with his daughter, promises to attend her upcoming concert. On the other side of the city, Hagen escapes from the pound after killing one of the staff. He breaks open the cages and frees the other dogs, who follow him into the city. With Hagen as their leader, the dogs start an uprising against their human oppressors, wreaking mayhem as Hagen locates and kills all the people who harmed him. The pack reaches the concert hall where Lili is playing, and the concert-goers barricade themselves within for safety. Spotting Hagen, Lili sneaks out of the concert hall and follows the dog pack on her bicycle. Followed by his army, Hagen goes to the slaughterhouse where Lili's father works, where they appear on the verge of taking revenge on him when Lili arrives. At first, Hagen growls at Lili and has his army behind and around him. Her father rushes from the building armed with a blowtorch to defend his daughter, but instead, Lili plays Franz Liszt's \\"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\\" on her trumpet. Hagen seems to forgive her and lies down to listen. All the other dogs lie down in a gesture of reconciliation as Lili sits in their midst and continues to play. She then lies down facing Hagen. Her father, stunned at the scene, puts down his weapon and goes to lie down beside his daughter.

With the exception of Bodie and Luke (the pair of brother dogs that portray Hagen), all the animals extras were dogs recruited from shelters or from the streets of the location shooting and trained with an eye toward their humane treatment and ultimate rehabilitation by Teresa Anne Miller, daughter of Hollywood animal trainer Karl Lee Miller whose work with animals includes films such as Babe and Cujo. Approximately 98% of the dogs were adopted after filming. Representatives for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals were invited to make a statement on the animals' treatment during filming, but declined, stating that \\"We appreciated that they seemed to take some extra steps along the way so the dogs were comfortable and not hurt... but we cannot endorse a film without having visited the set.\\" Reception =Critical reception= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 101 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"White God isn't an easy watch, but its soaring ambition and powerful acting — human and canine alike — make it well worth the effort.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 80 out of 100 from 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Awards and nominations= White God won the Prize Un Certain Regard at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the Octopus d'Or at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival for the Best International Feature Film. The dogs in the film were also awarded with the Palm Dog Award. The film was selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.
