The school was built in 1835, and continues to exhibit Greek Revival characteristics despite alterations in 1873 and 1951. It was used as a school until 1950, has hosted town meetings, and has served as the local library. It is presently home to the local historical society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Madison District No. 1 School is located in the village center of Madison, on the north side of NH 113, just west of the Madison Elementary School. It is a single-story wood frame structure with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. The building corners have simple pilasters, rising to entablatures running along the building sides. Its main facade faces south, and has two symmetrically placed entrances, each framed by simple moulding and topped by four-light transom windows. The interior has two small vestibules, which open into the single classroom. The walls are finished in painted wood. The school was built in 1835, and was originally located about west of the present location. In early decades it was a frequent site of town meetings, owing to its central location. It was moved near its present location in 1873, at which time its window arrangements were altered to improve interior lighting. The building was converted for use as the town library in 1951, and was moved to its present location in 1980 to make way for an addition to the adjacent school building (now the Madison Elementary School). The building is now maintained by the local historical society.

She has been hailed by NPR for possessing an ‚Äúamazing dexterity with musical languages‚Äù.  Early years  Shah's family is of Gujarati origin, and her parents are originally from Mumbai, India.http://theindianeye.net/indian-americans-win-herb-alpert- jazz-award/ Raised in Manhattan, Shah began her musical training in classical piano at age 5. She spent her formative years performing regularly at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center as a member of the prestigious Young People's Chorus of New York City, with whom she trained in styles ranging from opera to gospel to folk music in more than 20 languages. She traces her commitment to jazz to the childhood influence of uptown saxophonist Patience Higgins, a former neighbor whose band she would later join at Harlem venues including like Minton's and the Lenox Lounge. Shah attended New York City public schools, and became fluent in Spanish at the age of 16 after living with a host family in Ecuador. She went on to major in Latin American Studies at Harvard College, where she also studied Yor√πb√° and became fluent in Portuguese and French. During her undergraduate years, Shah lived abroad in Per√∫, China, and Brazil, where she conducted fieldwork on Afro-Brazilian music and politics; her honors thesis \\"Experiments with Transnationalism: Constructing Diaspora in the bloco- afro Mal√™ Debal√™‚Äù was awarded the Kenneth D. Maxwell Thesis Prize in Brazilian Studies and the Cultural Agents Thesis Prize. While at Harvard, she also received the Cec√≠lia Meireles Prize and the David McCord Prize. After college, Shah briefly worked at The Nation magazine and Human Rights Watch, before a chance meeting with NEA Jazz Master Sheila Jordan on the New York City Subway would steer her toward a career in music. She earned a Master's in Jazz Voice from Manhattan School of Music, where she studied with Theo Bleckmann, Peter Eldridge, Steve Wilson, and Jim McNeely.  Music  Shah has performed at venues and events including the Kennedy Center, Art Basel: Miami, Rochester Jazz Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival, Melbourne Jazz Festival, Park Avenue Armory, Blue Note, Joe's Pub, Blue Whale, Vermont Jazz Center, Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Rubin Museum of Art, and Copenhagen Jazz Festival. She has worked with Lionel Loueke, Sheila Jordan, Martial Solal, Fran√ßois Moutin, Greg Osby, Steve Wilson, Alune Wade (Senegal), and Mulatu Astatke. She was named ‚ÄúBest Graduate Jazz Vocalist‚Äù by Downbeat in 2012 and won the ASCAP Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composers Award in 2013. Shah's 2014 debut album, Visions, was produced by Benin-born jazz guitarist Lionel Loueke, and released on saxophonist Greg Osby's record label Inner Circle Music. \\"Visions\\" integrates a jazz quintet with the West African kora and Indian tabla, and includes special guests Loueke (guitar, vocals), Steve Wilson (saxophone, flute), and Rogerio Boccato (percussion). In 2017, Shah premiered the contemporary work \\"Folk Songs of Nabor√©a: a song-cycle for seven voices‚Äù at the Park Avenue Armory. The concert was named by NPR critic Nate Chinen as one of the Top 10 Performances of the year. In 2018, Shah released Interplay, a bass-and-voice duo album co-led by Fran√ßois Moutin, on Dot Time Records. The album features standards and originals, and includes improvisation; Moutin and Shah are joined on two tracks by pianist Martial Solal and vocalist Sheila Jordan. The DownBeat review of the release commented on \\"Moutin's dark, reedy bass acting like a dance partner to Shah's pliant, flickering vocals, which retain a tonal richness even through passages of extreme agility.\\" Jazz Times also described the album as \\"a stellar rapport\\" between the duo who \\"are fearless in their interpretations\\".

In October 2014, The Times newspaper reported that Charalambous falsely claimed to hold a \\"PhD in the parallels between Plato‚Äôs Utopia and Spartan Society\\" on his Facebook page as well as claiming to be a \\"professor of environmental sciences\\" on his official website. It was also reported that shortly after the revelations, claims that Charalambous was a qualified Barrister-at-Law were removed from his official website. In response, Charalambous made a statement via his official website, refuting claims made in The Times' article and displaying his academic certificates. These included a Doctorate of Business Administration certificate from the University of Northern Virginia, which lost accreditation after Charalambous had completed his studies there.  Career  Appointed Work and Pensions Spokesman for the United Kingdom Independence Party in 2016. Leader Paul Nuttall said ‚ÄúBy promoting Andrew Charalambous to the role of Work and Pensions I am happy to bring forward someone with the keen intelligence and application that the role requires. ‚ÄúHis track record in his previous brief, Housing shows how he can not only get under the skin of the brief, but he can also take expert opinion in the field with him. Time and again his policies have been co-opted by other parties, we expect no less going forward\\". As UKIP Work and Pensions Spokesman, he has called for action to end the north-south divide, and for government to extend its employment drive to parts of the UK which have never recovered the loss of their manufacturing base. Charalambous made a career in business as a property developer and private landlord. The Daily Telegraph newspaper poked fun at him for falling out with his bank for allegedly taking homeless people off the streets of Covent Garden in London and putting them in his properties. It was also pointed out in the Sunday Mirror that housing in his property portfolio had been rented out to immigrant tenants, despite the fact that UKIP leader Nigel Farage was calling for greater controls on immigration. Following Freedom of Information requests in 2015, Charalambous was shown to be among the biggest landlord recipients of housing benefit, having received ¬£826,395 in the last tax year. = Political activities = In the 1992 general election, Charalambous stood for the Conservatives in Tottenham as the youngest candidate of any main party in the General Election. Charalambous had been a member of and financial donor to the Conservative Party and was a founder of Conservative Friends of Cyprus and the Conservative Climate Campaign. He stood twice for the Conservative Party as a parliamentary candidate in local elections and twice in general elections; his most recent attempt was in Edmonton in 2010, where he came second. In early 2011, Charalambous switched from the Conservative Party to UKIP on the basis that the Conservative coalition government had failed to deliver on the UK-EU referendum, had not taken a sufficiently strong stand on immigration, and was cutting healthcare services. He is currently UKIP's housing spokesperson. In 2011, he represented UKIP in the Feltham and Heston by-election, where he came fourth. In the 2015 post election challenge to Nigel Farage's leadership of the party, Charalambous emerged as a Farage loyalist.Andrew Charalambous tweet 15th May 2015Andrew Charalambous tweet 16th May 2015 Charalambous was UKIP's first ever Housing and Environment Spokesman. He is now currently their Work and Pensions Spokesman. = Environmental efforts = Also known as 'Dr Earth', Charalambous opened a nightclub in 2008 called Surya, styled as the 'world's first ever ecological club'. One of the main features was a piezoelectric dance floor that attempted to harness energy through human movement. The Economist noted that despite Surya's claims, a Dutch company \\"unveiled plans for a disco with a piezoelectric dancefloor, waterless urinals and bio-beer back in 2006\\". Charalambous also launched Club4Climate, an 'eco- night' initiative designed to get young people involved in tackling environmental issues. Club4Climate was criticised by Friends of the Earth over an event it promoted in Ibiza; Friends of the Earth stated: \\"Telling people they can save the world by flying to an island to party is a green con. Club4Climate is misleading people by using our logo and our name...\\" Charalambous responded: \\"Our philosophy is about millions of people making a small change to their lifestyles. You aren't going to save the planet by telling them to ride bikes...\\"  References  Category:Living people Category:Environmental bloggers Category:UK Independence Party parliamentary candidates Category:Conservative Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:British people of Greek Cypriot descent Category:British real estate businesspeople Category:1967 births ","title":"Andrew Charalambous"},{"id":"42822691","text":"Lori L.

It was built on a plateau above the Jhelum River. It was built by Lalitaditya Muktapida (695‚Äì731) and served as the capital of Kashmir during his reign. Name The present name of the place, Paraspore, is a variation of the original Sanskrit name of the city, Parihaspur, which loosely translated would mean a city of laughs or a smiling city. \\"Parihas\\" means laughter and \\"pur\\" means city.  History Parihaspur Stupa The Sultanganj Buddha, India's only surviving post- Gupta monumental bronze a fraction of the size of Parihasapur Buddha It was built by Lalitaditya Muktapida (695‚Äì731) of the Karkota dynasty. He moved his capital from Srinagar to Parihaspur. Kalhana mentions the construction of the city in his Book 4 cantos 194‚Äì204. Lalitaditya according to Kalhana built his residence and four temples in this area. The temples included one for Vishnu (Muktakeshva) where according to Kalhana the emperor used 84,000 tolas of gold to make the image of Vishnu. In another temple he used as many Palas of silver for the image of Parihaskesana. He also had made a statue of Buddha in copper that according to Kalhana \\"reached up to the sky.\\" The main temple was larger than the famous temple that Lalitaditya built in Martand. online version of Kalhana's Rajatarangini in English Parihaspur lost its status as a capital after Lalitaditya's death. His son moved the royal residence. The Jhelum River is to the northeast of Parihaspur as it meets the Sind Nallah at Shadpur sangam. In the past this confluence of the rivers occurred closer to Parihaspur. The change in the course of the river is not natural but was engineered by famous Soya Pandit during Raja Avanti Varman's time (855‚Äì883 AD). With the river access gone, the city suffered greatly. The real destruction occurred when Avanti Varman's son Shankar Varman moved his capital to the new city of Shankarpur. According to Kalhana he cannibalized all the \\"good material\\" from these temples and palaces to build his city of Shankarpur (Pattan). Parihaspur however survived the pillage because Kalhana mentions that during the war between King Harsha and Uccala (1089‚Äì1101 AD), Uccala took refuge in Parihaspur. King Harsha believing that Uccala was in one of the buildings set the place on fire. He broke and melted down the statues of Parihaspur. The final blow to the temples came when Sultan Sikandar destroyed them completely in the fourteenth century.Peer Hassan Khoihami Tarikh-i- Kashmir Srinagar, 1960Cunningham A. Ancient Geography Of India Delhi-1969 Present ruins Only ruins in the form of large boulders, some ornately carved, and in situ carved footings are left of the old city now, and the place is commonly known as \\"Kani Shahar\\" (City of Stones) to local residents. Some of the finest examples of the carved figures of seated and standing atlantes have been taken to the Srinagar Museum. M.A.Stein first visited the place in 1892 and was able to place each of these constructions based on ruins that he found at that time. Stein also thinks that the village Gurdan near Parihaspur comes from Govardhana. Govardhana dhara is one of the names of God Vishnu. He visited the place again in 1892 and found that many stones that he had seen in 1892 were gone. Apparently Maharaja of Kashmir was building the Jhelum cart road and using the Parihaspur ruins as road material. Stein approached the British resident at that time for help. He was able to convince the Dogra king to stop further desecration of the historic temple ruins.

The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Praveen Lakkaraju. The movie was remade in Kannada as Kathe Chitrakathe Nirdeshana Puttanna. Plot Srinivas alias. Sreenu is a wannabe film director who wants to get a Nandi award for a story he has. He faces many ridicules from different producers, including one (Raghu Babu) who tries to make him adulterate the story and another lady (Jhansi) who tells that everybody in her family and outside including cooks and cleaners have to like the story if she has to produce it. He meets a businessman, Ramesh Rao (Rao Ramesh) with whom at first he has a fight for being late for an appointment, but eventually gets along with. He narrates the story to him. Rao also wants to do a film which will get a Nandi award as he wants to dedicate it to his father. In the opening scene in an apartment in Hyderabad, a girl commits suicide. The case appears to be serious and it is being investigated by inspector Shravan (Shravan) who at first suspects the security, who was the first one to find about the suicide. The next day, the owner of the house (Ali) comes with a babaji who takes the spirit of the girl into a lemon but dies in a car accident on the way back. Then Sreenu tells Ramesh Rao about 3 months later. He also tells Ramesh Rao to imagine himself (Sreenu) in place of the hero. In a bus from Vijayawada to Hyderabad, The hero (Sreenu as imagined) meets a girl Anjali (Anjali) on the bus. The both of them become friends during the journey but the next morning, Anjali leaves without Sreenu knowing. After getting down the bus, Sreenu goes to his friend Madhunandan (Madhunandan), and now it is revealed that he had actually come to Hyderabad to meet producer Dil Raju and narrate to him a story he wrote. A house broker (Prudhviraj) gets them a house in the same flat where the suicide took place. After a lot of persuasion, Sreenu agrees to stay there. There he meets Athreya and Arudra (Satyam Rajesh and Shankar) who claim themselves to be assistants of Dil Raju although they are not and began to stay with Sreenu and Madhu. That night, the girl in the bus, Anjali comes there as she thought her friends who used to stay there were still there. Sreenu manages to persuade her to come in with a cup of coffee as coffee is her weakness. Soon she becomes a regular guest at the house. One day, two policemen come there and give Sreenu a bundle and tell him to put it in the prohibited room which belongs to the owners of the flat. When he keeps them inside, he sees a picture of Anjali in the room. Sreenu asks Venkatesh (Harshavardhan), the watchman about the photo and he tells Sreenu that it is a photo of the girl who committed suicide. Sreenu, Athreya and Arudra get frightened out of their wits when Venkatesh tells them that he hasn't seen any girl enter the apartment at night time since a week. That night, The doorbell rings again but Sreenu does not open the door. Then next morning, he packs everything that belonged to him and runs away from the apartment. It is now revealed that whatever Sreenu told Ramesh Rao till now is his real-life story. Sreenu tells Rao that he just wanted to tell the story to somebody and he doesn't want to actually make it a movie. And saying so, he leaves from there. On the way back, Sreenu encounters a friend of Anjali whose photo he had seen in the room. When he inquires with the girl, he finds out that Anjali had a boyfriend, Madhunandan who was in jail as people believed him to be the reason Anjali committed suicide. At first, Sreenu thinks it is his friend, Madhu but later finds out it is not. Madhu takes Sreenu, Athreya and Arudra to his uncle Shaitan Raj (Brahmanandam), a psychiatrist. Raj helps the three of them and they find out it is just a man (Saptagiri) who has been hiding there as he thought he will get a free house if they also run away. The 4 of them encourage the man to work for a living. That night, Anjali comes there to tell them the truth. She reveals to them that her name is Ushanjali and the one who died is her twin sister, Geethanjali. Geethanjali was in love with Madhu, but her boss, who is surprisingly Ramesh Rao, rapes her after she disagrees to marry him. She commits suicide after he comes out and, Rao interprets as if she hanged herself to the fan, and has Madhu blamed for the death. The gang decide to take revenge on Rao. Sreenu tells Rao that he went back to the flat and the girl's spirit was coming that night to tell him who killed her. Ramesh Rao tells Sreenu he too will come along and hear the spirit. Sreenu and the gang send Ushanjali to Shaitan Raj to take training of the language and body language of devils so that she can act as Geethanjali. That night, at Sreenu's house, Ramesh Rao reveals he knows everything and that the spirit who has come now is not Geethanjali but Ushanjali. In a fit of rage, Ushanjali kills Ramesh Rao by beating him to death and then goes away. Just after she leaves, She comes back in again and tells them sorry for being late and that she is ready. It is now revealed that Ushanjali got locked inside her house after her door got jammed and that the one who came was the real Geethanjali (who escaped from the lemon after it broke open). The ending scene shows all of them together celebrating Geethanjali's boyfriend, Madhunandan's birthday and after that a song.

The film released on 10 April 2015. Audio of the movie released on 21 March 2015. Puneeth Rajkumar played a double role in this film, though both the roles never appear together onscreen. Plot The film starts with a flashback to the old days, where a Britisher commander is torturing a defiant Kannadiga. He then cuts the throat of the officer. The film starts with a reporter being killed in a place called Vikramatheertha, not on Karnataka map. She had earlier sent a letter to Home minister K.V. Anand Rao (Girish Karnad). When she later disappears, Rao asks the Police commissioner to send a newer recruit, a rough and ready police man, to investigate. Vikram (Puneeth Rajkumar) aspires to become a policeman, but fails as he refuses to give bribe. Through his fianc√©e Paaru (Adah Sharma) he meets the Home minister, who assigns him the mission. Vikram goes to Vikramatheertha, in Maharashtra, and finds out that the people are enslaved by Patil to illegally export soil to an unknown buyer. After being insulted, he beats up Patil and his henchmen and sends him into coma. Meanwhile, Patil's brother Kulkarni, an MLA, hears of his brother's injury and sends goons against Vikram, who are beaten up. When Kulkarni finds out he swears revenge against whoever did this. Vikram then frees and organizes the people to order the area, and goes to change the border between the states. On the way he beats up some of Kulkarni's goondas right in front of him. Vikram reports to Rao with his findings, including old Halegannada inscriptions, the people speak Kannada, and especially that Kulkarni is involved. Kulkarni fears his loss of power as a Minister and MLA and wants to kill Vikram. To this end he has a priest conduct rituals, but later kills him. In the meantime Vikram and the people excavate Vikramateertha and find many artifacts that they restore to their former glory, pictures of which are sent to Rao. Meanwhile, Rao tells Vikram the Centre has given approval for the site to be developed. Vikram requests he come to annex the site on Kannada Rajyotsava to show all of Karnataka their heritage. Meanwhile, Johnson (Vikram Singh), the descendant of the dead commander, calls Kulkarni, who is helping Johnson smuggle sand, to ensure everything is OK. He signs a contract for ¬£10 billion and will give Kulkarni ‚Çπ100 crore in exchange for triple the soil. Rao tells the world about Vikram's exploits and Vikramateertha's belonging to Karnataka. Johnson and Kulkarni see the news, Kulkarni tells Johnson all about Vikram and begs him to come there. The day of Kannada Rajyotsava, the people are very patriotic towards their mother tongue. At the same time as Rao is talking about Vikramateertha belonging to Karnataka, his grandmother Gowri wakes up from her long inactivity and flashes back to 1947. At that time as well, Johnson bombs the site killing many people. At that time, Vikramateertha was a thriving village with a famous Shiva temple. Gowri (Anjali), the daughter of the village headman is in love with village hero Rana Vikrama (Puneeth Rajkumar), and they are married with great pomp. Meanwhile, the area is under the control of Viceroy Louis Batten (Vikram Singh), who is only interested in gaining profits. One of his scientists finds much uranium in the soil. Afterwards one of the British collaborators tells the villagers they must vacate the village, but they refuse, at which point the British officer kills the headman with gun. Batten then sends in a large army to forcibly evict or kill the villagers. The villagers fight back with stones and their bare hands but the guns and cannons of the enemy force them back. Vikrama tells his wife and others to flee and returns to fight with the former lover of Gowri. However he is betrayed by his partner and given over to Batten. Batten tortures him mortally, but he slashes the throat of the evil Britisher before his death. Johnson bombs the site, causing death among the people. Vikram convinces Rao of the need to kill Johnson for the safety of the country and state, to prevent the uranium from getting into the hands of terrorists. Vikram goes to find and kill Johnson with a crack team, but Johnson escapes and has Vikram's own team try and kill him. After dispatching them, Vikram goes to the sand mine where Johnson is supervising the loading of the uranium and chases him along a train. After a fight, Vikram is stabbed in the stomach, but then kills Johnson, asking him for how many years did he exploit the people. Afterwards Vikram is promoted to ACP by Minister Rao, to the happiness of his ajji, amma, appa, and Paaru.

The law also requires covered offenders to notify law enforcement 21 days before traveling abroad. Critics have claimed violation of constitutional rights and note that the law would also cover those who were convicted as minors. HR 515 passed both chambers of the 114th United States Congress on February 2, 2016, and was signed into law by President Obama on February 8, 2016 (). Originally introduced during the 113th Congress as the International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (), which would require the notification of foreign governments when a citizen of United States registered as a sex offender for sexual offense involving a minor is going to be traveling to their country, the original bill passed the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress but died in the Senate. The provisions of the law took effect on October 31, 2017. On that date, the State Department began marking affected passports with the following sentence: \\"The bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor, and is a covered sex offender pursuant to 22 United States Code Section 212b(c)(l).\\" Because the message is too long to fit on the smaller passport card, the law also means that sex offenders can only apply for and carry the more detailed, and more expensive, passport book. Background \\"Megan's Law\\" is an informal name for laws in the United States requiring law enforcement authorities to make information available to the public regarding registered sex offenders, which was created in response to the 1994 murder of Megan Kanka in New Jersey.McLarin, Kimberly J. \\"Trenton Races To Pass Bills On Sex Abuse\\", The New York Times, August 20, 1994. Accessed June 8, 2010. Individual states decide what information will be made available and how it should be disseminated. Commonly included information is the offender's name, picture, address, incarceration date, and nature of crime. The information is often displayed on free public websites, but can be published in newspapers, distributed in pamphlets, or through various other means. Provisions The law requires notice be given to other countries, through Operation Angel Watch, when registered American sex offenders travel to their countries. The United States Secretary of State would also be allowed to limit or place restrictions on the travel of convicted sex criminals. Finally, the bill would ask the President of the United States to work out reciprocal deals with other countries so that the United States would be informed when foreign sex criminals tried to travel to the United States. Procedural history On May 6, 2014, during the 113th United States Congress, the \\"International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking\\" was introduced into the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R, NJ-4). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. On May 20, 2014, the House considered the bill under a suspension of the rules and voted to pass the amended version in a voice vote. The Senate took no further action. The re- introduced bill was passed by the Senate in December 2015, during the 114th United States Congress, with an amendment regarding appropriations for enforcement. The bill passed Congress in early February, and was signed by the President on February 8, 2016. Debate and discussion Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), who supported the bill, said about this and other human trafficking bills that were also passed on May 20, 2014, that \\"no single law will put an end to sex tourism or child sex trafficking, but every step we take strengthens our ability to prevent these crimes\\". According to Rep. Bill Flores (R-TX), the bill would enable the United States \\"to notify destination countries that a sex offender who has previously abused a child is traveling to that country and encourage reciprocal notification to protect American children from abuse by foreign sex workers\\". Chrysanthi Leon, associate professor of sociology and criminal justice and women and gender studies at the University of Delaware, argues that registrants are generally not the ones who will commit new sex crimes and that the U.S. Marshals Service already notifies receiving countries of registered sex offender travel. She says that the restrictions imposed by the law might harm family members of registrants who would face much of the same restrictions, and who are also often the victims, since much sex offenses occur within families. She says the law could, for example, prevent registrants from attending a family member's wedding in another country. After HR 515 passed the Congress, in February 2016, editorial boards of Los Angeles Times and Monterey Herald, and Lenore Skenazy of Free-range kids urged President Obama to veto the bill. The Volokh Conspiracy likened the \\"unique identifier\\" to be placed on sex offenders passports to the letter \\"J\\" stamped on passports of Jews in Germany in 1938. California Reform Sex Offender Laws filed a lawsuit challenging the law in U.S. District Court in San Francisco shortly after HR 515 was signed into a law by President Obama. They say the law will include those convicted of misdemeanors such as \\"sexting\\" or public urination to be identified as a sex offender on their passports. The lawsuit says that \\"a passport symbol that identifies an individual as a registered sex offender could place at significant risk that person as well as others traveling with them, including family members and business colleagues\\". The lawsuit The lawsuit was dismissed by a San Francisco federal District Judge on the grounds that it was filed prematurely and did not cite any valid constitutional claims.Sullum, J.

Presenting himself as a father-figure to the Emperor, Honest secretly poisoned the previous emperor and his wife to manipulate their child to his end while having political rivals and other threats killed off. Honest's selfish outlook is depraved to the point that he mourned Syura's death for a few seconds before callously shrugging off his son's demise and considering birthing a more competent son. When the Revolutionary Army begins their attack on the capital, having killed off a majority of the court when they planned to hand him over to the revolutionists, Honest convinces the Emperor to activate the Ultimate Imperial Arm Shikoutazer.

However, after Tatsumi's escape, Esdeath accepts her love for Tatsumi as one-sided while resolving to fight him to the death during the Revolutionary Army's siege on the Imperial capital. While Tatsumi deals with the Shikoutazer, Esdeath battles Akame and ends up amputating her own arm when it was exposed to Murasame's poison. After the Shikotazer's defeat, refusing to surrender even after the Empire fell, Esdeath attempts to use her Imperial Arm's full potential to freeze everything around her before being killed when Akame activates Murasame's Trump Card. Esdeath uses the last ounce of strength to freeze herself while her final thoughts were of regret over Tatsumi never returning her feelings for him.

She joins the Jaegers and is the first person Wave meets.

His Teigu, , is a pair of plates on his back that allow him to grow wings and attack using feathers as projectiles; its Trump Card is the ability to reflect any attack using the wings as barriers. Run eventually confronts Champ with Wave and Kurome, but suffers fatal wounds after more Wild Hunt members are involved.

Bolic uses his position and drugs to discreetly control the Path's members, turning them into his playthings. Esdeath, the Jaegers and the Four Rakshasa Demons were ordered to protect him, which resulted in intense battles when Night Raid came to kill him. These battle results in the deaths of Seryu and Susanoo. He is easily killed by Akame while Esdeath is occupied by Leone, Susanoo, Najenda and Tatsumi. =Holimaca= : is Bolic's bodyguard who wields a lost Teigu that had been recovered. The Teigu is , a scythe with unknown capabilities; even he himself does not fully know its capabilities. Akame was able to kill him so quickly that she never realized his weapon was a Teigu. =Four Rakshasa Demons of the Imperial Fist Temple= were four skilled soldiers in Honest's employ. All four were highly trained and able to manipulate their own bodies, with abilities such as extending their limbs, hardening their bodies, and contorting them out of harm's way, as well as possessing great combat abilities.

After surviving her battle with Tatsumi during Night Raid's mission to assassinate Bolic, Suzuka provided the Empire information on his ties to Night Raid while assigned to Wild Hunt to replace Champ and Enshin. Soon after, Esdeath nearly disfigures her, which in turn incites Suzuka's lustful obsession with Esdeath. Suzuka was placed under Esdeath's command during the siege of the Capital. In the end, Suzuka survived and left the Capital with Esdeath's severed hand. :Profile: :*Zodiac Sign: Leo :*Blood type: O =Budo= : was a Commander-in-chief of the Empire. He is regarded as stubborn and is known for speaking boldly to the Prime Minister. His faction is strong enough that Esdeath is hesitant to oppose it. He is loyal to the Empire as an ideal and desires to clean up the corruption within the Empire, but only after putting down the rebellion. This implies that he is antagonistic to both Night Raid and the Minister's corrupt ways. His Teigu is , a pair of piston-installed gauntlets, which allow him to generate electricity and lightning storms and to deliver devastating punches capable of breaching even Incursio's defense. When Budo battled Tatsumi after Incursio evolved, he notes Incursio's progress and realizes that his opponent may have done the impossible by fusing with his Teigu. Budo is killed by Mine during their rescue operation to save Tatsumi. =Wild Hunt= is the Secret Police of the Empire that is formed after the Jaegers suffered the loss of most of its members. The group is led by Syura who gathered world-class criminals from various regions under the Prime Minister's orders. Most of them carry a Teigu, although some of them are strong enough to fight without Imperial Arms. All six members enjoy abusing their new found authority to satisfy their own urges of sadism while justifying their actions under the pretense of investigating the whereabouts of Night Raid. Such abuses of power included rape, blackmail, extortion, torture, and wanton murder sprees. Unlike the Jaegers, Syura shows no camaraderie towards the members of Wild Hunt. He is indifferent to their deaths, instead valuing only their usefulness in combat.

Syura : is the son of Prime Minister Honest and the leader of Wild Hunt. He regards the Empire as a toy and uses Wild Hunt to promote unrest in the Empire. While he respects his father and they have an amiable relationship, Syura desires to surpass his father and become emperor. Prior to making himself known, Syura released many of Dr. Stylish's experimental Danger Beasts to kill innocent people before the Jeagers managed to wipe out most of them. After suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of Wave and enduring a scolding from his unimpressed father, Syura swears vengeance against Wave. Syura boasts about his relationship with the Minister to his victims and enemies so as to intimidate them into submission, but is nevertheless a skilled fighter, having learned various martial art styles throughout his travels. He wields the Teigu, , a pendant that allows him to teleport anyone within its trigram circle symbol over large distances. Syura is killed when he lets his guard down around a captured Lubbock, who used wires from his Teigu to break Syura's neck. :Profile: :*Aliases: :*Zodiac Starsign: Leo :*Blood type: A Champ is a member of Wild Hunt who appears as an overweight, sadistic, and pedophilic clown and serial killer. His motive for raping and killing children is so they will not become \\"filthy adults\\". He wields the Teigu , which takes the form of six floating orbs, each imbued with a different attribute when tossed (flame, lightning, ice, storm, rot, and explosive). As he is the one who killed Run's students, Run swore vengeance against him and succeeded in killing him with his own flame orb. His Teigu was retrieved by Night Raid.

Her family was burned to death, but she survived with a shattered psyche. Her Teigu is , a microphone that amplifies the user's voice into deadly sound waves capable of pulverizing her victims. She was killed by Mine and her Teigu was retrieved by Night Raid. Unlike Champ and Enshin, who died in the same battle, Cosmina possesses tremendous vitality and survived long enough for Dorothea to utilize her alchemy to save her. She was then modified into a spider-like centaur creature by Dorothea, who controls her to attack Night Raid. She is killed when Tatsumi bisects her monster form in battle. Dorothea is a child-like female alchemist working for Wild Hunt. She joined Syura in the hopes of meeting Dr. Stylish to combine her alchemy with his altered body, but is disappointed when she learns he was already dead. Her Teigu is , a set of fangs that allows her to drink her victims' blood in a vampire-like fashion in order to strengthen and heal herself. Her alchemy proves instrumental in saving Cosmina's life, though it cannot save anyone who has already died. It was also due to alchemy that Dorothea appears so young: in truth, she was an elderly woman who extended her lifespan by absorbing the energy from others. She was killed by Leone who crushes her with a boulder. :Profile: :*Aliases: :*Blood type: AB Enshin is a former pirate and a lecherous misogynist working for Wild Hunt.

He has a deep passion for his katana, , and refers to killing his victims as \\"feeding\\" it. K≈çsetsu is noted not to be a Teigu and Izou himself claims that he is not interested in Teigu. Syura has noted that as long as Izou is present he can make it up for Wild Hunt's lost military strength, even with Enshin and Champ dead and Cosmina recovering. He kills Lubbock when he tries to escape from the palace after being captured. He is later killed by Akame. =Elite Seven= The Elite Seven was a special squad of assassins that serves the Empire during the events of the prequel manga Akame ga Kill! Zero.

All members of the unit are children raised since childhood in the arts of assassination and Akame was a member of them, ranked no. 7 before defecting to the Revolutionary Army. Gozuki : Originally a member of the Rakshasa Demons, takes the seven most talented children amongst the many tested, Akame included, and trains them to be human weapons for the purpose of stamping out rebels acting against the Empire. He did not include Kurome amongst the seven as she finished in eighth place, and he did not want sisterly affections to interfere with their combat efficiencies. He refers them as his \\"children\\" and they in turn referred him as \\"father\\". He is intolerant of failure and threatens to disown any of them who failed in their missions. As the leader of the Elite Seven, Gozuki was originally owner of the Imperial Arm Murasame before the weapon ended up in Akame's possession. Najasho Ranked no.1 of the Elite Seven, Najasho is the sub-leader of the team, thus he usually treats his companions as less capable than him and had a tendency to boss them around. His Shingu is the \\"Water-Dragon Sword\\", a broadsword with the power to enhance the capabilities of its wielders for three minutes, at the cost of leaving them exhausted for a while once its effect wears off. Guy Ranked no.2, Guy has a rather perverted attitude, usually visiting brothels and flirting with the female members of the team. Despite that, he has real feelings for Cornelia and swears revenge upon those who killed her. His Shingu is the \\"Rare Suit\\", a suit of armor that takes advantage of the ground to perform surprise attacks. Cornelia Ranked no.3, Cornelia is the big-sister figure of the group. She is killed by one of Chelsea's former teammates called Taeko, after revealing her secret to her, unaware of her true identity. Her Shingu was the \\"Pulverization Ring\\", that bestows superhuman strength to its user, but can harm them if not used properly. Pony Ranked no.4, Pony is cheerful, straightforward, and rather dimwitted, who has a deep admiration for Gozuki and loved to please him. She also seems to enjoy fighting and killing her targets. Her Shingu is the \\"Yocto-bottoms\\", that gives the user extra acceleration and leg strength, but the user must compensate possible side- effects from extensive use with special physical training. Green Ranked no.5, Green is a bespectacled, rather reserved boy who actually had some feelings for Akame, which are never reciprocated. His Shingu is the \\"Sidewinder\\", a whip that moves according to its user's will, but demands much concentration. Tsukushi Ranked no.6, Tsukushi is around Akame's age and the member of the team she seems to be the closest to. Her Shingu is the \\"Prometheus\\", a pair of pistols whose bullets have their trajetory controlled by the user according to their will. However, this control gets harder with each round fired after successive shots. Reception The characters of Akame ga Kill! have been well received by anime and manga publications. UK Anime Network praised the development of Tatsumi from a \\"happy go lucky\\" protagonist and changes as he interacts with the members from Night Raid. Matt Packard of Anime News Network criticized most of its first villains for being \\"one-note savages resigned to \\"grinning insanely while being killed.\\" However, the introduction of the Jaegers led to a more positive response due to the characterization of the new antagonists with Wave's dynamic with Tatsumi being called out twice due to their several similarities in terms of personalities.

Early life Jim Sherow was born in Hutchinson Kansas and raised in Maize Kansas. Sherow's father and uncles served in the military during World War II. Sherow volunteered for military service in the air force during the Vietnam War from 1970-1974. University career The Hulse-Daughters House in Manhattan Kansas which Sherow and his wife renovated and turned into a bed and breakfast At Wichita State University Sherow received his bachelor's degree in 1976 and his masters in 1978. He finished his Ph.D. in History at the University of Colorado in 1987. His dissertation was titled \\"Discord in the Valley of Content\\" and received a \\"Westerners International-Phi Alpha Theta Award\\" for the historical subfield of \\"Western history\\". Sherow taught at Southwest Texas State University until 1992 when he became an associate professor at Kansas State University. Once at K-State, the College of Arts and Sciences awarded him with the William L. Stamey Award for Teaching in May 1995. In 2007, he became a full professor. He was named a University Distinguished Professor in 2017. City commission Sherow ran for city commission in 2005 with the endorsement of \\"Citizens for a Better Manhattan\\", but did not enter the commission. He lost by 6 votes after the count of provisional ballots. The election focused on topics like the redevelopment of downtown Manhattan, KS, the rental housing inspections, and the town's aquatics center. That year, he was elected to the Board of Directors for Downtown Manhattan, Inc which he maintained until 2007. Sherow served in the Manhattan, KS city commission from April 2007 until April 2013. In 2007, Sherow tied votes with challenger Jayme Morris-Hardeman for Manhattan, KS city commissioner seat. According to The Collegian, the student newspaper at Kansas State University, the tie was decided by a coin toss, with Sherow winning. Sherow ran again in the 2009 elections. Sherow was one of 4 city commission candidates to support the expansion of the local transit system, ATA Bus, to include fixed routes. In a similarly controversial issue, Sherow supported the southern portion of the redevelopment of Downtown Manhattan, which included the Flint Hills Discovery Center and a conference center. Both programs were enacted subsequent the elections. In the 2009 general election, Sherow received the most votes of the commissioners in the election receiving 2,756 votes or 18.07% of the total cast ballots, giving him a four-year term. 2014 congressional campaign =Primary and motivations for running= In March 2014, Sherow began a run for the Democratic primary in order to challenge incumbent Republican Tim Huelskamp in Kansas's 1st congressional district. In the primary, he also ran against democrat Bryan Whitney of Wichita, though Whitney did not actively campaign. Sherow won the primary with a significant lead over Whitney, with 65.6% of the 12,502 primary votes. Republican, Alan LaPolice also challenged Huelskamp in the primary, gaining 45% of the Republican primary votes. Sherow announced his initial impetus for running was that Huelskamp did not sufficiently represent Kansas in the House of Representatives; Sherow claimed Huelskamp did not sufficiently address the agricultural interests of the first district, amongst other concerns, such as encouragement of sustainable energy options. Sherow believed he would handle agricultural issues better than Huelskamp. In a September 3, 2014 interview with Salon, Sherow reinforced these motivations for running, noting the \\"General gridlock\\" in Congress. Sherow also described Huelskamp as more extreme and impractical than Governor Sam Brownback. When asked if the Huelskamp campaign was taking his challenge seriously, he responded \\"I think they‚Äôre taking it seriously. Huelskamp doesn‚Äôt want to give me any more name recognition than he needs to. So we‚Äôre going to put out a challenge for debate and I‚Äôll be very surprised if he actually accepts it. Sherow and Huelskamp did subsequently debate one another in different locations across the Big First. \\" =Endorsements and funding= Sherow saw considerable bi-partison support in developing his campaign. Traditional Republicans for Common Sense‚Äî with members like Kansas politicians Steve Morris, and Ruth Teichman ‚Äî endorsed him, saying that \\"[he] will promote practical solutions to our many problems rather than promoting a certain political 'party label.'\\" Sherow endorsed independent senate candidate Greg Orman, who is running against incumbent Republican Senator Pat Roberts in the state senate election. Democratic candidate Chad Taylor soon withdrew from the race in favor of Orman. The New Republic quoted Chris Reeves, \\"a Kansas City Network Consultant who works with Democratic candidates\\" in saying that \\"The moment Sherow, a Democrat, said he couldn‚Äôt endorse him, it was over .\\" Primaries were on August 5, 2014. As of July 24, 2014, Sherow had raised $66,507 of campaign funds as compared to the incumbent Huelskamp's $648,301. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that Sherow was receiving no support from the national Democratic Party, so feels that he would not owe favors the House's Democratic caucus. =Affiliated organizations= Personal life Sherow is married to Bonnie Lynn-Sherow. She is also a historian at K-State, specializing in North American Indigenous and agricultural history. She was founding director of K-State's Chapman Center for Rural Studies (2007-2020).

It was built in the mid-19th century and is considered one of the most important house and farm of Empord√† and included in the register of Architectural Heritage of Catalonia.  Building  The Mol√≠ de la Torre is a detached large building located away from the core of El Far d'Empord√†, near the C-31 bearing Figueres to La Bisbal d'Empord√†. It is built entirely of brick, with a big fence that hinders the access which has three openings, the central with an arch with pilasters on the sides . The construction consists of different bodies with different heights, the main building is ground floor, first and second floor, replaced by attic on the second building. Highlight the pillars that exist in each side of the access door and turn the front upstairs to the top floor with scrolls. The roof of the building is a terrace with a balustrade railing, and a polygonal tower in the center which rises a few feet above the building.  History  = Origins (1853-1906) = main door 1853 The building was constructed in 1853, as indicated by the wrought iron lintel of the door, by an order of Narcis Fonsdeviela, Marques de la Torre. The building is attributed to the architect Josep Roca i Bros who built the most of public works at that time. Initially it was a Gristmill, first of Watermills benefit from the irrigation of Alguem√† river, passing through Pont del Princep (also called Rec the molins). On the back passes an artificial canal which until 1950 generated its own light with a dynamo. One of the first owners was Manuel Lleonci, Councilman of Figueres (1862). In that time the mill worked 200 days a year with an average of six hours per day. The property passed in 1899 to Miquel Plana Goytisolo who was the owner of the Granja Av√≠cola del Mol√≠ de la Torre, along with his partner Miquel Sola. = Maria Pichot (1906 -1926) = Maria Gay, mezzo soprano, as Carmen in 1909 Maria Pichot i Girones, an opera artist with French nationality and married with the composer Joan Gay, acquired the estate in 1906. The purchase was made in front of notary of Figueres, Salvador Dal√≠ i Cus√≠, the artist's father. His brother Pepito Pitxot, resident and horticulturist in Figueres, was in charge of the property. In May 1916 a young Dali spent a season in the Mol√≠ de la Torre and discovered the Impressionism through the collection of the painter Ramon Pichot. In his autobiography Dali Secret Life includes a drawing of the building and describes his first contact with the Mol√≠ de la Torre: \\"I'm impressed as a magical place, was made specifically for the continuation of my dream and fantasize awake\\" and also stated \\"At the place where they occur most of my dreams, especially those of an erotic nature\\". = House of Rubert‚Äôs family (1927-1985) = Juan Rubert y Comas bought the Mol√≠ de la Torre for 106,000 pesetas in 1927 and settled there with his wife Antonia Lopez de Tejeiro and their children. During the Spanish Civil War the house was respected because Rubert, who lived during the fight in the Llombart Hotel of Figueres, used his Puerto Rican nationality. The estate passed to his three daughters Isabel, Juana, and Antonia. On 8 September 1973 Dal√≠ visited the Mol√≠ de la Torre, with the painter Antoni Pitxot and guided by Antonia Rubert, to cover all the corners of the house. Dal√≠ told that from the terrace of the house had painted several landscapes of the Empord√†. The North American collector Albert Reynolds Morse, founder of the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, who visited the mill several times, included a photo in his book Dali. A panorama of his art. = Luxury residence (1986-1995) = In 1986 the building was sold to the architect Juan Antoni Rodeja and other partners in Figueres. They built three luxury homes and a few years later the building was sold. = Na√Øve Museum (1996 - 2000) = The Mol√≠ de la Torre became a museum of Na√Øve art in 1996 when French biologist Albert Laporte and his Spanish wife Ana Perez bought the house. In May 1998 they opened a museum of naive art to show their collection of 1,500 paintings and sculptures. The initiative had a little interest and LaPorte dream ended after 2 years when the museum was closed. Forecasts anticipated 200,000 museum visitors a year but the total in two seasons did not exceed 30,000. = Present = In 2000 Jose Arias bought the building and between 2007 and 2008 the ground floor was enabled as a restaurant and the first floor as a dwelling. In 2013 the building was vacated.

Although a rich landowner of aristocratic background, he was one of the pioneers of revolutionary socialism in France and Romania, obtaining international fame as founder of L'√àre Nouvelle magazine. He was an early affiliate of the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party, but grew disenchanted with its radical policies, and, as a member of its \\"generous youth\\" faction, played a major part in dissolving it. With other members of this reformist group, he joined the National Liberal Party, serving as one of its representatives in Chamber. Affected by heart disease from childhood, Diamandy had to maintain a low profile in politics, but was a vocal marginal within the National Liberal establishment. From 1910, he invested his energy in literature and cultural activism, chairing the National Theater Bucharest and later the Romanian Writers' Society. He was pushed back to the forefront during the early stages World War I, when he supported an alliance with the Entente Powers. He advised Premier Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu on the matter and was sent on diplomatic missions to the West, helping to cement France's trust for Romania. He fought in the ill-fated campaign of 1916, and withdrew to Ia»ôi, retaking his seat in Chamber. During his final years, Diamandy became an advocate of democratic socialism, founding the Ia»ôi-based Labor Party and seeking the friendship of Russian Esers. The October Revolution caught him in Russia, but he escaped by way of Arkhangelsk, and died at sea while attempting to reach France. George Diamandy was the brother and collaborator of diplomat Constantin I. Diamandy, and the posthumous grandfather of writer Oana Orlea. He is largely forgotten as a dramatist, but endures in cultural memory for his controversial politics and his overall eccentricity. Biography =Early life= George Diamandy, the son of landowner Ion \\"Iancu\\" Diamandy and Cleopatra Catargiu, was born in Idrici, Vaslui County,CƒÉlinescu, p. 657 or, by his own admission, in B√¢rlad.Diamandy, p. 69 Several sources, including Diamandy's own account, give his birth date as February 27, 1867 Florin Faifer, \\"Mo»ôierul\\", in Convorbiri Literare, April 2002 (George CƒÉlinescu, the literary historian, has October 27). His brother, Constantin \\"CosticƒÉ\\", was born in 1870. Constantin and George also had a sister, Margareta, later married Popovici-Ta»ôcƒÉ. The Diamandys, of Greek origins, Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Diploma»õie »ôi scris: familia Diamandy\\", in Ziarul Financiar, February 23, 2007 had made a slow climb into the aristocracy of Moldavia and, later, the Kingdom of Romania. One branch of the family, who used the name variant Emandi, produced diplomat Theodor Emandi. Iancu rose to high office, serving in Parliament and as Prefect of Tutova County.Butnaru I, p. 135 His wife Cleopatra belonged to the higher realms of the boyar aristocracy, and according to politician-memoirist Constantin Argetoianu, had passed her \\"pride\\" and \\"airs\\" to both her sons. George, who always spoke Romanian with a thick and archaic Moldavian accent,Livescu, p. 130; Massoff, pp. 320‚Äì321 was first enlisted in school at B√¢rlad. However, having been infected with malaria, he had to spend much of his childhood taking seaside cures in France. He then returned to study at the United Institutes High School in Ia»ôi, where he notably put out a clandestine student magazine, Culbecul (\\"The Snail\\").Baiculescu et al., p. 779; CƒÉlinescu, p. 657 As noted by CƒÉlinescu, he was \\"absent-minded and rebellious.\\" According to his own account, he was \\"mediocre\\", but \\"read extensively outside the curriculum\\". He disliked the school and claimed that it gave him rheumatism and heart problems. Constantin (standing behind him), in an 1890 photograph His life course was changed by his discovery of socialism and proletarian internationalism, and he soon became their avid promoter. His brother had entirely different opinions in this respect, calling socialism \\"a farce\\".Gorovei, p. 152 George and his best friend Arthur Gorovei founded their own Socialist Club, which only lasted a few days.Gorovei, p. 151 Diamandy also published political articles in the review Contemporanul (the first one in 1887), following up with similar contributions to Munca and Raicu Ionescu-Rion's Critica SocialƒÉ.Diamandy, p. 69; Petrescu, pp. 80‚Äì81, 90‚Äì91 He neglected his schoolwork and, in his own words, passed his Baccalaureate \\"more than anything because the professors were generous\\". Diamandy also developed a passion for archeology, enjoying in particular the books of Gabriel de Mortillet and Theodor Mommsen.Gorovei, pp. 151, 153 He camped out with Nicolae Beldiceanu in Cucuteni, where he helped on the inventory of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture.CƒÉlinescu, p. 657; Gorovei, pp. 44‚Äì45, 48, 152‚Äì153 Diamandy was also a member of the B√¢rlad National Romanian Committee, which gathered funds and artifacts for the Romanian delegation to the 1889 Exposition Universelle.Georges Bibesco, Exposition universelle 1889. La Roumanie avant-pendant-apr√®s, Imprimerie Typographique J. Kugelmann, Paris, 1890, pp. 370, 385 He was working on a novel in the manner of √âmile Zola, which, according to Gorovei, was over-detailed and boring.Gorovei, p. 153 Upon graduation, Diamandy volunteered for service in the Romanian Land Forces, spending a year and a half as an artillery man. Disliked because of his pranks (\\"which I for one found spirited\\"), he was moved to the 7th Artillery Regiment in CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, and, because once there he complained about the mistreatment of regulars by the officers, spent several months in the disciplinary barracks.Diamandy, pp. 69‚Äì70 He notes: \\"Just as I was ending my term as a volunteer, the captain, having learned that I had donned a civilian's outfit for a private party, ordered me in lockdown.‚ÄîLockdown meant no stove and no windows, so that's how I ended up with pneumonia.\\"Diamandy, p. 70 =L'√àre Nouvelle= Diamandy went on to study Law at the University of Paris, but did very poorly, and was only granted half of his license; he completed the rest at Caen University. He pursued other scholarly interests, becoming a corresponding member of the Soci√©t√© Anthropologique. He published notices on Cucuteni, as well as studies on Bulgarian handicrafts and a sketch of Romanian anthropological criminology. Bulletins de la Soci√©t√© d'anthropologie de Paris, IV¬∞ S√©rie. Tome 1, 1890, pp. 406‚Äì408, 964‚Äì970 (republished by Pers√©e Scientific Journals) He also completed, in 1891, the historical demography tract D√©population et repeuplement de la France (\\"The Depopulation and Repopulation of France\\").Tamara Teodorescu, Rodica Fochi, Floren»õa SƒÉdeanu, Liana Miclescu, Lucre»õia Anghelu»õƒÉ, Bibliografia rom√¢neascƒÉ modernƒÉ (1831‚Äì1918).

In parallel, he resumed his work in political journalism, with articles published in Le Journal, La Petite R√©publique, La Justice, Le Socialiste, and L'Art Social. Taking over for the Romanian \\"revolutionary socialist\\" cell founded by Mircea and VintilƒÉ Rosetti,Constantin Petculescu, \\"Lupta revolu»õionarƒÉ »ôi democraticƒÉ a studen»õimii rom√¢ne. Tineri demni de tinere»õea lor\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 1975, p. 36 he joined the \\"internationalist revolutionary student group\\" of the Latin Quarter, presided upon by Alexandre Z√©va√®s. He was one of its delegates to the 1891 International Socialist Labor Congress in Brussels.Livet, pp. 567‚Äì568 According to his own account, he presided over the Congress proceedings. In December of that year, Diamandy sided with Z√©va√®s' moderate leadership against the radical revolutionary minority.Livet, p. 566 The next year, in May, having been elected President of the student group, he was also delegated to the socialist feminist congress, where he obtained a nominal submission of socialist women to the program of a future internationalist party.Charles Sowerwine, Sisters or Citizens?: Women and Socialism in France since 1876, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1982, pp. 68‚Äì69. He and fellow Romanian expatriate Emil Racovi»õƒÉ were present at the Socialist and Labor Congress, convened at Z√ºrich in 1893. On July 1, 1893,CƒÉlinescu, p. 657; Derfler, p. 169; Livet, p. 583 Diamandy published the first issue of a \\"monthly for scientific socialism\\",Voisin, p. 405 L'√àre Nouvelle (\\"The New Era\\"). It viewed itself as both a literary and a sociological review: dedicated to promoting literary naturalism and historical materialism, openly provoking the reading public to explore the work of Zola, it attacked the \\"reactionary\\" critics. It also proudly called itself \\"eclectic\\".Voisin, p. 405. See also Derfler, p. 169; Livet, p. 583 L'√àre Nouvelle hosted articles by Marxist thinkers from the various countries of Europe: primarily Friedrich Engels and Paul Lafargue, but also Georgi Plekhanov, Clara Zetkin, Karl Kautsky, Jean Jaur√®s, Gabriel Deville, and Jules Guesde. Its regular contributors included Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the Romanian Marxist doyen, Duc-Quercy, the French strike organizer, with the additional presence of Racovi»õƒÉ, Z√©va√®s, Victor Jaclard, Alexandre Millerand, Adolphe Tabarant, Ilya Rubanovich, and Ioan NƒÉdejde; Le√≥ Frankel was the editorial secretary.Livet, p. 583. See also Diamandy, p. 70, Petrescu, pp. 80, 89 Also featured in the review, Georges Sorel was a senior syndicalist with Marxist leanings, not affiliated with either Guesde's French Workers' Party (POF) or Millerand's smaller socialist circle. Diamandy and Lafargue encouraged him to extend his forays into critical social history. Madeleine Reb√©rioux, \\"Notes critiques. D√©but du XXe si√®cle: socialistes et syndicalistes fran√ßais\\", in Annales, Nr. 5/1964, pp. 986, 989‚Äì990 (republished by Pers√©e Scientific Journals); Sternhell, pp. 68‚Äì69 According to Sorel's own claim, his presence there was only made possible when non-revolutionary French socialists like Millerand had decided to boycott L'√àre Nouvelle.Sternhell, p. 69 Diamandy's magazine was poorly reviewed by the sociological establishment: writing for the Revue Internationale de Sociologie, Andr√© Voisin censured its \\"violence\\" and its \\"quite glaring partiality\\", but noted that some of the sociological pieces were \\"at the very least moderate in form\\".Voisin, p. 406 Sorel himself recalled: \\"G. Diamandy [...] was at the time a ferociously orthodox Marxist [...]. He spent more time in the taverns of Montmartre than at University. He was a jolly good chap, entirely unreliable. I kept seeing him after that time, he was still in Mortmartre, and seemingly heading toward alcoholism.\\"Sorel, pp. 165‚Äì166 Reportedly, Diamandy was pulling pranks and farces on his socialist colleagues, even during their public functions.Gorovei, pp. 153‚Äì155 However, the publication itself had a significant, if indirect, impact on the French Left. Diamandy proudly noted that it was \\"France's first Marxist magazine\\". As historian Leslie Derfler writes, it was \\"the first theoretical journal in France\\" and an answer to Die Neue Zeit; for Sorel's disciples, it also signified a turn toward a \\"more authentic\\" and \\"Latin\\" Marxism.Derfler, pp. 169‚Äì170 As Sorel himself indicated a while after, this meant a split with orthodox Marxism, for the sake of \\"renewal\\".Sternhell, pp. 72‚Äì73 Diamandy unwittingly enticed the conflicts between Sorel and the POF when he wrote in L'√àre Nouvelle that, according to Guesde, one need not have read Marx to become a Marxist.Sternhell, p. 72 =PSDMR= L'√àre Nouvelle only survived for a few months, publishing its final issue in November 1894,Petrescu, p. 89 before closing down in early 1895.Livet, p. 584 According to Sorel, Diamandy simply \\"disappeared, leaving his magazine stranded\\".Sorel, p. 166 Still, Diamandy managed to exert his direct influence over many other Romanian socialist students in France, from Racovi»õƒÉ and NƒÉdejde to Alexandru Radovici, Constantin Garoflid, Deodat »öƒÉranu, Dimitrie Voinov, and Ioan Cantacuzino.Diamandy, p. 70; Kiri»õescu, p. 15 Diamandy personally sponsored the emerging socialist movement in the Kingdom of Romania. On his trips back to the country, he was welcomed as a celebrity at the socialist-run Sotir Hall, Bucharest, before affiliating with the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR).Kiri»õescu, pp. 14‚Äì15 This Marxist group was supportive of the mainstream National Liberal Party (PNL), as the latter had promised the introduction of universal male suffrage. Victor Durnea, \\"C. Stere »ôi duelul sƒÉu de la 1894\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 1/2008 At the 2nd PSDMR Congress in April 1894, Diamandy and Vasile Mor»õun had successfully campaigned for the introduction of such electoral demands into the party statute.Petrescu, pp. 111‚Äì112 When the PNL came to power and refused to follow through with its promise, a PSDMR faction agitated in favor of the opposition Conservative Party, even though the latter was explicitly right- wing. Writing for Munca, Diamandy endorsed this view, suggesting that references to the PNL's progressivism be dropped from PSDMR's statute. antisemitic press (May 1896): socialists and Jewish Romanians milking a cow stamped \\"Romania\\", which is fed by an overworked peasant In partnership with Garabet IbrƒÉileanu,Kiri»õescu, p. 17 Diamandy edited for a while the PSDMR organ, Lumea NouƒÉ, exploring the possibility of returning to his home country. At Lumea NouƒÉ, he put out a brochure on Doctrina »ôi tactica socialistƒÉ (\\"Socialist Doctrine and Tactics\\"). Involved with the PSDMR chapter in BrƒÉila, he presented himself as a candidate in the parliamentary election of 1895, but lost.Petrescu, p. 121 In 1898, he submitted to Romanian authorities the project of a \\"Romanian anthropological exhibition\\" at the 1900 Exposition Universelle.\\"Informa»õii\\", in Epoca, June 21, 1898, p. 1 Following his father's death in 1898, Diamandy made his definitive return to Romania. By this time, the PSDMR was already showing the signs of a split into reformist, agrarian, and orthodox-Marxist camps. Diamandy was present at secretive meetings between PSDMR founders and the agrarian group of Ion Th. Banghereanu. Also present was Constantin Stere, the PSDMR's link with a left-leaning faction of the PNL, under Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu. The reformists, distrustful of Banghereanu's sustained effort to spread socialism in rural areas, pushed for a schism: Mor»õun, Radovici, and, after a while, Diamandy himself, proposed that the entire PSDMR leadership leave the party and become PNL members.Ornea I, pp. 244‚Äì248, 260‚Äì262, 268; Petrescu, pp. 131‚Äì134 As Diamandy notes, the conflict became a \\"grave disagreement\\", and led him to suspend himself from the party and return to Paris. It deepened when the PNL Premier, Dimitrie Sturdza, ordered Banghereanu's arrest on charges of sedition.Ornea I, pp. 244‚Äì248, 261‚Äì262; Petrescu, pp. 134‚Äì136 Socialism was also threatened from within by disputes over Jewish emancipation, which polarized the PSDMR between antisemitism and Jewish nationalism. Diamandy witnessed a violent dispute in Ia»ôi, where, he claimed, the Jewish Romanian affiliates had been heard shouting \\"Down with the Romanians!\\"NƒÉdejde, p. 390 The antisemitic campaign was allegedly stoked by the PNL government, which sought to prove that the peasant agitation was a Jewish affair.Petrescu, p. 136 =\\"Generous youth\\"= The moderate leadership continued to support PNL policies, even with Banghereanu jailed.Petrescu, pp. 142‚Äì143 At the 6th PSDMR Congress of April 1899, Diamandy and Mor»õun presented a motion to transform the party into a more moderate unit, called \\"National Democratic\\" or \\"Progressive Democratic\\". According to labor historian Constantin Titel Petrescu, the Congress was a sham, with many important activists absent, and with Jewish members stripped of their voting privileges, on Diamandy's own initiative.Petrescu, pp. 144‚Äì145 In his own view, Diamandy was still persuaded that \\"intransigent\\" socialism could eventually work in Romania, and considered methods to prolong the PSDMR's survival.NƒÉdejde, p. 398 Speaking at the Congress, he warned that the PSDMR was already an \\"anti-Marxist\\" group dedicated to a \\"top-down revolution\\", which had only managed to set up \\"a socialist general staff\\", and could not claim to have improved the workers' lives.Petrescu, p. 145 The alternative, he argued, was class collaboration, which meant attracting \\"into our ranks all better elements of the bourgeoisie\\".Petrescu, p. 146 The most outspoken opponents of \\"National Democratic\\" plan were C. Z. Buzdugan, Alexandru Ionescu and I. C. Frimu, representatives of the urban underclass, who saw this as an \\"attack\\" against the PSDMR's Marxist credentials.Ornea I, pp. 267‚Äì268; Petrescu, pp. 146‚Äì150 Buzdugan claimed that Diamandy had expunged the very notion of class conflict from his readings of Marxism. He himself stretched the meaning of \\"proletariat\\" to cover not just the minor class of industrial workers, but also the mass of \\"landless peasants\\"; their interests, Buzdugan concluded, could only be served by a \\"workers' party\\".Petrescu, pp. 146‚Äì148 Many of those who opted for a \\"workers' party\\" resigned, while Diamandy's supporters announced that a new conference in June 1899 would transform theirs into a \\"sincerely democratic party\\".Petrescu, pp. 149‚Äì150 The April Congress effectively destroyed the PSDMR. Diamandy, Mor»õun and their followers, collectively referred to as \\"the generous youth\\", resigned and joined the PNL. The PSDMR that survived through June was an informal political club, whose members included Buzdugan, Ionescu, and Panait Zosin.Petrescu, p. 150 In later socialist historiography, this schism was seen as a victory for Stere and his Poporanist faction, who redirected the leftist vote toward the PNL.Ornea I, p. 268; Petrescu, pp. 143‚Äì144, 150‚Äì151 According to cultural historian Z. Ornea, the \\"generous youth\\" so efficiently adapted itself to the new environment, and Stere so poorly, that the rumor should be discounted.Ornea I, pp. 268‚Äì269 Diamandy himself was dismissive of his contribution: \\"I entered the ranks of the liberal party, where I played a most silent and irrelevant part\\". Following the Hallier Affair, which tarnished the reputation of governing Conservatives, Diamandy took part in the unauthorized demonstrations which were broken up by Police.Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Bucure»ôtii de altƒÉdatƒÉ. Vol. II: 1885 ‚Äî 1901, Editura Ziarului Universul, Bucharest, 1928, pp. 280‚Äì281 He registered with the 3rd Electoral College, hoping to represent the peasants of Tutova County. Finally elected to the Chamber (Assembly) of Deputies in the 1901 race, which returned the PNL to power, Diamandy challenged Petre P. Carp, the outgoing Premier, to an oratorical duel in Chamber, over the issue of deficit spending. \\"Din Camera Rom√¢nieƒ≠\\", in Tribuna Poporului, February 20, 1902, pp. 1‚Äì2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) At around that time, he married »òtefania (or Safta), the daughter of Dumitru Simionescu-R√¢mniceanu. The latter was related by marriage to writer Duiliu Zamfirescu, and a probable inspiration for the avaricious and power-hungry characters in Zamfirescu's novels.Ramona Miron, \\"Familia lui Duiliu Zamfirescu √Æn √énsemnƒÉrile lui I. M. Dimitrescu\\", in Horia Dumitrescu (ed.), Cronica Vrancei XV, Editura Pallas, Foc»ôani, 2013, pp. 247‚Äì250. ; Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"O scrisoare de la pictorul George Demetrescu Mirea\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 19/2008 Diamandy inherited from Simionescu-R√¢mniceanu the large estate of Sascut, but also a conflict over land with the local peasants. In May 1904, the local authorities stepped in to evacuate villagers who were demonstrating on Diamandy's property.\\"Informa»õiuni\\", in AdevƒÉrul, June 2, 1904, p. 2 The conflict was later investigated by Gorovei, the agricultural inspector for Tutova. He claims that Diamandy exploited his workers and broke all legislation.Gorovei, pp. 156‚Äì158 Diamandy's status as a rich estate owner left an enduring mark on his contemporaries. Historians and commentators made note of his eccentricity: Nicolae Iorga remembered Diamandy's \\"old socialism\\" as \\"a seigniorial adventure\\",Butnaru II, p. 178 while Eugen Lovinescu simply noted that Diamandy's aristocratic airs were \\"incorrigible\\". Also according to Lovinescu, Diamandy was \\"a late-comer\\" among enthusiastic Francophiles, one whose \\"mind continued to live in Paris\\".Lovinescu, p. 267 CƒÉlinescu describes him as \\"an amateurish and sumptuous proletarian\\". The same was later stated by Lucian Boia, who mentions Diamandy as a \\"picturesque figure\\" and \\"perfect Francophile\\", while noting his activity among the \\"salon left\\".Boia, p. 103 =PNL dissident= Diamandy's socialist background and dealings with the BrƒÉtianu faction brought him to the forefront during the 1907 Peasants' Revolt: the fourth Sturdza cabinet, brought in to deal with the rebellion, resorted to handing out seats to BrƒÉtianu's circle, the Poporanists, and the \\"generous youth\\" alike.Ornea I, pp. 402‚Äì405 Diamandy was appointed Prefect of a war zone, Tecuci County, with specific orders that he was not to use the Land Forces against the peasants.Ornea I, pp. 404‚Äì405 He resigned in short while, citing health reasons. As he put it, in 1912: \\"It was during the revolts that I contracted infectious influenza, which is still killing me about 6 times each year. The sedentary life that comes with disease is what pushed me to writing, and thus, out of boredom and being exasperated with my disease, I began collaborating with [the National Liberal newspapers] Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ and Viitorul.\\"Diamandy, pp. 70‚Äì71 The interval also prompted him to work on a fictionalized diary, Ne om (\\"No Man\\"), which records his anxiety in front of disease and impending doom. It saw print in 1908, with the editorial branch of L'Ind√©pendence Roumaine daily. He had a prolific activity as a publicist, with articles in the central press, but also with political brochures that he signed using various pseudonyms‚ÄîGh. Despina, Ion Marvila, and Ne om. Following the 1907 election, reconfirmed as deputy, Diamandy and the other \\"generous\\" parliamentarians became key players in the transition from a Sturdza cabinet to the first of seven BrƒÉtianu administrations.Ornea I, p. 427‚Äì428 When it came about, in 1908, it was largely seen by the Conservatives as a covert socialist government, not least of all because of ambiguous statements made by Stere and Diamandy.Ornea I, p. 476 The fear of radicalized socialism peaked in December 1909, when Br«étianu was attacked and wounded by Gheorghe Stoenescu, a deranged worker with anarchist sympathies. The opposition asked Diamandy and Ioan NƒÉdejde to clarify whether they were still Marxists; they confirmed that they still viewed themselves as dialectical materialists, explaining their perspective as a kind of \\"Darwinism\\".Ornea I, pp. 522, 538 Diamandy gave his endorsement to Stere's project of land reform, which was resisted by the Conservatives, as well as by BrƒÉtianu and NƒÉdejde.Ornea II, pp. 30‚Äì31 Diamandy also believed it necessary to criticize the PNL from within. According to a 1911 retrospective in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, he proved himself \\"an enfant terrible of our politics\\": \\"He kept on admonishing Mr. BrƒÉtianu, even though it was him who had given him an eligible deputy seat. It was either that Mr. BrƒÉtianu is not democratic enough; or that Mr. BrƒÉtianu cannot organize his own party; neither of these seemed to please Mr. Diamandy. And Mr. Diamandy would always make sure to voice his opinion at the most inappropriate times.\\"A.C.C., \\"NoutƒÉ»õi. Doi copii teribili √Æn politica noastrƒÉ\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 7/1911, p. 97 In 1910, Diamandy published his first works in drama: a four-act play, Tot √Ænainte (\\"Carry On\\"), and a \\"dramatic sketch\\", Bestia (\\"The Beast\\").CƒÉlinescu, p. 1014 The latter was produced by the National Theater Bucharest, with Maria Filotti in the central role, and attracted much attention with its \\"daring subject\\".Livescu, pp. 102, 125 Diamandy did not join the Romanian Writers' Society, objecting to its antisemitism, and suggesting, in a letter to Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, that the professional association had admitted talentless authors.\\"Cestiuni actuale. Evreii »ôi literatura\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 16/1910, pp. 245‚Äì246 In articles he wrote for Facla and Semnalul newspapers, Diamandy openly advocated Jewish emancipation, against nationalist objections.Nicolae Iorga, Ac≈£iunea militarƒÉ a Rom√¢niei. √én Bulgaria cu osta≈üii no≈ütri, Editura Socec, Bucharest, 1914, p. 19 =Revista Democra»õiei Rom√¢ne= In 1910, Diamandy founded the weekly Revista Democra»õiei Rom√¢ne (\\"Review of Romanian Democracy\\"), which, as a cultural and sociological venture, suggested a program of ethnographic studies in the Romanian villages, and printed an edition of Bestia. Politically, Revista Democra»õiei Rom√¢ne coagulated inner- PNL dissidence, accusing BrƒÉtianu of having turned reactionary. Sorin Radu, \\"Liberalii »ôi problema reformei electorale √Æn Rom√¢nia (1866 ‚Äî 1914) (I)\\" , in the 1 December University of Alba Iulia Annales Universitatis Apulensis, Series Historica, Nr. 4‚Äì5, 2000‚Äì2001, pp. 140, 142‚Äì143 It hosted Diamandy's thoughts about reforming the 1866 Constitution: although he no longer demanded universal suffrage, he still saw it as a historical necessity farther down the line.M., \\"NoutƒÉ»õi. Svonul despre revizuirea Constitu»õiei\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 8/1910, pp. 105‚Äì106 Also featured was his maverick proposal to merge the breakaway Conservative-Democratic Party, a junior ally, into the PNL. These ideas were derided by the Conservative-Democrats at Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, who also noted that Diamandy's proposals were conspicuously serving the politically insignificant \\"generous youth\\". Stere and the \\"generous ones\\" were noted contributors to the magazine, as were Constantin Banu, Ioan Bianu, Gheorghe Gh. M√¢rzescu, Constantin AlimƒÉni»ôteanu, Ioan Alexandru BrƒÉtescu- Voine»ôti, and some of the committed Marxists.Baiculescu et al., p. 532 Outside this circle, Diamandy found himself isolated on the political scene, and was no longer proposed for an eligible seat in the elections of 1911, presenting a full report on his activities to his Tutova constituents. Revista Democra»õiei Rom√¢ne survived until 1912, by which time Diamandy had decided to stay away from political journalism, \\"since I only see fit to write as my conscience tells me to\\".Diamandy, p. 71 Another of his plays, Dolorosa, was taken up by the National Theater in 1911. The same year, Diamandy prefaced the collected works of a deceased socialist poet, Ion PƒÉun-Pincio.Petrescu, p. 114 By 1912, when his political satire Ra»õiunea de stat (\\"The Reason of State\\") was published in FlacƒÉra review and taken up by Comoedia Troupe, Diamandy had been elected President of the Romanian Theatrical Society. C. Georgescu Munteanu, \\"√énsemnƒÉri\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 28/1912, p. 567 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) However, Diamandy complained that his works were ignored by the National Theater, despite good referrals from writers Iacob Negruzzi and Zamfirescu. Alongside Radu D. Rosetti, he formed a Literary Circle at the rival Comoedia.\\"SƒÉrbƒÉtorirea maestrului Caragiale. Festivalul de la Teatrul Comoedia\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 26/1912, p. 7 Eventually joining the Writers' Society in 1911, he left it in 1913, but returned by popular demand in 1914.Victor Ion Popa, \\"Societatea Scriitorilor Rom√¢ni\\", in Boabe de Gr√¢u, Nr. 10/1934, p. 618 Diamandy bought himself a yacht, Spargeval (\\"Breakwave\\"), and sailed the Black Sea coast, writing on other plays.CƒÉlinescu, p. 657; Gorovei, pp. 158‚Äì159. See also Diamandy, p. 71 Soon, his attention focused on the \\"Eastern Question\\". In 1910, he returned from an extended trip through the Ottoman Empire, which is recorded in his travelogue, Impressions de Turquie. On his way through Babadag, a traditional Turkish-and-Islamic center in Romania, Diamandy refurbished the local Tekke, planting a new votive inscription over the tomb of Gazi Ali.Goran I. Cialicoff, notes to \\"Din descrierea cƒÉlƒÉtoriei lui Evliia-Celebi\\", in Arhiva Dobrogei, Vol. II, 1919, p. 143 Turning to nationalism during the Second Balkan War, Diamandy gave morale-supporting lectures to infantrymen of the Land Forces,Baiculescu et al., p. 467; Butnaru I, pp. 142‚Äì143 having already prefaced a textbook of military pedagogy, by Colonel Gheorghe »òuer. In June 1913, he also wrote the foreword to a social geography tract by Major G. A. Dabija. The work as a whole was probably the first in history to justify Romania's colonization of Southern Dobruja, formerly in the Kingdom of Bulgaria.Lascu, pp. 76‚Äì80 As later noted by Dabija, Diamandy's \\"unofficial\\" penmanship was required to divert attention from this being the expansionist policy of a Conservative government.Lascu, pp. 76, 79 =National Theater Director= In 1913, under a PNL government headed by Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, Culture Minister Ion G. Duca appointed Diamandy Director of the National Theater. As Duca would claim in his memoirs, this was only \\"to fulfill one of [Diamandy's] dreams\\"‚ÄîDiamandy, Duca writes, had \\"an incorrigible mania for being or seeming original.\\"Butnaru II, p. 178; Duca, p. 211 He was only National Theater director for a few months, being replaced by his Revista Democra»õiei Rom√¢ne colleague BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti before the end of the 1913‚Äì1914 season; he returned for a second term later in 1914.Massoff, pp. 215‚Äì218. See also Livescu, pp. 127, 129 The time he spent in office only served to aggravate his colleagues in the theatrical business.Boia, p. 236; Massoff, p. 320 One of them, Ioan Massoff, recalled that Diamandy had made a habit of citing his heart troubles to avoid seeing any of his subordinates, simply dictating his reform-minded wishes to them by proxy.Massoff, pp. 320‚Äì321 Reportedly, Diamandy sacked the actor Vasile Leonescu for spite: Leonescu had criticized Ra»õiunea de stat as \\"unworthy of being staged by Romania's top venue.\\"Massoff, pp. 333‚Äì334 Another actor, Ion Livescu, recalled that, although \\"an enlightened democrat\\", and \\"well inspired\\" in his choices for the repertoire, Diamandy played the part of an authoritarian, and only communicated through his secretary, Marin Simionescu-R√¢mniceanu. However, Livescu believes that Diamandy had good cause to ignore complaints and avoid quarrels.Livescu, pp. 129‚Äì130 By that stage in his career, Diamandy was contemplating the creation of a Romanian \\"People's Theater\\" for the benefit of peasants, the news of which sparked ridicule in the urban press.Kiriak Napadarjan, \\"Teatrul la sate\\", in Furnica, Nr. 32/1907, p. 2 His own work for the stage underwent a change of style: also in 1914, he published in FlacƒÉra the localized \\"heroic comedy\\" Chemarea codrului (\\"Call of the Woods\\"), written in the format of a com√©die en vaudeville.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 657, 1014 It premiered at his own National Theater, with Filotti as the female lead,Livescu, p. 131 and was an instant favorite of the public. The fantasy format of the play satisfied Diamandy, who went on to publish other plays and dramatic fragments: StrunƒÉ cucoane (\\"Hold on, Sire\\"), HƒÉmƒÉi»õƒÉ (\\"Barker\\"), Regina Lia (\\"Queen Lia\\"), and the libretto for a children's opera, Gheorghi»õƒÉ FƒÉt-Frumos (\\"Gheorghi»õƒÉ Prince Charming\\"), set to music by Alfons Castaldi. After the outbreak of World War I, Romania opted to preserve her neutrality, with public opinion divided between Francophile and Germanophile groups, respectively supportive of the Entente countries and the Central Powers. Francophilia showed up in his articles for various literary and political reviews, including his one-time contribution to Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ magazine (September 1, 1914).Angelo Mitchievici, Decaden»õƒÉ »ôi decadentism √Æn contextul modernitƒÉ»õii rom√¢ne»ôti »ôi europene, Editura Curtea Veche, Bucharest, 2011, p. 145. This political stance was probably a factor in his 1914 election as president of the Writers' Society,Boia, pp. 102‚Äì104 as was his status as Theater manager. He combined both assignments, collecting grants for the writers through Theater benefits, and selling Romanian books through a special booth in the Theater's foyer. Diamandy's mandate came to an end in August 1915, when he assigned his seat to Alexandru Mavrodi.Massoff, p. 219 As Livescu notes: \\"when it seemed to him that there would not be many people who could understand him [...], he put his hat on, and, having just lectured us so very passionately about that France of his, left us all, with a cold and jerky salute from the top of the stairs: 'Good day y'all!'\\"Livescu, p. 130 =World War I strategist and soldier= The Romanian delegation and its hosts in Paris, January 1915. Diamandy is seated, front row, center, between Ambassador Ioan Lahovary (to his left) and French historian Georges Lacour-G√°yet. Behind them, from left: St√©phen Pichon, Milenko Radomar Vesniƒá, Denys Cochin, Athos Romanos, Emil Costinescu, Jean Richepin, Ioan Cantacuzino, Joseph Aulneau, and Dimitar Stanchov. Diamandy's enthusiasm for intervention was held back by reports that Romania risked going into war without proper weapons and ammunition.Butnaru I, pp. 143, 146; Duca, p. 134 With this in mind, he and Constantin Istrati were sent to Italy by Premier BrƒÉtianu, and successfully negotiated a treaty of mutual assistance between the two neutral countries.Butnaru I, p. 143 He also visited traditionally-hostile Bulgaria, and claimed to have obtained assurances from Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov that she would not join the Central Powers. His brother Constantin Diamandy, noted for his highly optimistic combative stance and his martial attire,Butnaru I, pp. 136, 146; Duca, p. 11 became one of BrƒÉtianu's confidants. During his diplomatic missions, he had also informed the government, reassuringly, about the goings- on in Bulgaria, and acted as liaison with the Russian Empire.Butnaru I, passim For a while, Diamandy was affiliated with the trans-party \\"National Action\\", which, under Take Ionescu and Nicolae Filipescu, sought to bring Romania into the Entente. In January 1915, he was the group's envoy to France,Ornea II, p. 77 but acted as an informal delegate for BrƒÉtianu.Butnaru I, pp. 143‚Äì144 He was welcomed by the Franco‚ÄìRomanian Friendship Committee and by Paul Deschanel personally. His erstwhile associate, Georges Sorel, commented that Deschanel must have been misinformed: \\"[Diamandy] must really be thinking that Paris is a capital for the rent-seekers, since now they take him seriously. If Romania had had an honest intent to strike a deal with us, it would have surely picked herself some other negotiator. Evidently P. Deschanel was not aware of Diamandy's character.\\" Diamandy also had a meeting with Raymond Poincar√©, the President of France. He may have informed him about Radoslavov's promises, which Diamandy still took for granted, and which may explain Poincar√©'s overly confident support for Romania in later Entente conferences. However, the talk also covered the issue of Romania's grievances toward Russia, which still prevented her for entering the war. He introduced this enigma to Poincar√©: \\"Romania looks forward to France's victory and to Russia's defeat\\" (see Franco-Russian Alliance).Fran√ßois Fejt≈ë, Requiem pour un empire d√©funt. Histoire de la destruction de l'Autriche-Hongrie, √âDIMA/Lieu Commun & √âditions du Seuil, Paris, 1993, p. 57. At one of the banquets in his honor, Diamandy divulged the existence of a parallel Franco‚ÄìRomanian alliance,Butnaru I, p. 144 and stressed \\"that R[o]mania's entry into the war would result in the conflict's end.\\"\\"Thinks Rumania Will End the War\\", in The Boston Globe, January 11, 1915, p. 5 Diamandy gave a public report on the world conflict and how it fit with Romania's national interest at the National Liberal Party Center of Studies. It was published, in 1916, with assistance from the Romanian Academy.Butnaru I, p. 146 The same year, he prefaced (as Giorgio Diamandy) Federico Valerio Ratti's monograph on \\"Latin Romania\\", published in Florence by I Libri d'Oggi.Bulletin of the New York Public Library, Vol. 23. January to December 1919, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, New York City, 1919, p. 68 Other such pieces were taken up by various newspapers and magazines, including Universul, L'Ind√©pendence Roumaine, and Rampa. He also put out a complete collection of his novellas. Returning to Chamber after the 1914 elections, Diamandy participated in the heated sessions of December 1915. He voiced the mainstream opinion of the PNL in open disputes with the Conservative Petre P. Carp. He rejected Carp's fears that a victorious Russia looked set to occupy the Danube Delta, but also noted that he himself had reserves about bringing Romania into the war, and made public his resignation from the \\"National Action\\". \\"Din Camera rom√¢nƒÉ\\", in Unirea, January 1, 1916, p. 3 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) This effectively returned him to the PNL's mainstream, where he continued to campaign in favor of going to war.Ornea II, pp. 103‚Äì107 Nevertheless, Diamandy also supported his former ally, Stere, who was being heckled by the other deputies for suggesting that an alliance against Russia was in Romania's benefit.Ornea II, pp. 104‚Äì107 Eventually, in summer 1916, Premier BrƒÉtianu discarded his reservations, and Romania entered the war as an Entente country. While Constantin became tasked with ensuring a direct Russian military involvement and military aid for the Romanian Front,Butnaru I, pp. 147‚Äì149 George again volunteered for military service. He was reputedly enrolled as a private, but was seen traveling with his own orderly.Gorovei, pp. 159‚Äì160 He was detached to the Second Army commandment in the Southern Carpathians, where he held conference with General Alexandru Averescu and other officers. Averescu remembered him as a shady figure, not worthy of his trust, and noted in particular Diamandy's ideas about using expanding bullets against the Austro-Hungarian Army (which had reportedly initiated their use in combat).Averescu, pp. 15‚Äì16, 88‚Äì89 Diamandy saw action in the front-line trenches, but was still plagued by his lung and heart problems, and was eventually sent to a hospital behind the lines.Butnaru I, p. 148 By then, the Diamandys' forecasts about Bulgarian neutrality and Romanian readiness for war proved misguided, with Romania suffering a scathing defeat in the Battle of Turtucaia.Butnaru I, p. 147 =Labor Party= After losing the Battle of Bucharest in December 1916, the Romanian Land Forces withdrew into Moldavia, which, with Russian help, they defended against renewed Central Powers offensives. Diamandy was also moved to Ia»ôi, the provisional capital, where BrƒÉtianu's government and the Parliament had relocated. He took back his Chamber seat, and, as the poor management of war weakened support for BrƒÉtianu, went on public record with his criticism.Duca, pp. 133‚Äì137 The February Revolution in Russia reopened the path toward radical socializing reforms, and pushed Diamandy back into socialist politics. BrƒÉtianu promised land reform and a new electoral law, but Diamandy and other dissenting PNL- ists were not appeased: they claimed that the government had lost its \\"moral right\\" to apply such legislation, and obstructed it repeatedly.Ornea II, pp. 167‚Äì168. See also Gorovei, p. 161 According to Duca's hostile account, the February Revolution gave Diamandy the illusion that time had come for him \\"to play a great role\\", and that the \\"tyrannical\\" BrƒÉtianu was an embarrassment for the Russian democracy.Duca, p. 172 Duca also claims that, despite his \\"laughable exhibitions\\" in favor of land reform, Diamandy could never conceive of completely redistributing property from the landowners to the peasants.Butnaru II, p. 178; Duca, pp. 196, 198, 200‚Äì201 By April 1917, Diamandy had formed his own parliamentary party, called Labor Party (Partidul Muncei). It had the radical agrarianist Nicolae L. Lupu for a co-chairman, with Grigore Iunian, Ioan Cantacuzino, Grigore Trancu-Ia»ôi, Constantin Ion Parhon, Mihail Macavei, Grigore FilipescuDuca, pp. 174‚Äì175, 180, 187‚Äì189; Ornea II, p. 167; Petrescu, p. 312; Popescu, pp. 21‚Äì22 Radu Petrescu, \\"Enigma Ilie CƒÉtƒÉrƒÉu (II)\\" , in Contrafort, Nr. 7‚Äì8/2012 and Alexandru SlƒÉtineanu Gheorghe I. Florescu, \\"√énsemnƒÉri zilnice din anii Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, November 2004 as regular members. Diamandy himself authored the central manifesto, published as a brochure. As Duca writes, the ailing dramatist was parading in a socialist's uniform: \\"a sort of Russian worker's blouse, his boots on, quite like an authentic comrade just arrived from some soviet\\". He was \\"evidently ridiculous\\", \\"acutely megalomaniac\\", driven to \\"a pathological state\\" by the urgency of his heart disease.Duca, p. 176 The Minister of Agriculture, Gheorghe Gh. M√¢rzescu, was also disturbed by Diamandy's behavior, writing: \\"George Diamandi, thinking about ways to support the ideas of the Labor Party, born from personal ambitions stoked by the Russian revolution, imagined that he should necessarily show up in Chamber in Tolstoy's costume. This operetta thing is produced for the benefit of peasants.\\" In his private diaries, General Averescu recalls his meeting with an anxious King Ferdinand in the small town of Moine»ôti. The monarch looked into \\"the growth of a socialist movement in our country\\", and had left Ia»ôi because \\"socialists and young liberals, under G. Diamandy, are supposedly in contact with the Russian revolutionaries\\".Averescu, p. 156 The account is also supported by Duca. According to him, Diamandy and Lupu had revived their contacts with the old socialists, as well as with Russian Esers, with whose backing they intended to set up a Romanian \\"democratic government\\"; their project for a revolution was bogged down when the \\"pragmatic\\" Russians discovered that the Labor Party was politically insignificant and \\"oligarchic\\".Duca, pp. 173, 176‚Äì178, 180 The Labor faction also branched into neighboring Bessarabia, using the revolutionary agent Ilie CƒÉtƒÉrƒÉu for an emissary. Nevertheless, the Laborites supported the calls for order, reacting against Russian soldiers and Romanian civilians who demanded a \\"Romanian republic\\".Gorovei, pp. 160‚Äì161 According to Arthur Gorovei, the Labor Party should be regarded as George Diamandy's \\"final prank\\".Gorovei, p. 161 In June 1917, following the renewed offensive of the Central Powers, Diamandy became a refugee to Russia,Butnaru II, p. 178; Duca, p. 205 where his brother Constantin was Romanian Ambassador. He was trapped on Russian territory during the October Revolution, events which his brother downplayed in his reports to BrƒÉtianu.Butnaru II, p. 179 The Revolution took Russia out of the war and signaled the start of a Russian‚ÄìRomanian diplomatic war: Constantin was held in captivity by the Council of People's Commissars, and eventually expelled.Butnaru II, pp. 180‚Äì182 =Death and aftermath= George Diamandy fled to the White Sea port of Arkhangelsk, where he embarked on the ship Kursk, bound for France. Kursk also transported some 3,000 returning members of the Czechoslovak Legion and some 300 French governesses. On the stormy night of December 27, 1917, off the coast of Shetland, Diamandy suffered a fatal attack of angina (or myocardial infarction).Butnaru II, p. 179; Duca, p. 205 As noted by CƒÉlinescu: \\"his coffin was buried at sea, while a choir formed by hundreds of Czechs sang, as an homage.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p. 657. See also Butnaru II, p. 179 Diamandy's death was received with indifference by the Germanophiles and wearied intellectuals in Bucharest. In his obituary for Scena magazine, dramatist A. de Herz referred to the deceased as an unpatriotic man of \\"ferocious egotism\\", claiming that his leadership of the National Theater had been \\"dismal\\".Boia, p. 236 The mood changed soon after the November 1918 Armistice, which sealed the Entente's victory on the Western Front, and returned Romanian Francophiles to high favor. Diamandy's last play, Una dintr-o mie (\\"One in a Thousand\\"), was performed by the National Theater in 1919.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1014; Massoff, p. 225 Presided upon by Lupu, the Labor Party continued to be active in the opposition, fought against the signing of peace with the Central Powers, and presented its own candidates in the 1918 election.Ornea II, pp. 209, 212‚Äì213 Some of its members were already defecting to the People's League or rejoining the PNL, while the Laborite leadership considered an alliance with the Socialist Party.Petrescu, p. 313. See also Popescu, pp. 22‚Äì24 It eventually merged into Stere's Peasants' Party, which became one of the PNL's leading opponents in the early interwar period.Ornea II, pp. 213‚Äì214; Petrescu, p. 313; Popescu, p. 22 Stere himself rekindled memories of Diamandy by making him a secondary character, \\"Raul Dionide\\", in the 1930s novel √én preajma revolu»õiei.Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, Literatura rom√¢nƒÉ √Æntre cele douƒÉ rƒÉzboaie mondiale, Vol. I, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1972, p. 379. The marriage between George and »òtefania Diamandy produced a son, Ion \\"Iancu»ôor\\" (1905‚Äì1935), and two daughters, Georgeta and Anca. Unusually, they would both be successively married to the same man: aviator Constantin \\"B√¢zu\\" Cantacuzino, son of the Conservative politico Mihail G. Cantacuzino and of Maruca Rosetti. Georgeta's marriage to Cantacuzino produced one daughter, the writer Oana Orlea (Maria-Ioana Cantacuzino). Alex. »òtefƒÉnescu, \\"Cine este Oana Orlea?\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 42/2011 Plays and prose Diamandy is often regarded as a very minor contributor to Romanian literature. According to Lovinescu, he was as much a \\"dilettante\\" here as in archeology and socialism, \\"cerebral\\", but lacking \\"artistic intuition\\".Lovinescu, pp. 267, 268 The same was noted by writer Florin Faifer, who assesses that Diamandy \\"was not in fact a virtuoso\\" of drama, losing himself in musings that range \\"from art to politics and the economy.\\" C. Georgescu Munteanu of LuceafƒÉrul condemned Ra»õiunea de stat as \\"a pointless work\\", the dramatization of such \\"a commonplace fact\\" that the public could not bring itself to applaud it. Una dintr-o mie also evidenced this problematic style. According to Faifer, its humorous intent was \\"tortured, burdened by vulgarities.\\" As noted in 2007 by historian Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, Diamandy the dramatist had been \\"entirely forgotten\\". Inspired by the works of Henrik Ibsen, Tot √Ænainte depicts life in the fictional arms industry of Clermont-Ferrand. The young industrialist Jean H√©quet intervenes to save the livelihoods of his employees, taking over management from his intransigent father. As a political manifesto, it seemingly favors class collaboration, but, as CƒÉlinescu notes, \\"seems to be rather communistic in spirit.\\" According to Massoff, it was read as \\"a play with socialist undertones\\".Massoff, p. 320 In Bestia, called by CƒÉlinescu \\"an intellectual play with a confusing exposition\\", the divorc√©e Ninetta Coman displays her seemingly visceral misandry. Her viciousness is confronted by an idealistic husband, who (Faifer notes) is an \\"artificial\\" character. Towards the end of the play, Ninetta is revealed to have been the long-suffering victim of sexual violence, and to have undergone a voluntary hysterectomy.CƒÉlinescu, p. 657; Lovinescu, p. 267 In Dolorosa, Lovinescu reads echoes from D'Annunzio. It shows the duel of wits between two painters and a woman of their company: she loves the one who does not love her back.Lovinescu, pp. 267‚Äì268 Critics were generally more lenient toward Chemarea codrului. Massoff calls it \\"one of the good Romanian plays\\".Massoff, p. 321 Lovinescu welcomed its imprecision, which parted with the staples of historical drama while preserving \\"the national atmosphere\\"; the result being \\"a hajduk legend\\" admitting \\"poetry and idealism.\\"Lovinescu, p. 268 CƒÉlinescu sees Chemarea as Diamandy's \\"only reasonably valid play\\", but \\"false\\" in content and \\"embarrassing\\" with its depiction of sexual controversy. Localized in medieval RƒÉdeana, it alludes to the rape of Anca, a virtuous young woman, by marauding Tatars. Although dishonored under the shame culture of that period, she is defended by the young nobleman, Ioni»õƒÉ, who elopes with her into the surrounding woods.CƒÉlinescu, p. 657; Lovinescu, p. 268 According to Faifer, Diamandy's other writings display a taste for \\"the picturesque\\" and \\"the unforeseen\\". These include Ne om, but also his travelogue, his hunting stories, and his novellas. The latter works show bohemian society and the rural elite at their most decadent, subject to illusions and violent passions.

They were integral to the early UK riot grrrl scene.Monem, Nadine (ed.)(2007) Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now!, Black Dog Publishing, History Linus was formed by songwriter/guitarists Jen Denitto and Andy Roberts, with vocalist Tammy Denitto and drummer Peter Frost, and played their first gigs in late 1992 after several years of rehearsals. Linus soon became involved in the London riot grrrl scene, helping to organise gigs (including the debut from Sister George), and producing zines including \\"Plague Your Eyes\\", which gained them fan and press attention. Members of the band organised riot grrrl meetings, a newsletter and a PO box, and networked with riot grrrls around the UK. On Valentine's Day 1993 they performed with riot grrrl bands Huggy Bear and Blood Sausage, the same weekend of the former band's notorious appearance on The Word; gigs followed the same year with Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Voodoo Queens, Pussycat Trash, Skinned Teen, Frantic Spiders, Witchknot and other riot grrrl-associated bands such as Heavenly, Hole, and Scrawl, with whom they toured in September. The first single, the \\"Linus\\" EP, was recorded by Ian Shaw and released on Jim Irvin‚Äôs Bone Records in 1993, followed by a three- song contribution to four-band/double 7\\" compilation \\"Some Hearts Paid To Lie\\" on Wiiija. Follow up single \\"Super Golgotha Crucifixion Scene\\" was released in 1994 and made Radio 1's Evening Session single of the week; along with debut album Yougli, it was released on Elemental Records, then part of the Alternative Tentacles group. The album was well-received across the board, and rated 4/5 in Select. The same year saw an appearance at the Phoenix Festival and a small US tour. Linus were dropped by Elemental in 1995 after the label was acquired by One Little Indian, and the next few years saw line-up changes and various unreleased recordings. Jen Denitto left in 1997, and was replaced temporarily by Charley Stone (Salad/Gay Dad) and permanently by Deb Van Der Geugten. Drummer Annie Leblond joined for the \\"Don‚Äôt Forget\\" EP in 1998 - well-reviewed by Melody Maker \\\\- and second album Good Listener, recorded in 1999 and released in 2000, after which Andy Withey joined on drums. 2002-2004 saw Linus reinvigorated by a second wave of riot grrrl-associated music, with the band playing three Ladyfests in 2003. In 2004, the band toured to support their \\"P.E.\\" EP, including gigs with We Start Fires, Zombina and the Skeletones, (hooker), and Electrelane. This period saw Linus networking with the DIY queercore scene, including shows for Local Kid (Bristol) and Homocrime (London) and gigs alongside Lesbo Pig and Wetdog. Linus disbanded in 2005 after the sudden death of Andy Roberts. Tammy Denitto went on to play in The Dream Is Over with Stephen Lane of Vase. Jen Denitto went on to play in The Low Edges and The Monochrome Set; and has drummed with Keith Top of the Pops, Dom Green and Rebekah Delgado. Both Jen Denitto and Deb Van Der Geugten played in Scarlet's Well and The Wimmins' Institute. Compilations of unreleased Linus material, and demos of songs by Andy Roberts were released in 2006; a memorial gig was held in February the same year. The 2007 book Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now! was part-dedicated to Roberts. In June 2015, an \\"Andy Roberts Retrospective\\" exhibition was held at the Edwardian Cloakroom in Bristol, including live music. Following on from this, former band members Jen Denitto, Deb Van Der Geugten and Charley Stone played a gig together, billed as The Bass Players of Linus, in February 2016.

He has also released work under his real name and as Psilodumputer, Pushiro, and J.Panic. Biography Rahm began making music at the age of 11 on an Amiga 500 computer and later an Amiga 1200 before moving to a PC, synthesizers, and other musical equipment. His first live gigs were at local community events, which he described as an inappropriate context for his energetic performances. In the late 1990s he became involved in the rave scene, playing both illegal and legal events. The \\"psilo-\\" prefix of his stage name comes from rave drug culture. Before becoming a music professional Rahm worked as a computer service technician. In addition to Psilodump, Rahm released the 2001 Full of SID/Microcompo Remixes EP, a tribute to the SID Commodore 64 sound chip, under the name Psilodumputer, and when DJing has gone by J.Panic. In 2003 Rahm co-founded The X-Dump, a Swedish electronic music collective and record label with Din Stalker, Dorothy's Magic Bag, and his brother, Paza Rahm. He has toured extensively, playing a number of notable events including Peace & Love, Stockholm Pride, Blip Festival, and Norbergfestival. Musical style Psilodump has been closely associated with chiptune music since becoming acquainted with the genre through the Micromusic community in 2000. Several of his albums have been released through chiptune- related labels, including Micromusic and 8bitpeoples, though he has expressed distaste for most chiptune music and critical of what he sees as simplistic tendencies among some of the musicians who make it. He has cited as musical influences Aphex Twin, Pink Floyd, Nine Inch Nails, Orbital, Kraftwerk, Squarepusher, Cylob, Die Krupps, Hardfloor, Yello, System of a Down, Laibach, David Bowie, Westbam, Bj√∂rk, Hallucinogen, Moby, and Din Stalker. Discography Peace & Love festival in 2009 Rahm began releasing music in the late 1990s through his own 476 Records label, largely using CD-Rs. His earliest known work from the mid-1990s, under the name Pushiro, was remastered and released on the Art of Realistix label in 2005. He used the name Psilodumputer for his first non-476 Records album, the 2001 EP Full of SID / Microcompo Remixes on the Domizil label. The 2002 Gamma EP, released through Sound of Habib, was the first official title bearing the Psilodump name, which he would use predominantly thereafter. Premonition Magazine described Gamma as an \\"innovating and well arranged mix between IDM, Tech, and Bitpop,\\" and said of the new artist \\"this young man should go a long way.\\" Psilodump went on to have his music published on CD, vinyl, and online, by several labels, such as Sound of Habib, Q-Records, Kahvi Collective, Micromusic, 8bitpeoples, Eclectro Records, Candy Mind Records, Monotonik, Ninjani Diskus, Demon Tea Recordings, Data Airlines, as well as Rahm's affiliated labels 476 Records and X-DuMP3. Though typically prolific, other than a few tracks under his real name Rahm did not put out new music between 2006 and 2009, when he released The Nya Albumet (\\"The New Album\\"), which Zero Magazine called \\"both danceable and extremely friendly listening.\\" Many works by Psilodump are Creative Commons licensed and available for free on several websites, including Archive.org. =List of works= References External links   *Psilodump on Archive.org Category:Intelligent dance musicians Category:Chiptune musicians Category:Swedish electronic musicians Category:Electro musicians Category:People from Stockholm Category:1980 births Category:21st-century Swedish musicians Category:8bitpeoples artists Category:Living people ","title":"Psilodump"},{"id":"42823308","text":"Cape Lazo is a headland at the tip of the Comox Peninsula on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Cape Lazo\\" The community of Lazo is located near the cape.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Lazo (community)\\" In 1791 Narv√°ez named the cape Punta de Lazo de la Vega.

The model house owes it existence to the Essex Handicraft Association, particularly to Mrs St Osyth Mahala Wood, n√©e Eustace-Smith (born in 1886, Hampstead, died on 1 November 1970, Wasperton, Warwickshire) an English campaigner and philanthropist who became a great benefactor to her local community. She had lived at Parsonage Hall, Bures since her marriage in 1924 and was renowned for her ability to create dolls furniture out of mahogany, an extremely hard wood to work with and not the preferred choice of wood normally used for such fine work. Under her guidance and that of Lady Whitmore the Essex Handicraft Association made plans for a magnificent and notable dolls house to architectural standards in 1955 to portray a typical Essex mansion. Plans were drawn up by Martin Evans RIBA (b.1927) a recently qualified architect from Feering in Essex, whose mother Esther was a member of the Association. The house was based on Boreham Manor, near Chelmsford, the home of another fellow member Lady Ritchie. It is extremely large [ wide and high], and has tall Tudor chimneys and an elegant Georgian fa√ßade, while the back is Elizabethan. The main rooms consist of a drawing-room, dining-room, kitchen, nursery, Chinese room, main bedroom, gentleman‚Äôs room and bathroom. It required the services of a professional plasterer to cover the interior walls while the interior base in places is made of genuine miniature parquet flooring. The house is populated by 25 characters, all made by hand, many of whom of course depict the invaluable servants who would have kept the house in perfect order. Everything within and without, from the ghost in the hall to the handwritten will in the desk, was created by members, who were all encouraged to contribute their fine skills to create a lasting monument to Essex domestic architecture. The finished construction stood for some time in Parsonage Hall, Bures and is now on permanent display in the round at the Braintree District Museum in Braintree, Essex. In 1998 Essex Heritage Trust gave the museum a grant of ¬£3000 to provide glass display cabinets for the Doll's House and Barn. Mrs Dawn Arthur, is another member who lived at the time at Boreham and whose late husband Allan Arthur was High Sheriff of Essex in 1971, then a Deputy Lieutenant. She encouraged the idea of a barn which could go alongside the house, with work on a similar scale. For a long time this was in storage at Braintree District Museum, where there has not been enough room to display it beside the model house but it can now be appreciated and admired in the round in the beautiful medieval barn at Layer Marney Tower.

He toured extensively in Britain, South Africa and Australia, first with Frederick Loudin's Jubilee Singers and then with his own minstrel companies. Early years Orpheus McAdoo was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, on 4 January 1858. He was the oldest child of slave parents. His mother was the only slave on the estate who could read. The family occupied a two-room cottage, presumably since they had higher status than most of the slaves on the plantation. McAdoo attended the Hampton Institute, graduating in 1876. For three years he was a schoolteacher in rural Virginia, in Pulaski and Accomack counties, and for several more years he taught at the Hampton preparatory school. While teaching McAdoo also spent much of his time touring with the Hampton Male Quartet. Around the end of 1885 he decided to join the Fisk Jubilee Singers led by Frederick J. Loudin. This troupe had sailed for England in April 1884, and for six years toured Australia, England, India and the Far East, returning to the USA in April 1890. Around October 1899 McAdoo and soprano Belle F. Gibbons left Loudin's group and went back to the USA. There McAdoo formed his own company, the Virginia Concert Company or Virginia Jubilee Singers. Touring minstrel shows Orpheus McAdoo in 1899, with portrait of his young son inset The members of the new troupe included McAdoo's younger brother Eugene McAdoo, his future wife Mattie E. Allen (c. 1868-1936), Belle F. Gibbons, Madame J. Stewart Ball and Moses Hamilton Hodges. On 29 May 1890 Jubilee Singers left New York for England. The troupe then went to South Africa, opening on 30 June 1890 in the Cape Colony. The troupe received a very favorable reception. The Cape Argus said, McAdoo's company found strong racial prejudice in South Africa, particularly in Transvaal and the Orange Free State, with a 9 p.m. curfew for blacks. The natives had to get passes for travel in the country, and were not allowed to own a business. Orpheus McAdoo married Mattie E. Allen on 27 January 1891 at Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony. In February 1891 President Paul Kruger saw the Jubilee Singers perform, perhaps entering a theater for the first time is his life, and was said to have been greatly moved by their rendition of Nobody knows the trouble I have seen. The company closed in South Africa on 25 January 1892. McAdoo's company began a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1892. The McAdoos' son Myron was born in 1893. After three years, the company returned to Cape Town on 29 June 1895. McAdoo had some difficulties with the baritone Will Thompson and with Mamie Edwards, who both left the company to live in Kimberley. In February 1897 McAdoo went to New York to hire replacements. He returned in June 1897 with eight new artists, including dancers, a comedian and female impersonator, and a juggler. McAdoo renamed the company the \\"Minstrel, Vaudeville and Concert Company\\". In August 1897 Thompson and Edwards rejoined the company. A sample joke from this show, adapted from the plantation to the South African frontier, was, Last Australian tour Orpheus McAdoo's Georgia Minstrels in Australia in January 1900 In 1898 the company returned to Australia. McAdoo leased the Palace Theatre, Sydney, a vaudeville house, with plans to establish a stock company there. In April 1899 McAdoo returned to the USA to recruit members for the Georgia Minstrels and Alabama Cakewalkers. Singer Flora Batson joined the company at this time. This full-size African-American minstrel troupe toured Australia from 1899 to May 1900. In June 1899 M.B. Curtis's All-star American Minstrels embarked on an Australian tour. Members included Billy McClain and his wife Cordelia, and Ernest Hogan. Soon after the show reached Sydney Curtis abandoned the show and Hogan took over. The McClains transferred to Orpheus McAdoo's Georgia Minstrels. A review of the O.M. McAdoo Georgia Minstrels show in the Brisbane Opera House in January 1900 said \\"The two low comedians of the company‚àí\\"Billy\\" McClain and C.W.

Background  Lin Ding was born in 891, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. The family of his father Lin Wuyin (ÊûóÁÑ°Èö±) was from Houguan (‰æØÂÆò, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), but Lin Wuyin, who was known to be a poet, left his home territory and was residing in Ming Prefecture (ÊòéÂ∑û, in modern Ningbo, Zhejiang). Then-prefect of Ming, Huang Sheng (ÈªÉÊôü), was respectful to the intelligentsia, and Lin Wuyin became dependent on him for support. Lin Ding was thus born at Ming.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 86. When Lin Ding grew older, he went to pay homage to then- ruler of the region, Qian Liu (whose domain had become the state of Wuyue). Qian Liu made Lin an officer at his headquarters, and soon thereafter assigned Lin to serve on staff of his son Qian Chuanguan. Qian Chuanguan became impressed with Lin's abilities, and often recommended him for greater responsibilities, but Qian Liu did not react. One day, when Qian Chuanguan again went to see his father to recommend Lin, Qian Liu responded, \\"Lin Ding has an unusual bone structure. He would have the proper disposition to be a chancellor. But I have no intention to give him great honors. I want you to be the one doing that, so that he would be faithful to you.\\"  Service under Qian Yuanguan  In 932, Qian Liu died. Qian Chuanguan (who then changed his name to Qian Yuanguan) assumed control of the state, and for some time only claimed the title of military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered at Wuyue's capital Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û), in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) and Zhendong (ÈéÆÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) Circuits, as vassal to Later Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. He made Lin Ding his secretary and assistant in his role as military governor of Zhenhai. It was said that while serving under Qian Yuanguan, Lin was honest and upright in character, and showed excellent memory. He was capable in calligraphy, in the style of Ouyang Xun and Yu Shinan. He was studious in his middle age, and was involved not only in reading but also collecting books. He also took the time to copy the books over, and to fill in the missing parts. In 937, after Qian Yuanguan assumed the title of King of Wuyue, he made Lin to be his cultural officer.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Lin was later made chancellor. As chancellor, Lin was said to be attentive to pointing out the problems in Qian Yuanguan's administration without avoiding difficult discussions. In 940, when Qian Yuanguan became intent to intervene in the civil war of Wuyue's southern neighbor Min (between Min's king Wang Yanxi and Wang Yanxi's younger brother Wang Yanzheng), Lin tried to dissuade him, but was unable to stop him from sending a detachment commanded by the generals Yang Renquan and Xue Wanzhong (ËñõËê¨Âø†) to intervene on Wang Yanzheng's behalf. The mission turned in failure when the Wang brothers ended up rejoining forces against the Wuyue army.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. The people respected Lin for foreseeing the lack of accomplishment of the mission.  Service under Qian Hongzuo  Qian Yuanguan died in 941 and was succeeded by his son Qian Hongzuo. Lin Ding remained chancellor. He died in 944 and was given the posthumous name Zhenxian (Ë≤ûÁçª, \\"honest and wise\\"). He left a 20-volume work.

It includes an old-growth forest and a ravine. The park was laid out as a residential property in 1843. It was the home of John Charles Haines, a prominent Illinois politician, from 1857 to 1896. In 1911, the Hull House Association renamed it the Joseph T. Bowen Country Club and began using the property as a summer retreat. The land was purchased by the Waukegan Park District in 1963. History In 1843, politician James Montgomery built a house on a lot of land near present-day Waukegan, Illinois, then known as Little Fort. At some point, the property was transferred to William Fay. In 1857, Fay sold the property to John Charles Haines, who used it as a summer residence. A member of the Chicago City Council, Haines was elected Mayor of Chicago the next year. He served two one-year terms and remained active in Illinois politics for the rest of his life, including a stint in the Illinois Senate. Haines built an addition to the house in the early 1870s. He died there on July 4, 1896. In 1909, the property was purchased by Fred W. Buck, the mayor of Waukegan, who intended to deed it to the city of Waukegan as a park. However, the city rejected the offering because it was too far from downtown.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200089.pdf The property was unused for two years. In 1911, Jane Addams started to look for a new summer camp for the children of Hull House, a settlement house in Chicago. Addams had previously rented land in Wisconsin and Michigan, but these campgrounds suffered from bad weather and a lack of maintenance. A realtor provided Addams with a list of three hundred potential camp properties, so she went on a trip with fellow Hull House administrator Louise DeKoven Bowen to visit sixty-seven candidates. Addams and Bowen purchased the land from Buck on December 11 after seeing the site. They renamed the land the Joseph Tilton Bowen Country Club after Bowen's recently deceased husband. When the club opened the next year, Bowen had her personal gardener plan a formal gardens, baseball field, vegetable garden, orchard, tennis courts, playground, and croquet club. During the summer, Hull House children attended for two weeks, typically if they were involved in other Hull House activities. Children were asked to pay a nominal fee to help maintain the property and to give them a sense of responsibility. The Chicago and North Western Railway provided free transportation for the children throughout the club's history. Over 40,000 children attended the Bowen Country Club from 1912 to 1963. During the off-season, the club was used for conferences and other private uses. In 1963, the Hull House Association sold the club to the Waukegan Park District for $360,000; the associated had found a new camp in East Troy, Wisconsin. A ground formed from the Waukegan Area Council of Church, Waukegan Area of the Lake County Welfare Council, and some other local churches were granted a license to use the park for $1,200 per year. The council was dissolved four years later and the Waukegan Park District assumed full operation of the property. In 1987, the park district completed the Jack Benny Center for the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra and Concert Chorus and the Bowen Park Theatre and Opera Company.

The expression minor exorcism can be used in a technical sense or a general sense. The general sense indicates any exorcism which is not a solemn exorcism of a person believed to be possessed, including various forms of deliverance ministry. This article deals only with the technical sense which specifically refers to certain prayers used with persons preparing to become baptised members of the Christian Church. These prayers request God's assistance so that the person to be baptised will be kept safe from the power of Satan or protected in a more general way from temptation.

Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 21 May 2014 . Text previously attributed to a fourth Council of Carthage in 398, now identified as a collection called Statuta Ecclesi√¶ Antiqua, prescribes in its seventh canon the rite of ordination of such an exorcist: the bishop is to give him the book containing the formulae of exorcism, saying, \\"Receive, and commit to memory, and possess the power of imposing hands on energumens, whether baptized or catechumens\\"; and the same rite was still in use in the early 20th century, except that instead of the ancient Book of Exorcisms, the Roman Pontifical, or Roman Missal, was placed into the hands of the ordinand. The same canons required that those preparing to be baptised (known as catechumens) were to undergo a daily imposition of hands by these exorcists. The 4th century Mystagogical Catechesis of Cyril of Jerusalem gives a detailed description of baptismal exorcism, from which it appears that anointing with exorcised oil formed a part of this exorcism in the East.Cyril of Jerusalem.

Anointing with oil as part of baptismal exorcism is also mentioned in the Apostolic Tradition and the Arabic Canons of Hippolytus ‚Äì early 20th Century scholarship attributed both of these documents to Hippolytus of Rome, but the origin of both sources is now disputed. Authors such as Eusebius (3rd century) and Augustine (4th century) provide further details of these minor exorcisms, prayers and ceremonies performed over adults preparing for baptism. Eusebius mentions the imposition of hands and prayer. Among the Latins, and especially at Rome, breathing accompanied with a form of exorcism and placing in the mouth a little exorcised salt, was employed in addition to the signing with the cross and the imposition of hands. Mostly those in the minor order of exorcist performed the ceremony of exorcism, then a priest signed the catechumens with the cross and laid hands upon them. The final ceremony took place on Holy Saturday, when the priest himself performed the ceremony of exorcism.Scannell, T. (1908). \\"Catechumen\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved May 21, 2014 from New Advent. An exsufflatio, or out-breathing of the demon by the candidate, which was sometimes part of the ceremony, symbolized the renunciation of the Devil, while the insufflatio, or in-breathing of the Holy Spirit, by ministers and assistants, symbolised the infusion of sanctifying grace by the sacrament.Toner, Patrick. (1909). \\"Exorcism\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved May 21, 2014 from New Advent. Augustine noted that rites of exorcism by exsufflation were also performed for the baptism of infants.Augustine of Hippo. On Marriage and Concupiscence (Book II). Paragraph 50.

(Buffalo, New York: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1887.) Revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight. After the English Reformation, the Anglican baptismal rite in the 1549, Book of Common Prayer, which was based on the Sarum Rite, \\"took place at the church door and included singing with the cross on forehead and breast and an exorcism.\\" Similarly, the Lutheran Church, in its 1526 Baptismal Booklet contained a minor exorcism before the sign of the cross. Most of these ancient ceremonies were retained in the rites still practiced by the Catholic Church in the first half of the 20th century. Contemporary practice In many Christian denominations, the minor exorcism is an integral part of the baptismal liturgy. =Anglicanism= Today, in some provinces of the Anglican Communion, the \\"Anglican liturgy does not involve an explicit exorcism or rejection of evil, but does including a signing with the cross and the wish that baptism delivers one from \\"the powers of darkness.\\" Others, such as the Anglican Church of Tanzania, however, provide for anointing and consignation that accompanies \\"the exorcism that follows the examination of the candidates\\". =Catholicism= In 1972, the minor orders were reformed; men preparing to be ordained as Catholic priests or deacons would no longer receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of lector and acolyte were retained, but redesignated as ministries. It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a ministry of exorcist if it seemed useful in that nation.Paul VI. Ministeria quaedam, II: \\"The orders hitherto called minor are henceforth to be spoken of as 'ministries'.\\" Any such lay 'exorcists' should not be confused with priests authorised to conduct major exorcism of those deemed to be possessed. As part of the wider reforms of the Second Vatican Council, all Catholic liturgical books were updated, including the rites for the baptism of adults and of children. The revised rites retained prayers designated minor exorcisms, for use during or before the ceremony of baptism itself. These would be performed as a routine part of the normal preparation for Christian baptism. In 1969, an English translation was released of the Rite of Baptism for Children (later amended 1984). Baptism could now be celebrated by a priest or deacon and included a formula of minor exorcism. This was located in the rite immediately following prayers for the child and a Litany of the Saints, and was immediately followed by an anointing with the oil of catechumens. The Second Vatican Council also called Constitutions of the Second Vatican Council: Sacrosanctam Concilium n. 64 for adults seeking baptism to be part of a formal process of preparation, or catechumenate, as was the case in the early church. A Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults was therefore prepared after the Council, and an interim English edition published in 1974. A revised and expanded version for the USA was published in 1988. The rite includes a selection of eleven texts for minor exorcisms, which may be performed on one or more occasions during the months when a person enrolled as a catechumen is preparing for baptism.In the USA edition, at paragraphs 93A‚Äì93K, indicated as translations of 113-118 and 373.1-373.5 in the Latin original. Anointing with the oil of catechumens may be repeated on several occasions.USA edition, rubrics 98-101, translating Latin 103, 127-129, 212. The notes also indicate that the minor exorcisms may be carried out by a lay catechist deputed for this purpose by the bishop, though the use of the oil of catechumens is reserved to deacons and priests. In addition to these exorcisms, the Rite for Adults includes three ceremonies called scrutinies, to be celebrated as integral parts of the Sunday Eucharist on the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sundays of Lent. Each scrutiny contains a prayer of exorcism reserved to the deacon or priest. There is also a simplified set of prayers provided for use with children mature enough to be personally catechised. The only minor exorcism in the children's rite is part of a one-off scrutiny which is offered in two forms. Both texts use the image of entering the light of Christ, turning respectively from \\"darkness\\" and from \\"whatever could make them bad\\".USA rite, 300, translating Latin prayers 339 & 392. The USA ritual book also contains additional prayers to be used with already-baptised Christians preparing to be received into full communion with the Catholic Church, including a one-off scrutiny which may be celebrated on the Second Sunday of Lent. Although it notes that a careful distinction must be made between the exorcisms of catechumens and this penitential rite for baptised adults, one possible prayer over the candidates prays that the candidates may \\"be freed of ... obstacles and falsehoods\\" while the other prays that they may \\"resist all that is deceitful and harmful\\" and that Jesus would \\"heal the wounds of their sins\\".USA rite, 463 & 470, original material in English with no Latin antecedent. =Lutheranism= In the Lutheran Church, through its Rite of Exorcism in the Baptismal Liturgy, \\"the Church has kept an opportunity to teach how serious this falleness' is, and can, through bold proclamations against the devil, teach what a blessing and joy it is to receive the Holy Spirit with the Water and Word of Holy Baptism. Rather than inviting the devil into one by ignoring his presence in all the unbaptized, the Church proclaims boldly his overthrow (James 4:7), and reminds herself, and all her members, who our enemies truly are: the devil, the world, and, yes, even our own sinful flesh. And, the Good News that one dies with Christ, and rises to new life in Him with the Water and the Word, brings us comfort in our battles with our defeated enemies (Romans 6:4; 16:20).\\" =Methodism= The baptismal liturgy used in the United Methodist Church contains a minor exorcism, when the candidate for baptism is asked to reject the 'spiritual forces of wickedness and evil powers of this world'.

In a deformed workers' state, the working class has never held political power like it did in Russia shortly after the Russian Revolution. These states are considered deformed because their political and economic structures have been imposed from the top (or from outside), and because revolutionary working class organizations are crushed. Like a degenerated workers' state, a deformed workers' state cannot be said to be a state that is transitioning to socialism. Most Trotskyists cite examples of deformed workers' states today as including Cuba, the People's Republic of China, North Korea and Vietnam. The Committee for a Workers' International has also included states such as Syria or Burma at times when they have had a nationalised economy. History The concept of deformed workers' states was developed by the theorists of the Fourth International after World War II, when the Soviet Union had militarily defeated Nazi Germany and created satellite states in Eastern Europe. Taking Leon Trotsky's concept of the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers' state, the 1951 Third World Congress of the International described the new regimes as deformed workers' states. Rather than advocating a social revolution, as in the capitalist countries, the Fourth International advocated political revolution to oust the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union (which was degenerated) and in the buffer states.Pierre Frank, \\"Evolution of Eastern Europe\\", Fourth International, November 1951. This approach has been defended by the Trotskyist currents that trace their political continuity through the World Congresses between 1951 and 1965, such as the reunified Fourth International and CWI. The League for the Fifth International argues that the Eastern European states were degenerate workers states, in that they were \\"degenerate from birth\\" being qualitative degenerated rather than having quantitative deformations. Therefore, a political revolution would be needed. Those Trotskyist currents that split from the Fourth International before 1948 over differences with Trotsky on the Soviet Union tend to disagree with this interpretation and have adopted theories describing the post-war Stalinist states as being state capitalist or bureaucratic collectivist. Some Trotskyist groups such as Socialist Action, while having some disagreements with the Cuban leadership, consider Cuba a healthy workers' state. Others, such as the Freedom Socialist Party, say that the People's Republic of China has gone too far on the road of capitalist restoration to be considered a deformed workers' state.

The Bank of Albania has the task of supervising the financial system, which currently contains 16 privately owned banks and many other financial institutions. The function of the banking network The banking network allows bank transactions to all the network members bank around the country and the world. For example, a network member bank in Albania has an order from its client to transfer funds to a network member bank in the country. The transaction of transferring of funds will be carried out by the two banks and will be validated if it does not violate any banking laws such as money laundering. Such a system forms an important part of the economic and financial system.Open Data Albania - Fitimi i Sistemit Bankar ne Shqiper History The Albanian banking network began its development in 1913 with the establishment of the central bank, but the banking network started its real expansion after the fall of Communism, in 1992. Following the new capitalist market economy structure, this network was established as a two- tier system of the central bank and secondary banks. Initially there were three secondary banks formed with state capital: Savings Bank, National Commercial Bank and the Commercial Agricultural Bank. In the following years there has been tremendous increase in the banking system, with the creation of the new private banks, privatization of the existing state owned banks and expansion of the banking network through the improvement of banking legislation. The Bank of Albania The Albanian banking network has the first-level independent Bank of Albania as its central hub. The role of the Bank of Albania is to ensure that the financial network functions well. All the second-level banks, micro-finance institutions and other financial institutions are required by law to report to the central bank. The Bank of Albania, as an independent legal institution, ensures the stability of the banking system and protects the interests of depositors and the general public. It also provides a sound banking system, whose activity is transparent and leads to an efficient market economy. Secondary banks The nodes of the banking network are represented by the Bank of Albania, 16 nodes representing all second-level banks, 17 nodes representing non-banking financial institutions, 289 nodes representing foreign exchange bureaux and savings and loan associations, and three other associations, giving a total of 325 nodes. All these institutions (nodes) have their headquarters connected with the Bank of Albania, while being the central hubs for their own branches. An example is the National Trade Bank (BKT), which as of 2014 has 61 branches of its own (nodes),BKT zgjeron rrjetin e degeve so the number of nodes in the network might reach and surpass 1000 nodes as these financial institutions keep expanding their network by adding new nodes in the system.

A Critique of Political Economy (, ; 1867‚Äì1883), is a foundational theoretical text in materialist philosophy, economics and politics by Karl Marx. Marx aimed to reveal the economic patterns underpinning the capitalist mode of production in contrast to classical political economists such as Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill. While Marx did not live to publish the planned second and third parts, they were both completed from his notes and published after his death by his colleague Friedrich Engels. Das Kapital is the most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.  Themes  In Das Kapital (1867), Marx proposes that the motivating force of capitalism is in the exploitation of labor, whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of surplus value. The owner of the means of production is able to claim the right to this surplus value because he is legally protected by the ruling regime through property rights and the legally established distribution of shares which are by law distributed only to company owners and their board members. The historical section shows how these rights were acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and \\"middle-man\\". In producing capital (produced goods), the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour. Das Kapital proposes an explanation of the \\"laws of motion\\" of the capitalist economic system from its origins to its future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, the growth of wage labour, the transformation of the workplace, the concentration of capital, commercial competition, the banking system, the decline of the profit rate, land-rents, et cetera. The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes: * Wage-labour is the basic \\"cell- form\\" (trade unit) of a capitalist society. Moreover, because commerce as a human activity implied no morality beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services, the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic, the moral and the legal spheres of human activity in society; hence, subjective moral value is separate from objective economic value. Subsequently, political economy (the just distribution of wealth) and \\"political arithmetic\\" (about taxes) were reorganized into three discrete fields of human activity, namely economics, law and ethics - politics and economics were divorced. * \\"The economic formation of society [is] a process of natural history\\". Thus, it is possible for a political economist to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism, given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had objectified human economic relations. The use of money (cash nexus) voided religious and political illusions about its economic value and replaced them with commodity fetishism, the belief that an object (commodity) has inherent economic value. Because societal economic formation is a historical process, no one person could control or direct it, thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists. The economic formation (individual commerce) of a society thus precedes the human administration of an economy (organised commerce). * The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy (German: gegens√§tzliche Bewegung) describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour and so the class struggle between labour and capital, the wage labourer and the owner of the means of production. These capitalist economic contradictions operate \\"behind the backs\\" of the capitalists and the workers as a result of their activities and yet remain beyond their immediate perceptions as men and women and as social classes.Marx, Karl. Capital: The Process of Capitalist Production. 3d German edition (tr.). p. 53. * The economic crises (recession, depression, et cetera) that are rooted in the contradictory character of the economic value of the commodity (cell-unit) of a capitalist society are the conditions that propitiate proletarian revolution‚Äîwhich The Communist Manifesto (1848) collectively identified as a weapon forged by the capitalists which the working class \\"turned against the bourgeoisie itself\\". * In a capitalist economy, technological improvement and its consequent increased production augment the amount of material wealth (use value) in society while simultaneously diminishing the economic value of the same wealth, thereby diminishing the rate of profit‚Äîa paradox characteristic of economic crisis in a capitalist economy. \\"Poverty in the midst of plenty\\" consequent to over-production and under-consumption. After two decades of economic study and preparatory work (especially regarding the theory of surplus value), the first volume appeared in 1867 as The Production Process of Capital. After Marx's death in 1883, Engels introduced Volume II: The Circulation Process of Capital in 1885; and Volume III: The Overall Process of Capitalist Production in 1894 from manuscripts and the first volume. These three volumes are collectively known as Das Kapital.  Synopsis  = Capital. Volume I = Capital, Volume I (1867) is a critical analysis of political economy, meant to reveal the contradictions of the capitalist mode of production, how it was the precursor of the socialist mode of production and of the class struggle rooted in the capitalist social relations of production. The first of three volumes of Das Kapital was published on 14 September 1867, dedicated to Wilhelm Wolff and was the sole volume published in Marx's lifetime. = Capital. Volume II = Capital, Volume II, subtitled The Process of Circulation of Capital, was prepared by Engels from notes left by Marx and published in 1885. It is divided into three parts: # The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits # The Turnover of Capital # The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital. In Volume II, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found, namely how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae, not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner and money lender, the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or functioning capitalist. Moreover, workers appear in Volume II essentially as buyers of consumer goods and therefore as sellers of the commodity labour power, rather than producers of value and surplus-value, although this latter quality established in Volume I remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based. Marx wrote in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: \\"In Book 1 [...] we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process ¬£100 becomes ¬£110, the latter will find already in existence in the market the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s)\\". This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the capitalist mode of production (Ernest Mandel, Intro to Volume II of Capital, 1978). Part 3 is the point of departure for the topic of capital accumulation which was given its Marxist treatment later in detail by Rosa Luxemburg, among others. = Capital. Volume III = Capital, Volume III, subtitled The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole, was prepared by Engels from notes left by Marx and published in 1894. It is divided into seven parts: #The conversion of Surplus Value into Profit and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit #Conversion of Profit into Average Profit #The Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall #Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital) #Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital. #Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground Rent. #Revenues and Their Sources The work is best known today for Part 3 which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the rate of profit tends to fall. This result which orthodox Marxists believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order was held by Marx and Engels to‚Äîas a result of various contradictions in the capitalist mode of production‚Äîresult in crises whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new mode of production as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of capitalism from prior forms.  Intellectual influences  The purpose of Das Kapital (1867) was a scientific foundation for the politics of the modern labour movement. The analyses were meant \\"to bring a science, by criticism, to the point where it can be dialectically represented\\" and so \\"reveal the law of motion of modern society\\" to describe how the capitalist mode of production was the precursor of the socialist mode of production. The argument is a critique of the classical economics of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and Benjamin Franklin, drawing on the dialectical method that G. W. F. Hegel developed in Science of Logic and The Phenomenology of Spirit. Other intellectual influences on Capital were the French socialists Charles Fourier, Henri de Saint-Simon, Jean Charles L√©onard de Sismondi and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon; and the Greek philosophers, especially Aristotle. At university, Marx wrote a dissertation comparing the philosophy of nature in the works of the philosophers Democritus (circa 460‚Äì370 BC) and Epicurus (341‚Äì270 BC). The logical architecture of Das Kapital is derived in part from the Politics and the Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle, including the fundamental distinction between use value and exchange value,Marx, Karl; Fowkes, Ben, trans. (1977). Capital. Vol. 1. New York: Knopf Doubleday. p. 68, 253. f. 6. Marx credits Aristotle for being the \\"first to analyze [...] the form of value\\". In addition, he identifies the categories of use and exchange value with the Aristotlean distinction between the Oeconomic and the Chrematisitic. In the Politics, the former is defined as value in use while the latter is defined as a practice in which exchange value becomes an end unto itself. the syllogisms (C-M-C' and M-C-M') for simple commodity circulation and the circulation of value as capital.Meikle, Scott (1997). Aristotle's Economic Thought. London: Clarendon Press.McCarthy, George (1992). Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. Moreover, the description of machinery under capitalist relations of production as \\"self-acting automata\\" derives from Aristotle's speculations about inanimate instruments capable of obeying commands as the condition for the abolition of slavery. In the 19th century, Marx's research of the available politico-economic literature required twelve years, usually in the British Library in London.Marx, Karl; Fowkes, Ben, trans. (1977). Capital. Vol. 1. New York: Knopf Doubleday. pp. 446.  Capital, Volume IV Karl Marx, Theorien √ºber den Mehrwert, 1956 Karl Kautsky, editor of Theories of Surplus Value At the time of his death (1883), Marx had prepared the manuscript for Das Kapital, Volume IV, a critical history of theories of surplus value of his time, the 19th century, based on the earlier manuscript Theories of Surplus Value (1862‚Äì63). The philosopher Karl Kautsky (1854‚Äì1938) published a partial edition of Marx's surplus-value critique and later published a full, three-volume edition as Theorien √ºber den Mehrwert (Theories of Surplus Value, 1905‚Äì1910). The first volume was published in English as A History of Economic Theories (1952).Columbia Encyclopedia (1994). 5th Edition. p. 1707.  Publication  Capital, Volume I (1867) was published in Marx's lifetime, but he died in 1883 before completing the manuscripts for Capital, Volume II (1885) and Capital, Volume III (1894) which friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels edited and published as the work of Marx. In the wake of the Great Recession caused by the global economic collapse of 2008‚Äì2009, Das Kapital was reportedly in high demand in Germany. = Translations = The first translated publication of Das Kapital was in the Russian Empire in March 1872. It was the first foreign publication and the English edition appeared in 1887.Ostler, Nicholas (2005). Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World. HarperCollins: London and New York. Despite Russian censorship proscribing \\"the harmful doctrines of socialism and communism\\", the Russian censors considered Das Kapital as a \\"strictly scientific work\\" of political economy, the content of which did not apply to monarchic Russia, where \\"capitalist exploitation\\" had never occurred and was officially dismissed, given \\"that very few people in Russia will read it, and even fewer will understand it\\". Nonetheless, Marx acknowledged that Russia was the country where Das Kapital \\"was read and valued more than anywhere\\". For instance, the Russian edition was the fastest selling as 3,000 copies were sold in one year while the German edition took five years to sell 1,000, therefore the Russian translation sold fifteen times faster than the German original.Figes, Orlando. A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924 (1996). London. p. 139. The foreign editions of Capital. Critique of Political Economy (1867) by Karl Marx include a Russian translation by the revolutionary socialist Mikhail Bakunin (1814‚Äì1876). Eventually, Marx's work was translated into all major languages. The English translation of volume 1 by Samuel Moore and Eleanor Marx's partner Edward Aveling, overseen by Engels, was published in 1887 as Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey, & Co. This was reissued in the 1970s by Progress Publishers in Moscow, while a more recent English translation was made by Ben Fowkes and David Fernbach (the Penguin edition). The definitive critical edition of Marx's works, known as MEGA II (Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe) Bearbeitung des Bandes: Waltraud Falk (Leiter)Karl Marx. Capital a critical analysis of capitalist production. London 1887., includes Das Kapital in German (only the first volume is in French) and shows all the versions and alterations made to the text as well as a very extensive apparatus of footnotes and cross-references. In 2012, Red Quill Books released Capital: In Manga!, a comic book version of Volume I which is an expanded English translation of the successful 2008 Japanese pocket version Das Kapital known as Manga de Dokuha.\\"Marx's 'Das Kapital' comic finds new fans in Japan\\" .

Nature. Vol. 547. pp. 401‚Äì402. Retrieved 30 July 2017. Positive reception also cited the soundness of the methodology used in producing the book, which is called immanent critique. This approach, which starts from simple category and gradually unfolds into complex categories, employed \\"internal\\" criticism that finds contradiction within and between categories while discovering aspects of reality that the categories cannot explain. This meant that Marx had to build his arguments on historical narratives and empirical evidence rather than the arbitrary application of his ideas in his evaluation of capitalism. On the other hand, Das Kapital has also received criticism. For instance, there are theorists who claimed that this text was unable to reconcile capitalist exploitation with prices dependent upon subjective wants in exchange relations. Marxists generally reply that only socially necessary labor time, that is, labor which is spent on commodities for which there is market-demand, can be considered productive labour and therefore exploited on Marx's account. There are also those who argued that Marx's so-called immiseration thesis is presumed to mean that the proletariat is absolutely immiserated. , although the existing scholarly consensus tends towards the opposite view that Marx believed that only relative immiseration would occur, that is, a fall in labor's share of output. Marx himself frequently polemicized against the view \\"that the amount of real wages ... is a fixed amount\\".

Born to a Jewish family in Palestine, he moved to Britain in 1947 and by the end of the 1950s had assumed the pen name of Tony Cliff. A founding member of the Socialist Review Group, which became the International Socialists and then the Socialist Workers Party, in 1977, Cliff was effectively the leader of all three.  Biography  Tony Cliff was born Yigael Gl√ºckstein in Zikhron Ya'akov in the Ottoman Empire's Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (In what is now Israel), in 1917, the same year Britain seized control of the territory from the Ottoman Empire during World War I. He was one of four children born to Akiva and Esther Gl√ºckstein, Jewish immigrants from Poland, who had come to Palestine as part of the Second Aliyah. His father was an engineer and contractor. He had two brothers and a sister; his brother Chaim later became a notable journalist, theatre critic, and translator. Through his sister Alexandra, he was the uncle of Israeli graphic designer David Tartakover. Cliff grew up in British-ruled Mandatory Palestine; notable Zionist and future Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett was a family friend and frequent visitor to his family home. He had two prominent uncles: the noted doctor Hillel Yaffe and agronomist; and Zionist activist Chaim Margaliot Kalvarisky. His piano teacher was a sister of Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel, and his father's business partner was one of Weizmann's brothers. He attended school in Jerusalem, then studied at the Technion in Haifa, before dropping out and studying economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In his youth, he came to identify with Communism, though he never joined the Communist Party of Palestine, as he had not met any of its members before becoming a socialist activist. However, he did join the socialist-Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, and soon became not only a Trotskyist in 1933, but also a confirmed opponent of Zionism. Along with other Hashomer Hatzair members, he joined the illegal Palestine Revolutionary Communist League, necessitating the use of several pseudonyms in three languages^source?. With the beginning of World War II, Gl√ºckstein was active in efforts to oppose mobilization of Jews to the British war effort, seeing the war as a struggle between imperialists. He was arrested by the British and imprisoned for the duration of the war. After his release he met his wife Chanie Rosenberg, a Jewish immigrant from South Africa, and they moved in together in Tel Aviv in 1945. They moved to Britain in 1947, but Cliff was never able to become a British citizen and remained a stateless person for the rest of his life. To the end of his life he spoke English with a distinct Israeli accent. He was deported by the British authorities and lived in the Republic of Ireland for several years. During this period, he was active in left-wing circles in Dublin, and was acquainted with Owen Sheehy-Skeffington and his wife, Andr√©e.Andr√©e Sheehy-Skeffington, Skeff: The Life of Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, 1909-1970 (Lilliput Press, 1991), p. 101. He was permitted to take up British residency due only to the status of his wife Chanie as a British citizen. Living in London, Gl√ºckstein again became active with the Revolutionary Communist Party, on to the leadership of which he had been co- opted. For most purposes, Gl√ºckstein was a supporter of the leadership of the RCP around Jock Haston,The War and the International: A History of the British Trotskyist Movement, 1937‚Äì1949 (with Al Richardson), Socialist Platform, London 1986. and as such he was involved with the discussions concerning the nature of those states dominated by Russia and the Communist parties initiated by a faction within the RCP. This debate was linked to other discussions on the nationalised industries in Britain and the increasingly critical stance of Haston and the RCP as to the leadership of the Fourth International with regard to Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia in particular. On the break-up of the RCP, Gl√ºckstein‚Äôs supporters joined Gerry Healy's group The Club although, having been deported to Ireland, Gl√ºckstein himself did not. In 1950, he helped launch the Socialist Review Group, which was based on a journal of the same name. This was to be the main publication for which Gl√ºckstein wrote during the 1950s, until it was superseded by International Socialism in 1960, eventually ceasing publication altogether in 1962. By the time he gained permanent residency in Britain his supporters in The Club had been expelled due to differences on Birmingham Trades Council regarding socialist policy concerning the war in Korea, where Gl√ºckstein's co-factionalists refused to take a position of support for either side in the war. Owing to his lack of established residency rights in Britain, and during his earlier exile in Ireland, Gl√ºckstein used the name Roger or Roger Tennant as a pseudonym. The first edition of his short book on Rosa Luxemburg in 1959 was possibly the first use of the pen name 'Tony Cliff'. In the 1960s, Cliff would revive many of his earlier pseudonyms in the pages of International Socialism in which journal reviews are to be found by Roger, Roger Tennant, Sakhry, Lee Rock and Tony Cliff, but none by Yigael or Yg'al Gl√ºckstein. Gl√ºckstein‚Äôs group was renamed the International Socialists in 1962, and was to grow from fewer than 100 members in 1960 until it claimed in the region of 3,000 in 1977, at which point it was renamed the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Cliff remained a leading member until his death in 2000. He was central to the various reorientations carried out in the SWP to react to changes in the position of the working class. In particular, after the high level of strike activity in the early seventies, he argued in the late seventies that the working class movement was entering a \\"downturn\\" and that the party's activity should be radically changed as a result. A fierce debate ensued, which Cliff's side eventually won. Trotskyist writer Samuel Farber, a long-time supporter of the International Socialist Organization in the US, has argued that the internal party regime established by Cliff during this period is \\"reminiscent of the one established by Zinoviev in the mid-twenties in the USSR\\" consequently leading to the various crises and splits in the group later on. Cliff's biography is, as he himself remarked, inseparable from that of the groups of which he was a leading member. Shortly before his death he underwent a major surgical operation on his heart.Birchall 2010.  Ideology  Cliff was a revolutionary socialist in the Trotskyist tradition, attempting to make Lenin's theory of the party effective in the present day. Much of his theoretical writing was aimed at immediate tasks of the party at the time. Since then, the consensus in most Trotskyist groups has been that all the states dominated by Stalinist parties ‚Äì which are characterised by state planning and state ownership of property ‚Äì are to be seen as 'degenerated workers' states' (The Soviet Union) or 'deformed workers' states' (other Stalinist states, including much of Eastern Europe). In many ways, Cliff was the main dissident from this idea, although some of his opponents have sought to associate his state capitalist view with other ideas: for example, the theory of 'bureaucratic collectivism' associated with Shachtmanite Workers Party in the United States. However, Cliff himself was insistent that his ideas owed nothing to those of Max Shachtman, or earlier proponents of the theory such as Bruno Rizzi, and made this clear in his work Bureaucratic Collectivism ‚Äì A Critique. Nevertheless, in the 1950s, his group distributed literature published by Shachtman's group and the theory of the 'permanent arms economy', which was considered one of the pillars of what became the International Socialist Tendency, and originated with Shachtman's group, though it is sometimes claimed that Cliff refused to acknowledge this publicly.This allegation seems to have originated from Jim Higgins in his booklet More Years for the Locusts, but it would seem to be contradicted by the fact that International Socialism, Nos. 47 and 49 carried prominent ads for the book The Permanent War Economy by T.N. Vance, who is now acknowledged to be the originator of the theory. Both Higgins and Cliff are listed in No. 49 as editors of that issue.  Personal life  Cliff had little or no time for any activities not directly linked to the needs of building his party (with the exception of caring for his family). He did not drink or smoke, or socialise very much. Cliff's wife, Chanie Rosenberg, was an active member successively of the SRG, IS and SWP, in which she remains active. As well as authoring many articles on social questions for the group's publications, she was an activist in the National Union of Teachers until her retirement. In addition, three of the couple's four children became members of the SWP, with one son, Donny Gluckstein, co-authoring two books with his father. Cliff is depicted as Jimmy Rock of the Rockers in Tariq Ali's satire Redemption.

He is noted for his experimental work (in particular his 1968 composition Sinfonia and his series of virtuosic solo pieces titled Sequenza) and also for his pioneering work in electronic music.  Biography  Berio with violinist Francesco D'Orazio Berio was born in Oneglia (now part of Imperia), on the Ligurian coast of Italy. He was taught how to play the piano by his father and grandfather, who were both organists. During World War II he was conscripted into the army, but on his first day, he injured his hand while learning how a gun worked and spent time in a military hospital. Following the war, Berio studied at the Milan Conservatory under Giulio Cesare Paribeni and Giorgio Federico Ghedini. He was unable to continue studying the piano because of his injured hand, so instead concentrated on composition. In 1947 came the first public performance of one of his works, a suite for piano. Berio made a living at this time by accompanying singing classes, and it was in doing this that he met the American mezzo-soprano Cathy Berberian, whom he married shortly after graduating (they divorced in 1964). Berio wrote a number of pieces that exploited her distinctive voice. In 1952, Berio went to the United States to study with Luigi Dallapiccola at Tanglewood, from whom he gained an interest in serialism. He later attended the Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik at Darmstadt, where he met Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Mauricio Kagel. He became interested in electronic music, co-founding the Studio di fonologia musicale, an electronic music studio in Milan, with Bruno Maderna in 1955. He invited a number of significant composers to work there, among them Henri Pousseur and John Cage. He also produced an electronic music periodical, Incontri Musicali. In 1960, Berio returned to Tanglewood, this time as Composer in Residence, and in 1962, on an invitation from Darius Milhaud, took a teaching post at Mills College in Oakland, California. From 1960 to 1962 Berio also taught at the Dartington International Summer School. In 1965 he began to teach at the Juilliard School, and there he founded the Juilliard Ensemble, a group dedicated to performances of contemporary music. In 1966, he again married, this time to the noted philosopher of science Susan Oyama (they divorced in 1972). His students included Louis Andriessen, Steven Gellman, Dina Koston, Steve Reich, Luca Francesconi, Giulio Castagnoli, Flavio Emilio Scogna, William Schimmel and Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead. All this time Berio had been steadily composing and building a reputation, winning the Prix Italia in 1966 for Laborintus II. His reputation was cemented when his Sinfonia was premiered in 1968. In 1972, Berio returned to Italy. From 1974 to 1980 he was the director of the electro-acoustic division of IRCAM in Paris, and in 1977 he married the musicologist Talia Pecker. In 1987 he opened Tempo Reale, a centre for musical research and production based in Florence. In 1988 he was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music, London. In 1989 he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. The same year, he became Distinguished Composer in Residence at Harvard University, remaining there until 2000. In 1993‚Äì94 he gave the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard, later published as Remembering the Future. He was active as a conductor and continued to compose to the end of his life. In 2000, he became Presidente and Sovrintendente at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. Luciano Berio died in 2003 in a hospital in Rome. He was an atheist.Giovanni Arledler, La musica e la Bibbia, \\"La Civilt√† Cattolica\\" no. 3372, December 15th, 1990, pp. 593‚Äì594. He was noted for his sense of humour. He gave a two-hour seminar at a summer school in the United States analysing Beethoven's 7th Symphony, demonstrating that it was a work of radical genius. The next day he gave another two-hour seminar, with a completely straight face, showing why it was hopelessly flawed and a creative dead-end.  Work  Berio's electronic work dates for the most part from his time at Milan's Studio di Fonologia. One of the most influential works he produced there was Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) (1958), based on Cathy Berberian reading from James Joyce's Ulysses, which can be considered as the first electroacoustic composition in the history of western music made with voice and elaboration of it by technological means. A later work, Visage (1961) sees Berio creating a wordless emotional language by cutting up and rearranging a recording of Cathy Berberian's voice; therefore the composition is based on the symbolic and representative charge of gestures and voice inflections, ‚Äúfrom inarticulate sounds to syllables, from laughter to tears and singing, from aphasia to inflection patterns from specific languages: English and Italian, Hebrew and the Neapolitan dialect.\\" In 1968, Berio completed O King a work which exists in two versions: one for voice, flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano, the other for eight voices and orchestra. The piece is in memory of Martin Luther King Jr., who had been assassinated shortly before its composition. In it, the voice(s) intones first the vowels, and then the consonants which make up his name, only stringing them together to give his name in full in the final bars. The orchestral version of O King was, shortly after its completion, integrated into what is perhaps Berio's most famous work, Sinfonia (1967‚Äì69), for orchestra and eight amplified voices. The voices are not used in a traditional classical way; they frequently do not sing at all, but speak, whisper and shout. The third movement is a collage of literary and musical quotations. A-Ronne (1974) is similarly collaged, but with the focus more squarely on the voice. It was originally written as a radio program for five actors, and reworked in 1975 for eight vocalists and an optional keyboard part. The work is one of a number of collaborations with the poet Edoardo Sanguineti, who for this piece provided a text full of quotations from sources including the Bible, T. S. Eliot and Karl Marx. Another example of the influence of Sanguineti is the large work Coro (premiered 1977), scored for orchestra, solo voices, and a large choir, whose members are paired with instruments of the orchestra. The work extends over roughly an hour, and explores a number of themes within a framework of folk music from a variety of regions: Chile, North America, Africa. Recurrent themes are the expression of love and passion; the pain of being parted from loved ones; the death of a wife or husband. A line repeated often is \\"come and see the blood on the streets\\", a reference to a poem by Pablo Neruda, written in the context of the outbreak of the civil war in Spain. In the last period of his production Berio was also interested in the use of live electronics, applied in some compositions as Ofan√¨m (1988‚Äì1997) and Altra voce (1999): the electronic music and technical part of such pieces was always performed by the musicians of Tempo Reale. = Sacher = Along with eleven other composers, (Conrad Beck, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Wolfgang Fortner, Alberto Ginastera, Crist√≥bal Halffter, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Klaus Huber and Witold Lutos≈Çawski), Berio was asked by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to celebrate the Swiss conductor Paul Sacher's 70th birthday by composing a solo cello piece using the letters of Sacher's name (eS, A, C, H, E, Re). This was published under the name 12 Hommages √† Paul Sacher.Stowell, Robin, \\"Other solo repertory\\" in R. Stowell (ed.), (1999) The Cambridge Companion to the Cello. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 144 Berio's piece is called Les mots sont all√©s (The Words Are Gone). Some of the resulting compositions were performed in Zurich on 2 May 1976 and the whole \\"Sacher\\" project was first performed completely by Czech cellist Franti≈°ek Brikcius in Prague in 2011. Music Les mots sont all√©s has been performed since by cellists Siegfried Palm, Jean-Michelle Fonteneau, and Alexander Ezerman among others. = Sequenza = Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands in the Hague in 1972 Berio composed a series of virtuoso works for solo instruments under the name Sequenza. The first, Sequenza I came in 1958 and is for flute; the last, Sequenza XIV (2002) is for cello. These works explore the full possibilities of each instrument, often calling for extended techniques. The various Sequenze are as follows: *Sequenza I for flute (1958); *Sequenza II for harp (1963); *Sequenza III for woman's voice (1966); *Sequenza IV for piano (1966); *Sequenza V for trombone (1966); *Sequenza VI for viola (1967); *Sequenza VII for oboe (1969) (rev. by Jacqueline Leclair and renamed Sequenza VIIa in 2000); *Sequenza VIIb for soprano saxophone (adaptation by Claude Delangle in 1993); *Sequenza VIII for violin (1976); *Sequenza IXa for clarinet (1980); *Sequenza IXb for alto saxophone (adaptation by the composer in 1981); *Sequenza IXc for bass clarinet (adaptation by Rocco Parisi in 1998); *Sequenza X for trumpet in C and piano resonance (1984); *Sequenza XI for guitar (1987‚Äì88); *Sequenza XII for bassoon (1995); *Sequenza XIII for accordion \\"Chanson\\" (1995); *Sequenza XIVa for violoncello (2002); *Sequenza XIVb for double bass (adaptation by Stefano Scodanibbio in 2004). = Stage works = *Opera (1970, revised 1977) *La vera storia (1982) *Un re in ascolto (1984) *Vor, w√§hrend, nach Zaide (1995; Prelude, interlude and ending for an opera fragment by Mozart) *Outis (1996) *Cronaca del luogo (1999) *Turandot (2001; Ending for the Puccini opera) = Transcriptions and arrangements = Berio is known for adapting and transforming the music of others, but he also adapted his own compositions: the series of Sequenze gave rise to a series of works called Chemins each based on one of the Sequenze. Chemins II (1967), for instance, takes the original Sequenza VI (1967) for viola and adapts it for solo viola and nine other instruments. Chemins II was itself transformed into Chemins III (1968) by the addition of an orchestra, and there also exists Chemins IIb, a version of Chemins II without the solo viola but with a larger ensemble, and Chemins IIc, which is Chemins IIb with an added solo bass clarinet. The Sequenze were also shaped into new works under titles other than Chemins; Corale (1981), for example, is based on Sequenza VIII. As well as original works, Berio made a number of arrangements of works by other composers, among them Claudio Monteverdi, Henry Purcell, Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler and Kurt Weill. For Berberian he wrote Folk Songs (1964; a set of arrangements of folk songs). He also wrote an ending for Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot (premiered in Las Palmas on 24 January 2002 and in the same year in Los Angeles, Amsterdam and Salzburg) and in Rendering (1989) took the few sketches Franz Schubert made for his Symphony No. 10 and completed them by adding music derived from other Schubert works. Transcription is a vital part of even Berio's \\"creative\\" works. In \\"Two Interviews\\", Berio mused about what a college course in transcription would look like, looking not only at Franz Liszt, Ferruccio Busoni, Igor Stravinsky, Johann Sebastian Bach, himself, and others, but to what extent composition is always self-transcription. In this respect, Berio rejected and distanced himself from notions of \\"collage\\", preferring instead the position of \\"transcriber\\", arguing that \\"collage\\" implies a certain arbitrary abandon that runs counter to the careful control of his highly intellectual play, especially within Sinfonia but throughout his \\"deconstructive\\" works. Rather, each quotation carefully evokes the context of its original work, creating an open web, but an open web with highly specific referents and a vigorously defined, if self-proliferating, signifier-signified relationship. \\"I'm not interested in collages, and they amuse me only when I'm doing them with my children: then they become an exercise in relativizing and 'decontextualizing' images, an elementary exercise whose healthy cynicism won't do anyone any harm\\", Berio told interviewer Rossana Dalmonte. Perhaps Berio's most notable contribution to the world of post-WWII non-serial experimental music, running throughout most of his works, is his engagement with the broader world of critical theory (epitomized by his lifelong friendship with linguist and critical theorist Umberto Eco) through his compositions. Berio's works are often analytic acts: deliberately analysing myths, stories, the components of words themselves, his own compositions, or preexisting musical works. In other words, it is not only the composition of the \\"collage\\" that conveys meaning; it is the particular composition of the component \\"sound-image\\" that conveys meaning, even extra-musical meaning. The technique of the \\"collage\\", that he is associated with, is, then, less a neutral process than a conscious, Joycean process of analysis-by-composition, a form of analytic transcription of which Sinfonia and the Chemins are the most prominent examples. Berio often offers his compositions as forms of academic or cultural discourse themselves rather than as \\"mere\\" fodder for them. Among Berio's other compositions are Circles (1960), Sequenza III (1966), and Recital I (for Cathy) (1972), all written for Berberian, and a number of stage works, with Un re in ascolto, a collaboration with Italo Calvino, the best known. Berio's \\"central instrumental focus\\", if such a thing exists, is probably with the voice, the piano, the flute, and the strings. He wrote many remarkable pieces for piano which vary from solo pieces to essentially concerto pieces (points on the curve to find, concerto for two pianos, and Coro, which has a strong backbone of harmonic and melodic material entirely based on the piano part). Lesser known works make use of a very distinguishable polyphony unique to Berio that develops in a variety of ways. This occurs in several works, but most recognisably in compositions for small instrumental combinations. Examples are Diff√©rences, for flute, harp, clarinet, cello, violin and electronic sounds, Agnus, for three clarinets and voices, Tempi concertanti for flute and four instrumental groups, Linea, for marimba, vibraphone, and two pianos, and Chemins IV, for eleven strings and oboe, as well as Canticum novissimi testamenti for 8 voices, 4 clarinets and saxophone quartet.

These systems may encompass state ownership, employee ownership, cooperative ownership, citizen ownership of equity,, common ownership, or collective ownership. Historically social ownership implied that capital and factor markets would cease to exist under the assumption that market exchanges within the production process would be made redundant if capital goods were owned by a single entity or network of entities representing society, but the articulation of models of market socialism where factor markets are utilized for allocating capital goods between socially owned enterprises broadened the definition to include autonomous entities within a market economy. Social ownership of the means of production is the common defining characteristic of all the various forms of socialism. The two major forms of social ownership are society-wide public ownership and cooperative ownership. The distinction between these two forms lies in the distribution of the surplus product. With society-wide public ownership, the surplus is distributed to all members of the public through a social dividend whereas with co-operative ownership the economic surplus of an enterprise is controlled by all the worker-members of that specific enterprise.Toward a Socialism for the Future, in the Wake of the Demise of the Socialism of the Past, by Weisskopf, Thomas E. 1992. Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 24, No. 3‚Äì4, p. 10: \\"Here again there are two principal variants of such social claims to income, depending on the nature of the community holding the claim: (1) Public surplus appropriation: the surplus of the enterprise is distributed to an agency of the government (at the national, regional, or local level), representing a corresponding community of citizens. (2) Worker surplus appropriation: the surplus of the enterprise is distributed to enterprise workers.\\" The goal of social ownership is to eliminate the distinction between the class of private owners who are the recipients of passive property income and workers who are the recipients of labor income (wages, salaries and commissions), so that the surplus product (or economic profits in the case of market socialism) belong either to society as a whole or to the members of a given enterprise. Social ownership would enable productivity gains from labor automation to progressively reduce the average length of the working day instead of creating job insecurity and unemployment. Reduction of necessary work time is central to the Marxist concept of human freedom and overcoming alienation, a concept widely shared by Marxist and non-Marxist socialists alike.

New German Critique, No. 6, pp. 60-81: \\"The socialization demanded by socialism signifies a new regulation of production with the goal of replacing the private capitalist economy with a socialist communal economy.\\"  Objectives  Social ownership is variously advocated to end the Marxian concept of exploitation, to ensure that income distribution reflects individual contributions to the social product, to eliminate unemployment arising from technological change, to ensure a more egalitarian distribution of the economy's surplus,Market Socialism, a case for rejuvenation, by Pranab Bardhan and John Roemer. 1992. Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 101‚Äì16: \\"Public ownership in the narrow sense of state control of firms is not necessary to achieve one of socialism's goals, a relatively egalitarian distribution of the economy's surplus. We take public ownership, in a wider sense, to mean that the distribution of the profits of firms is decided by the political democratic processyet control of firms might well be in the hands of agents that do not represent the state.\\" or to create the foundations for a non-market socialist economy. In Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism, social ownership of the means of production emerges in response to the contradictions between socialized production and private appropriation of surplus value in capitalism. Marx argued that productivity gains arising from the substitution of variable capital (labor inputs) for constant capital (capital inputs) would cause labor displacement to outstrip the demand for labor. This process would lead to stagnant wages and rising unemployment for the working class alongside rising property income for the capitalist class, further leading to an over- accumulation of capital. Marx argued that this dynamic would reach a point where social ownership of the highly automated means of production would be necessitated to resolve this contradiction and resulting social strife. Thus the Marxist case for social ownership and socialism is not based on any moral critique of the distribution of property income (wealth) in capitalism, but rather the Marxist case for socialism is based on a systematic analysis of the development and limits of the dynamic of capital accumulation.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93‚Äì133: \\"It was not the moral unworthiness of the exploitive surplus value mechanism which Marx proposed as the instrumentality of the collapse of capitalism. It was rather the consequences of that mechanism in providing capitalists with so much ill- gotten income that it would ultimately effectively ‚Äòchoke‚Äô the system.\\" For Marx, social ownership would lay the foundations for the transcendence of the capitalist law of value and the accumulation of capital, thereby creating the foundation for socialist planning. The ultimate goal of social ownership of productive property for Marx was to expand the \\"realm of freedom\\" by shortening average work hours so that individuals would have progressively larger portion of their time to pursue their genuine and creative interests. Thus the end goal of social ownership is the transcendence of the Marxist concept of alienation. The economist David McMullen identifies five major benefits of social ownership, where he defines it as society-wide ownership of productive property: first, workers would be more productive and have greater motivation since they would directly benefit from increased productivity, secondly this ownership stake would enable greater accountability on the part of individuals and organizations, thirdly social ownership would eliminate unemployment, fourth it would enable the better flow of information within the economy, and finally it would eliminate wasteful activities associated with \\"wheeling and dealing\\" and wasteful government activities intended to curb such behavior and deal with unemployment. From a non-Marxist, market socialist perspective, the clearest benefit of social ownership is an equalization of the distribution of property income, eliminating the vast disparities in wealth that arise from private ownership under capitalism. Property income (profit, interest and rent) is distinguished from labor income (wages and salaries) which in a socialist system would continue to be unequal based on one's marginal product of laborsocial ownership would only equalize passive property income.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93‚Äì133: \\"The ‚Äòfirst order effect‚Äô of socialization will be an equalization of the property return, and it is to this that we must turn for the clearest and most certain benefit...The clearest, most immediate, and most obvious social improvement from socialism would be the abrogation of the pathologically unequal distribution of property return under capitalism.\\" Notable non-Marxist and Marxist socialist theorists alike have argued that the most significant argument for social ownership of the means of production is to enable productivity gains to ease the work burden for all individuals in society, resulting in progressively shorter hours of work with increasing automation and thus a greater amount of free time for individuals to engage in creative pursuits and leisure.To The Rural Poor, by Lenin, Vladimir Ilich. Collected Works, 6, Marxists, p. 366: \\"Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society.\\" = Criticism of private ownership = Social ownership is contrasted with the concept of private ownership and is promoted as a solution to what its proponents see as being inherent issues to private ownership. Market socialists and non-market socialists therefore have slightly different conceptions of social ownership. The former believe that private ownership and private appropriation of property income is the fundamental issue with capitalism, and thus believe that the process of capital accumulation and profit-maximizing enterprise can be retained, with their profits being used to benefit society in the form of a social dividend. By contrast, non-market socialists argue that the major problems with capitalism arise from its contradictory economic laws that make it unsustainable and historically limited. Therefore, social ownership is seen as a component of the establishment of non-market coordination and alternative \\"socialist laws of motion\\" that overcome the systemic issues of capital accumulation. The socialist critique of private ownership is heavily influenced by the Marxian analysis of capitalist property forms as part of its broader critique of alienation and exploitation in capitalism. Although there is considerable disagreement among socialists about the validity of certain aspects of Marxian analysis, the majority of socialists are sympathetic to Marx's views on exploitation and alienation. Socialists critique the private appropriation of property income on the grounds that because such income does not correspond to a return on any productive activity and is generated by the working class, it represents exploitation. The property-owning (capitalist) class lives off passive property income produced by the working population by virtue of their claim to ownership in the form of stock, bonds or private equity. This exploitative arrangement is perpetuated due to the structure of capitalist society. From this perspective, capitalism is regarded as class system akin to historical class systems like slavery and feudalism. Private ownership has also been criticized on ethical grounds by the economist James Yunker. Yunker argues that because passive property income requires no mental or physical exertion on the part of the recipient and because its appropriation by a small group of private owners is the source of the vast inequalities in contemporary capitalism, this establishes the ethical case for social ownership and socialist transformation.The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism, by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93‚Äì133: \\"From the human point of view, return paid to non-human factors of production is unearned and equivalent to a free gift of nature. It is the personal appropriation of this free gift of nature by a small minority of society under contemporary capitalism which establishes the ethical unworthiness of capitalism and the desirability of a socialist transformation...The employment of capital instruments and natural resources in economic production requires no personal hardship or exertion from any human being. The economic services provided by these factors of production are not corporeally inherent in human beings. The opposite is true of labor services, which can only be provided through the physical and mental activity of human beings...the really grossly exaggerated personal incomes in society are dominated by property income, and this source of inequality would be abrogated by the equalization of property income distribution.\\"  Socialization as a process  Socialization is conceived as a process that transforms the economic processes and, by extension, the social relations within an economy. As such, it is distinct from the process of \\"nationalization\\" which does not necessarily imply a transformation of the organizational structure of organizations or the transformation of the economic framework under which economic organizations operate. Marxists envision socialization as a restructuring of social relations to overcome alienation, replacing hierarchical social relations within the workplace with an association of members. = Socialization debates = During the 1920s, socialists in Austria and Germany were engaged in a comprehensive dialogue about the nature of socialization and how a program of socialization could be effectively carried out. Austrian scientific thinkers whose ideas were based on Ernst Mach's empiricist notion of energy and technological optimism, including Josef Popper-Lynkeus and Carl Ballod, proposed plans for rational allocation of exhaustible energy and materials through statistical empirical methods. This conception of non-capitalist calculation involved the use of energy and time units, the latter being viewed as the standard cardinal unity of measurement for socialist calculation. These thinkers belonged to a technical school of thought called \\"scientific utopianism\\", which is an approach to social engineering that explores possible forms of social organization. The most notable thinker belonging to this school of thought was the Viennese philosopher and economist Otto Neurath, whose conception of socialism as a natural, non-monetary economic system became widespread within the socialist movement following the end of World War I. Neurath's position was held in contrast to other socialists in this period, including the revisionist perspective stemming from Eduard Bernstein, the orthodox social democratic perspective of Karl Kautsky, the Austro-Marxism models of labor- time calculation from Otto Bauer and the emerging school of neoclassical market socialism. Neurath's position opposed all models of market socialism because it rejected the use of money, but was also held in contrast with the more orthodox Marxist conception of socialism held by Karl Kautsky, where socialism only entails the elimination of money as capital along with super- session of the process of capital accumulation. Otto Neurath conceptualized a comprehensive view of socialization during the socialization debates. \\"Total socialization\\" involved not only a form of ownership but also the establishment of economic planning based on calculation in kind, and was contrasted with \\"partial socialization\\". \\"Partial socialization\\" involved the use of in-kind calculation and planning within a single organization, which externally operated within the framework of a monetary market economy. Neurath's conception of socialism was the initial point of criticism of Ludwig von Mises in the socialist calculation debate.Otto Neurath‚Äôs Economics in Context, by Nemeth, Elisabeth; Schmitz, Stefan W.; Uebel, Thomas E. 2007. In the subsequent socialist calculation debates, a dichotomy between socialists emerged between those who argued that socialization entailed the end of monetary valuation and capital markets, and those who argued that monetary prices could be used within a socialized economy. A further distinction arose between market socialists who argued that social ownership can be achieved within the context of a market economy, where worker-owned or publicly owned enterprises maximized profit and those who argued that socially owned enterprises operate according to other criteria, like marginal cost pricing.  Typology  Social ownership and socialization is categorically distinct from the process of nationalization. In most cases, \\"socialization\\" is understood to be a deeper process of transforming the social relations of production within economic organizations as opposed to simply changing titles of ownership. In this sense, \\"socialization\\" often involves both a change in ownership and a change in organizational management, including self-management or some form of workplace democracy in place of a strict hierarchical form of control. More fundamentally, social ownership implies that the surplus product (or economic profits) generated by publicly owned enterprise accrues to all of societystate ownership does not necessarily imply this. Fundamentally, there are two major forms of \\"social ownership\\". The first is society-wide public ownership by an entity or network of entities representing society. The second major form of social ownership is employee-owned cooperative enterprise, with the members of each individual enterprise being co-owners of their organization. These possibilities give rise to a socialization dilemma, faced by advocates of public ownership: if social ownership is entrusted exclusively to state agents, then it is liable to bureaucratization; if it is entrusted exclusively to workers, then it is liable to monopoly power and abuse of market position. Additionally, there are two major forms of management or \\"social control\\" for socially owned organizations, both of which can exist alongside the two major modes of social ownership. The first variant of control is public management, where enterprises are run by management held accountable to an agency representing the public either at the level of national, regional or local government. The second form of social control is worker self-management, where managers are elected by the member-workers of each individual enterprise or enterprises are run according to self-directed work processes.Toward a Socialism for the Future, in the Wake of the Demise of the Socialism of the Past, by Weisskopf, Thomas E. 1992. Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 24, No. 3‚Äì4, p. 9: \\"There are two principal variants of such control, depending on the nature of the community in whom control rights are vested: (1) Public management: enterprises are run by managers who are appointed by and accountable to an agency of government (at the national, regional, or local level), which agency represents a corresponding politically-constituted community of citizens. (2) Worker self-management: enterprises are run by managers who are appointed by and accountable to those who work in them...with control rights resting ultimately with the community of enterprise workers ...\\" The exact forms of social ownership vary depending on whether or not they are conceptualized as part of a market economy or as part of a non-market planned economy. = Public ownership = Public ownership can exist both within the framework of a market economy and within the framework of a non-market planned economy. In market socialist proposals, public ownership takes the form of state-owned enterprises that acquire capital goods in capital markets and operate to maximize profits, which are then distributed among the entire population in the form of a social dividend. In non-market models of socialism, public ownership takes the form of a single entity or a network of public entities coordinated by economic planning. A contemporary approach to socialism involves linking together production and distribution units by modern computers to achieve rapid feedback in the allocation of capital inputs to achieve efficient economic planning. The economist Alec Nove defines social ownership as a form of autonomous public ownership, drawing a distinction between state-owned and directed enterprises. Nove advocates for the existence of both forms of enterprise in his model of feasible socialism.The Economics of Feasible Socialism Revisited, by Nove, Alexander. 1991. pp. 212‚Äì13): \\"Radoslav Selucky opts for what he calls 'social ownership', with 'means of production managed by those who make use of them', separated from the state...1) State enterprises, centrally controlled and administered, hereinafter referred to as centralized state corporations. 2) Publicly owned (or socially owned) enterprises with full autonomy and a management responsible to the workforce, hereinafter socialized enterprises.\\" Public ownership was advocated by neoclassical socialist economists during the interwar socialist calculation debate, most notable Oskar Lange, Fred M. Taylor, Abba P. Lerner and Maurice Dobb. Neoclassical market socialist economists in the latter half of the 20th century who advocated public ownership highlighted the distinction between \\"control\\" and \\"ownership\\". John Roemer and Pranab Bardhan argued that public ownership, meaning a relatively egalitarian distribution of enterprise profits, does not require state control as publicly owned enterprises can be controlled by agents who do not represent the state. David McMullen's concept of decentralized non-market socialism advocates social ownership of the means of production, believing it to be far more efficient than private ownership. In his proposal, property titles would be replaced by \\"usership\\" rights and the exchange of capital goods would no longer be possible. Market exchange in capital goods would be replaced by internal transfers of resources, but an internal and decentralized price system would be fundamental to this systems' operation. However, by itself public ownership is not socialist as it can exist under a wide variety of different political and economic systems. State ownership by itself does not imply social ownership where income rights belong to society as a whole. As such, state ownership is only one possible expression of public ownership, which itself is one variation of the broader concept of social ownership. = Social ownership of equity = The social ownership of capital and corporate stock has been proposed in the context of a market socialist system, where social ownership is achieved either by having a public body or employee-owned pension funds that own corporate stock. The American economist John Roemer developed a model of market socialism that features a form of public ownership where individuals receive a non-transferable coupon entitling them to a share of the profits generated by autonomous non-governmental publicly owned enterprises. In this model, \\"social ownership\\" refers to citizen ownership of equity in a market economy. James Yunker argues that public ownership of the means of production can be achieved in the same way private ownership is achieved in modern capitalism, using the shareholder system that effectively separates management from ownership. Yunker posits that social ownership can be achieved by having a public body, designated the Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO), own the shares of publicly listed firms without affecting market-based allocation of capital inputs. Yunker termed this model Pragmatic market socialism and argued that it would be at least as efficient as modern-day capitalism while providing superior social outcomes as public ownership would enable profits to be distributed among the entire population rather than going largely to a class of inheriting rentiers. An alternative form of social ownership of equity is ownership of corporate stock through wage earner funds and pension funds. The underlying concept was first expounded upon in 1976 by the management theorist Peter Drucker, who argued that pension funds could reconcile employees' need for financial security with capital's need to be mobile and diversified, referring to this development as \\"pension fund socialism\\". In Sweden during the late 1970s, the Meidner program was advanced by the Swedish Social Democratic Party as a way to socialize enterprises through employee wage earners' funds, which would be used to purchase corporate stock. Rudolf Meidner's original plan was to require Swedish companies over a certain size to issue shares equal to 20 percent of profits, which would be owned by wage-earner funds controlled by employees through their trade unions. This plan was rejected and a watered-down proposal was adopted in 1984, which left corporate decision making just as it was and limited the scope of employee ownership to less than 3.5% of listed company shares in 1990.The Social Ownership of Capital, by Minns, Richard. 1996. New Left Review, Vol. 219, pp. 44‚Äì45.\\" = Cooperative ownership = Cooperative ownership is the organization of economic units into enterprises owned by their workforce (workers cooperative) or by customers who use the products of the enterprise (this latter concept is called a consumer cooperative). Cooperatives are often organized around some form of self-management, either in the form of elected managers held accountable to the workforce, or in the form of direct management of work processes by the workers themselves. Cooperatives are often proposed by proponents of market socialism, most notably by the economists Branko Horvat, Jaroslav Vanek and Richard Wolff. Cooperative ownership comes in various forms, ranging from direct workers' ownership, employee stock ownership plans through pension funds, to the weakest version involving profit sharing. Profit-sharing and varying degrees of self-management or \\"Holacracy\\" is practiced in many of the high-technology companies of Silicon Valley. The earliest model of cooperative socialism is mutualism, proposed by the French anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. In this system, the state would be abolished and economic enterprises would be owned and operated as producer cooperatives, with worker- members compensated in labor vouchers. The model of market socialism promoted in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was based on what was officially called \\"social ownership\\", involving an arrangement where workers of each firm each became members and joint-owners and managed their own affairs in a system of workers' self-management. Contemporary proponents of cooperative ownership cite higher motivation and performance in existing cooperatives. Critics argue that cooperative ownership by itself does not resolve the structural issues of capitalism like economic crises and the business cycle, and that cooperatives have an incentive to limit employment in order to boost the income of existing members. = Commons and peer-to-peer = In the context of non-market proposals, social ownership can include holding the means of producing wealth in common (common ownership), with the concept of \\"usership\\" replacing the concept of ownership. Commons-based peer production involves the distribution of a critical mass of inputs and all outputs through information networks as free goods rather than commodities to be sold for profit by capitalist firms. The economist Pat Devine defines social ownership as \\"ownership by those who are affected bywho have an interest inthe use of the assets involved\\", distinguishing it from other forms of ownership. Devine argues that this variant of social ownership will be more efficient than the other types of ownership because \\"it enables the tacit knowledge of all those affected to be drawn upon in the process of negotiating what should be done to further the social interest in any particular context\\". The phrases \\"social production\\" and \\"social peer-to-peer\\" production have been used to classify the type of workplace relationships and ownership structures found in the open-source software movement and Commons-based peer production processes, which operate, value and allocate value without private property and market exchange.  Ownership in Soviet-type economies  In Soviet-type economies, the means of production and natural resources were almost entirely owned by the state and collective enterprises. State enterprises were integrated into a national planning system, where factor inputs were allocated to them by the Ministry for Technical Supply (Gossnab). According to The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, \\"socialist ownership\\" is a form of social ownership that forms the basis for the socialist system, involving the collective appropriation of material wealth by working people. Social ownership arises out of the course of capitalist development, creating the objective conditions for further socialist transformation and for the emergence of a planned economy with the aim of raising the living standards for everyone in society.  Misuse of the term  Particularly in the United States, the term socialization has been mistakenly used to refer to any state or government- operated industry or service (the proper term for such being either nationalization or municipalization). It has also been incorrectly used to mean any tax-funded programs, whether privately run or government run.  Notes   Further reading  * Korsch, Karl (1975). \\"What Is Socialization?

The term was developed by Leon Trotsky in The Revolution BetrayedLeon Trotsky, The Revolution Betrayed, 1936 and in other works.See, for example, Leon Trotsky, \\"The USSR and Problems of the Transitional Epoch\\", extract from The Transitional Program (1938), or \\"The ABC of Materialist Dialectics\\", extract From \\"A Petty-Bourgeois Opposition in the Socialist Workers Party\\" (1939), in Leon Trotsky, In Defense of Marxism, 1942. The Soviet experience Trotsky held that in Russia between the 1917 October Revolution and up to Joseph Stalin's consolidation of power, there was a genuine workers' state. The bourgeoisie had been politically overthrown by the working class and the economic basis of that state lay in collective ownership of the means of production. Contrary to the predictions of many socialists such as Lenin, the revolution failed to spread to Germany and other industrial Western European countries (although there were massive upheavals of working people in some of these countries), and consequently the Soviet state began to degenerate. This was worsened by the material and political degeneration of the Russian working class by the Civil War of 1917‚Äì1923. After the death of Lenin in 1924, the ruling stratum of the Soviet Union, consolidated around Stalin, was held to be a bureaucratic caste, and not a new ruling class, because its political control did not also extend to economic ownership. The theory that the Soviet Union was a degenerated workers' state is closely connected to Trotsky's call for a political revolution in the USSR, as well as Trotsky's call for defense of the USSR against capitalist restoration. Trotsky summarized the more optimistic arguments within the International Left Opposition thus: Trotsky always emphasised that the degenerated workers' state was not a new form of society, but a transitional phase between capitalism and socialism (and closer to capitalism) that would inevitably collapse into one form or the other. He argued however that whether this downfall led to the restoration of workers' democracy or to capitalist restoration would depend on whether the movement to overthrow the dictatorship of the bureaucracy was led by the organised working class: \\"Degenerated\\" vs. \\"deformed\\" The term \\"degenerated workers' state\\" commonly refers only to the Soviet Union. Trotskyists of the Fourth International (founded in 1938) coined the term \\"deformed workers' state\\" to describe states (like the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe as well as China) based upon collectivised means of production, but in which the working class never held direct political power. The two terms therefore label similar phenomena in that they both refer to states where the bourgeoisie no longer holds power, where the means of production has been socialised and where an unaccountable bureaucratic elite holds the political reins. They differ in the history of how their situation has arisen: through the bureaucratic degeneration of a genuine workers' democracy, as in the Soviet Union; or through the establishment of a deformed workers' state resulting from the overthrow of bourgeois rule and ownership by some force other than the mass action of the organised working class, such as by an invasion, a guerrilla army, or a military coup. Critics Besides the supporters of the Soviet Union holding the belief that the state was a healthy workers' state, the theory has been criticised from within the Trotskyist movement, and by other socialists critical of the Soviet Union. Among the disputed issues are the relationships between a workers' state (of any type), and a planned economy. Some authorities tend to equate the two concepts, while others draw sharp distinctions between them. Among Trotskyists, alternative but similar theories include state capitalism and bureaucratic collectivism. Related terms Another theoretical term used by some Trotskyists, most notably Ted Grant, to describe the dictatorial rule of bureaucracies in such \\"degenerated\\" or \\"deformed\\" workers' states is proletarian bonapartism.Trotsky (1935) The Workers' State, Thermidor and Bonapartism http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/02/ws-therm-bon.htm See also * New class * State socialism References Category:Political science terminology Category:Trotskyism Category:Marxist theory Category:History of socialism ","title":"Degenerated workers' state"},{"id":"42824006","text":"Beverly Klass (born November 8, 1956) is an American professional golfer.

The Coalition was launched at a public meeting of 2,000 people at Friends House on Euston Road in London, on 21 September which was chaired by Lindsey German, then active in the Socialist Workers Party. \\"The Stop the War Coalition has been formed to encourage and mobilise the largest possible movement against the war\\", said the founding statement. \\"Its aim is simple-to draw together everyone who wants to stop this madness, and to present the anti-war arguments which are squeezed out of the media.\\" Among the sponsors of the Coalition were the former Labour MP Tony Benn, and the Labour MPs George Galloway, Tam Dalyell and Jeremy Corbyn, in addition to Tariq Ali, Harold Pinter, Suresh Grover and Andrew Murray. German became Convenor of the Coalition and a meeting on 28 October settled the Coalition's official aims. This meeting also elected a steering committee which consisted of representatives of Labour Left Briefing and the Communist Party of Britain. Representatives of the Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee) and the Alliance for Workers' LibertyTina Becker \\"Building for 18 November\\", Weekly Worker, 1 November 2001 failed to get elected, although both became members of the Coalition and participated in its activities. At this time, it was alleged that the SWP dominated the organisation, although German, Rees and Nineham left the SWP in 2009. The involvement of George Galloway among the leading figures was criticised by Nick Cohen in The Observer because of his alleged \\"support for every anti-American tyrant on the planet\\".Nick Cohen \\"Galloway can no longer count on the indulgence of polite society\\", The Observer, 15 January 2006 The Conservative MP Julian Lewis, in a letter to The Daily Telegraph in 2003, referring to Andrew Murray's involvement in the Communist Party of Britain, wrote that he \\"had thought\\" his \\"days of unearthing totalitarians at the heart of 'peace movements'\\" had ended when the Soviet Union collapsed, but Murray was now in a \\"key position, being quoted by the anti-war media as if he were a representative of democratic politics\\". In this early period, Stop the War had a broad base. Ann Treneman wrote in The Times in January 2003 that the \\"two most obvious strands\\" of StWC support consisted of \\"the Establishment and the grassroots.

By the time of the February 2003 march in London, Greenpeace, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party (SNP) were among the 450 organisations which had affiliated to the coalition, and the coalition's website listed 321 peace groups. Banners on the march At their initial meeting the Coalition also adopted the slogan \\"Against the racist backlash\\", asserting that a war against Afghanistan would be perceived as an attack on Islam and that Muslims, or those perceived as being Muslim, would apparently face racist attacks in the United Kingdom if the government joined the war. The Coalition worked closely with the Muslim Association of Britain in organising its demonstrations. Nick Cohen in 2003 criticised the relationship of the StWC with organisations he considers reactionary such as the Muslim Association of Britain. He accused the coalition of ignoring the requests of secular trade unions and Kurds in Iraq. However, Cohen himself was accused by Greg Muttitt of being extremely selective in his embrace of 'secular trade unions' in Iraq; in his newspaper columns, he never mentioned the most important trade union in the country, the oil workers' union, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Cohen also asserted that there is a contradiction between the StWC's call for respect for human rights and its allegedly close links with organisations that openly call for the death penalty for homosexuality and apostasy.Nick Cohen \\"The Left isn't listening\\", The Observer, 16 February 2003Nick Cohen \\"The Left's unholy alliance with religious bigotry\\", The Observer, 23 February 2003Nick Cohen \\"The great liberal betrayal\\", New Statesman, 1 November 2004 Campaigns and responses (2003‚Äì2014) =Build up to the Iraq War= The largest demonstration organised by the Coalition was the mass protest on 15 February 2003 in London against the imminent invasion of Iraq.

Following the beginning of the war and the events of Day X, the Coalition organised another national demonstration on the next Saturday, 22 March. While the turnout for this march did not match the demonstration of 15 February ‚Äì Stop the War claimed up to 500,000, whilst fellow organisers CND claimed between 200,000‚Äì300,000 ‚Äì it was noted that this was the largest anti-war demonstration held during wartime and had been organised with but a week's notice. =Anti-war activities (November 2003‚Äì2005)= StWC Placard The Coalition held a series of protests during November 2003 climaxing in a march on the 20th protesting against what it claimed is the aggressive foreign policy of U.S. President George W. Bush, and against the continued U.S. detention of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, which protesters have claimed is an illegal infringement of human rights and the Geneva conventions. A march past parliament was organised climaxing in a rally in Trafalgar Square. A papier- m√¢ch√© statue of Bush was toppled in an action reminiscent of the much televised pulling down of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad by American soldiers. Speakers included politician George Galloway, then SNP leader Alex Salmond and Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic. The coalition estimated that 300,000 people were present at the demonstration, while the police put those attending at 100,000 people. On 19 March 2005, StWC organised a large demonstration in Westminster with supporters marching from Hyde Park to Parliament Square via the US embassy. The supporters were calling for the invading troops to move out of Iraq, for the US to not attack Iran and Syria, for the UK government to halt reductions in the civil liberties of UK citizens including the right to protest and a free trial (which they allege would result from the recent Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 and Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005), and for a reduction in racism in the UK. The date was chosen as the it was the international day of anti-war demonstrations, as called by the Assembly of the Social Movements at the 2004 European Social Forum. Estimates of the number of marchers vary from 45,000 by the police to over 100,000 by StWC to 200,000 by some observers. The protest was the first occasion on which a march had passed the US embassy in London since the protests over the Vietnam War. Commentators such as Cohen and John RentoulJohn Rentoul \\"Debate with the Restart the War Coalition\\" , The Independent (Eagle Eye blog), 18 August 2010 have accused Stop the War of being pro-Hussein. John Rees has written: \\"Socialists should unconditionally stand with the oppressed against the oppressor, even if the people who run the oppressed country are undemocratic and persecute minorities, like Saddam Hussein.\\"Alan Johnson \\"The Euston moment\\", The Guardian, 21 April 2008 StWC has been criticised by journalists such as Cohen for its refusal to condemn attacks on US and other foreign troops occupying Iraq, and refusal to condemn foreign insurgent fighters who have entered parts of the country.Nick Cohen \\"Saddam's very own party\\", New Statesman, 7 June 2004Andrew Mueller \\"Don't stop the war\\", OpenDemocracy, 18 March 2005 =The 7/7 London bombings= After the 2007 march, speeches in Trafalgar Square Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, StWC in association with CND and the Muslim Association of Britain held a vigil for the victims at the Peace Garden in Euston, London on 9 July 2005 and a further solidarity gathering at Russell Square, close to one of the Underground stations targeted, on 17 July 2005. At the latter StWC national convener Lindsey German condemned the bombings but added that \\"The only way to end the bombings is to withdraw from Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine. When we have justice around the world we will have peace as well\\".\\"Vigil sees Londoners standing together against war and racism\\", Socialist Worker, 16 July 2005 The StWC also supported vigils across the country. The StWC organised the British demonstration on 24 September 2005 using the slogans \\"Stop the Bombings\\", \\"Bring the Troops Home\\", \\"Defend Civil Liberties\\" and \\"Defend the Muslim Community\\". The protest coincided with protests in Washington, D.C. and occurred just before the Labour Party Conference began in Brighton. On 10 December 2005 the StWC held an International Peace Conference attended by around 1,500 people. Speakers from across the world included Cindy Sheehan, the American mother whose son died in Iraq; and Hassan Juma, president of the Iraqi Southern Oil Workers Union. At this conference a call was launched for an international demonstration on 18 March 2006. At the rally in London, Police estimating 15,000 marchers took part, but the groups organising the protest. which included CND and the Muslim Association of Britain as well as Stop the War, thought between 80,000 and 100,000 people had participated. According to Kate Hudson: \\"The government must listen to the voices of the people, which is calling on them to bring the troops home from Iraq\\". On 23 September 2006, a demonstration was held outside the venue for the Labour Party Conference in Manchester. Estimates of attendance varied from \\"around 20,000\\" by the police, \\"up to 50,000\\" from the Coalition, to \\"more than 50,000\\" by the Socialist Worker. The 2007 demo took place on 24 February 2007 in London, jointly organised with the CND. The themes of this march were No Trident and Troops Out of Iraq. Stop the War protest in March 2008 On 15 March 2008 another international demonstration was held to mark the 5-year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq; although numbers did not match the original demonstrations, around 40,000 people were on the march in London. In Parliament Square, banners were placed in sight of the House of Commons. About the rally in Trafalgar Square, Tony Benn noted in his diary that he \\"spoke for four minutes and ten seconds. Two minutes was the limit, but I got away with it: they liked the phrase 'Parliament belongs to the past; the streets belong to the future'. They really liked that.\\" =London G-20 Protest (1‚Äì2 April 2009)= A march from the American embassy in Grosvenor Square to Trafalgar Square on 1 April 2009 brought together protesters from the Stop the War Coalition, Palestine Solidarity Campaign, The British Muslim Initiative, and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. On 2 April 2009, 200 people protested outside the ExCeL Centre where the G-20 Summit was being held. =Libyan Civil War (2011)= The Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist) was initially a member of the Stop the War Coalition. However, it and other individuals were expelled from the project on 23 September 2011 after it explicitly supported Muammar Gaddafi's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in the Libyan Civil War against the NATO-backed rebels in Benghazi. The leadership of the Stop the War Coalition had claimed that the Benghazi rebellion, as part of the Arab Spring was a \\"popular rising\\" and Gaddafi the head of a \\"brutal dictatorship.\\" The CPGB-ML claimed that the Stop the War Coalition was taking a pro-imperialist line, that the Benghazi rebels were CIA/MI6 backed and that this pro-imperialist line was influenced by the \\"various Trotskyite, revisionist and left-Labour luminaries in the leadership.\\" John Rees stated on the overthrow of Gaddafi \\"nobody is going to shed a tear for the fall of this brutal dictator.\\" =Syrian Civil War (2011‚Äì14)= Stop the War has also campaigned against British involvement in the Syrian Civil War, which began in March 2011, organising protests ahead of votes in the UK Parliament in August 2013 and December 2015. Samir Dathi wrote for the Stop the War website in June 2013: \\"Whilst many of us want nothing more than to see the ruthless dictator Assad go, we cannot support the further militarisation of the conflict, which will only perpetuate the horrific violence and refugee crisis in the region. If there is to be hope for the Syrian people, the first step is for all foreign interference to cease.\\" On the morning of the House of Commons vote on 29 August 2013 against military intervention in Syria, the conservative commentator Peter Oborne wrote in an article for The Daily Telegraph newspaper that Stop the War \\"has consistently shown far more mature judgment on these great issues of war and peace than Downing Street, the White House or the CIA. More surprising still ... [it] has often proved better informed than these centres of Western power, coolly warning against the diet of propaganda masquerading as bona fide intelligence.\\" The vote was \\"a vindication of the mass anti-war movement in this country over the last decade\\", wrote Andrew Murray in The Guardian. \\"The possibility is now open for Britain playing a different role in the world, breaking with the policies and preoccupations of imperialism\\", but \\"that change is nothing like secured yet.\\" The then chair of Stop the War, Jeremy Corbyn, thanked supporters for lobbying their MPs. \\"There still exists the danger of renewed conflict as the interests of the military, arms dealers, and others remains ever present and very powerful\\", he wrote. Stop the War has been accused of having pro-Assad links. According to the journalist Andrew Gilligan in The Daily Telegraph, many individuals associated with Stop the War openly favour the Assad government.James Bloodworth \\"Mother Agnes has pulled out of the Stop the War conference. And yet she would have fitted in so well\\", The Spectator (Coffee House blog), 18 November 2013 StWC vice-president Kamal Majid said in a speech at a conference organised by the New Communist Party in 2012 that the Assad family has \\"a long history of resisting imperialism\\", and should be supported \\"because their defeat will pave the way for a pro-Western and pro-US regime\\". In November 2013, it was announced that Mother Superior Agnes Mariam de la Croix had withdrawn from a forthcoming Anti-war conference organised by Stop the War for 30 November, after journalists Owen Jones and Jeremy Scahill had refused to share a platform with her because of accusations that she is a supporter of the Assad government. According to Amr Salahi, writing for the Left Foot Forward website, no Syrian was among the speakers at the event, but the former Guardian foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele said that he would have happily shared the platform with Mother Agnes. Relations with the Labour Party in late 2015 From 2011, Jeremy Corbyn was the chair of the Stop the War Coalition. When he stood as a candidate for the Labour Party leadership, the organisation's national convenor, Lindsey German, advocated that he should be supported. A week after his election as Labour leader in September 2015, it became known that he was stepping down as Chair of Stop the War, but would continue to support the group. =The November 2015 attacks in Paris= Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, STWC published an article on their website titled \\"Paris reaps whirlwind of western support for extremist violence in Middle East\\". The piece was criticised by Labour MPs, including Hilary Benn, then shadow foreign secretary, who said it was \\"wholly wrong\\". He said that the attacks were not the fault of the French, rather it was the \\"fault of the attackers.\\" By this time, the article had already been removed from the Stop the War website. StWC issued an apology. Murray told John Harris in an interview for The Guardian: \\"It didn't represent the organisation's views on Paris, and I think it was ... well, the best one could say is, extremely insensitive.\\" Jon Lansman, of the Corbynite Momentum pressure group, commented later about the material concerning the Paris attacks: \\"I think even Stop the War themselves have accepted they were stupid for publishing those articles. There were some very silly things published, and wrong things.\\" In explaining why she left StWC, Caroline Lucas gave these statements as one reason. Her spokesperson said: =Syrian Civil War (late 2015)= Following Hilary Benn's speech advocating air strikes in Syria in the House of Commons on 2 December, which drew on the history of anti-fascism, an article appeared on the StWC website. The article, soon taken down, read in part: \\"Benn does not even seem to realise that the jihadist movement that ultimately spawned Daesh [Isis] is far closer to the spirit of internationalism and solidarity that drove the International Brigades than Cameron's bombing campaign.\\" A few days later, Andrew Murray commented that he thought the piece was \\"wholly absurd. It doesn't reflect Stop the War's view in the slightest. It was taken down as soon as I saw it was up there. I'd apologise to any Stop the War supporters who were upset by it.\\" The editor of the website resigned. Stop the War lobbied MPs against supporting the proposal, along with members of Momentum. Both groups were accused of intimidation. Lindsey German wrote that she was \\"against bullying and intimidation. I condemn people who send abusive texts or messages\\" having received them herself. Following a demonstration in Walthamstow outside the constituency office of Labour MP Stella Creasy just before the December 2015 vote, which gained publicity at the time, German defended the rights of protesters. Nearly a week after the vote, on 8 December, it emerged that the Green MP Caroline Lucas had resigned from her Stop the War Coalition role because of the group's statements following the November 2015 Paris attacks and her concerns that Syrians attending the meeting had not been allowed to speak by the chair, Diane Abbott, at one of the group's parliamentary meetings. These concerns were shared by the human rights activist Peter Tatchell who told The Independent that Stop the War's \\"opposition to US imperialism ... sometimes mean[s] they will ignore the horrendous crimes of despotic anti-American regimes like Russia and Iran.\\" In a letter to The Guardian, Tatchell and other \\"previous strong supporters\\" accused StWC of having \\"lost its moral compass and authority\\". John Rees wrote on 10 December 2015 that Stop the War does not support the Assad regime. It \\"does believe that it is the people of Syria who are the only ones who should decide the fate of their country free of all great power and regional power interference\\". =Corbyn and the StWC Christmas 2015 dinner= Corbyn's continued involvement in the group became a source of friction with other leading members of the Labour Party. The former Labour shadow cabinet minister for Education, Tristram Hunt, described the group as a \\"really disreputable organisation\\" on 6 December when Corbyn's intention to attend the group's fundraising Christmas dinner on 11 December was becoming an issue. Former shadow ministers Emma Reynolds and Caroline Flint also urged him to distance himself from the group. Reynolds referred to the \\"abhorrent views\\" of Stop the War's leadership and described the group's positions as being \\"anti-West rather than anti-war\\", while Flint said they \\"are not Labour's friends\\". Corbyn attended the Stop the War event on 11 December in order to keep a promise to formally hand over his position as chair to Andrew Murray. In his speech at the event, at a Turkish restaurant in Southwark, south London, Corbyn said the \\"anti-war movement has been a vital force at the heart of our democracy\\" and \\"I think we've been right on what we've done\\". Tariq Ali, in an article for The Independent, thought the recent attacks on Stop the War were motivated by the \\"nasty and unpleasant war being waged in England, targeting Jeremy Corbyn\\" and wondered if the distancing of leading Green activists from Stop the War was because Corbyn \\"is attracting the electoral support of large numbers of hitherto Green supporters\\". Later history =Coverage of Syrian and Israeli topics (2016‚Äì17)= Human rights advocate Peter Tatchell describe StWC as in 'moral meltdown' in his newspaper article titled \\"The Stop the War Coalition is more interested in fighting the West than fighting for Syrians\\". According to Tatchell: > The Stop the War Coalition (STWC) is in moral meltdown and in the throes of > a rebellion by many of its longtime supporters ‚Äì including me ‚Äì over its > one-sided Syria protests and its persistent failure to listen to appeals > from democratic, anti-war and civil society activists inside Syria...The > coalition won't even campaign for airdrops of food and medical supplies to > besieged civilians... In a breathtaking display of double standards, they > supported aid convoys to refugees in Calais but not to those in Aleppo. No > wonder the movement is increasingly discredited. Tatchell adds: > Symptomatic of the rot at the heart of Stop the War Coalition is former > chair Andrew Murray's article published in the Morning Star in October. A > leading official in the anti-war movement, Murray blasted the West but > didn't even mention Russia's mass killing of women and children in Syria. In October 2016, protesters heckled Corbyn, who was keynote speaker at event in London, because of his inaction on Syria. In his January 2017 interview \\"Here's what Jeremy Corbyn could do, to win in 2020\\", Tatchell speaks positively of Corbyn, who he has known for more than three decades, but calls on Corbyn to distance himself from StWC. Tatchell says: > It's very difficult to justify how any Left Wing person can support StWC > while it maintains its current double standards. I think he needs to > recognise STW is a deeply flawed organisation with deeply flawed politics. StWC issue a statement after the chemical attack in Syria. There is no mention of Russia at all. Nor is there any direct criticism of Assad's regime. It says: \\"This attack must be condemned along with all the other atrocities of the war.\\" After criticism of the US president, the statement follows with: > All those who oppose the carnage in Syria and are concerned about the > sharpening tensions around the world must raise their voices against more > military intervention and demand an end to the fighting. In the StWC April 2017 conference resolutions neither Assad nor Russia are named. Concerning Syria, Motion 4 is the main motion, although it is primarily about Western military activity in Mosul, Iraq. The Resolution requests that the StWC leadership mount a major media campaign: to make the case that civilian fatalities in Mosul, Iraq due to western bombing \\"is now reportedly higher\\" than in the bombing of Aleppo by Assad. In the two years before May 2017, some contentious articles were removed from the StWC website. One such piece, by Alison Weir, concerned unsubstantiated allegations about the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, while another by Richard Falk, was entitled \\"Time to go to war with Israel as the only path to peace in the Middle East\\".

The Young Hegelians drew on his idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques, first of religion and then of the Prussian political system. They rejected anti-utopian aspects of his thought that \\"Old Hegelians\\" have interpreted to mean that the world has already essentially reached perfection. Left and Right Hegelianism The German philosophers who wrote immediately after the death of Hegel in 1831 can be roughly divided into the politically and religiously radical 'left', or 'young', Hegelians and the more conservative 'right', or 'old', Hegelians. The Right Hegelians followed the master in believing that the dialectic of history had come to an end‚ÄîHegel's Phenomenology of Spirit reveals itself to be the culmination of history as the reader reaches its end. Here he meant that reason and freedom had reached their maximums as they were embodied by the existing Prussian state. And here the master‚Äôs claim was viewed as paradox, at best; the Prussian regime indeed provided extensive civil and social services, good universities, high employment and some industrialization, but it was ranked as rather backward politically compared with the more liberal constitutional monarchies of France and Britain. The Young Hegelians drew on both Hegel's veneration of Reason and Freedom (as the guiding forces of history) and his idea that the 'Spirit' overcame all that opposed reason and freedom. They felt Hegel's apparent belief in the end of history conflicted with other aspects of his thought and that, contrary to his later thought, the dialectic was certainly not complete; this they felt was (painfully) obvious given the irrationality of religious beliefs and the empirical lack of freedoms‚Äîespecially political and religious freedoms‚Äîin existing Prussian society. It is important to note that the groups were not as unified or as self-conscious as the labels 'right' and 'left' make them appear. The term 'Right Hegelian', for example, was never actually used by those to whom it was later ascribed, namely, Hegel's direct successors at the Fredrick William University (now the Humboldt University of Berlin). (The term was first used by David Strauss to describe Bruno Bauer‚Äîwho actually was a typically 'Left', or Young, Hegelian.) History It was the outcry caused by David Strauss' The Life of Jesus in 1835 which first made the 'Young Hegelians' aware of their existence as a distinct group, and it was their attitude to religion that distinguished the left and right from then onwards (August Cieszkowski is a possible exception to this rule). Despite the lack of political freedom of speech in Prussia at the time, King Wilhelm III, under the influence of his relatively enlightened minister of religion, health and education Altenstein, allowed pretty much anything to be said about religion so long as there was practical obedience to his enforced merging of Calvinism and Lutheranism and spreading of Protestantism in Catholic areas.Stedman- Jones, Gareth, introduction to Marx and Engels, The Communist Manifesto, Penguin Classics, 2002 Thus the Young Hegelians at first found it easier to direct their critical energies towards religion than politics. A major consolidator of the Young Hegelian movement was the journal Hallische Jahrb√ºcher (1838‚Äì41) (later Deutsche Jahrb√ºcher (1841‚Äì43)) which was edited by Arnold Ruge and received contributions from many of the other Young Hegelians (and, in its infancy, Old Hegelians). It attacked Catholicism and orthodox Protestantism but was initially politically moderate, taking the line that Prussia was the embodiment of historical reason, which required that it evolve by peaceful reform towards a bourgeois egalitarian state with a constitutional monarchy, Protestant religion (though without a dominating state church) and freedom of speech. Another nucleus of the Young Hegelian movement was the Doctor's Club in Berlin (later known as 'the Free'), a society of intellectuals founded in 1837 and led by Bruno Bauer who, by 1838, was writing the most anti-Christian pamphlets in Germany at the time.Kolakowski, Leszek, Main currents of Marxism: the founders, the golden age, the breakdown, Norton, 2005. The radicalization and politicization of the movement occurred when the new king, Frederick William IV, upon whom the Young Hegelians had pinned their hopes of political reform, came to power in 1840 and curtailed political freedom and religious tolerance more than before. In philosophy the radicalization took the form of a breach with Hegel‚Äôs doctrine of the Prussian state as the fulfillment of history. In religion it manifested as a rejection of Christianity even in its most diluted pantheistic form and an adoption of atheism (led by Bauer and Feuerbach). In politics the Young Hegelians dropped much of Hegel's political theory and for the most part turned to republicanism ‚Äì the exceptions being Moses Hess, who mixed Hegelianism with communism, and of course Marx and Engels. In all these areas a central change was the adoption of certain ideas of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, especially the notion that the self-transcendence of the world by man was a possibility and duty, but one that could never be conclusively fulfilled. Although they spread democratic ideas throughout Germany to some extent, the intellectual exertions of the Young Hegelians failed to connect with or stir any wider social movement, and when the Deutsche Jahrb√ºcher was suppressed in 1843 the movement started to disintegrate. Philosophy The Young Hegelians interpreted the entire state apparatus as ultimately claiming legitimacy based upon religious tenets. While this thought was clearly inspired by the function of Lutheranism in contemporary Prussia, the Young Hegelians held the theory to be applicable to any state backed by any religion. All laws were ultimately based on religious tenets. As such, their plan to undermine what they felt was the corrupt and despotic state apparatus was to attack the philosophical basis of religion. =Main members= David Strauss David Strauss wrote Das Leben Jesu (The Life of Jesus/The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined) in 1835, in which he argued ‚Äì in a Hegelian framework ‚Äì against both the supernatural elements of the Gospel and the idea that the Christian church was the sole bearer of absolute truth. He believed the Gospel stories were mythical responses to the situation the Jewish community at the time found themselves in. The idea that 'infinite reason' or 'the absolute' (i.e. broadly Hegelian notions of God) could be incarnated within a finite human being was particularly absurd. Moreover, the original teachings of Jesus, which were aimed at aiding the poor and downtrodden, had slowly been perverted and usurped by the establishment to manipulate and oppress the populaces of the world by promising them a reward in the afterlife if they refrained from rebellion against the powers that be in this life. Bruno Bauer Bruno Bauer went further, and claimed that the entire story of Jesus was a myth. He found no record of anyone named \\"Yeshua of Nazareth\\" in any then-extant Roman records. (Subsequent research has, in fact, found such citations, notably by the Roman historian Tacitus and the Jewish historian Josephus, although these citations are not contemporaneous with Jesus' life and are viewed by some as forgeries.) Bauer argued that almost all prominent historical figures in antiquity are referenced in other works (e.g., Aristophanes mocking Socrates in his plays), but as he could not find any such references to Jesus, it was likely that the entire story of Jesus was fabricated. Ludwig Feuerbach Ludwig Feuerbach wrote a psychological profile of a believer called Das Wesen des Christentums (The Essence of Christianity). He argues that the believer is presented with a doctrine that encourages the projection of fantasies onto the world. Believers are encouraged to believe in miracles, and to idealize all their weaknesses by imagining an omnipotent, omniscient, immortal God who represents the antithesis of all human flaws and shortcomings. Carl Nauwerck was a German orientalist, theologian and lecturer of Hegelian philosophy in Berlin who lost his teaching license along with Bruno Bauer in 1842.Toews, John (Becoming Historical ‚Äì Cultural Reformation and Public Memory in Nineteenth-Century Berlin) Arnold Ruge As an advocate of a free and united Germany, Arnold Ruge shared Hegel's belief that history is a progressive advance towards the realization of freedom, and that freedom is attained in the State, the creation of the rational general will. At the same time he criticized Hegel for having given an interpretation of history which was closed to the future, in the sense that it left no room for novelty.Copleston, Frederick (A History of Philosophy, volume VII, p. 301) Max Stirner Max Stirner would occasionally socialize with the Young Hegelians, but held views much to the contrary of these thinkers, all of whom he consequently satirized and mocked in his nominalist masterpiece Der Einzige und Sein Eigentum (The Ego and Its Own). =Younger members= Karl Marx Another Young Hegelian, Karl Marx, was at first sympathetic with this strategy of attacking Christianity to undermine the Prussian establishment, but later formed divergent ideas and broke with the Young Hegelians, attacking their views in works such as The German Ideology. Marx concluded that religion is not the basis of the establishment's power, but rather ownership of capital‚Äîprocesses that employ technologies, land, money and especially human labor-power to create surplus-valueMarx, K. 1967. Capital: A critical analysis of capitalist production. ed. F. Engels. New York.‚Äîlie at the heart of the establishment's power. Marx (and Engels) considered religion as a component of the ideological superstructure of societies, and a pre-rational mode of thought, which nonetheless was wielded by ruling elites to obscure social relationships including the true basis of political power. In this latter sense, he described religion as \\"the opium of the people.\\"Marx, K. 1976. Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel‚Äôs Philosophy of Right. Collected Works, v. 3. New York. August von Cieszkowski August Cieszkowski focused on Hegel's view of world history and reformed it to better accommodate Hegelian Philosophy itself by dividing it into Past, Present, and Future. In his Prolegomena to Historiosophy, Cieszkowski argues that we have gone from Art (the Past), which was a stage of contemplating the Real, to Philosophy (the Present), which is a contemplation of the Ideal, and that since Hegel's philosophy was the summing-up and perfection of Philosophy, the time of Philosophy was up, and the time for a new era has dawned ‚Äì the era of Action.www.nonserviam.com Karl Schmidt In The Realm of Understanding and the Individual (Das Verstandestum und das Individuum), Karl Schmidt examined the history of Hegelianism and derived the truth that, \\"I am only myself.\\" At the end of the dialectic, where the individual exists \\"by grace of spirit, the law of spirit is applied to spirit itself, and is dragged to its grave\\". The individual remains as the evidence of the dialectic, and where the physical and psychical worlds merge, the individual stands atop the rubble. The Individual is different from Stirner's Unique One in that whilst the Unique One's unique nature is derived from comparison, The Individual exists for itself, and is the existence of all ideas- it is nothing more than peculiarity and uniqueness itself. Karl Schmidt was the last notable Young Hegelian, and arguably the most obscure of the notable Young Hegelians. Edgar Bauer Edgar Bauer, 1820‚Äì1886, was the younger brother of Bruno Bauer. According to Lawrence S. Stepelevich, Edgar Bauer was the most anarchistic of the Young Hegelians, and \\"...it is possible to discern, in the early writings of Edgar Bauer, the theoretical justification of political terrorism.\\"Stepelevich, Lawrence S. (1983). The Young Hegelians: An Anthology. Cambridge Die Freien Die Freien by Friedrich Engels Die Freien (The Free Ones) was a 19th-century circle of Young Hegelians formed at the University of Berlin and gathering for informal discussion over a period of a few years. Its leader was Bruno Bauer, a student who had attended Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's lectures and was then asked to defend the position of the Old Hegelians against the claims of David Strauss's Life of Jesus. After reviewing the book, Bauer was converted and became even more radical than Strauss, becoming an atheist and arguing that Christianity was not only historically baseless, but it was also irrational and a barrier to progress. Later in his life, he would disassociate himself from the group. =Meetings= Attendees included Max Stirner, Bruno Bauer, Arnold Ruge, Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, among others. Although not much is known about the group, with John Henry Mackay's biography of Max Stirner appearing to be the most authoritative source, involvement appears to have been a formative period for Marx and Engels (who wrote The Manifesto of the Communist Party, Wage-Labour and Capital and The German Ideology shortly after involvement) and Stirner (who wrote The Ego and Its Own around the same time). Consequently, the overall influence of the group to modern political thought can be considered monumental. As a cartoon by Engels shows, their small meetings were also attended by a \\"secret policeman\\", reporting on their activities to the authorities. The members of Die Freien held widely diverging views and met for the purpose of debate. They did not represent a unified political or ideological outlook, though most of them have subsequently been seen as \\"Young Hegelians.\\" They usually met at Hippel's Wine Bar in central Berlin. According to John Henry Mackay's biography of Max Stirner, they were well known for using foul language, at one point resulting in Arnold Ruge chastising them before storming out. Reportedly, there were many women involved with the group, although information only survives for Stirner's second wife, Marie D√§hnhardt. Moreover, after the owner stopped lending them money to drink, they resorted to jokingly begging on the street. However, Mackay claims that they drank little and drunkenness was uncommon. =Philosophy= Marx would not accept that the state was the seat of universality and rationality, i.e. that it was inherently rational; and made it his goal to prove that the difference between civil society, which Hegel held to be the sphere where individual interest is pursued in conflict with the interests of others and the state, where such conflicts are transcended, was in fact misplaced, the goal of the proletariat being in fact to abolish such differences. Other Young Hegelians had other qualms about Hegel‚Äôs philosophy. David Strauss did not accept Hegel‚Äôs claims of Christian historicity renouncing any historical basis to Christianity in favour of its demythization, claiming that the stories found in the Bible should be understood as myths \\"constructed not by individuals but by the earliest Christian communities in response to the teaching of Christ and the Messianic tradition which they had inherited from the Old Testament\\". Legacy The Young Hegelians were not popular at the university due to their radical views on religion and society. Bauer was dismissed from his teaching post in 1842, and Marx and other students were warned that they should not bother submitting their dissertations at the University of Berlin, as they would certainly be poorly received due to their reputations. Dudley Knowles argues that the Young Hegelians secularised Hegel's idea of Geist (spirit), removing the religious link. The resulting philosophy ultimately replaces spirit as the subject of history with that of man.

Probably as a result of diplomatic pressure from the Russian Embassy, Belgian police had forced the delegates to leave the country.Krupskaya, Reminiscences of Lenin The congress finalized the creation of the Marxist party in Russia proclaimed at the 1st Congress of the RSDLP. The Organising Committee for convening the Second Congress of the RSDLP was originally elected at the Bia≈Çystok Conference held in March (April) 1902, but soon after the conference all the committee members but one were arrested. At Lenin's suggestion, a new Organising Committee was set up at a conference of Social-Democratic committees held in November 1902 in Pskov. On this committee the Iskra-ists had an overwhelming majority. Under Lenin's guidance, the Organising Committee carried out extensive preparatory work for the Second Congress. Draft Regulations for the convening of the Congress were adopted at a plenary session held in Orel in February 1903. Following this plenary session, members of the Organising Committee twice visited the local Party organisations with a view to assisting them in their work. With their participation, the local committees discussed the draft Regulations, after which the Organising Committee finally endorsed the Regulations and approved a list of the local organisations entitled under them to representation at the Congress. The Organising Committee prepared for the Congress a detailed written report on its activities. There were 37 sessions and 51 delegates. Of these, 33 supported Iskra, the party newspaper, 5 backed the Bund and there were 2 economists (Marxists who believed workers should concentrate on economic demands rather than political ones). 6 delegates were neutral. The fourth session asked whether the party should support a dictatorship of the proletariat, all but one of the delegates voted for this, the economist Akimov abstained. This Congress is notable by the RSDLP becoming split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks as a result of a dispute between Vladimir Lenin and Juliy Martov over the major points of the Party Programme. At the 22nd session, Lenin and Martov disagreed on the wording of the first party rule defining membership. Lenin proposed a party member should be someone \\"Who recognizes the party's program and supports it by material means and by personal participation in one of the party organisations. Martov's wording was slightly different: regular personal association under the direction of one of the party organisations. The dispute was about whether the party should have a loose membership or whether it should be a party of professional revolutionaries. Georgi Plekhanov, founder of Russian Marxism, supported Lenin. Leon Trotsky, future leader of the Petrograd Soviet, backed Martov. The congress voted 28-23 in Martov's favour but his support included the 7 Bundists and Economists who would later walk out. This left Lenin's faction in the majority so Lenin called his faction Bolshevik or majoritarian. Martov accepted this, calling his faction Menshevik or minoritarian. At the 27th session one of the constituent groups of the party, the General Jewish Labour Bund, asked that the Bund would be recognized as the sole representative of the Jewish working class in Russia. A Bundist delegate tabled a motion that all Russian citizens should have the right to use their own language. Lenin and the Iskra group opposed the motion. Joseph Stalin supported. It was defeated in a tie, 23 votes against 23 votes. However, a similar motion proposed by Noe Zhordania (leader of the Transcaucasian Social Democrats) was passed. Moreover, the Bund proposed that the RSDLP should have a federal structure, with the Bund as a constituent party. This was defeated 41-5 (5 abstentions). Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were united in their opposition to the Bundist proposal, calling it separatist, nationalist and opportunist. After their proposal was rejected, the Bund withdrew from the RSDLP.Johnpoll, Bernard K. The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967. pp. 30-31 The two economists also walked out when the congress decided that the Iskraists should represent the party abroad. The 2nd Central Committee was elected. Its three members (Lengnik, Noskov and Gleb Krzhizhanovsky) were all Lenin's supporters. Iskra's editorial board became the party's Central Organ and was cut from six to three members (Lenin, Plekhanov and Martov).Tony Cliff, Building the Party 1893-1914, pages 103-12  References  * Article in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia; * –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω –í. –ò., II —Å—ä–µ–∑–¥ –†–°–î–†–ü. 17 (30) –∏—é–ª—è ‚Äî 10 (23) –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 1903 –≥., –ü–æ–ª–Ω. —Å–æ–±—Ä. —Å–æ—á., 5 –∏–∑–¥., —Ç. 7;  External links  * Complete English Stenographic Record of the Second Congress of the RSDLP.

Background The bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives May 21, 2013, but apparently did not get scheduled for a floor vote until after the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014 erupted in the Spring of 2014. This bill was scheduled for a vote in the House the week of May 26, 2014 in part due to on-going \\"allegations that several VA hospitals tried to conceal long wait times for medical care.\\" These questions about substandard timely care and false records came to light in May 2014. The situation involved treatment of veterans in a number of VA hospitals. Eric Shinseki, then Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, resigned May 30, 2014.Shinseki 'mad as hell' about VA allegations, but won't resign Senior Veterans Affairs officials reportedly kept secret waiting lists in order to hide the high number of veterans that were forced to wait for months to receive important medical care. As many as 450 senior officials may have been involved, including VA hospital managers. Some veterans died while they were still awaiting treatment. A VA department handbook on administrative policies indicates that employees have 30 days to appeal any disciplinary action before it can be taken and have all disciplinary actions or reprimands removed from their records after two years. The Department has to meet high standards for doing things like separately proving an employee was absent each and every day if the employee quits showing up to work and proving that there is a direct relationship between the misconduct and their own efficiency. Data provided by the Office of Personnel Management shows that only 7,349 federal employees were fired in 2013 out of a total of almost 2 million. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2013 would require the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), upon determining that the VA Secretary has not appropriately responded to an IG report that recommends actions to be taken by the Secretary to address a VA public health or safety issue, to notify the Secretary and the congressional veterans committees of such failure. The bill would require the Secretary: (1) within 15 days after such notification, to submit to the IG a list of the names of each responsible VA manager and the matter for which the manager is responsible; (2) within 7 days after such submission, to notify each such manager of the covered issue; (3) to direct such manager to resolve the issue, (4) to provide the manager with appropriate counseling and a mitigation plan for resolving the issue; and (5) to ensure that a manager's performance review includes an evaluation of actions taken with respect to such issue. The bill would prohibit the Secretary from paying a bonus or award to any manager whose issue remains unresolved. =Amendments= *increased fees on VA loans for some veterans *verification of the income of people receiving VA pensions to be certain that they qualify *allow residency in medical foster homes for veterans whose care in a nursing home is paid for by the VA Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs on August 1, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2072 would increase the fees charged to certain veterans who obtain loans guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It also would extend VA‚Äôs authority to verify income reported by recipients of VA pension benefits using data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Those two changes would decrease direct spending by $182 million over the 2014-2018 period and by $191 million over the 2014-2023 period, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates. Pay-as- you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect direct spending. H.R. 2072 also would increase spending subject to appropriation, primarily by allowing VA to pay for eligible veterans to live in medical foster homes. The CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 2072 would have a discretionary cost of $170 million over the 2014-2018 period, subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts. H.R. 2072 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 21, 2013 by Rep. Dan Benishek (R, MI-1). It was referred, the same day, to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and on May 31, 2013 to the United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health. On October 16, 2013, it was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-245 and placed on the placed on the Union Calendar, (Calendar No. 173). Based on the Congressional records cited, it apparently went nowhere significant until after the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014 erupted in the Spring of 2014. Debate and discussion In a House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health hearing on May 21, 2013, Aleks Morosky, the senior legislative associate of Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) testified against the bill in introductory form on behalf of the VFW. Morosky said that the VFW agreed with the bill's intent, but were \\"concerned with the precedent set by placing IG in a personnel management role. Managers must be held responsible for failing to properly perform their duties, but VA must maintain direct control over the accountability of its employees.\\" Rep. Benishek (R-MI), who introduced the bill, said that it targets \\"bureaucrats in Washington who drag their feet and don't do their jobs.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Inspector generals in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2072 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2072 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2072 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2072 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2072 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 2072 *House Report 113-245 on H.R. 2072 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States Department of Veterans Affairs ","title":"Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2013"},{"id":"42824313","text":"Colin Gerard Tan (born 13 July 1977) is a technology entrepreneur and Singaporean poet. His works have been performed in Australia and the United Kingdom, where he did his postgraduate studies at Cambridge. He is the founder of Rentlord, one of the earliest fully online property management portals in the UK allowing landlords and tenants to manage every aspect of a property tenancy over the internet. Biography Tan was born in Singapore and educated in St Andrew's Primary and Secondary School. After mandatory military service, he studied English literature at the National University of Singapore, where the poets Edwin Thumboo and Lee Tzu Pheng were his tutors and mentors. After that he worked in human rights at Franciscans International, a non-governmental organisation in Geneva representing the poor at the United Nations. Tan became a student at the University of Cambridge's English department's first cohort of the Masters programme in Critical Theory. He received a Cambridge Commonwealth Trust scholarship to study his PhD on Aesthetic Theory in the writings of Walter Benjamin and Immanuel Kant. During this period, he also tutored at St Johns College. At Cambridge, he was a contemporary of the Singaporean poet in Chinese Chee Lay Tan, who was also doing his doctoral thesis, and with whom Tan collaborated artistically on poetry translations of each other. Creative Works In Melbourne, he collaborated with composer Michael Easton. Together they wrote I Chose to Climb, a multimedia play with music, for the Port Fairy Spring Music Festival, which Tan also directed. The play was later published in his poetry collection, The Evidence of the Senses. It played also in London at the Royal Academy of Music. In England, Tan's text has been set to music by Gabriel Jackson. His sequel to Addison's Spacious Firmament premiered at St Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey, and was commissioned for the John Armitage Trust.*http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/john-armitage-lives-on-in- concert-7411556.html *http://www.musicomh.com/classical/features- classical/autumn-preview-2008 Tan has been anthologised in Singapore and his writing taught in the classroom.

The site was first identified for burial in 1857 when the town of Lake Forest was planned. Later, William Le Baron Jenney designed a winding road system and Ossian Cole Simonds developed the landscape scheme. History Overcrowding of church property led to the rural cemetery movement in the mid-19th century. The movement came to the United States in 1831 with the construction of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts. In 1857, the Lake Forest Association, a group of business leaders looking to develop a Presbyterian community, purchased a tract of land north of Chicago, Illinois along Lake Michigan. In an effort to maintain a high standard of public health, the association set aside a portion of the land along the northernmost extremity for use as a cemetery. Landscape architect Almerin Hotchkiss was commissioned to plan the property. He provided easy access to the cemetery from Sheridan Road yet contained it with natural ravines. On December 11, 1859, the Forest Cemetery Association was founded to oversee the property. Subscriptions were issued to interested parties to fund the cemetery's development. Samuel F. Miller, a civil engineer for the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad, developed a cemetery plan in 1860. However, it provided irregularly shaped lots and a poor roadway scheme. Most plots were too small for the wealthy citizens, so the few large lots were immediately purchased. This left few options that could satisfy potential buyers. The property was transferred to the City of Lake Forest in 1863. The Lake Forest City Council issued an ordinance creating a cemetery commission on June 6, 1881. They began an official recording of burials in 1882. The commission also decided to completely redesign the property. William Le Baron Jenney was tasked with developing a new roadway system. Jenney was one of the foremost Chicago architects, recently completing the First Leiter Building. He placed the new entrance to the cemetery on Lake Avenue, affording more privacy. He completely reworked the cemetery, designing a curving road system and large lots on treeless fields. Strolling pathways were installed around circles of graves. Jenney also proposed a chapel, but this was never built. The cemetery design was slightly revised in 1892 to accommodate the increased use of automobiles. Also that year, were donated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago so that Catholics could be buried in the cemetery. In 1900, Ossian Cole Simonds was commissioned to improve the grounds. Simonds was a friend and former associate of Jenney and was lauded for his work designing Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. His plan provided sewers and drainage, better roadways and walkways, and new burial subdivisions. His Prairie School design utilized native plants and offered increased privacy. The cemetery is expected to continue to accept burials until around 2050. Since the cemetery is owned by the city, only Lake Forest residents are typically approved for burial.

According to his own account, his youth was passed among prominent French people and that he, at the same time, made the acquaintance of the theatrical and Bohemian worlds of the French capital. Vandam began a career as a journalist during the Prusso-Austrian war of 1866, writing for English papers, and he was correspondent for American papers during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. Settling in London in 1871, he engaged in translation from the French and Dutch and other literary work, occasionally going abroad on special missions for newspapers.

Description Cochleoceps orientalis grows to approximately 55 mm long. It has no scales, instead being protected by mucous which covers the body in a thick coating. It has an intense orange to greenish-yellow colouration. The body is scattered with dark red spots that diminish in size and intensity toward the belly. Numerous, short, thin, blue, iridescent lines are present on the back and sides. These lines are generally perpendicular to the length of the body. The posterior part of the ventral fins appear as a fleshy fringe, with the anterior part merging into the sucking disc. Parts of the disc have dermal papillae which are flat. These probably allow the fish to adhere to surfaces. Distribution Cochleoceps orientalis lives in the marine waters of the southeastern part of Australia. It is found around New South Wales from Seal Rocks to Mallacoota, Victoria. Habitat and behaviour Cochleoceps orientalis cleaning the much larger Chelmonops truncatus Cochleoceps orientalis normally lives in the demersal zone at depths of 3 to 40 metres. It is most often found on the kelp species ecklonia radiata but can sometimes occur on ascidians and sponges at greater depths. This species avoids swimming in open waters where it would vulnerable to predators. It instead it remains sucked onto kelp, and when moving, does so in short dashes. Cochleoceps orientalis is known to clean parasites from morwongs, leatherjackets, eastern blue gropers, boxfishes, and porcupinefishes. Life cycle Adults deposit their eggs on kelp, with both males and females remaining at the site. However, only the male guards them. References Further reading *Briggs, J.C. in Paxton, J.R. & W.N.

Life  Felderhoff was born in Elbing, West Prussia (ElblƒÖg, Poland). He entered the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1880 and studied there under Fritz Schaper until 1884, after which he became a Master Student in the studio of Reinhold Begas. In 1885, he spent a year in Rome on a scholarship, then returned for more work with Begas, remaining there through 1888, although he was doing free-lance work as early as 1887 and won a government contract to sculpt busts of famous generals for the Berlin Armory (Zeughaus, now the German Historical Museum). 1890 and 1891 brought another stay in Rome. He then helped his mentor, Begas, to complete the National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument, for which he received a medal in 1897. Close-up of Johann II, showing damage sustained during World War II Felderhoff joined the Berlin Secession and became a member of the Academy in 1913. He was named a Professor there in 1917 and died in Berlin in 1919.  Work  His model of Albert the Bear drew praise in 1893, when it was entered in a competition to provide figures for the Fisherman's Bridge. Although the contract went to Johannes Boese, it enabled Felderhoff to negotiate a commission for a statue and busts in the Siegesallee project and was used as the basis for the central figure; Johann II, Margrave of Brandenburg (Group 6). He was the only Siegesallee sculptor to work in an austere modern style, rather than the favored historical style. (Some changes were made when Kaiser Wilhelm reviewed the sketches, but their nature is unknown). This caused his work to be criticized as \\"mediocre\\".Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und die Siegesallee.

More specifically, it notes how the people that you once knew likely have changed. The singer recalls his old friend Walter, and how \\"when the world was young... all the girls knew Walter's name.\\" He reminisces about how he and Walter \\"said [they'd] fight the world so [they'd] be free\\" and claimed that they would \\"save up all [their] money and [they'd] buy a boat and sail away to sea, but it was not to be.\\" He asks himself, \\"I knew you then, but do I know you now?\\" The singer concludes that \\"people often change, but memories of people can remain.\\" Release \\"Do You Remember Walter?\\" was first released on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, following \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\", and preceding \\"Picture Book\\". \\"Do You Remember Walter?\\" eventually had single release as the B-side of \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\". In 1996, an acoustic live version of the song was put on the U.S. version To the Bone. This same version was the penultimate track on the Picture Book compilation. Reception \\"Do You Remember Walter?\\" received positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited \\"Do You Remember Walter?\\" as a highlight from The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, and Pitchfork Media's J.H.

The General National Congress, based in western Libya and backed by various militias with some support from Qatar and Turkey, initially accepted the results of the 2014 election, but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya's transition and HoR elections.[13] The House of Representatives (or Council of Deputies) is in control of eastern and central Libya and has the loyalty of the Libyan National Army, and has been supported by airstrikes by Egypt and the UAE. Due to controversy about constitutional amendments, HoR refused to take office from GNC in Tripoli, which was controlled by armed Islamist groups from Misrata. Instead, HoR established its parliament in Tobruk, which is controlled by General Haftar's forces. In December 2015, the Libyan Political Agreement was signed after talks in Skhirat, as the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in Tripoli, Tobruk, and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the Government of National Accord. On 30 March 2016, Fayez Sarraj, the head of GNA, arrived in Tripoli and began working from there despite opposition from GNC. The GNA's authority remains unrecognized by HoR, as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon. In addition to those three factions, there are: the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, led by Ansar al-Sharia, which had the support of the GNC and was defeated in Benghazi in 2017; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan provinces; \\"One is the internationally recognized government based in the eastern city of Tobruk and its military wing, Operation Dignity, led by General Khalifa Haftar. The other is the Tripoli government installed by the Libya Dawn coalition, which combines Islamist militias with armed groups from the city of Misrata. The Islamic State has recently established itself as a third force\\" the Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna which expelled ISIL from Derna in July 2015 and was later itself defeated in Derna by the Tobruk government in 2018; as well as other armed groups and militias whose allegiances often change. In May 2016, GNA and GNC launched a joint offensive to capture areas in and around Sirte from ISIL. This offensive resulted in ISIL losing control of all significant territories previously held in Libya. Later in 2016, forces loyal to Khalifa al-Ghawil attempted a coup d'√©tat against Fayez al-Sarraj and the Presidential Council of GNA.  Background of discontent with General National Congress  At the beginning of 2014, Libya was governed by the General National Congress (GNC), which won the popular vote in 2012 elections. The GNC was made of two major political groups, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the Justice and Construction Party (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced. Division among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this governing body. The GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda; voting to declare sharia law and establishing a special committee to \\"review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law\\"; imposing gender segregation and compulsory hijab at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014 until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named Operation Dignity (; 'Amaliyat al-Karamah). = Political fragmentation of the GNC = The 2012 elections, overseen by the Libyan electoral commission with the support of the UN Special Mission In Libya (UNSMIL) and nongovernmental organizations like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), have been considered \\"fair and free\\" by most Libyans. However, the elections did not necessarily create a strong government because the Parliament was fragmented due to the lack of organized political parties in Libya post-revolution. The GNC was made up of two major parties, the National Forces Alliance and the Justice and Construction Party, as well as independents in which some were moderates and others conservative Islamists. The GNC became a broad-based congress. The GNA elected Nouri Abusahmain as president of the GNC in June 2013. He was considered an independent Islamist and a compromise candidate acceptable to liberal members of the congress, as he was elected with 96 out of a total of 184 votes by the GNC. = GNC establishes the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR) = The GNC was challenged due to increasing security concerns in Tripoli. The GNC itself was attacked many times from militias and armed protesters who stormed the GNC assembly hall. Following his appointment, Abusahmain was tasked with providing security. He set up the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR), which was initially intended to protect and secure Tripoli in August 2013. But this armed group was responsible for kidnapping Prime Minister Zeidan in October of that year resulting in the GNC dismissing it from its security function and Abusahmain himself as president. During his term, Abusahmain blocked inquiries into the distribution of state funds and it was alleged that Abusahmain was channeling government funding towards the LROR. The LROR was not an Islamist armed group but rather was made of rebels from the city of Gharyan. Its commander was Adel Gharyani. In October 2013, following the kidnapping of the Prime Minister, Abusahmain used his presidency to change the agenda of the GNC in order to prevent a debate over disestablishing the LROR. At the same time, he cancelled a request to establish a committee to investigate the allocation, by Abusahmain himself, of 900 million Libyan Dinars (US$720 million) to the LROR and various other armed groups. Instead, the LROR had its responsibilities reduced by the GNC but was allowed to continue to operate, and no one was prosecuted for the incident. = Kidnapping of Prime Minister Zeidan = Most journalists reported that the kidnapping of Zeidan was by the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR) (Ghurfat Amaliyat al-Thuwar) created by Abusahmain by decree 143 of 7 July. Yet there is evidence to suggest that this is not the case and that armed groups such as the Duru3 actually conducted the kidnapping. = Expansion of armed groups during the GNC's term = Many Libyans blamed the GNC and the interim government for a continued lack of security in the country. The interim government struggled to control well-armed militias and armed groups that established during the revolution. Libyans in Benghazi especially began to witness assassinations and kidnapping and perceived the GNC to be turning a blind eye to the deteriorating security situation in the east. But security concerns increased across the country allowing armed groups to expand in both Tripoli and in the east. * In 2012, the assassination of the US ambassador to Libya by Ansar al-Sharia took place. * In October 2013, the kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan by the LROR took place. * The kidnapping of Egyptian diplomats in January 2014 also by the LROR took place. * In March 2014, armed protesters allegedly linked to the LROR stormed the GNC parliament building, shooting and injuring two lawmakers and wounding several others. In April 2014, an anti-terrorist training base called \\"Camp 27\\", located between Tripoli and the Tunisian border, was taken over by forces fighting under the control of Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi, also known as Ibrahim Tantoush, a long- serving Al-Qaeda organizer and former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The Islamist forces at Camp 27 have subsequently been described as part of the Libya Shield Force. The Libya Shield Force was already identified by some observers as linked to al-Qaeda as early as 2012. = GNC's political isolation law = Although Islamists were outnumbered by Liberals and Centrists in the GNC, in May 2013 they lobbied for a law \\"banning virtually everyone who had participated in Gaddafi's government from holding public office\\". While several Islamist political parties and independents supported the law, as they generally had no associations to the Qaddafi regime, the law enjoyed strong public support. Polls demonstrated that a large majority of the Libyan people supported the exclusion of high-ranking Qaddafi-regime officials. The law particularly impacts elite expatriates and leaders of liberal parties. There existed reservations that such a law would eliminate technocratic expertise needed in Libya at the time. Armed militiamen stormed government ministries, shut down the GNC itself and demanded the law's passage. This intimidated the GNC into passing the law in which 164 members approved the bill, with only four abstaining and no member opposing it. = Suppression of women's rights = GNC opponents argue that it was supporting Islamist actions against women. Sadiq Ghariani, the Grand Mufti of Libya, is perceived to be linked closely to Islamist parties. He has issued fatwas ordering Muslims to obey the GNC, and fatwas ordering Muslims to fight against Haftar's forces In March 2013, Sadiq Ghariani, issued a fatwa against the UN Report on Violence Against Women and Girls. He condemned the UN report for \\"advocating immorality and indecency in addition to rebelliousness against religion and clear objections to the laws contained in the Quran and Sunnah\\". Soon after the Grand Mufti issued a clarification op-ed that there should be no discrimination between men and women yet women have a greater role in the family. Later in 2013, lawyer Hamida Al-Hadi Al-Asfar, advocate of women's rights, was abducted, tortured and killed. It is alleged she was targeted for criticising the Grand Mufti's declaration. No arrests were made. In June 2013, two politicians, Ali Tekbali and Fathi Sager, appeared in court for \\"insulting Islam\\" for publishing a cartoon promoting women's rights. Under sharia law they were facing a possible death penalty. The case caused widespread concern although they were eventually acquitted in March 2014. After the GNC was forced to accept new elections, Ali Tekbali was elected to the new House of Representatives. Protesters stage a large demonstration in Shahat against the GNC's mandate extension plan. During Nouri Abusahmain's presidency of the GNC and subsequent to GNC's decision to enforce sharia law in December 2013, gender segregation and compulsory hijab were being imposed in Libyan universities from early 2014, provoking strong criticism from Women's Rights groups. = GNC extends its mandate without elections = The GNC failed to stand down at the end of its electoral mandate in January 2014, unilaterally voting on 23 December 2013 to extend its power for at least one year. This caused widespread unease and some protests. Residents of the eastern city of Shahat, along with protesters from Bayda and Sousse, staged a large demonstration, rejecting the GNC's extension plan and demanding the resignation of the congress followed by a peaceful power transition to a legitimate body. They also protested the lack of security, blaming the GNC for failing to build the army and police. Other Libyans rejecting the proposed mandate rallied in Tripoli's Martyrs Square and outside Benghazi's Tibesti Hotel, calling for the freeze of political parties and the re-activation of the country's security system. On 14 February 2014, General Khalifa Haftar ordered the GNC to dissolve and called for the formation of a caretaker government committee to oversee new elections. However, his actions had little effect on the GNC, which called his actions \\"an attempted coup\\" and called Haftar himself \\"ridiculous\\" and labelled him an aspiring dictator. The GNC continued to operate as before. No arrests were made. Haftar launched Operation Dignity three months later on 16 May. = House of Representatives versus GNC = On 25 May 2014, about one week after Khalifa Haftar started his Operation Dignity offensive against the General National Congress, that body set 25 June 2014 as the date for new elections. Islamists were defeated, but rejected the results of the election, which saw only an 18% turnout. They accused the new House of Representatives parliament of being dominated by supporters of Gaddafi, and they continued to support the old GNC after the Council officially replaced it on 4 August 2014. The conflict escalated on 13 July 2014, when Tripoli's Islamists and Misratan militias launched Operation Libya Dawn to seize Tripoli International Airport, capturing it from the Zintan militia on 23 August. Shortly thereafter, members of the GNC, who had rejected the June election, reconvened as a new General National Congress and voted themselves as replacement of the newly elected House of Representatives, with Tripoli as their political capital, Nouri Abusahmain as president and Omar al-Hasi as prime minister. As a consequence, the majority of the House of Representatives were forced to relocate to Tobruk, aligning themselves with Haftar's forces and eventually nominating him army chief. On 6 November, the supreme court in Tripoli, dominated by the new GNC, declared the House of Representatives dissolved. The House of Representatives rejected this ruling as made \\"under threat\\". On 16 January 2015, the Operation Dignity and Operation Libya Dawn factions agreed on a ceasefire. The country was then led by two separate governments, with Tripoli and Misrata controlled by forces loyal to Libya Dawn and the new GNC in Tripoli, while the international community recognized Abdullah al-Thani's government and its parliament in Tobruk. Benghazi remained contested between pro-Haftar forces and radical Islamists.  Opposing forces  = Pro-GNC = The pro-GNC forces were a coalition of different militias with different ideologies although most of them are Islamist influenced especially in eastern Libya in Benghazi and Derna. Since LPA negotiations started in Skhirat there has been a rift within the militias over support for the UN-sponsored talks and the proposed Government of National Accord, which seeks to unite the rival governments. Since GNA started working from Tripoli in March 2015, Libya Dawn coalition the largest of Pro-GNC militias has been disbanded and most of its forces changed allegiances to GNA.  Libya Dawn  The Islamist \\"Libya Dawn\\" has been described as \\"an uneasy coalition\\" identified as \\"terrorists\\" by the elected parliament in Tobruk including \\"former al-Qaeda jihadists\\" who fought against Qaddafi in the nineties, members of Libya's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and a \\"network of conservative merchants\\" from Misrata, whose fighters make up \\"the largest block of Libya Dawn's forces\\". The coalition was formed in 2014 as a reaction against General Khalifa Haftar failed coup and to defeat Zintan brigades controlling Tripoli International Airport whose aligned with him. The Zawia tribe has been allied to Libya Dawn since August 2014, although in June 2014 at least one Zawia army unit had appeared to side with General Haftar, and reports in December claimed Zawia forces were openly considering breaking away from Libya Dawn. Zawia militia have been heavily fighting the Warshefana tribe. In the current conflict, the Warshefana have been strongly identified with the forces fighting against both Libya Dawn and Al Qaeda. Zawia has been involved in a long-standing tribal conflict with the neighbouring Warshefana tribe since 2011. The motivations of the Zawia brigades participation in the war have been described as unrelated to religion and instead deriving foremost from tribal conflict with the Warshafana and secondarily as a result of opposition to the Zintani brigades and General Haftar. When the head of GNA Fayez Sarraj arrived in Tripoli, Libya Dawn has been disbanded as the interests of the militias forming it conflicted when some of them choose to support GNA others chose to stay loyal to GNC.  Libya Shield  The Libya Shield Force supports the Islamists. Its forces are divided geographically, into the Western Shield, Central Shield and Eastern Shield. Elements of the Libya Shield Force were identified by some observers as linked to Al-Qaeda as early as 2012. The term \\"Libya Shield 1\\" is used to refer to the Islamist part of the Libya Shield Force in the east of Libya. In western Libya, the prominent Islamist forces are the Central Shield (of the Libya Shield Force), which consists especially of Misrata units and the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room. Two smaller organizations operating in western Libya are Ignewa Al-Kikly and the \\"Lions of Monotheism\\". Al-Qaeda leader Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi, also known as Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr or Ibrahim Tantoush has been active in western Libya, capturing the special forces base called Camp 27 in April 2014 and losing it to anti-Islamist forces in August 2014. The Islamist forces around Camp 27 have been described as both Al-Qaida and as part of the Libya Shield Force. The relationship between Al-Qaeda and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is unclear, and their relationship with other Libyan Islamist groups is unclear. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb are also active in Fezzan, especially in border areas. Libya western and central Libya Shield force fought alongside Libya Dawn and were disbanded with it in 2015. While the eastern Libya Shield forces merged later with other Islamist militias and formed Revolutionary Shura Council to fight Hafter LNA.  Revolutionary Shura Councils  In Benghazi, the Islamist armed groups have organized themselves into the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries. These are: * Ansar al-Sharia * Libya Shield 1 * February 17th Martyrs Brigade * Rafallah al-Sahati Brigade The Shura Council of Benghazi has been strongly linked with ISIL as they fought together against Hafter in Battle of Benghazi. Yet, the Shura Council never pledged allegiance to ISIL. Meanwhile, in Derna the main Islamist coalition Shura Council of Mujahideen which was formed in 2014 is an al-Qaeda-affiliated group. The coalition has been in fight with ISIL in 2015 and drove them out from the city. Ajdabiya had its own Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, which is the most ISIL linked among the three Shura councils. Its leader Muhammad al-Zawi and a number of the council pledging allegiance to ISIL played a major role in strengthening the Islamist group grip on Sirte.  Benghazi Defense Brigades  Benghazi Defense Brigades was formed in June 2016 to defend Benghazi and the Shura Council from the Libyan National Army, the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) included various Libya Dawn militias and was organized under the banner of the former Grand mufti Saddiq Al-Ghariyani. Even thought it pledged to support the GNA and apparently working under Mahdi Al-Barghathi, the Defence Minister of the GNA. The GNA never recognized the BDB with some members calling for it to be demarcated as a \\"terrorist organization\\".  Amazigh militias  Even though the Amazigh militias mainly situated in Zuwara and Nafusa Mountains fought alongside Libya Dawn, they consider themselves pushed towards that because Zintan brigades and the rest of their enemies has been sided with HoR. Still though, the Amazigh main motivations for fighting against Haftar is his Pan-Arabic ideas which is conflicting with their demands of recognition their language in the constitution as an official language. While keeping their enmity towards Haftar, the Amazigh militias mostly became neutral later in the war especially since the formation of GNA. = Operation Dignity = The anti- Islamist Operation Dignity forces are built around Haftar's faction of the Libyan National Army, including land, sea and air forces along with supporting local militias.  LNA  General Khalifa Haftar The Libyan National Army, formally known as \\"Libyan Arab Armed Forces\\", was gradually formed by General Khalifa Haftar as he fought in what he named Operation Dignity. On 19 May 2014, a number of Libyan military officers announced their support for Gen. Haftar, including officers in an air force base in Tobruk, and others who have occupied a significant portion of the country's oil infrastructure, as well as members of an important militia group in Benghazi. Haftar then managed to gather allies from Bayda, 125 miles east of Benghazi. A minority portion of the Libya Shield Force had been reported to not have joined the Islamist forces, and it is not clear if this means they had joined the LNA forces. Since then Haftar continued to strengthen his LNA by recruiting new soldiers along with the advancements he made on the ground. In 2017 Haftar said that his forces are now larger by \\"hundred times\\" and now they are about 60 thousand soldiers.  Salafist militias  Salafists, called Madkhalis by their enemies, fought alongside Haftar LNA since the beginning against the Islamist militias, especially Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries and ISIL whom they considered Khawarij after a fatwa from Saudi Rabee al-Madkhali.  Zintan brigades  Since the Battle of Tripoli Airport, armed groups associated with Zintan and the surrounding Nafusa region have become prominent. The Airport Security Battalion is recruited in large part from Zintan. The \\"Zintan Brigades\\" fall under the leadership of the Zintan Revolutionaries' Military Council.  Wershefana militias  Wershefana tribal and mainly Gaddafi loyalists armed groups, from the area immediately south and west of Tripoli, have played a big role in Haftar forces west of Libya On 5 August 2014, Warshefana forces captured Camp 27, a training base west of Tripoli. Wershefana armed groups have also been involved in a long- standing tribal conflict with the neighbouring Zawia city since 2011. Zawia has allied with Libya Dawn since August 2014, although its commitment to Libya Dawn is reportedly wavering. After being accused of kidnapping, ransoming and other crimes, a GNA joint force made up mostly from Zintan brigades defeated them and seized the Wershefana district. Zintan brigades were former allies of Wershefana. = Ethnic tensions = In 2014, a former Gaddafi officer reported to the New York Times that the civil war was now an \\"ethnic struggle\\" between Arab tribes (like the Zintanis) against those of Turkish ancestry (like the Misuratis), as well as against Berbers and Circassians.  Effects  Libyan oil fields, pipelines, refineries and storage As of February 2015, damage and disorder from the war has been considerable. There are frequent electric outages, little business activity, and a loss in revenues from oil by 90%. Over 4,000 people have died from the fighting, and some sources claim nearly a third of the country's population has fled to Tunisia as refugees. Since Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar had captured the ports of Libya's state-run oil company, the National Oil Corporation, in Es Sider and Ra's Lanuf, oil production has risen from 220,000 barrels a day to about 600,000 barrels per day. The war has prompted a considerable number of the country's sizeable foreign labour force to leave the country as extremist groups such as ISIL have targeted them; prior to the 2011, the Egyptian Ministry of Labour estimated that there were two million Egyptians working in the country yet since the escalation of attacks on Egyptian labourers the Egyptian Foreign Ministry estimates more than 800,000 Egyptians have left the country to return to Egypt. Land mines remain a persistent threat in the country as numerous militias, especially ISIL, have made heavy use of land mines and other hidden explosives; the rapidly changing front lines has meant many of these devices remain in areas out of active combat zones; civilians remain the primary casualties inflicted by land mines with mines alone killing 145 people and wounding another 1,465 according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In a report, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) revealed that it had registered over 45,600 refugees and asylum seekers in Libya during 2019. The World Food Programme reported that an estimated 435,000 people had been forcibly displaced from their homes during the conflict. On 22 October 2019, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that children have been suffering from different sorts of malnutrition in the war- torn nations, including Libya. Executive Director of UNICEF said on 18 January 2020, that thousands of Libyan children were at risk of being killed due to the ongoing conflict in Libya. Since hostile clashes between the Libyan government and Haftar‚Äôs LNA forces (backed by the UAE and Egypt) have broken out in Tripoli and western Libya, conditions of children and civilians have worsened. The blockade on Libya‚Äôs major oil fields and production units by Haftar‚Äôs forces has sown losses of over $255 million within the six-day period ending 23 January, according to the National Oil Corporation in Libya. The NOC and ENI, which runs Mellitah Oil & Gas in Libya, have suffered a production loss of 155,000 oil barrels per day due to the blockade on production facilities imposed by Haftar‚Äôs LNA. The entities claim losing revenue of around $9.4mn per day. Since the beginning of Libyan conflict, thousands of refugees forced to live in detention centres are suffering from mental health problems, especially women and children, who are struggling to confront the deaths of their family members in the war. On 7 February 2020, the UNHCR reported that the overall number of migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard in, January, surged 121% against the same period in 2019. The ongoing war has turned the country into a huge haven for migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. On 6 April, an armed group invaded a control station in Shwerif, the Great Man-Made River project, stopped water from being pumped to Tripoli, and threatened the workers. The move by the armed group was a way to pressure and force the release the of detained family members. On 10 April 2020, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Libya, Yacoub El Hillo condemned the water supply cutoff as \\"particularly reprehensible\\". On 21 April 2020, the UN took in to consideration the \\"dramatic increase\\" of shelling on densely populated areas of Tripoli, and claimed that continuation of war is worsening the humanitarian situation of Libya. The organisation also warned that such activities could possibly lead to war crimes. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) in its first quarter report for 2020 on the civilian casualty in Libya cited that approximately 131 casualties have taken place between 1 January and 31 March 2020. The figures included 64 deaths and 67 injuries, all of which were a result of the ground fighting, bombing and targeted killing led by Khalifa Haftar‚Äôs army, the LNA, backed by the United Arab Emirates. On 5 May 2020, The International Criminal Court‚Äôs chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, raised concerns over the continuous spree of attacks by Haftar on Tripoli. The prosecutor said that actions endanger lives and also warned of possible war crimes, due to current state of affairs. \\"Of particular concern to my Office are the high numbers of civilian casualties, largely reported to be resulting from airstrikes and shelling operations,\\" she expressed in a statement.  Timeline   Peace efforts  During the first half of 2015, the United Nations facilitated a series of negotiations seeking to bring together the rival governments and warring militias of Libya. A meeting between the rival governments was held at Auberge de Castille in Valletta, Malta on 16 December 2015. On 17 December, delegates from the two governments signed a peace deal backed by the UN in Skhirat, Morocco, although there was opposition to this within both factions. The Government of National Accord was formed as a result of this agreement, and its first meeting took place in Tunis on 2 January 2016. On 17 December 2017, general Khalifa Haftar declared the Skhirat agreement void. A meeting called the Libyan National Conference was planned in Ghadames for organising elections and a peace process in Libya. The conference was prepared over 18 months during 2018 and 2019 and was planned to take place 14‚Äì16 April 2019. It was postponed in early April 2019 as a result of the military actions of the 2019 Western Libya offensive. The Libya Summit in Berlin, Germany on 19 January 2020 In July 2019, Ghassan Salam√©, the head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), proposed a three-point peace plan (a truce during Eid al-Adha, an international meeting of countries implicated in the conflict, and an internal Libyan conference similar to the Libyan National Conference). In September 2019, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) discussed the need for the PSC to play a greater role in concluding the Libyan crisis, putting forward a proposal to appoint a joint AU-UN envoy to Libya. Turkish President RT Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin made a joint call for ceasefire, starting 12 January 2020, to end the proxy war in Libya. The ceasefire is said to have been broken hours after its initiation. Both the warring parties ‚Äì GNA supported by Turkey and LNA backed by Saudi, UAE, Egypt and Jordan ‚Äì blamed each other for the violence that broke out in Tripoli. Turkey‚Äôs Foreign Minister, Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu said Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by foreign powers including the UAE, does not want peace and is seeking a military solution to the drawn-out war in the country. Haftar's forces launched attacks on Abu Gurain province, near the port city of Misurata, Libya‚Äôs UN-recognized government claimed. The attacks were seen as a violation of cease-fire accord signed at the Berlin Conference. On 12 February, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution demanding a \\"lasting cease-fire\\" in Libya. Drafted by Britain, it received 14 votes, while Russia abstained. Around 19 February, the government withdrew from peace talks following rocket attacks on Tripoli. At the urging of the UN, both sides agreed to a new ceasefire in late March due to the novel coronavirus; however, the ceasefire quickly fell apart. On 24 March shells hit a prison in an area held by the GNA, drawing UN condemnation. The GNA launched a series of \\"counter-attacks\\" early on 25 March, in response to what the GNA called \\"the heaviest bombardments Tripoli has seen\\". In June 2020, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi brokered an agreement with parties aligned to the Libyan National Army, calling it the Cairo Declaration - However, this was quickly rejected. On 21 August 2020,Libya's rival authorities have announced an immediate ceasefire.The Tripoli-based and internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) published a statement that also calls for elections in March 2021. The United Nations Security Council received a confidential report in September 2020, which provided details of the extensive violations of the international arms embargo on Libya, since the beginning of 2020. The UN identified eight countries breaching embargo. Besides, the United Arab Emirates and Russia were found to have sent five cargo aircraft filled with weapons to Libya on 19 January 2020, when the world leaders were signing a pledge to respect the arms embargo on Libya, at the Berlin conference. Four out of the five cargo airplanes belonged to the UAE. On 16 September 2020, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu told CNN Turk that Turkey and Russia have moved closer to an agreement on a ceasefire and political process in Libya during their latest meetings in Ankara. According to Reuters, Turkey and Russia are the main power brokers in Libya‚Äôs war, backing opposing sides. Russia supports the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar, while Turkey backs Libya‚Äôs internationally-recognised Government of National Accord. In September 2020, the European Union issued sanctions against two people, who were indirectly or directly engaged in serious human rights abuses. While Benghazi-based Mahmoud al-Werfalli was engaged in violations like killings and executions, Moussa Diab was involved in human trafficking and the kidnapping, raping and killing of migrants and refugees. Three companies, Turkish maritime firm Avrasya Shipping, Jordan- based Med Wave Shipping and a Kazakhstan-based air freight company, Sigma Airlines, were also sanctioned for breaching the UN arms embargo by transferring military material to Libya. Among these, Sigma Airlines was also found involved in the air-borne hard cash shipments for the Khalifa Haftar‚Äôs government from the United Arab Emirates, Russia and the United Kingdom, among others. Sigma Airlines was also involved in a bank-note delivery made on 29 January 2019 for the LNA, using a commercial network operating through the UAE, Ukraine, Jordan and Belarus. In approximately $227 million bank note transfers, $91 million came from the UK, $27 million from Russia and $5 million from the UAE, which recorded highest number of transfers among 14 countries that were involved.  Reactions  = Domestic reactions = Khalifa Haftar and his supporters describe Operation Dignity as a \\"correction to the path of the revolution\\" and a \\"war on terrorism\\". The elected parliament has declared that Haftar's enemies are \\"terrorists\\". Opponents of Haftar and the House of Representatives' government in Tripoli claim he is attempting a coup. Omar al-Hasi, the internationally unrecognized Prime Minister of the Libya Dawn-backed Tripoli government, speaking of his allies' actions, has stated that: \\"This is a correction of the revolution.\\" He has also contended: \\"Our revolution had fallen into a trap.\\" Dawn commanders claim to be fighting for a \\"revolutionary\\" cause rather than for religious or partisan objectives. Islamist militia group Ansar al-Sharia (linked to the 2012 Benghazi attack) has denounced Haftar's campaign as a Western-backed \\"war on Islam\\" and has declared the establishment of the \\"Islamic Emirate of Benghazi\\". The National Oil Corporation (NOC) denounced calls to blockade oil fields prior to the Berlin Conference on 19 January 2020, calling it a criminal act. The entity warned to prosecute offenders to the highest degree under Libyan and international law. Dignitaries from Tripoli, Sahel and Mountain regions in Libya expressed discomposure at the briefing by the UN envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame at the Security Council, for equalizing the aggressors (Haftar's forces backed by UAE and Egypt) and the defender (GNA forces). They said Salame‚Äôs statements made both the parties equal amid Haftar's offensive in Tripoli and the war crimes committed against civilians, including children. = Foreign reactions, involvement, and evacuations =  Neighboring countries  * ‚Äì Early in May 2014, the Algerian military said it was engaged in an operation aimed at tracking down militants who infiltrated the country's territory in Tamanrasset near the Libyan border, during which it announced that it managed to kill 10 \\"terrorists\\" and seized a large cache of weapons near the town of Janet consisting of automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition boxes. The Times reported on 30 May that Algerian forces were strongly present in Libya and it was claimed shortly after by an Algerian journalist from El Watan that a full regiment of 3,500 paratroopers logistically supported by 1,500 other men crossed into Libya and occupied a zone in the west of the country. They were later shown to be operating alongside French special forces in the region. However, all of these claims were later denied by the Algerian government through Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal who told the senate that \\"Algeria has always shown its willingness to assist [our] sister countries, but things are clear: the Algerian army will not undertake any operation outside Algerian territory\\". On 16 May 2014, the Algerian government responded to a threat on its embassy in Libya by sending a team of special forces to Tripoli to escort its diplomatic staff in a military plane out of the country. \\"Due to a real and imminent threat targeting our diplomats the decision was taken in coordination with Libyan authorities to urgently close our embassy and consulate general temporarily in Tripoli,\\" the Algerian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Three days later, the Algerian government shut down all of its border crossings with Libya and the army command raised its security alert status by tightening its presence along the border, especially on the Tinalkoum and Debdab border crossings. This also came as the state-owned energy firm, Sonatrach, evacuated all of its workers from Libya and halted production in the country. In mid-August, Algeria opened its border for Egyptian refugees stranded in Libya and said it would grant them exceptional visas to facilitate their return to Egypt. * ‚Äì In June 2020, Chadian President Idriss D√©by announced his support to Khalifa Haftar's force in Libya, and had sent 1,500 to 2,000 troops to help Haftar, in wake of call from the United Arab Emirates to support Haftar's force against the strengthening Tripoli government and to end incursions by anti-D√©by rebels. Chadian oppositions have accused Khalifa Haftar of his attempt to assassinate Chadian opposition leaders. * ‚Äì Egyptian authorities have long expressed concern over the instability in eastern Libya spilling over into Egypt due to the rise of jihadist movements in the region, which the government believes to have developed into a safe transit for wanted Islamists following the 2013 coup d'√©tat in Egypt that ousted Muslim Brotherhood-backed president Mohamed Morsi. There have been numerous attacks on Egypt's trade interests in Libya which were rampant prior to Haftar's offensive, especially with the kidnapping of truck drivers and sometimes workers were murdered. Due to this, the military-backed government in Egypt had many reasons to support Haftar's rebellion and the Islamist February 17th Martyrs Brigade operating in Libya has accused the Egyptian government of supplying Haftar with weapons and ammunition, a claim denied by both Cairo and the rebel leader. Furthermore, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has become increasingly popular among many Libyans wishing for stability, has called on the United States to intervene militarily in Libya during his presidential candidacy, warning that Libya was becoming a major security challenge and vowed not to allow the turmoil there to threaten Egypt's national security. On 21 July 2014, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry urged its nationals residing in Libya to adopt measures of extreme caution as it was preparing to send consular staff in order to facilitate their return their country following an attack in Egypt's western desert region near the border with Libya that left 22 Egyptian border guards killed. A week later, the ministry announced that it would double its diplomatic officials on the Libyan-Tunisian border and reiterated its call on Egyptian nationals to find shelter in safer places in Libya. On 3 August, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia agreed to cooperate by establishing an airbridge between Cairo and Tunis that would facilitate the transfer of 2,000 to 2,500 Egyptians from Libya daily. On 31 July 2014, two Egyptians were shot dead during a clash at the Libyan-Tunisian border where hundreds of Egyptians were staging a protest at the Ras Jdeir border crossing. As they tried to cross into Tunisia, Libyan authorities opened fire to disperse them. A similar incident occurred once again on 15 August, when Libyan security forces shot dead an Egyptian who attempted to force his way through the border along with hundreds of stranded Egyptians and almost 1,200 Egyptians made it into Tunisia that day. This came a few days after Egypt's Minister of Civil Aviation, Hossam Kamal, announced that the emergency airlift consisting of 46 flights aimed at evacuating the country's nationals from Libya came to a conclusion, adding that 11,500 Egyptians in total had returned from the war-torn country as of 9 August. A week later, all Egyptians on the Libyan-Tunisian border were evacuated and the consulate's staff, who were reassigned to work at the border area, withdrew from Libya following the operation's success. Meanwhile, an estimated 50,000 Egyptians (4,000 per day) arrived at the Salloum border crossing on the Libyan-Egyptian border as of early August. In 2020, Egypt helped devise the 2020 Cairo Declaration, however, this was quickly rejected. On 21 June 2020, the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered his army to be prepared for any mission outside the nation, stating that his country has a legitimate right to intervene in neighboring Libya. Besides, he also warned the GNA forces to not cross the current frontline with Haftar‚Äôs LNA. An official statement issued by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates on 21 June 2020, stated that the two Gulf nations extended full support to the Egypt‚Äôs government regarding its intentions of military intervention in Libya. The UN- recognized GNA condemned Egypt, UAE, Russia and France for providing military support to Haftar‚Äôs militias. * ‚Äì Along with most of the international community, Malta continues to recognize the Government of National Accord as the legitimate government of Libya. I Eastern Libyan government charg√© d'affaires Hussin Musrati insisted that by doing so, Malta was \\"interfering in Libyan affairs\\". Due to the conflict, there are currently two Libyan embassies in Malta. The General National Congress now controls the official Libyan Embassy in Balzan, while the Tobruk-based Eastern Libyan House of Representatives has opened a consulate in Ta' Xbiex. Each of the two embassies say that visas issued by the other entity are not valid. Following the expansion of ISIL in Libya, particularly the fall of Nawfaliya, the Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil called for the United Nations and European Union to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state. In 2020 Malta stated that its policy on Libya was in line with that of Turkey. * ‚Äì At the early stage of the conflict, Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir, an Islamist himself, had sought to reach support to the Tripoli government, having supplied weaponry and aids to the rebels overthrowing Muammar Gaddafi. However, after al- Bashir's realignment with Saudi Arabia in wake of Yemeni conflict, Sudan provided support to Haftar's force to gain support from Saudi Arabia. Sudan had sent 1,000 militia personnel to aid Haftar. Nonetheless, in July 2017, General Khalifa Haftar of the Libyan National Army ordered the closing of the Sudanese consulate in the town of Kufra, and expelled 12 diplomats. The consul and 11 other consular staff were given 72 hours to leave the country. The reason given that the way it conducted its work was \\"damaging to Libyan national security.\\" The Sudanese government protested and summoned Libyan charge d'affaires in Khartoum, Ali Muftah Mahroug, in response, lingering the distrust between Haftar to the Sudanese. Sudan recognises the Government of National Accord in Tripoli as the government of Libya, not the House of Representatives that is backed by General Haftar. As of 2017 Sudan has not opened an embassy in Tripoli but maintains a consulate in the Libyan capital to provide service to Sudanese citizens.Khalifa Haftar expels 12 Sudan diplomats from Libya. Middle East Eye. Published 27 July 2017. Retrieved 14 April 2019. In 2020, following the overthrown of Omar al-Bashir, Sudan has sought to investigate the role of the United Arab Emirates on bringing Sudanese mercenaries fighting in Libya and have arrested a number of them. * ‚Äì Post-revolutionary Tunisia also had its share of instability due to the violence in Libya as it witnessed an unprecedented rise in radical Islamism with increased militant activity and weapons' smuggling through the border. In response to the initial clashes in May, the Tunisian National Council for Security held an emergency meeting and decided to deploy 5,000 soldiers to the Libyan‚ÄìTunisian border in anticipation of potential consequences from the fighting. On 30 July 2014, Tunisian Foreign Minister Mongi Hamdi said that the country cannot cope with the high number of refugees coming from Libya due to the renewed fighting. \\"Our country's economic situation is precarious, and we cannot cope with hundreds of thousands of refugees,\\" Hamdi said in a statement. He also added that Tunisia will close its borders if necessary. Tunisian Foreign Minister, Khemaies Jhinaoui, revived Tunisia's stance to stop the fighting in Libya and follow the UN-led political suit. He stressed on rejection of military solutions to the war. In January 2020, Tunisia said that it is preparing to accommodate a new inflow of migrants escaping the war in Libya. The country has chosen the site of Fatnassia to receive Libyan refugees.  Others  * ‚Äì On 27 August 2014, the UN Security Council unanimously approved resolution 2174 (2014), which called for an immediate ceasefire and an inclusive political dialogue. The resolution also threatened to impose sanctions, such as asset freezes and travel bans, against the leaders and supporters of the various militias involved in the fighting, if the individuals threaten either the security of Libya or the political process. The United Nations Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, expressed his fears of a \\"full civil war\\" in Libya, unless the international community finds a political solution for the country's conflict. In 2019, the United Nations reported that Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had systematically violated the Libyan arms embargo. In February 2020, Libya's Ambassador to the UN, Taher Al-Sunni, emphasized on documenting attacks against civilians, medical personnel and field hospitals in Libya, during his meeting with the Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Around 2 March 2020, Ghassan Salam√© (the UN special envoy to Libya) resigned, citing the failure of powerful nations to meet their recent commitments. In June 2020, UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres condemned and expressed shock at discovering mass graves in a Libyan territory that was formerly captured by the forces of general Khalifa Haftar, backed by the governments of Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Guterres commanded the UN-backed government to ensure identifying the victims, investigate into the cause of death and return the bodies to the respective family. On 25 September 2020, UN diplomats revealed that Russia and China blocked the official release of a report by UN experts on Libya. The report accused the warring parties and their international backers, including Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, of violating the 2011 UN arms embargo on the war-torn country. * ‚Äì On 30 July 2014, the French government temporarily closed its embassy in Tripoli, while 40 French, including the ambassador, and 7 British nationals were evacuated on a French warship bound for the port of Toulon in southern France. \\"We have taken all necessary measures to allow those French nationals who so wish to leave the country temporarily,\\" the foreign ministry said. In 2016, a helicopter carrying three French special forces soldiers was shot down south of Benghazi during what President Fran√ßois Hollande called \\"dangerous intelligence operations.\\" In December 2019, French government canceled the delivery of boats to Libya following a lawsuit filed by NGOs opposing the move. The NGOs cited the French donation as a violation of European embargo on Libya for providing military equipment and arms to countries involved in war crimes. * ‚Äì Ministry of External Affairs spokesman, Syed Akbaruddin, said that India's diplomatic mission in Libya has been in touch with the 4,500 Indian nationals, through several co-ordinators. \\"The mission is facilitating return of Indian nationals and working with the Libyan authorities to obtain necessary exit permissions for Indian nationals wanting to return,\\" he said. * ‚Äì Iran has facilitated a very difficult role in this conflict. Unlike many countries in the Middle East that Iran has interests, Iran has very little to none of interest in Libya, but Iran has desired to expand its Islamic Revolution to Africa. However, Saudi Arabia's support for Haftar has complicated Iran's desire, as Iran has also been accused of supporting Haftar's force, even when Tehran has refrained from siding with Haftar. On the other hand, Iran also provides political support to Turkey's military intervention to Libya. * ‚Äì Israel and Libya do not have any official relations. However, during the time in exile, Khalifa Haftar had developed a close and secret tie with the United States, thus extended to Israel, and the secret tie resulted in Israel quietly backs Khalifa Haftar on his quest to conquer entire of Libya. Israeli advisors have secretly trained Haftar's force to prepare for war against the Islamist-backed government in Tripoli. Israeli weapons are also seen in Haftar's forces, mostly throughout Emirati mediation. Mossad, the feared Israeli intelligence group, has also developed a strong relationship with Haftar and also assists Haftar's force in the conflict. * ‚Äì The Italian embassy has remained open during the civil war and the government has always pushed for the success of UN-hosted talks among Libya's political parties in Geneva. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said \\"If there's no success, Italy is ready to play a leading role, above all a diplomatic role, and then, always under the aegis of the UN, one of peacekeeping inside Libya\\", adding that \\"Libya can't be left in the condition it is now.\\" In 2015, four Italian workers were kidnapped by Islamic State militants near Sabratha. Two of them were killed in a raid by security forces the following year while the other two were rescued. Between February 2015 and December 2016, however, Italy was forced to close its embassy and every Italian citizen in Libya was advised to leave. The embassy reopened on 9 January 2017. * ‚Äì Morocco turned down an offer by the United Arab Emirates in 2020 to provide support for Khalifa Haftar. Instead, Morocco expressed its hope to mediate for the end of the conflict. * ‚Äì In February 2015, discussions on supporting the Libyan parliament by supplying them with weapons reportedly took place in Cairo when President of Russia Vladimir Putin arrived for talks with the government of Egypt, during which the Russian delegates also spoke with a Libyan delegation. Colonel Ahmed al-Mismari, the spokesperson for the Libyan Army's chief of staff, also stated that \\"Arming the Libyan army was a point of discussion between the Egyptian and Russian presidents in Cairo.\\"Egypt acts as middleman for Russia-Libya arms deal .

A private army of 100 mercenaries from the Wagner group, backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has begun offensive on the forward base in Libya. On 2 October 2019, at least 35 Russian mercenaries were killed in Libya while fighting for Khalifa Haftar's forces. According to the reports, senior commander in Russian Wagner Group, Alexander Kuznetsov was injured while fighting alongside Haftar's militias in south of Tripoli. In a joint press conference with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed the involvement of Russian mercenaries in Tripoli‚Äôs ongoing conflict. He also said they are not affiliated to Moscow and are not funded by the government. These fighters were transferred to Libya from the de-escalation zone in Syria's Idlib. French daily Le Monde reported that Saudi Arabia was funding the operations of Russian Wagner mercenaries deployed to support Khalifa Haftar in Libya. It also claimed that over 2000 Russian mercenaries were involved in carrying out attacks on Tripoli in late 2019. * ‚Äì Saudi Arabia since 2014 has thrown a significant support for Haftar's force fighting in Libya. According from Wall Street Journal and retrieved by Al Jazeera, Saudi Arabia had given millions of dollars to support Haftar's army in its failed attempt to takeover Tripoli after a meeting with General Haftar by Saudi King Salman. Due to Haftar's defeat, Saudi Arabia was thought to have become increasingly involved in Libya. * ‚Äì In late July 2014, the Thai government asked Libya's authorities to facilitate the evacuation of its nationals by exempting the need for exit visas. As of 14 August, over 800 Thai workers have been successfully evacuated from the country, while Thailand's Ministry of Labour announced that it would prepare jobs for more than 2,800 workers residing in Libya. * ‚Äì Turkey has been one of the most vocal critics of the civil war, mostly aimed against the Eastern Government led by Khalifa Haftar. Turkey was found to have transported arms, ammunitions and aids to the Western Government led by Fayez al-Sarraj against Haftar's force. In 2019, the Libyan National Army accused the Turkish authorities of supporting terrorist groups in Libya for many years, adding that the Turkish support has evolved from just logistic support to a direct interference using military aircraft to transport mercenaries, as well as ships carrying weapons, armored vehicles and ammunition to support terrorism in Libya. In 2016, Jordan's king accused Turkey of helping Islamist militias in Libya and Somalia. In July 2019, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the President of Turkey, threatened to declare war on Khalifa Haftar after receiving news of six Turkish citizens arrested by Haftar's force. On 27 December 2019 Bloomberg reported that Turkey intended to deploy its navy to protect Tripoli and send troops to help train GNA forces. Additionally Turkmen rebel groups fighting in northern Syria were expected to transfer to Tripoli. The Speaker of the Turkish Parliament subsequently announced Turkey‚Äôs plans to send troops to help Libya's Presidential Council's government, especially after the efforts of Haftar's backers, including UAE, to pressurize Fayez Al-Sarraj to recede the request for Turkey‚Äôs support. On 2 January 2020, the Turkish Grand National Assembly voted 325‚Äì184 to send troops to help the internationally- recognized Government of National Accord in Libya. * ‚Äì Following France's evacuation of some British nationals, the UK's embassy in Tripoli was the only diplomatic mission still open in the war-torn city. However, British diplomats residing there have sought refuge in a fortified compound south-west of the city to avoid the repetitive rocket attacks by warring militias. Three days earlier, a convoy carrying British diplomats from Tripoli to Tunisia came under fire when their vehicles refused to stop at an unofficial checkpoint in the outskirts of the city. On 2 August, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office finally announced that it would temporarily close its embassy in the capital and evacuate its staff. Ambassador Michael Aron said that the embassy would continue to operate from Tunisia. The following day, the Royal Navy ship HMS Enterprise managed to evacuate more than a hundred foreign nationals from the country to Malta, most of whom were British, in an operation off the coast of Tripoli. In March 2016, Ambassador Peter Millett called for \\"a much more coordinated approach between the different groups, regions and forces and the armed groups in Libya\\" in order to defeat ISIL in Libya. Head of British Embassy in Libya, Nicholas Hopton said that Britain is drafting a resolution in the Security Council in order to genuinely end the Libyan crisis. The draft resolution urges the U.N. and the international community to effectively achieve a ceasefire with the help of a monitoring mission and other sources, the HCS Information Office said. * ‚Äì In June 2019 the GNA discovered a cache of US-made Javelin anti-tank missiles in a captured LNA base in the mountains south of Tripoli. Markings on the missiles‚Äô shipping containers indicate that they were originally sold to Oman and the United Arab Emirates in 2008. Emirati forces, who previously conducted airstrikes on Islamist targets in Libya, were suspected of backing General Khalifa Haftar. The United States State Department and Defense Department stated they have opened investigations into how the weapons ended up on the Libyan battlefield. The Emirati Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement denying ownership of weapons found in Libya and stated that it supported United Nations-led efforts to broker a political solution to the conflict. France later released a statement that the missiles found in the base belonged to France, and that they were damaged and out of use. Nevertheless, the UAE has been identified as a strong supporter of Khalifa Haftar and the LNA, which saw the Libyan general and his forces as the best bulwark to contain and combat various Islamist groups in the war torn country; the UN reported that the UAE supplied Haftar's forces with aircraft, over 100 armoured vehicles and over US$200 million in aid. According to The Libya Observer, a covert deal between Khalifa Haftar and figures from the Muammar Gaddafi-era, Revolutionary Committees, was signed in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Both the parties agreed to share power in Libya, enabling Gaddafi‚Äôs loyalists to retrieve power in return for supporting Haftar in the ongoing fighting. According to a French Intelligence website, UAE supplied around 3,000 tons of military equipment to Haftar forces in late January 2020. The transit operation was completed through \\"Antonov 124\\" aircraft owned by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and operated by Makassimos Air Cargo Company. In April 2020, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates secretly purchased an advanced missile system from Israel. The UAE, which had been supplying weapons to Khalifa Haftar in the Libyan civil war, also deployed the Israeli-made missile system in the war through the LNA. On 20 April 2020, the Financial Times reported the suspected violation of an international arms embargo by the United Arab Emirates. It reported the claims after reviewing documents that cited 11,000 tonnes of jet fuel shipment worth nearly $5 million was sent by the UAE to Khalifa Haftar-controlled eastern Libya in March 2020. The shipment is currently under probe by a panel of experts from the United Nations. According to Human Rights Watch, on 18 November 2019, the UAE launched a drone attack on a biscuit factory in Al-Sunbulah that killed 8 civilians and injured 27. The factory was shut down after the attack. According to an investigation led by Human Rights Watch, the factory had no military presence. The remnants of four laser-guided missiles ‚Äì Blue Arrow-7 (BA-7) ‚Äì were found, which were launched via a Wing Long -II drone. In May 2020, a confidential report by the United Nations revealed that the UAE had been supporting the mission of Khalifa Haftar through two Dubai-based companies, Lancaster 6 DMCC and Opus Capital Asset Limited FZE. These firms deployed a team of 20 Western mercenaries led by South African national Steve Lodge to Libya for a \\"well funded private military company operation\\" in June 2019. An investigation by BBC Africa Eye and BBC Arabic Documentaries revealed that in a strike on 4 January 2020, the UAE-operated Wing Loong II drone was used to fire a Chinese Blue Arrow 7 missile, which killed 26 unarmed cadets. During that time, the Wing Loong II drones were being operated only from the UAE-run Al-Khadim Libyan air base. * ‚Äì The United States has been active in post-2011 Libya with the military carrying out sporadic airstrikes and raids in the country, predominantly against Islamist groups. In 2014, U.S. commandos seized an oil tanker bound for anti-government militias and returned it to the Libyan national government. Two months later, the U.S. embassy in Tripoli was evacuated due to a heavy militia presence in the capital. In 2015, U.S. warplanes killed the head of the Islamic State in Libya in a strike. In 2016, U.S. President Barack Obama stated that not preparing for a post-Gaddafi Libya was the \\"worst mistake\\" of his presidency. On 19 January 2017, the day before President Obama left office, the United States bombed two IS camps in Libya, reportedly killing 80 militants. These types of operations have continued under the Trump administration with a September 2017 airstrike killing an estimated 17 IS militants. On 25 September 2019, airstrike carried out by the U.S. killed 11 suspected ISIL militants in the town of Murzuq, Libya. This was the second airstrike in a week against the militant group, according to U.S. Africa Command. A U.S. military air-raid, on 27 September, killed 17 suspected ISIL militants in southwest Libya, making it a third strike against the militia group within a month. On 30 September, US Africa Command said it conducted an airstrike in southern Libya that killed 7 ISIL militants, alongside the Government of National Accord. This marked the fourth raid in the region against ISIL in two weeks. On 10 February 2020, at least six Libyan families sued Haftar and the UAE government in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia for committing war crimes in Libya. The families of victims who were either killed, injured or faced attempted killings, demanded $1 billion in damages, said the plaintiffs‚Äô attorneys, Martin F. McMahon & Associates. * - A number of Il-76TD turbofan strategic airlifters belonging to Ukraine-registered companies have been destroyed in Libya.

Born into a well-to-do family of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Noyes attended Yale University from 1904 to 1908. He played for their basketball team and was the captain for his final two seasons. As a senior in 1907‚Äì08, Noyes was selected as a consensus All-American by the Helms Athletic Foundation. After graduation, Noyes spent the next three years in his home state, serving as the head coach of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's basketball team. In three seasons in charge of the Badgers, Noyes compiled a 26‚Äì15 overall record. Two years later, he found himself in charge of Yale's team. For the 1913‚Äì14 season, his only as their head coach, Yale recorded an 11‚Äì7 record. During his time in Wisconsin, Noyes became greatly interested in conserving the environment. And although he had earned a law degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School, he decided to pursue his passion. In 1926, he proposed a law that centralized conservationism in Wisconsin under a director and six unpaid commissioners. In 1930, he established the Haskell Noyes Conservation Warden Efficiency Award, which is still given annually to the person selected as the top Warden in Wisconsin. Noyes died on December 8, 1948, several days after falling and fracturing his skull. He was 62 years old. In 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame.

Robert Alfred Vaughan Life The eldest child of Robert Vaughan, he was born at Worcester on 18 March 1823, a seven-months child who was frail. His father began his education, and he entered University College school, London, in 1836 at age 13. Passing on to University College, he graduated B.A. at the age of 19 (1842) with classical honours, in London University. In 1843 he became a student at the Lancashire Independent College, under his father's presidency. Having finished his course in Manchester, and become engaged to be married, Vaughan spent a session (1846‚Äì7) at the University of Halle, coming under the influence of Julius M√ºller and August Tholuck. At this time he thought his main object should be a series of ecclesiastical dramas to illustrate church history: Tholuck suggested the study of philosophy. Between June and October 1847 he travelled in Italy with his father. Early in 1848 he became assistant to William Jay at Argyle Chapel, Bath. He expected to be ordained as colleague and successor to Jay, and resigned when difficulties were made about this; his engagement ended on 24 March 1850. Accepting a call from Ebenezer Chapel, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, Vaughan was ordained there on 8 September 1850. He was learning Spanish and Dutch (to add to French, German, and Italian) to gain access to writings of mystics, and was contributing constantly to the British Quarterly. In the autumn of 1854 he visited Glasgow but declined a call to succeed Ralph Wardlaw, returned home ill, and was laid up for two months with pleurisy. In the spring of 1855 symptoms of pulmonary disease were apparent; he resigned his charge, preaching his last sermon on 24 June. Vaughan was an invalid at Bournemouth, St. John's Wood, and Westbourne Park, London. He died at 19 Alexander Street, Westbourne Park, on 26 October 1857. Works Vaughan's first publication was The Witch of Endor, and other Poems, 1844. His father set him on reading Origen for an article for the British Quarterly; when published (October 1845) it won praise from Sir James Stephen and Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd. To the London University Magazine he contributed in 1846 a dramatic piece Edwin and Elgiva. While at Bath Vaughan wrote articles for the British Quarterly on Schleiermacher and Savonarola, and planned from 1849 his work on the mystics. In August 1855 he put to press Hours with the Mystics, in dialogue form, published in March 1856, 2 vols.; an enlarged edition appeared in 1860, edited by his father; a third edition in 1880, edited by his son, Wycliffe Vaughan. In 1857 Vaughan was still contributing articles to Fraser's Magazine and the British Quarterly. His Essays and Remains were published in 1858, 2 vols. Some of his letters are in Positive Religion, 1857, edited by Edward White. Family About 1848 Vaughan married the only child of James Finlay of Newcastle upon Tyne.

He was Principal of Swansea Art School from 1908 to 1943, and the first curator of the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea from 1910 to 1950. He played a leading part in the artistic life of Swansea between the wars. Biography Murray was born on 11 August 1877 in Portsoy, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the second son of William Alexander Minty Murray (1848‚Äì1920), a cabinet maker, and his wife May Grant (1848‚Äì1890). His elder brother George Murray (1897‚Äì1898) also became an artist, who was renowned for his murals, portraits and mosaics. He was educated at Blairgowrie High School, Blairgowrie School of Art (1893-97), Edinburgh School of Art (1897-98) and the Royal College of Art in London (1876‚Äì1933), where he won several prizes. After leaving the Royal College with an ARCA, he studied at Acad√©mie Julian in Paris in 1905. In 1909 he married Margaret Falconer Findlay. They had two sons: Ivan Grant (born 1912) and George Findlay (born 1913). He died in Swansea on 17 November 1950. Swansea Art School Before moving to Swansea, Murray was Art Headmaster of West Bromwich Municipal School of Art for three and a half years. While being interviewed for the position of principal of Swansea Municipal School of Art in 1908 (later Swansea Art School, now part of University of Wales, Trinity Saint David), Murray told the interviewing panel: He told them that the Art School was the most dismal that he had ever seen, the rooms were too small and the lighting was bad. As far as he could see, their Art School was as good as dead and he had no desire to be associated with the inevitable funeral! He was appointed on the first ballot. On his appointment he was the only teacher for 107 part-time students. Under his leadership the school grew rapidly in scope and reputation. In 1910 the Art School was ranked 140th in England and Wales; by 1914 it was in 25th place. In 1925 the school won a Grand Prix at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris. In 1939 it had 530 students. Murray introduced stained glass making in the art school in 1935. It has since developed into a major centre for artistic glass. He retired in 1943, after 34 years as principal. Glynn Vivian Art Gallery In 1911, two years after becoming principal of Swansea Art School, Murray was asked to become curator of the new Glynn Vivian Art Gallery in Swansea. He accepted, providing that an assistant was appointed at the school, and held both posts concurrently. The gallery was financed by the art collector Richard Glynn Vivian, who provided his collection of paintings, drawings and china. Building on Richard Glynn Vivian's collection, Murray expanded the gallery's collection by acquiring works by established painters such as Augustus John, Gwen John and James Dickson Innes; and younger painters including Kyffin Williams and John Elwyn. Murray played a leading part in the acquisition for Swansea of the British Empire Panels by Frank Brangwyn. These sixteen large panels had been commissioned in 1927 for the Royal Gallery at the House of Lords as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, but they were rejected as unsuitable for the Palace of Westminster. They were installed in the Brangwyn Hall Swansea in 1934, where they remain. Murray remained curator of the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery until his death in 1950. Painting Murray was a figurative artist who mainly painted landscapes in watercolour and oils. At the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris he learned to brighten his palette, and to take on new ideas from the impressionists.

In addition to writing 18 books with Gregory White Smith, Naifeh is a businessman who founded several companies, including Best Lawyers that spawned an industry of professional rankings. He is also an artist whose geometric abstractions, many large in scale, have been exhibited widely throughout the world over a period of 45 years. Jackson Pollock: An American Saga was published on December 24, 1989. The Philadelphia Inquirer called the book \\"Brilliant and definitive ‚Ä¶ so absorbing in its narrative drive and so exhaustively detailed that it makes everything that came before seem like trial balloons.\\" Van Gogh: The Life, which Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called \\"magisterial,\\" was published in 2011 with a companion website hosting over 6,000 pages of notes. The book stirred global controversy by debunking the widely accepted theory that Van Gogh committed suicide and arguing instead that village bullies shot him. \\"As a tale of ambition, hard-fought fleeting triumphs and dark despair,\\" said SFGate, \\"it has the dramatic pull of a gripping nineteenth-century novel. ‚Ä¶ [The] biography enriches the eye.

Personal life Naifeh was born to U.S. diplomats George Naifeh and Marion Naifeh in Tehran, Iran, on June 19, 1952. His father is of Lebanese descent. In addition to several cities in the U.S., he lived with his parents during their postings in Baghdad, Iraq; Baida, Libya; Benghazi, Libya; Lagos, Nigeria; Karachi, Pakistan; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Muscat, Oman; and Amman, Jordan. He began painting at age ten in Libya, studying with a Dutch-born artist, Catharina Baart Stephan. He later studied, at age fifteen, with Bruce Onobrakpeya, one of the leading Nigerian artists of the twentieth century. He had exhibitions in both Kano and Kaduna, Nigeria, and in Karachi, Pakistan. In 1974, he had an exhibition at McCormick Hall, site of the Princeton University Art Museum, and, in 1975, he had an exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the first exhibition of art created there in the city's history. \\"An Exhibition in Abu Dhabi is a rare happening,\\" Barbara Hughes wrote in the U.A.E. News. \\"But an exhibition of work mainly created in Abu Dhabi is probably unique.\\" Naifeh graduated summa cum laude from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware, in 1970. He then attended Princeton University and graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in history in 1974 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"Culture Making: Money, Success and the New York Art World.\\"http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01d791sh29x He graduated from the Harvard Law School in 1977, and received a master's degree in fine arts, also from Harvard, in 1979. His undergraduate thesis on the New York Art World was published by Princeton University in 1976. and his Ph.D. dissertation on the artist Gene Davis was published in 1982. Naifeh received honorary doctorates from the University of South Carolina Aiken in 1998 and the Juilliard School in 2012. In 1989, along with Gregory White Smith, he purchased the Joye Cottage in Aiken, South Carolina in 1989. Together, they restored the historic Whitney-Vanderbilt house, a creation of both Stanford White and Carr√®re and Hastings. The story of that renovation is told in their book, On a Street Called Easy, In a Cottage Called Joye, which The New York Times called \\"wry and gentle ‚Ä¶ house-and-garden renovations gone delectably awry.\\" Since 2009, Naifeh has served as co-chairman of Juilliard in Aiken Festival, an annual performing arts festival in Aiken. The 2014, Festival culminated in an early-music performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion that was presented not only in Aiken but in Spivey Hall in Atlanta and Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. Naifeh married Gregory White Smith, his co-author and partner of 40 years, in 2011. Career Naifeh worked as an intern in the office of Congressman Charlie Wilson, as a docent at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and as an associate attorney at the law firm of Milbank Tweed. He was the author‚Äîall, except for the first book, co-authored with Smith‚Äîof many books including five New York Times bestsellers. He published Jackson Pollock: An American Saga in 1989, which won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and was also a finalist for the National Book Award. Interview Magazine said of the book, \\"For once, with this intense, engrossing, and indeed brilliant work, we have a biography that justifies its length. Seldom have the history of an artist, the development of his imagination, and the fevers of his soul been more grandly yet intimately described.\\" The book was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film by Ed Harris in 2000, Pollock (film). Harris said the biography was \\"the bible for the project and remained so until filming was completed.\\" The biography also served as an inspiration for John Updike's Seek My Face. \\"It would be in vain,\\" Updike wrote, \\"to deny that a large number of details come from the admirable, exhaustive 'Jackson Pollock: An American Saga.'\\" Naifeh also wrote Van Gogh: The Life, which was called \\"the definitive work for decades to come\\" by Leo Jansen of the Van Gogh Museum, in 2011. Time Magazine wrote: \\"Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, whose 1989 biography of Jackson Pollock won the Pulitzer Prize, have written this generation's definitive portrait of the great Dutch post-Impressionist. ‚Ä¶ Their most important achievement is to produce a reckoning with van Gogh's occasional 'madness' that doesn't lose sight of the lucidity and intelligence ‚Äì the profound sanity ‚Äì of his art.\\" The Boston Globe wrote: \\"Now, at last, with 'Van Gogh: The Life' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, we have what could very well be the definitive biography ‚Ä¶ And how pleased we should be that Naifeh and Smith have rendered so exquisitely and respectfully van Gogh's short, intense, and wholly interesting life.\\" In addition to English, Van Gogh: The Life has been published in Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese and is being translated into Italian, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Naifeh also wrote several how-to books to fund the writing of Pollock, including (with Michael Morgenstern), the best-seller How to Make Love to a Woman, which sold several million copies in 29 languages. He wrote several true crime books, including the bestseller The Mormon Murders in 1988 and Final Justice in 1993. The latter was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Fact Crime. Naifeh and Smith's one book of humor, detailing the renovation of Joye Cottage, was well-received: \\"Page after belly-ticking page,\\" wrote The Washington Post. \\"Numerous adventures bordering on slapstick. ‚Ä¶ A delightful read.\\" Together with Smith, Naifeh founded the legal publishing company Best Lawyers in 1981 which published The Best Lawyers in America, a peer-review list, in 1983. That list went on to become Best Lawyers, a global network linking lawyers and clients. In 2013, Best Lawyers ranked 74,965 lawyers representing 18,034 law firms in 75 countries. In 2009, the company partnered with U.S. News to produce rankings of law firms and in 2014 it gave out 61,138 rankings to 11,681 law firms in 120 practice areas. The Best Lawyers list is widely respected in the legal profession. Kevin Maroney, Associate General Counsel of United Healthcare, has said, \\"I always review Best Lawyers and rely on its recommendations.\\" Bernd-Peter Bier, Senior Vice President of the Tax Division at Bayer AG, has said, \\"I have used Best Lawyers to locate lawyers in an area of law that I do not have retained counsel. I find it to be a great resource.\\" Kevin R. Hackett, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of Rockefeller Group International, has said, \\"Best Lawyers is the gold standard in selecting a lawyer.\\" Naifeh returned to painting and sculpting in 1998, creating works of geometric abstraction based on geometric formulas from medieval art from southern Spain to northern India but closely related to the works of such twentieth-century western masters as Frank Stella and Sol Lewitt. He had an exhibition at the Columbia Museum of Art in the summer of 2013. Humanities Magazine noted that Naifeh's \\"tessellating works explore the threads weaving together traditional Islamic art and the Geometric Abstraction movement.\\" The Free Times wrote that the exhibition offered \\"many rich ideas for exploration: formal beauty, the nature of abstraction, how art and math intersect, and insights into the cultural expressions of\\" the Middle East. \\"This is, simply, a very important exhibition that deserves much more attention.\\" Naifeh had an exhibition at the art foundation MANA Contemporary in Jersey City, New Jersey, and at the Leila Heller Gallery in 2014. Naifeh's partner Smith was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 1975, which led to 13 brain surgeries as well as radiation and nuclear medicine treatments and experimental chemotherapeutic regimens. His search for cutting edge medical care was profiled on CBS's \\"60 Minutes\\" and recounted in their book Making Miracles Happen.

The San Francisco Bay Area comprises nine northern California counties and contains four of the ten most expensive counties in the United States. Strong economic growth has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, but coupled with severe restrictions on building new housing units, it has resulted in an extreme housing shortage which has driven rents to extremely high levels. The Sacramento Bee notes that large cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles both attribute their recent increases in homeless people to the housing shortage, with the result that homelessness in California overall has increased by 15% from 2015 to 2017. In September 2019, the Council of Economic Advisers released a report in which they stated that deregulation of the housing markets would reduce homelessness in some of the most constrained markets by estimates of 54% in San Francisco, 40% in Los Angeles, and 38% in San Diego, because rents would fall by 55%, 41%, and 39% respectively. In San Francisco, a minimum wage worker would have to work approximately 4.7 full-time jobs to be able to rent a two-bedroom apartment. San Francisco has several thousand homeless, despite extensive efforts by city government to address the issue. The dramatically larger prevalence of visible homelessness in the city (relative to other large US cities) is widely noted by visitors as well as residents, and as of 2018, is starting to impact the city's largest industry, tourism (a $9 billion industry), as one large doctors' group has decided to move their annual convention elsewhere after members' concerns about threatening behavior, mental illness, and assault on one of their board members. The number of the people in poverty in the San Francisco Bay Area grew from 573,333 (8.6%) in 2000 to 668,876 (9.7%) in 2006-2010. While poverty rates vary greatly across the SF Bay area, in 2015, the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies published that the poverty rate was 11.3%, having a slight downward trend from 12%; however, it was still above the historical average rate of 9%.  Historical background  = Emergence in the late 70's and early 80's = The prevalence of homelessness emerged both in San Francisco and the United States in general in the late 70's and early 80's. Jennifer Wolch identifies some of these factors to include the loss of jobs from deindustrialization, a rapid rise in housing prices, and the elimination of social welfare programs.Wolch, Jennifer R., and M. J. Dear. Malign Neglect: Homelessness in an American City. Jossey-Bass, 1993. The Reagan Administration made large cutbacks on affordable and public housing programs, such as Section 8, leaving much of the task of providing public and supportive housing up to local jurisdictions. The economic shift from production oriented jobs in factories towards the service industry resulted in a loss of wages as factory jobs were more lucrative. This decrease in wages was compounded by the fact housing prices continued to rise, with average real estate value in the Bay Area increasing by 100% between 1984 and 1990. As these economic changes were occurring, social events also impacted the city's homeless population. The deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s had succeeded, and saw the mass transfer of mental health patients to community based clinics. This transfer was not smooth, as many previously institutionalized patients found themselves back in society with less support than they were accustomed to and few possessed the professional skills or resources needed to successfully transition.Dear, Michael J. Landscapes of Despair: from Deinstitutionalization to Homelessness. Princeton Univ Press, 2016. The failure of deinstitutionalization is often attributed to the cuts to mental health services made at the same time, with mental health budgets decreasing by a third between 1978 and 1982. As a result, the homeless population has had a disproportionate rate of mental health needs ever since the 80's. = Feinstein years (1978-1988) = Dianne Feinstein was the first mayor of San Francisco forced to address the homeless issue. Her administration operated under the belief that the growing homeless problem was a temporary issue, and a side effect of the recent recession. The response to the problem was to open temporary shelters that provided a sandwich and a bed for a night, with the hope that those served could find permanent housing soon.Green, Mathew. ‚ÄúTIMELINE: The Frustrating Political History of Homelessness in San Francisco.‚Äù KQED, 23 Mar. 2018, www.kqed.org/lowdown/22644. This program proved to be underfunded and unprepared for the demand, as the homeless population continued to grow. = Agnos administration (1988-1992) = Feinstein's successor, Art Agnos, took a more involved approach to address the homeless problem as part of a broader progressive mayoral campaign. Agnos' view of homelessness was that it was the result of structural inequalities and could only be resolved by intervention from state welfare programs.Parson, Sean Michael. ‚ÄúAn Ungovernable Force? Food Not Bombs, Homeless Activism and Politics in San Francisco, 1988--1995.‚Äù University of Oregon, Sept. 2010, hdl.handle.net/1794/11179. Under his direction, two multi-service buildings that provided mental health counseling and substance abuse support in addition to housing were opened to benefit the homeless community.Ward, Brant, et al. ‚ÄúHomelessness Looks the Same as It Did 20 Years Ago.‚Äù San Francisco Chronicle, projects.sfchronicle.com/sf- homeless/overview/.  Camp Agnos  Despite Agnos' official support for the homeless, his administration was not without some controversy. A group of young anarcho-activists, Food Not Bombs, began to distribute free vegetarian meals to homeless people in parks around the Haight, which was opposed by a group representing developers and business interests. Tensions between activists, who argued they were just providing aid to the residents the city didn't support, and the city eventually escalated in the city arresting activists and confiscating their supplies. Clashes between the city and activists continued off and on over the course of the following year, until confrontations over the usage of Civic Center Plaza escalated to the occupation of the park by a mix of activists and members from the homeless community estimated to number between 300 and 350 in all and eventually became known as \\"Camp Agnos\\". Complaints from the protesters included the city's inaction to address the growing homelessness, lack of affordable housing options, and the ineffectiveness of existing shelters. One homeless protester said of the services provided, \\"A shelter is like being in prison. There's no freedom of movement\\" and complained of the inability of being able to use shelters with her husband, opting instead to sleep on the streets so they could be together. Under pressure from the Board of Supervisors and the negative publicity, Agnos ordered police to ticket and arrest those who remained in Camp Agnos. = Jordan crackdown (1992-1996) = Former police chief Frank Jordan won the 1992 mayoral race on a platform of bringing public order back to the city and promised to return public space back to its residents from the homeless and youth activists. Jordan sought to crack down on the disorderly and troublesome activists who he thought were dealt with too leniently by the former administration. Jordan's four years saw 700 arrests and citations given to the Food Not Bombs activists, prompting Amnesty International to respond: > \\"Amnesty International is concerned that the Food Not Bombs activists may > have been targeted on account of their beliefs and effectively prohibited > from exercising their right to freedom of expression, assembly, and the > right to impart information. If this were found to be the case, the City of > San Francisco would be in breach of international law and Amnesty > International would adopt those imprisoned as \\"Prisoners of Conscience\\" and > work for their unconditional release.\\"Amnesty International. ‚ÄúAmnesty > International Seeks Further Information on ‚ÄòFood Not Bombs‚Äô Activists > Arrested in San Francisco, USA.‚Äù 28 October 1994, > www.foodnotbombs.net/amnesty_letter.html.  Matrix program  Jordan's homeless policy extended beyond confronting Food Not Bombs members and their homeless allies. Jordan introduced the Matrix Program, which expanded the role police had in tackling homelessness by increasing the number of citations given to homeless people for city misdemeanors, with 6,000 citations issued in the first six months of the program's initiation. Matrix teams of city police usually accompanied with social service workers to systematically sweep the city block by block to engage members of the homeless community and dismantle homeless encampments. The initial reception from city residents was mostly positive with 75% of calls to the Mayor's office praising the crackdown as a needed step to clean the city up.Heather MacDonald, San Francisco's Matrix Program for the Homeless, 14 Crim. Just. Ethics 2 (1995) Critics of Matrix accused the program of using resources on punitive enforcement of quality of life laws that generally only affect the homeless community, like sleeping in public and loitering, instead of promoting services to aid the homeless. Mass citations to the homeless, critics argued, was counter-productive since those in extreme poverty lacked the funds to pay the fines. Judges would respond to unpaid fines by issuing arrest warrants, resulting in the incarceration of homeless people when the same resources used to jail the inmates could instead go towards expanding shelter services.McIntyre, Jennifer, and Alissa Rikker. FROM BEYOND SHELTER TO BEHIND BARS. 1993 www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/from_beyond_shelter_to_behind_bars.pdf. Additional critiques lobbied at the program centered around the use of police as social service workers. Matrix police were authorized to give psychological field tests to determine if a homeless person was acting erratically and were the deciding force on whether or not to bring them to the hospital for mental services.Gowan, Teresa. Hobos, Hustlers, and Backsliders : Homeless in San Francisco, University of Minnesota Press, 2010. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/berkeley- ebooks/detail.action?docID=557532. In 1994, homeless rights advocates succeeded in convincing the board of supervisors to pass a resolution opposing the Matrix Program, with Jordan's response being to double down by expanding the program's sweeps to Golden Gate Park. Though the Matrix program persisted, public opinion shifted against it for being too harsh and Jordan failed to secure a second term. = Willie Brown (1996-2004) = Willie Brown, San Francisco's first African-American mayor, won a run-off against Frank Jordan with a campaign promise to end the Matrix Program. Upon assuming office, Brown suspended the Matrix Program and ordered a judge to revoke all citations and warrants stemming from the program.Maya Nordberg, Jails Not Homes: Quality of Life on the Street of San Francisco, 13 Hastings Women's L.J. 261 (2002) Despite this action to end Matrix, citations issued to the homeless community for quality of life violations, a highly criticized aspect of Matrix, increased. The last year of Matrix saw 11,000 of these kind of citations, which rose to 16,000 in Brown's first year and soared to 23,000 by 1999. The militarized clearance of the homeless encampments within Golden Gate Park, which had an estimated population of 1,000 throughout the park and featured the deployment of police helicopters equipped with infra-red cameras, demonstrated Brown's commitment to his promise: \\"You tell me where the camp is, and in 24 hours it won't be there\\".Claiborne, William. ‚ÄúSAN FRANCISCO'S HOMELESS EXPECTED COMPASSION, BUT GOT A CRACKDOWN.‚Äù The Washington Post, WP Company, 28 Nov. 1997, www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/11/28/san- franciscos-homeless-expected-compassion-but-got-a- crackdown/0111d2fc-a70b-4fb7-9029-67ca2cbfb485/ These citations were less publicized than Jordan's Matrix program and considered to be routine policing instead of any homeless oriented policy, allowing Brown to avoid some of the negative publicity that plagued his predecessor. Not all of Brown's positions were detrimental to the homeless community as he successfully mobilized support to secure a $100 million government bond to expand affordable housing and his support for universal healthcare was a central tenet to his platform, though its implementation was never manifested.Davis, John. Perspectives in Black Politics and Black Leadership. University Press of America, 2007. Riding a robust economy and operating under a patronage system that benefited his allies and restricted political opponents, Brown was able to secure a second term despite policies that alienated his liberal base, including his harsher than expected treatment of the city's homeless.Mullin, Megan, et al. ‚ÄúCity Caesars?‚Äù Urban Affairs Review, vol. 40, no. 1, 2004, pp. 19‚Äì43.SAGE Journals, doi:10.1177/1078087404265391. = Gavin Newsom (2004-2010) = Gavin Newsom, a previous member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, succeeded Brown after running as a Democratic centrist to become San Francisco's youngest mayor in the past century.\\"About the Mayor\\". The City and County of San Francisco. Archived from the original on 2007-11-23. Given the ineffective steps taken to address homelessness over the past two decades, Newsom sought to implement wholesale change on how the city interacted with its homeless community as he thought programs needed more resources and oversight. With Newsom's support, the city passed two measures, propositions M and N, to change homeless policy. Proposition M expanded quality of life laws to include the prohibition of \\"aggressive\\" panhandling and panhandling near ATMs, parking lots, or buses. Though this was another quality of life law and included citations, priorities were made to funnel offenders to substance-abuse or mental health treatment as much as possible.  Care Not Cash (Prop N)  A cornerstone of Newsom's homeless legislation was actually passed with his support while he was still on the Board of Supervisors in 2002. Proposition N, better known as Care Not Cash, was passed by the city with 60% approval with the goal to overhaul the city's welfare system by cutting General Assistance payments to eligible adults from $395 a month (one of the highest rates in California) to $57 a month and to use the savings to expand care services for the city's homeless residents. Newsom claimed that using resources for services would prove to be more effective at supporting homeless residents instead of handouts, arguing that cash handouts encouraged homeless people to flock to the city from neighboring counties, along with increased usage of emergency medical services and crime rates on the weekends the cash was dispersed.Newsom, Gavin Christopher, and Lisa Dickey.

His claim that handouts cause crime rates to spike and increased hospitalization has been disputed by some academic studies conducted in San Francisco, which have found an inverse relationship between recipients of monetary subsidies and risky behaviors such as substance usage.Riley, E. D. ‚ÄúCash Benefits Are Associated with Lower Risk Behavior Among the Homeless and Marginally Housed in San Franciscos.‚Äù Journal of Urban Health, vol. 82, no. 1, 2005, pp. 142‚Äì150., doi:10.1093/jurban/jti015. Care Not Cash resulted in approximately 1,200 homeless people finding shelter via the usage of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units in hotels throughout the city, however those that did not receive housing found life on the streets even more difficult due to the sharp funding cuts. Critics of the program accuse it of having exclusive standards to participate in, thereby excluding large segments of the homeless population, as well as using substandard SRO housing units, which often lack private bathrooms and food prep areas, as permanent housing.Murphy, Stacey. ‚Äú‚ÄòCompassionate‚Äô Strategies of Managing Homelessness: Post-Revanchist Geographies in San Francisco.‚Äù Antipode, vol. 41, no. 2, 2009, pp. 305‚Äì325., doi:10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00674.x.  Other programs  Other measures introduced included Homeward Bound and Operation Outreach, as well as the introduction of new sit-lie ordinances. Homeward Bound was a program to pay for bus tickets to send homeless people out of the city so long as they could prove they had a place to be received at their destination. This was met with resistance from critics like the Coalition for Homelessness who accused the program of not solving anything and was just dumping the problem off to other counties.Gonzales, Richard. ‚ÄúS.F. Paying to Send the Homeless Back Home.‚Äù NPR, NPR, 17 February 2006, www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5221311. Mayor Newsom argued that \\"the vast majority of people that are out on the sidewalks are not from San Francisco originally\\" and would be better served by being returned to supportive family members, although by 2007 San Francisco's homeless census found that only 31% percent of the homeless population became homeless outside of San Francisco.Abbott, Kerry, and Shelagh Little. San Francisco 2007 Homeless Count . San Francisco Human Services Agency , Mar. 2007, hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2007-SF-PIT-Report.pdf. Operation Outreach was instituted in 2004 and, echoing some of the philosophies behind the Matrix program of the Jordan era, utilized police officers to enforce quality of life laws.Huey, Laura. \\"Homelessness and the ‚ÄòExclusive Society‚ÄôThesis: Why It Is Important to ‚ÄòThink Local‚Äôto ‚ÄòAct Local‚Äôon Homelessness Issues.\\" European Journal of Homelessness _ Volume (2009). This program differed from the Matrix program in that it involved a diverse number of agencies with the purpose of connecting the homeless community with services as the primary goal, with the quality of life citations a secondary result. The effectiveness of the outreach aspect of the program is disputable, as the Coalition found that only 24 of 204 people surveyed received a referral to a program or service in their last encounter with the police.Herring, Chris, and Dilara Yarbrough. \\"Punishing the Poorest: How San Francisco‚Äôs Criminalization of Homelessness Perpetuates Poverty.\\" UC Berkeley Human Rights Center and the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness (2015). In his last year, Newsom expanded the quality of life laws within the city by successfully passing Proposition L in a public vote, which banned city residents from sitting or lying on sidewalks between the hours of 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.Collins, Terry, and Associated Press. SF Voters Approve Sit/Lie Ban on Sidewalks. Fox News, 4 November 2010, web.archive.org/web/20101105170951/www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2010%2F11%2F03%2Fstate%2Fn120338D96.DTL. Causes of homelessness Mass homelessness has several contributing factors, including: \\"Economic Dislocation\\", \\"Reduced Social Safety Nets\\", \\"Failed Housing Policy\\", \\"Mass Incarceration\\", \\"Family Instability\\", and other \\"Individual Causes\\" including mental health and physical wellness. Reasons cited for homelessness in the 2015 survey commissioned by the City of San Francisco include job loss (25%), alcohol/drug use (18%), eviction (13%), argument/asked to leave by friend/family (12%), and divorce/separation (11%). Reasons for coming from outside San Francisco at the time of homelessness include seeking a job (25%), LGBTQ acceptance (11%), to access homeless services (22%), was visiting and decided to stay (17%), accessing VA services or clinic (5%), and family/friends are here (13%). = Great Depression = In the 1930s the Great Depression caused a widespread poverty, hunger, and homelessness, particularly in industry-dependent cities, such as San Francisco. Two million homeless people migrated across the United States in search of jobs and housing, especially into the west coast. The number of people without homes grew in the 1980s in San Francisco, as wages stagnated and funding for welfare reform was cut, eliminating the social safety net. = Housing crisis = Since the 1960s, San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area have enacted strict zoning regulations.Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space Vol 31, Issue 7, pp. 1259 - 1278 Among other restrictions, San Francisco does not allow buildings over 40 feet tall in most of the city, and has passed laws making it easier for neighbors to block developments. Partly as a result of these codes, from 2007 to 2014, the Bay Area issued building permits for only half the number of needed houses, based on the area's population growth. In September 2019, the Council of Economic Advisers released a report in which they stated that deregulation of the housing markets would reduce homelessness in some of the most constrained markets by estimates of 54% in San Francisco, 40% in Los Angeles, and 38% in San Diego, because rents would fall by 55%, 41%, and 39% respectively. In 2002, the San Francisco Planning Department launched the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Planning Process to resolve recognized land use conflicts in several SF neighborhoods. Many stakeholders in these neighborhoods oversaw the planning process, which was focused on the rezoning of historically industrial lands for new residential uses, but was unresponsive to neighborhood concerns of unaffordable housing, residential and job displacement, gentrification, public safety, and inadequate open space.Kusmer, Kenneth L. Down and out, on the Road: the Homeless in American History. Oxford University Press, 2003. Only those who could afford these limited new housing units were able to access housing, causing socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnic minority groups to either seek housing in under resourced neighborhoods of San Francisco such as the Tenderloin or lose housing completely, leading to poor health outcomes for marginalized populations. Adopted in 2008, the plan banned housing development in large areas to preserve land for light industrial uses. Since it was adopted, both homelessness and the housing crisis have worsened. = Gentrification and displacement = Gentrification in the San Francisco Bay Area is of increasing concern, a research and action initiative of UC Berkeley in collaboration with researchers at UCLA and Portland State University has produced The Urban Displacement Project to \\"[examine] the relationships between investment, neighborhood change, gentrification and displacement.\\" This study indicates rising levels of segregation in relation to increasing income inequality in the SF Bay Area. A mapping tool has been also been developed through the project to track displacement and gentrification in the San Francisco Bay Area (http://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf). With the emergence of a \\"new\\" Oakland, the African American population has decreased significantly from 2000 to 2010. During this period, there has been a push to kick out the homeless from government-funded housing which has further caused many landlords to halt renting to Section 8 tenants. According to a report done in 2015, 41% of homeless people who were surveyed in Oakland became homeless after age 50 which is likely due to rising housing prices and loss of safety nets. The ongoing gentrification in the SF Bay area is deepening structural divisions. The rapid economic growth of the tech industry in San Francisco and nearby Silicon Valley has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs.Bhatia, Rajiv. ‚ÄúProtecting Health Using an Environmental Impact Assessment: A Case Study of San Francisco Land use Decisionmaking.‚Äù American Journal of Public Health, vol. 97, no. 3, 2007, pp. 406-413., doi: 10.2105/ajph.2005.073817. The resultant high demand for housing, combined with the lack of supply, (caused by severe restrictions on the building of new housing units) have caused dramatic increases in rents and extremely high housing prices, adding to the already developing housing crisis. For example, from 2012 to 2017, the San Francisco metropolitan area added 400,000 new jobs, but only 60,000 new housing units. Even though real income rates in the Bay Area have been increasing over time, it was published in 2011 by the American Journal of Economics and Sociology that low-income residents are left with less leftover income after their rental payments that the equivalent in the 1960s. Additionally, gentrification affects the health outcomes of individuals and families being displaced. Melody Tulier's research identifies that as rates of gentrification in Alameda County grew between 2005-2013, low-tract census populations had an increase in incidents of preventable mortality, specifically due to suicide, homicide, diabetes, HIV and nutritional deficiencies. By the end of 2000, gentrification in San Francisco grew to the center of political and organizing activity. Anti-displacement advocates received success in gaining representation on SF's Planning Department and in advancing new regulations (e.g., inclusionary zoning) to protect and create affordable housing, which led to a shift from citywide to district legislative elections to address neighborhood concerns at the city level.Arnold, Crowley, Bravve, Brundage, Biddlecombe, Althea, Sheila, Elina Bravve, Sarah,Christine (2014). \\"OUT OF REACH 2014 Twenty-Five Years Later, The Affordable Housing Crisis Continues. On January 18, 2016, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, in response to issues of gentrification the Black Seed Collective coordinated a Black Lives Matter movement protest blocking all westbound traffic on the Bay Bridge that connects Oakland and San Francisco. During this protest they demanded for \\"the immediate divestment of city funds for policing and investment in sustainable, affordable housing so Black, Brown and Indigenous people can remain in their hometowns of Oakland and San Francisco.\\" = Exclusionary zoning policies = In the 1960s, San Francisco and surrounding Bay Area cities enacted strict zoning regulations. Zoning is the legal restriction of parts of a city to particular uses, such as residential, industrial, or commercial. In San Francisco, it also includes limitations on building height, density, shape, and banning the demolition of old buildings. Zoning was originally executed as a public health prevention policy to ensure industrial emissions are separated from residential areas, but has since been manipulated by homeowners to artificially drive up the price of housing. https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/zoning-laws-and-the-rise- of-economic-inequality/417360/ The housing crisis is both a regional and local problem. Gentrification and exclusion are intimately related at a neighborhood level. If a high-demand, high-cost neighborhood won't build, developers and people looking for housing will be diverted to the nearest low-cost neighborhoods.John Mangin, The New Exclusionary Zoning, vol 25 Stanford Law & Policy Review 91 (2014). That increases demand and development and leads to gentrification. Since the residents of high-cost, high-demand neighborhoods tend to have mobility, money, and access to information and power, they are hugely successful in leveraging land-use policies to exclude newcomers. Exclusionary zoning policies in San Francisco in city planning have caused a divide in affordability and accessibility for housing. The anti-development orientation of certain cities is turning them into preserves for the wealthy as housing costs increase beyond what lower-income families can afford to pay, which displaces communities and residents of low-income areas, leading to rising rates of homelessness. = Redlining policies = Additionally, until 1968, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) enforced an explicit redlining policy of racial discrimination in mortgage lending. Under redlining, racial minority groups were refused loans for mortgages. The policy incentivized homeowners to restrict the sale of houses to white families only, creating all-white neighborhoods.Katherine C. Devers & J. G. West, Exclusionary Zoning and Its Effect on Housing Opportunities for the Homeless, 4 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol'y 349 (2014). Although prohibited by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the practice of neighborhood delineation based on race and class had a lasting impact, depriving certain neighborhoods of essential resources such as housing, schools, clinics, and grocery stores. The zoning policies created divisions within SF districts, widening the income inequality gap and polarizing resource accessibility and socioeconomic demographics, seen especially in the Tenderloin District, which currently experiences the highest rates of homelessness. Prevalence and visibility by city In what is commonly referred to as a variation on Greyhound therapy, many cities in the United States, including the city of San Francisco, buy homeless persons free one-way bus tickets to reduce the visibility of homeless populations within the city. This has been occurring over the last three decades. From 2010 to 2017, an estimated \\"20,000 homeless people have been sent to and from within the mainland US\\". There have been numerous reports and lawsuits between cities regarding homeless and patient dumping especially in cases where the person's destination either A) has fewer homeless support and homeless-exiting programs than San Francisco and/or B) where the destination city has staff at the inbound bus terminal issuing similar one-way tickets back out to San Francisco or any other city in the U.S. The homeless are also a visual reminder for the Bay Area of the increasing struggles of the homeless with impoverishment due to the high cost of living as they particularly occupy common public spaces frequented by the middle and upper classes. =San Francisco= As of 2019, the city was believed to have approximately 8,035 homeless residents, 5,180 of whom are unsheltered. As of 2015, approximately 71% of the city's homeless had housing in the city before becoming homeless, while the remaining 29% came from outside of San Francisco. This figure is up from 61% in 2013. Of that 71%, 51% had lived in San Francisco for less than 10 years before becoming homeless; 11% had only lived in San Francisco for a year before becoming homeless. By 2016, according to a report by urban planning and research organization SPUR, San Francisco had the third highest per capita homelessness rate (0.8%) of all large US cities, as well as the third highest percentage of unsheltered homeless (55%). (\\"Unsheltered\\" means sleeping somewhere not designated as a permanent living location, and includes tents, automobiles, and RV's, but does not include people staying in designated homeless shelters.) SPUR says in one of their publications: > \\"For anyone who believes, based on their own eyes, that San Francisco has > the worst problem with homelessness in the country, this statistic ‚Äî the > number of unsheltered homeless people per capita ‚Äî is the ‚Äúsmoking gun.‚Äù > East Coast cities have adopted a very different set of strategies, > emphasizing shelters as a low-cost, temporary solution and in many cases > forcing people to go into those shelters, as opposed to allowing them to > choose to sleep in public spaces. Indeed, New York State has a ‚Äúright to > shelter‚Äù law that compels the city and state to provide shelter beds to all > New Yorkers who are homeless by ‚Äúreason of physical, mental, or social > dysfunction.‚Äù While some critics decry the New York approach as > ‚Äúwarehousing‚Äù homeless people, it‚Äôs clear that they have been vastly more > successful than large California cities in getting people at least minimal > shelter and in addressing the quality of life impacts on city residents. By > making ‚Äúreal housing‚Äù with wraparound social services the only acceptable > solution, without having enough money to actually scale up that solution, > Bay Area cities, especially San Francisco, have created the conditions in > which thousands of people are living on the streets.\\" In 2018, San Francisco's homeless camps drew scrutiny from a UN special rapporteur, Leilani Farha, who visited different camps and spoke to residents. Farha compared the conditions she witnessed to those of Mumbai, stating: \\"...I'm sorry, California is a rich state, by any measures, the United States is a rich country, and to see these deplorable conditions that the government is allowing, by international human rights standards, it's unacceptable. I'm guided by human rights law.\\" She also decried the city for conducting \\"tent sweeps\\" whereby encampments are cleared: \\"It's damaging because they always have to move.They're treated like nonentities. Sometimes they say [belongings are] put in storage, but more often they'll dump everyone's possessions into one dumpster. It's horrible. It's not dignified. The people have nowhere to go. It's illogical. It's tragic.\\" =Richmond= As of 2017, the Richmond Police Department (RPD) have noted at least 76 encampments and about 800 people living homeless. About 50% of homeless residents lost their Richmond homes and ended up on the streets. According to the City of Richmond's memo on Homelessness Policies and Initiatives, ‚ÄúRichmond is already Contra Costa County‚Äôs predominant location for homeless shelter beds.‚Äù With a population of about 110,000 people, about 9.7% of the total population of the Contra Costa County, Richmond is a 55.4% contributor to Contra Costa County homeless shelter beds. Homeless people from across the Bay Area are sent to Richmond shelters, making it hard for the City of Richmond to deal with the city's own homeless population. = Berkeley = People's Park is currently home to many community members of Berkeley's large homeless population and has remained a safe place of refuge for them due to a long history of students advocacy, free speech riots, and protests against the University of California, Berkeley in the iconic university owned public park. = Oakland = In 2016, the Oakland City Council declared a shelter crisis. Although, no action was taken beyond this declaration to address the problem. Programs such as Keep Oakland Housed help the homeless by providing current tenants with case managers that help them apply to programs that would benefit them financially. These programs include lowering phone bill costs and providing mental health counseling. Restoration of Lake Merritt, a significant landmark in Oakland has affected the lives of many who are homeless and live there. Though politicians thought that the renovation of Oakland by restoring Lake Merritt would help the city, creating more space for homes, 80% of existing Oakland households were unable to afford the prices of these new luxury buildings. The effect was a clear strengthening of gentrification of that area. = San Jose = San Jose's largest homeless encampment was known as The Jungle; when it was dismantled in 2014, it was thought to be the largest encampment in the United States, covering near Coyote Creek with up to 175 residents. The city was home to an estimated 4,000 homeless in 2016; of those, approximately 500 were thought to be living out of their cars, while many others were believed to seek shelter along trails and creeks. = Santa Rosa = In 2019, the Joe Rodota Trail in Santa Rosa had the large homeless encampment in the history of Sonoma County, but was dispersed in January 2020, with some of its inhabitants relocating to other areas of Sonoma County.  The impact of homelessness on physical and social wellbeing  Homeless populations are especially susceptible to physical and mental ill-health due to their lack of shelter and social safety nets. Not only are homeless populations more exposed to infectious diseases, injuries, and psychosocial pressures that lead to mental health issues, but they also rarely receive adequate care from the San Francisco area healthcare system. Mcclendon, Jennifer; Lane, Shannon (2014). \\"Handbook of Social Work Practice with Vulnerable and Resilient Populations\\". Homeless People. Columbia University Press: 345‚Äì365. JSTOR 10.7312/gitt16362. As victims of social and structural disenfranchisement, many displaced individuals resort to drug use and drug-related social communities as coping strategies. Homelessness in San Francisco is correlated with increased rates of substance abuse‚Äîmethamphetamine, black-tar heroin, and crack cocaine were the most common illegal drugs found on San Francisco streets in 2018. A cycle of poverty and drug abuse contributes to the growth of the homeless population, and many homeless feel that they cannot escape. Bourgois, P. I., & Schonberg, J. (2009). Righteous Dopefiend. Berkeley: University of California Press. = Healthcare = Persons with prior physical or mental health issues are more likely to become homeless. Homelessness in turn worsens the homeless' mental health and decreases their access to therapy.People, Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Health Care for Homeless (1988). Health Problems of Homeless People. National Academies Press (US). \\"Individuals and families who have lost a safe place of residence are vulnerable to physical threats such as exposure and violence, and the psychosocial threats related to high stress associated with mental health problems and substance abuse.\\" Homelessness has additional negative consequences within the Bay Area such as risky sex, urination and defecation in public areas and on the streets, use of emergency room visits as a way to get housed, and health problems. Stigma impacts the fates of the homeless by making them to be an \\"other\\" which in turn strengthens power dynamics. Structural forces are then obscured by the stigma. Many shelters have tried to address mental health issues; however, due to limited trained staff, they can do very little to treat mentally ill homeless people. Furthermore, many homeless and mentally ill people are resistant to intervention from clinicians, due to previous bad encounters. Approximately 20% of the patients who end up in Bay Area emergency rooms are homeless or have been housing insecure in the previous two months, and 13.8% were living in homeless shelters or on the streets. In the past 12 months, 15.5% of them had spent a night in a shelter, 30.5% had previously been homeless, 25.4% were at risk of becoming homeless in the next two months, and 9.1% had been evicted in the past year. Homeless people are prone to a much higher rate of visiting the emergency department due to mental health issues. Reported obstacles in treating mental health like supportive housing has impacted the healthcare cost and usage.  Drug use  San Francisco's homeless youth experience high rates of psychiatric disorders and substance use and have been known to use the following substances: cannabis, cocaine, narcotics (heroin and methadone) and stimulants (methamphetamine and amphetamine).Quimby, Ernika G.; Edidin, Jennifer P.; Ganim, Zoe; Gustafson, Erika; Hunter, Scott J.; Karnik, Niranjan S. (2012-08-30). \\"Psychiatric Disorders and Substance Use in Homeless Youth: A Preliminary Comparison of San Francisco and Chicago\\". Behavioral Sciences. 2 (3): 186‚Äì194. doi:10.3390/bs2030186. ISSN 2076-328X. PMC 4217629\\\\. PMID 25379220. Homelessness has been associated as a predictor of the use of heroin and recent nonfatal overdose among street-recruited injection heroin users in the San Francisco Bay Area, calling for more targeted interventions to decrease this risk association. San Francisco streets are littered with drug syringes, trash, and feces, resulting in a level of contamination \\"...much greater than communities in Brazil or Kenya or India\\". The city spends approximately 30 million dollars per year on the removal of feces and contaminated needles. Of the 400,000 needles distributed monthly, San Francisco receives around 246,000 back ‚Äî meaning that there are roughly 150,000 discarded needles unaccounted for each month - or nearly 2 million per year. After a visit to San Francisco's homeless camps in January 2018, United Nations special rapporteur Leilani Farha stated that the belief that drug abuse was a root cause of homelessness was not generally true, that the reverse in fact is more prevalent, whereby \\"Most people on the streets are living with some sort of 'structural trauma,' meaning they have lost their job, can't afford housing, been evicted by a landlord. The structural trauma causes deeply personal effects that can lead to living on the street that triggers drug use.\\" Structural forces are then obscured by the stigma of homelessness. Stigma impacts the fates of the homeless by making them to be an \\"other\\" which in turn strengthens power dynamics. Current efforts to address the issue by region The creative communication strategies and practices of the Coalition on Homelessness, Poor News Network, and Media Alliance have both empowered voices from impoverished San Francisco Bay Area communities, and also enabled the development of \\"counter-public spheres\\" that work in tangent with mainstream media outlets. Former state assemblyman Mike Gatto, in a 2018 opinion piece, proposed that a new form of detention be created as a method to force drug addicted and mentally ill homeless people (who make up two-thirds of California's homeless population) off the streets and into treatment. =California (overview)= California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC) Ongoing efforts include the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC). Established in 1988 as a private nonprofit organization, it aims to sustain access to affordable housing through project partnerships with other non-profits and government housing agencies, in addition to being a resource for affordable housing policy efforts. CHPC has been successful in preserving more than 60,000 homes through over $12 billion in private and public partnerships.  We Count California!  \\"We Count California!\\" is a collaborative effort between the California Homeless Youth Project and the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health to combat the issue of homeless youth being undercounted during the annual point-in-time homeless counts which are crucial for federal funding of homeless support programs. They hope to achieve more accurate counts by providing trainings and statewide technical assistance activities to support California communities toward improved youth inclusion. =San Francisco= Legislative efforts In 2014, the City of San Francisco spent $167 million annually on housing homeless residents.Matier, Phillip (April 21, 2014). \\"S.F. spending on homeless exceeds many departments' budgets\\". SFGate. Retrieved June 5, 2014. By 2016, total spending (including housing and treatment) was believed to be $241 million annually.Heather, Knight (2016-04-01). \\"What San Franciscans know about homeless isn't necessarily true\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved 2016-04-12. However, much of this spending is focused on housing the formerly homeless, or those at risk, and not the currently homeless. The city's shelter program has approximately 1,200 beds, and several hundred people are on a waitlist to be housed. Even with 1,200 shelter beds and several hundred on waiting list, most homeless avoid the shelter for various reasons such as: overcrowding, safety, and rules that, among other things, separate people experiencing homelessness from their possessions, pets, and loved ones. In 2015, the Navigation Center shelter was created to address these issues. There have been increasing efforts to keep the homeless away from the public eye, through forced removal, or harassment sweeps. These efforts have come to be known as the \\"war on the homeless\\". The Homeless Coalition has been an active body in the fight for homeless rights and decriminalization of the homeless. The \\"Right to Rest Act of the Homeless Bill of Rights Campaign\\" has been a large effort to allow the homeless to sit, rest and sleep on sidewalks and in public. This effort is seen as essential especially when there is a significant shortage in affordable housing. San Francisco's policies towards homeless people have been criticized by homeless rights advocates and was listed as the eleventh least desirable city in the US to be homeless. There are 23 city infractions that are known as ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù crimes because they criminalize actions that would be legal on private property, thereby disproportionately affecting homeless people.Fisher, Marina, et al. California‚Äôs New Vagrancy Laws: The Growing Enactment and Enforcement of Anti- Homeless Laws in the Golden State. Policy Advocacy Clinic Berkeley Law, 2015, California‚Äôs New Vagrancy Laws: The Growing Enactment and Enforcement of Anti- Homeless Laws in the Golden State, poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=126024068112006089067118077121099098039053020046074058007068113088084113006090004108037124118022010007121002112116107064097069012058074010000086113095126020096100048044017119085108110065104073126000003022110097118027098067116106006098002100083113125&EXT;=pdf. Examples include the prohibition of sleeping in public, overnight parking restrictions, and anti-loitering ordinances. The city enforces these laws by issuing an average of over 3,000 citations a year. The price of enforcing quality of life crimes for San Francisco was $20.6 million in 2015.City and County of San Francisco, Budget and Legislative Analysis. Policy Analysis Report, 1 June 2016. sfbos.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/56045-Budget%20and%20Legislative%20Analyst%20Report.Homelessness%20and%20Cost%20of%20Quality%20of%20Life%20Laws.Final.pdf These citations typically involve fines that can be difficult for impoverished homeless residents to pay, leading to only 7% of fines paid in 2000. Unpaid fines can often result in arrests and criminal records, which makes it more difficult to gain employment and encourages avoidance of future contact with social services due to fear of punishment.Forbes, Elaine Legislative Analyst Report - San Francisco's 'Quality of Life' Laws and Seattle's 'Civility' Laws City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors January 11, 2002 File No. 011704 Quality of life crimes have become so prevalent that the San Francisco Police Department launched Operation Outreach to specialize in homeless related crime. The program's intended purpose is to collaborate with other city agencies like the Department of Public Health and the Department of Public Works connect members of the homeless community with social services and resources. = California SB 1045 = In September 2018, California SB 1045 was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. This bill will take effect on January 1, 2019 and would initiate a five-year pilot program ending on January 1, 2024. The goal of this legislation, as authored by State Senator Scott Wiener, is to improve the health of people suffering from substance abuse disorders or severe mental illness and has the potential to directly impact the homeless population of San Francisco. Under a pilot program of SB 1045, the bill would permit the board of supervisors of the County of Los Angeles, the County of San Diego and the City and County of San Francisco to appoint a conservator for an individual who is incapable of caring or making decisions for themselves through the order of a probate court. These provinces are also required to provide the following services and resources, which include, but are not limited to adequate community housing, outpatient mental health counseling, psychiatric assistance, access to medications and substance use disorder services. People who have had eight or more 5150 holds within a year would be considered for conservatorship. San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced that she plans to add 70 to 90 new beds for these prospective patients at the city's navigation centers and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital before November 2019. With the support of Senator Weiner and Mayor Breed, San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman introduced a bill in October 2018 that outlined the conservatorship criteria for the city. The bill mimics Wiener's legislation as it identifies those who are homeless and frequently utilize emergency services due to severe mental illness or substance-abuse disorder as likely candidates for intervention. It is estimated that SB 1045 along with local legislation would impact between 50 and 100 people in San Francisco. Local homeless organizations and health centers have prompted concerns over criminalizing homelessness and the mentally ill as the legislation only targets those without homes. Other oppositions have noted that the bill is too narrow and only covers a small subset of the population that suffers from substance abuse or mental disorder. Additional critics, including the Coalition on Homelessness, argue that the bill violates a person's civil liberties and his/her freedom to control and make medical decisions about his/her own body. = Proposition C = Proposition C would collect up to $300 million per year to fund services for the city's homeless through taxes on San Francisco's biggest businesses. In November 2018, Proposition C was approved by 61% of San Francisco's voters; however, this proposition has been put on hold while the state debates whether a simple-majority is enough to pass the proposition or whether a two-thirds supermajority should be required. Navigation center The Navigation Center started as a pilot intervention program and is a collaboration between the City of San Francisco and the San Francisco Interfaith Council. It is funded by a $3 million anonymous donation and is based on the belief that people experiencing homelessness would be more receptive to utilizing shelters if they were \\"allowed to stay with their possessions, partners, and pets.‚Äù The first Navigation Center opened in 2015 at a former school building in the Mission District. Unlike other shelters, the Navigation Center allows clients to come and go as they please and tries to get them permanent housing within ten days. Navigation Center provides otherwise unsheltered residents of San Francisco with room and board while case managers work to connect them to income, public benefits, health services, shelter, and housing. Navigation Center is different from traditional housing units in that it has few barriers to entry and intensive case management. There are 4 Navigation Centers so far in San Francisco. As of January 2017, they have provided shelter for 1,150 highly vulnerable people, and 72% of these guests have exited to housing. Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing determines access to Navigation Centers on a case-by-case basis. The most important goal of Navigation Centers, according to the stakeholders, is to have its guests rapid exits to housing.http://ecs- sf.org/_documents/Perspectives_NavCenter_Report4.pdf Due to the success of this program, The Board of Supervisors have voted for The City to negotiate a lease with Caltrans to open two Navigation Centers on state property. In March 2019 San Francisco mayor, London Breed, proposed a navigation center to be built in San Francisco's Embarcadero. Breed's proposal was supported by tech giants Marc Benioff, Jack Dorsey, while local residents opposed to the idea which engulfed them into a 2 month long heated debate. Both pro and opposition groups started GoFundMe campaigns, SAFE Embarcadero for ALL (opp) and SAFER Embarcadero for ALL (pro), to serve their purpose; both raised more than $275,000 combined.https://start.att.net/news/read/category/news/article/newser- theres_a_wild_battle_happening_on_gofundme_right_n-rnewsernor, The San Francisco Port Commission approved the 200 bed Navigation center proposed by Breed making it the largest in the city. Local residents refused the action with promises to take the matter to court using the money they've raised through GoFundMe to cover attorney fees. Social innovation There has been an increasing need for solutions to social issues such as homelessness since the 1990s, these solutions are not anymore solely based in government reliance or the economic market, rather through volunteerism and charity. Unfortunately, there are many limiting factors of these efforts. Social innovation clusters, or SI clusters as they are called have emerged as an alternative framework for creating solutions through social innovation. SI clusters are a result of socially-oriented organizations working in close proximity with like-minded companies, which has developed more ideas for social entrepreneurship and venture philanthropy. While these ideas have developed well, the social issues like homelessness in the Bay Area are still prevalent. =Richmond= Legislative efforts In 2017, the Richmond City Council voted unanimously to establish a Richmond city homeless task force. This task force attempts to address the rising homeless crisis in Richmond, and develop methods to disrupt the cycle of homelessness. As of now there is a list of common themes that the task force wants to work towards addressing, including: Need for more accurate data, community education and engagement, more emergency housing services, long-term housing solutions, mental and behavioral health, and self-sufficiency pathways. The City of Richmond has legislation in place to allow homeless to sleep in public without worry of citation when shelters are overcrowded. Additionally, the City of Richmond has also engaged UC Berkeley students involved in the THIMBY (Tiny House In My Backyard) project with a pilot program for developing a model for six transitional tiny homes to be placed in Richmond. This is in-line with developing efforts in the SF Bay Area to use micro-apartments and tiny houses‚Äîthe Tiny House Movement‚Äîin combating the housing crisis.  Anti- homeless ordinances  = San Francisco = San Francisco's sit-lie law, Section 168 of San Francisco's Police Code, aims to criminalize homelessness by making it \\"unlawful to sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk\\" \\"during the hours seven (7:00) a.m. and eleven (11:00) p.m.\\" Without many places to go during the day, homeless people are often subjected to law enforcement and sometimes even receiving multiple violations in the same day. Violations result in a fine between $50 to $100 or must be petitioned in court which presents even larger barriers to the homeless. = Berkeley = On December 1, 2015, an ordinance was passed that \\"prohibits people lying in planter beds, tying possessions to poles or trees or keeping them within two feet of a tree- well or planter, taking up more than two square feet of space with belongings, and keeping a shopping cart in one place for more than an hour during the day. It also further penalizes public urination and defecation\\", already illegal.

Life He was the fifth son and seventh child of Thomas Williams of Cote, Aston, Oxfordshire, born on 23 May 1813. He was educated at a private school, and afterwards at London University. At the age of 19 he was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 31 January 1833. After practising for two or three years under the bar as a certificated conveyancer, he was called to the bar on 4 May 1838. The publication of his books brought Williams an extensive practice as a conveyancer and real property lawyer, and in March 1862 he was appointed by Lord Westbury, the Lord Chancellor, one of the four conveyancing counsel to the court of chancery. His health suffered from the strain of increasing work. He was made a Queen's Counsel on 30 March 1865, and during Easter term, on 20 April following, was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn. As a Q.C. he became a series of cases relating to the establishment of rights of common;Such as the Commissioners of Sewers v. Glasse (more commonly known as the Epping Forest case), Lord Rivers v. Adams, Warwick v. Queen's College, Oxford (the Plumstead Common case), Hall v. Byron (the Coulsdon Common case), Smith v. Earl Brownlow (the Berkhampstead case), Peek v. Earl Spencer (the Wimbledon case), Earl De la Warr v. Miles (the Sussex Forest case). it included most of the cases in which there was an attempt by lords of manors to wrest from commoners the enjoyment of their rights. In 1875 Williams was appointed professor of the law of real and personal property to the Inns of Court by the council of legal education, and was annually re-elected to this office until his resignation in 1880. He died at his residence, 49 Queensborough Terrace, London, on 25 October 1881. Works In 1845 Williams published his Principles of the Law of Real Property (first as Williams on Conveyancing), a work which ran through 18 editions in the 19th century. It was followed in 1848 by his Principles of the Law of Personal Property, of which the 14th edition appeared in 1894. Williams's lectures on the Seisin of the Freehold, the Law of Settlements, and the Rights of Common were published in 1878‚Äì1880. He also edited the fourth edition of Charles Watkins on Descents, and wrote Letters to John Bull, Esq., on Lawyers and Law Reform (London, 1857), and An Essay on Real Assets (1861).

Technically it is not a trust but an agency arrangement, although it has been characterized as a hybrid between a traditional trust and an agency relationship. One use of the nominee trust is to avoid reporting the ownership of real estate on the public record. The deed, or other filed document lists the trustee, but not the undisclosed principals. Another use is to facilitate transfer of real property without involving the county recorder. Unlike a trust, the trustee does not have legal title, which remains in the \\"beneficiaries\\". Therefore, the trustee does not file a tax return with regard to income on trust property, as they would in an actual trust. The nominee trust is also an exception to the general rule that the capacity of a trustee is separate from the capacity of an agent. The common law may apply principles of the law of bailment to the nominee trust in some instances. The trustee is an agent of the beneficiaries who merely follows their specific directions.

The military established a junta called the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) to govern the nation. After dissolving the government and the Senate, the NCPO vested executive and legislative powers in its leader and ordered the judicial branch to operate under its directives. In addition, it partially repealed the 2007 constitution, save the second chapter which concerns the king, declared martial law and curfew nationwide, banned political gatherings, arrested and detained politicians and anti-coup activists, imposed Internet censorship and took control of the media. The NCPO issued an interim constitution granting itself amnesty and sweeping power. The NCPO also established a military dominated national legislature which later unanimously elected General Prayut as the new prime minister of the country.  Background  In the 2011 general election, Yingluck Shinawatra and the Pheu Thai Party (PTP) won a landslide victory and formed the government with Yingluck as prime minister. Anti- government protests, led by former Democrat Party secretary general Suthep Thaugsuban, began in November 2013. Suthep later formed the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) for the purpose of demanding the establishment of an unelected \\"people's council\\" to supervise \\"political reform\\". Pro-government groups, including the Red Shirts, held mass rallies in response. Violence occasionally occurred, resulting in a number of deaths and injuries. In December 2013, Yingluck dissolved the House of Representatives and scheduled a general election for 2 February 2014. Disrupted by the anti- government protesters, the election was not completed on that day. The Constitutional Court then nullified the election on 21 March 2014. On 7 May 2014, the Constitutional Court unanimously removed Yingluck and nine other senior ministers from office over the controversial transfer of a top security officer in 2011. The remaining ministers selected Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan to replace Yingluck as caretaker prime minister as protests continued. After the coup, PDRC leader Suthep Thaugsuban told PDRC supporters that he had been in talks with General Prayut since 2010 about how to exclude Yingluck's brother Thaksin Shinawatra and his family from power. He also claimed that before declaring martial law, General Prayut told him that \\"Khun Suthep and your masses of PDRC supporters are too exhausted. It's now the duty of the army to take over the task\\". Similarly, Reuters reported in December 2013 that close friends of Prayut, former army chief, Anupong Paochinda, and General Prawit Wongsuwan were supporters of the PDRC. After the coup, Prawit was named Deputy Prime Minister.  Immediately prior to the coup  = Martial law imposition = General Prayut Chan-o-cha, RTA Commander. The RTA intervened on 20 May 2014, when its commander, General Prayut, exercised the power under the act promulgated by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) entitled Martial Law, BE 2457 (1914), to impose martial law nationwide from 03:00. He said through a television pool that the imposition of martial law was due to continuous violence from both sides and was for the purpose of allowing the army to restore and maintain the peace. After imposing martial law, General Prayut ordered the dissolution of the Centre for Administration of Peace and Order, a police body formed by the caretaker government to resolve the crisis. He then established a Peace and Order Maintaining Command (POMC) with himself as its commander. Charged with the duty to \\"restore peace to the people from all sides without delay\\", the POMC was initially given the power to \\"prevent, suppress, abate and resolve\\" any situation affecting national security, to enforce every provision of the martial law, and to summon any person. General Prayut also ordered the personnel of the police, navy, air force and Ministry of Defence to be subject to the POMC. In Bangkok, soldiers were stationed in many places and the main roads were blockaded. The military retook the Government House from the PDRC protesters and seized all television stations in Bangkok and some other parts of the country before shutting down some stations, including those of the PDRC and the Red Shirts. General Prayut later ordered all media to replace their regular programs with the POMC programs whenever he required. and imposed a ban on publishing information which might affect the military's mission. He also directed all government agency chiefs to report to him. On 21 May 2014, the POMC established an Internet censorship task force and ordered Internet service providers to report to it in order to control online content. The caretaker government complained that it had not been consulted about the martial law-related decisions of the army. The army claimed that the move was not a coup d'√©tat and that the government remained in office. = Unsuccessful talks = After its establishment, the POMC held talks with rival groups for two days in an attempt to find resolution. It was reported that the participants were of conflicting opinions and no agreement could be adopted. During talks, the caretaker government was requested by the Election Commission to resign. The government denied the request, saying it was required by the constitution to stay in office. The 2007 constitution prescribed that the cabinet vacates office en bloc upon dissolution of the House of Representatives but it shall remain in office and continue to function until a new cabinet takes office. On the afternoon of 22 May 2014, the POMC held another talk at the Thai Army Club on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road The talk had proceeded for five hours without reaching agreement, whilst the government maintained that it bore a legal duty to remain in office. At the meeting, General Prayut eventually said to Minister of Justice Chaikasem Nitisiri who led the government representatives: \\"The talk knows no end because you all only speak about the law. [...] The government insists that it won't resign, right?\\" Chaikasem replied: \\"Not at this moment\\". General Prayut then told the meeting that \\"Sorry, I must seize power\\" and ordered the detention of the cabinet members as well as the leaders of the PDRC, Red Shirts, and political parties who attended the talk, much to the dismay of the media representatives who were present. They were held at the 1st Infantry Regiment of the King's Guard.  Coup  Soldiers at Chang Phueak Gate, Chiang Mai = Launch = On the evening of 22 May 2014, General Prayut announced through a televised address that the armed forces were assuming control of national administration, formally launching a coup d'√©tat against the caretaker government and establishing the NCPO to rule the state. Later that night, the NCPO repealed the 2007 constitution, save the second chapter which deals with the king. In addition, it formally ordered the dissolution of the caretaker government, but the Senate as well as all other state agencies, including the courts and the independent organs, were kept intact. The NCPO declared its composition as follows: * General Prayut (RTA Commander) as its leader, * General Thanasak Patimaprakorn (Chief of Defence Forces), Admiral Narong Pipathanasai (Royal Thai Navy Commander), Air Chief Marshal Prajin Jantong (Royal Thai Air Force Commander), and Police General Adul Saengsingkaew (Royal Thai Police Commissioner General), as its deputy leaders, * General Udomdet Sitabut (RTA Deputy Commander) as its secretary general. The NCPO then announced that its leader would exercise all powers and duties which the laws invest in the prime minister and the cabinet, until there was a new prime minister. It placed its members in charge of government ministries and equivalent agencies. On 24 May 2014, the NCPO dissolved the existing Senate and granted legislative powers to its leader. It ordered the judicial branch to operate under its directives. It transferred Police General Adul to an inactive post in the Office of the Prime Minister and replaced him with Police General Watcharapol Prasarnrajkit. Adul was seen as a loyalist of the deposed government. = Arrest and detention of public figures = Immediately after the coup was launched, caretaker Prime Minister Niwatthamrong, who did not attend the talks, left his office at the Ministry of Commerce so as to avoid being apprehended by the military. The NCPO ordered him and the cabinet members who were not detained to report to the military that day. It was reported that Niwatthamrong attempted to establish a government-in-exile at the United States embassy in Bangkok, but the embassy denied the report. On the night of 22 May 2014, military officers detained additional politicians, including Chalerm Yubamrung and his sons. The following day, the NCPO summoned PTP members and Shinawatra family members, including Yingluck. Niwatthamrong and Yingluck surrendered themselves to the NCPO on that day. Yingluck was detained at an undisclosed \\"safe house\\". The NCPO said it released her on 25 May. The NCPO later summoned another 114 prominent figures from both sides and stated that those who refused to submit to it would be apprehended and prosecuted. Activist Sombat Boonngamanong, better known as Dotty Editor, was the first person who refused to surrender, saying \\"Hilarious. Not reporting [to the junta] is considered a criminal offense.\\" He challenged the summons with a post on Facebook: \\"Catch me if you can\\". The NCPO responded by stating that on the morning of 24 May, it would send soldiers to apprehend those who failed to appear. One of those apprehended on that day was Panthongtae Shinawatra, a nephew of Yingluck. Sombat was eventually apprehended on 5 June 2014 in Chon Buri Province. The military tracked him down through the Internet, using the IP address he used to post his comments. In addition to two years in jail for violating its orders, the military said Sombat will face seven years of imprisonment on grounds of encouraging people to violate its orders, which are the \\"law of the nation\\". The military also said that those who provided refuge to Sombat were to be dealt with by two years in jail on account of \\"harbouring a criminal\\". The NCPO also summoned the Bangkok diplomatic corps to its headquarters. In its summons, it said the corps were merely \\"invited\\" to a meeting with the military figures, so that they would have \\"correct understanding\\" of its mission. Many foreign ambassadors, including German Ambassador Rolf Peter Schulze, refused to go. Former Minister of Education Chaturon Chaisaeng was the first person to be tried in a military court for failing to appear as summoned by the NCPO. Soldiers apprehended Chaturon in front of a crowd of foreign journalists immediately after giving a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand on 27 May 2014. An NCPO spokesman said that holding a press conference with foreign media was deemed improper and against NCPO policy. Chaturon faced fourteen years of imprisonment in consequence of computer crime charges. Martial law allows the military to detain people for no more than seven days. The NCPO did not observe the time limit. Some individuals were held incommunicado for more than three weeks. = Control of public activities and media = Upon announcing the coup, the NCPO laid down a ban on political gatherings and directed all protesters to disperse. It ordered all educational institutes, both public and private, to close from 23 to 25 May 2014. It imposed a curfew throughout the country, ordering people to stay indoors from 22:00 to 05:00. The curfew time was later changed to 24:00 to 04:00 hours, effective 28 May 2014. The curfew was lifted in most parts of the country on 13 June 2014. The NCPO ordered all television and radio stations to stop airing their regular programs and to broadcast RTA programs only. It detained Wanchai Tantiwittayapitak, deputy director of the Thai Public Broadcasting Service which operates Thai PBS station, after he permitted the station to live broadcast a special program about the coup on YouTube instead of television. On the program, several scholars, including Chulalongkorn University lecturer Gothom Arya, were interviewed and gave negative comments on the coup. Thai PBS said Wanchai was taken to the First Army Area headquarters to \\"tune in understanding between the media and army\\". On 23 May 2014, the NCPO summoned all media chiefs to the Thai Army Club and ordered Internet service providers to censor any information deemed provocative, causing public disturbance, containing official secrets, likely detrimental to national security, or defamatory to the NCPO. It threatened to shut down social media if its operator failed to block information inciting unrest or inciting \\"opposition to peacekeeping\\". On the afternoon of 23 May, analogue television networks, except Thai PBS, were allowed to resume their normal programming, after the NCPO ordered the Internet service providers to block all broadcast sharing attempts on the Internet and instructed the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission to shut down Internet-based television. All digital television networks were permitted to resume broadcasts the following day. On 24 May 2014, media organisations issued an open letter urging the NCPO to end the restriction of press freedom as soon as possible. The NCPO responded by summoning all media operators, instructing them that they were required to attend a meeting with the NCPO first.  Aftermath  = Future roles = The NCPO stated on 23 May 2014 that it aimed to conduct national \\"economic, social and political\\" reforms before elections were permitted. It said a reform council and a national assembly will be set up to work on the reforms. It also said it wanted to handle, inter alia, the rice pledge project problems, and will carry out a project of constructing roads on both banks of the Chao Phraya River. The road construction project was originally initiated by the PTP in 2012 and was part of a flood control project. General Prayut said he would run the country until the situation required an interim government. In administering the country, he said he will use the military command and control systems which he believed would develop the country. The NCPO announced that its leader would determine national administrative policies, both \\"short-term and long-term\\". Unlike previous coups, there were no promises of a quick return to civilian rule. On 26 May, the NCPO held a press conference at which a Thai Rath journalist asked General Prayut if he would become the new prime minister himself. Prayut did not refuse, answering, \\"It is already in the plan.\\" Another journalist, from the Bangkok Post, asked when an election would happen. Prayut replied, \\"[An election] depends on the situation. [There is] no deadline. That's enough\\", before walking out of the conference room. The following day, both journalists were summoned by the NCPO on grounds of \\"giving questions that lessen public confidence in the ruler\\". An NCPO spokesman also said that normal democratic principles could not be applied at the current time. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the military's decisions showed that General Prayut is preparing \\"a long-term pervasive takeover without the calling of quick elections\\". On 29 May 2014, Lieutenant General Chatchalerm Chalermsukh, deputy army chief of staff, told reporters at a press conference in Bangkok, that while elections would be held, there was no timetable. \\"Right conditions\\" would have to be put in place before an election took place, he said. A day later, in a national television address, General Prayut said elections would not be held for at least fifteen months. He warned against resistance to the military and called on all sides to co-operate and stop protesting. Some observers believe that elections are being postponed due to issues of succession to the throne of Thailand. The king's \\"...death will shake Thailand like nothing has in its modern history, and the Thai military wants to be firmly in charge when that happens. It is that simple.\\" = Royal endorsement = On 24 May 2014, the NCPO said King Bhumibol Adulyadej had acknowledged the coup, but stopped short of describing the response as an endorsement. However, on 26 May 2014 the king formally appointed General Prayut to run the country. In Thailand the monarchy is highly respected and royal endorsement was seen as legitimation of the takeover. = L√®se majest√© cases = At a press conference on 23 May 2014, the NCPO said one of its missions is to \\"severely\\" deal with l√®se majest√© offenders in Thailand and ordered governmental officers to support this mission. On 25 May 2014, the NCPO authorised military courts to try all cases concerning l√®se majest√©, sedition, national security, and violation of NCPO orders. On that day, the NCPO searched the residence of Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, an imprisoned magazine editor sentenced in 2013 to 11 years in jail for l√®se majest√©. The NCPO detained his wife, who had been campaigning for political prisoners, and his son, a fourth year student at the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University. Other critics of the l√®se majest√© law were detained as well. The NCPO later summoned a number of exiled activists accused of l√®se majest√©, including former Chulalongkorn University political science lecturer Giles Ji Ungpakorn and former minister Jakrapob Penkair. They were ordered to appear by 9 June 2014. = Interim constitution = An interim constitution was enacted on 22 July 2014, paving the way for the establishment of a national legislature, a provisional government, and a reform council. The draft interim constitution originally required that a draft new constitution be approved by the citizens in a nationwide referendum before it is forwarded to the king for his signature. The requirement was disapproved by the NCPO and was deleted. Wissanu Krea-ngam, a Chulalongkorn University law lecturer who drafted the interim constitution, explained that the requirement was deleted to avoid \\"lengthy process\\".  Domestic responses  = Pro- and anti- government protesters = Many PDRC protesters lauded the announcement of the coup at their rally sites. Phra Buddha Issara, a then Buddhist monk and PDRC co-leader, went on stage to proclaim the victory of the anti-Shinawatra government protesters before requesting that his followers disperse and go home. Soldiers took over the pro-government protest sites and fired shots in the air to disperse protesters. The last group of protesters left Bangkok on the evening of 23 May 2014. The NCPO provided 70 military vehicles to carry the protesters from both sides home. = Anti-coup =  Public protests  In spite of a ban on political gatherings of more than five persons, demonstrators, including Thammasat University students, marched to the Democracy Monument on 23 May 2014 to express their anger at the coup. However the military stopped them from reaching the monument, citing fear of violence and clashes. On the same day, separate protests took place outside the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre, led by freelance media, artists, and social activists. Soldiers sent by the NCPO detained the protesters. A live round was fired and the whereabouts of those apprehended was not known. On 24 May 2014, a group held an anti-coup protest in front of Major Ratchayothin Cinema in Bangkok, where a company of troops with riot shields was stationed. On that evening, another group of at least 1,000 protesters marched to the Victory Monument. The military tried to stop their procession, using a police truck. Some of the protesters were apprehended but were released after negotiation. At midday on 25 May 2014, a group of anti-coup protesters gathered in front of a McDonald's restaurant at Ratchaprasong, in the heart of Bangkok. Soldiers arrived and seized the area. Another group of people tried to march from the Victory Monument to the Pathum Wan intersection protesting the coup. The military managed to block them. Anti-coup protests also took place outside Bangkok. In Chiang Mai Province, a group of people clad in black held anti-coup activities for days, including marching to the city's ancient walls where they performed a candle-lit ceremony opposing the military's action. Some of them were apprehended by military on 24 May. Anti-coup rallies also occurred in several other provinces. In Khon Kaen Province, students held a ceremony to bid farewell to democracy in front of Central Plaza Khon Kaen shopping mall where soldiers were stationed. In Maha Sarakham Province, students held an anti-coup protest in the middle of the city but soldiers came and seized protest materials such as banners. A group of Thais living in Australia held anti-coup activities at Kings Park, Perth, on 26 May. A number of anti-coup activists outside Bangkok were later summoned by regional military courts and were detained without charges. On 10 June 2014, Chalard Vorachat, a retired pilot officer and renowned hunger striker, sued the NCPO before the Criminal Court. Chalard alleged that the NCPO, by staging the coup, committed insurrection. The court dismissed the case, ruling that Chalard was not the victim and was therefore not entitled to institute the case, although Chalard claimed that he was the victim because his rights and liberties had been affected by the coup.  Online activities  A banner in Bangkok, observed on 3 June 2014, informs the public that \\"liking\\" or \\"sharing\\" the activity of those who openly disrespect the Monarchy on social media could land them in prison. The banner says this is \\"for the sake of the monarchy\\". near Chit Lom, Bangkok, Thailand on 2014-06-30. The woman in the right side of the picture is Chatwadee Amornpat, known as 'London Rose' who has openly insulted the Monarchy. Ministry of Information and Communication Technology when accessing prohibited content, such as The Daily Mail, from Thailand in 2014. Anti-coup sentiment was also echoed on Thai social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and LINE, even though the military had previously warned that it would block social media if material critical of the coup was published. A reporter, Pornthip Mongyai, was dismissed by her news agency, Mono Group, after a photo of Pornthip, wearing a press armband, stood next to a line of soldiers with an \\"X\\" taped over her lips, went viral on the Internet. In response to anti-coup activities on social media, the NCPO ordered the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) to block Facebook in Thailand \\"from time to time\\", effective from 28 May 2014. On that evening, Facebook was blocked for about an hour throughout the country. The MICT stated on 24 May that more than 100 URLs have been blocked under martial law. People calling for protests on social media were warned that they will face prosecution for sedition. The military also said that liking an anti-coup page on Facebook constituted a criminal offence.  Anti-coup symbols  Thai coup protesters used a salute consisting of three fingers symbolising their opposition to the coup; it was inspired originally from The Hunger Games film series,The Thai protesters' Hunger Games salute shows a lack of political thought but it was later extended to represent the ideas of liberty, equality and brotherhood.See: * * The military announced that it would arrest anyone who displayed the salute. Protesters then adopted the sandwich as their new anti-coup symbol. They handed out sandwiches, shouting \\"sandwiches for democracy!\\". On 22 June 2014, a student eating sandwiches in front of Siam Paragon and a group of students who were to organise a sandwich activity at the same venue were apprehended and were later placed in detention. Apart from using the three-finger salute and eating sandwiches in public, two other acts of expressing anti-coup stance have been criminalised: reading George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four in public, and wearing shirts with certain slogans such as \\"Peace Please\\" and \\"Respect My Vote\\". Private citizens performing other symbolic acts were also apprehended and detained. These included: an aged woman wearing a mask with the word \\"People\\", a man shouting \\"I'm a common citizen who feels shame because there's another coup in my country\\", a fried squid vendor wearing a red shirt, a group of people covering their eyes, ears, and mouths, a group of movie commentators and artistic activists intending to organise the displaying of the film Nineteen Eighty-Four, a group of people holding activities in front of Wat Phra Si Mahathat, a temple in Bangkok, to commemorate the transition of absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy in the Siamese revolution of 1932, a student playing \\"La Marseillaise\\" in public, a group of people holding papers asking \\"Where are the people?\\", and a man holding a paper saying \\"Holding papers is not a crime\\". All were to be tried in military courts for sedition. = Pro-coup = On 25 May 2014, a pro-coup group held a counter-rally at the Democracy Monument calling on the NCPO to conduct reforms before a general election. The following day, a group of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a similar rally. = Political parties = Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva said on 25 May 2014 that he was sorry that he could not protect democracy. The following day, he urged the NCPO to take tough measures against anti-coup groups. = Academic and religious sectors = The coup met with strong reactions from Thai academics, with the majority expressing serious concern over its negative impact on Thailand's democracy and human rights. But some Thai academics argued that there was no other solution to Thailand's problems. A group of university lecturers, who call themselves the Assembly for the Defence of Democracy (AFDD), issued a statement on 23 May 2014, emphasizing the right of the people to offer resistance to an illegitimate ruler and requesting the military to promptly release the detained protesters. In its statement, the AFDD said, > A good ruler shall not rule by force. He must be accepted by the public, > must gain public consent, must keep his words, and must acquire faith and > trust from everyone. If the NCPO treats the people as its enemy and keeps on > suppressing them by force, it will face endless resistance and will have to > suppress countless people. Eventually, there will be no one left to be > ruled. On that day, AFDD members gathered in front of the Dome Building of Thammasat University to express their anti-coup stance. The scholars from the Midnight University also issued a statement denouncing the coup and demanding the resignation of the National Human Rights Commission. The academic sector also called on NCPO members to disclose their financial interests to the public. However, the National Anti-Corruption Commission said that it is not required by any law. On 26 May 2014, Phra Paisal Visalo, a monk renowned for his roles in human rights protection, denounced the coup, saying \\"Even though this coup brought an end to some urgent problems..., it is the beginning of new various problems which are surely more serious\\". In response to heavy opposition from the academic sector, military officers were stationed at some higher education institutions to prevent academics from expressing political opinions or holding political activities. These included Thammasat University's Tha Pra Chan Campus in Bangkok. The NCPO summoned leading pro-democracy scholars. Despite the NCPO threatening that those failing to show up would face criminal penalties, the summoned said they would not submit to the military. A number of scholars who failed to appear were later apprehended, such as Thammasat University law lecturer Sawatree Suksri who was apprehended at Suvarnabhumi Airport on 7 June 2014 after travelling back from the United States on a US embassy study trip about human rights. The military also ordered Thai diplomats to take measures to force the return of exiled academicians. One of the targets was Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai associate professor at Kyoto University who challenged the summons by asking if he could send his pet chihuahua to meet with General Prayut in his stead. Pavin claimed that the Thai ambassador in Tokyo and consul general in Osaka had both been told by the military that if they failed to force Pavin to return, they would either be transferred or forced out of the foreign service. On 13 June 2014, the NCPO issued an arrest warrant against Pavin.  International responses  = Government sector =  Supranational  *  The Council of the European Union concluded on 23 June 2014 that the EU and its member states will not sign the partnership and cooperation agreement with Thailand, until a democratically elected government is in place, and that other agreements will also be affected as appropriate.  The European External Action Service called for the military to accept and respect the constitutional authority of the civilian power and stressed \\"the importance of holding credible and inclusive elections as soon as feasible\\". *  Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, issued a statement through his spokesman, expressing concern over the coup, calling for \\"a prompt return to constitutional, civilian, democratic rule\\" and movement towards cooperation between the parties.  Navi Pillay, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemned the coup. She said her office has monitored the situations for the past five months and she is \\"deeply concerned about the forcible replacement of an elected government, the imposition of martial law, the suspension of the constitution and the emergency measures that are restricting the enjoyment of human rights\\". She also urged prompt restoration of rule of law in the country.  Countries  * - The Argentine Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Argentine Embassy in Bangkok demanded an \\"immediate return to the constitutional order in Thailand\\". * ‚Äì Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop expressed that she was \\"gravely concerned\\" over the military coup and described the situation as \\"volatile\\". She also urged Australian travellers to exercise caution and pay close attention to their security, there are an estimated 5000+ Australians currently in Thailand. * ‚Äì Cambodian government officials expressed concerns that tensions could rise at the Cambodia‚ÄìThailand border, where a dispute has been ongoing since 2008. Council of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan said \\"We wish to see this [coup] not jeopardizing democratic transition, maintaining peace and stability, and still respecting [and safeguarding] the will and interest of the Thai people\\" while adding that nothing is expected to change at the Cambodia‚ÄìThailand border. Siphan also said that the government would always respect the mutual interests of the two countries. * ‚Äì Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the coup and said: \\"This decision violates Thailand's democratic principles and stands in stark contrast to the Army's earlier assurances that its role would be limited to securing public order. We hope and expect the Thai military will return Thailand to civilian rule as soon as possible, respect democratic processes and the rule of law, ensure freedom of expression and assembly, and guarantee due process for those who have been detained.\\" * ‚Äì The Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement condemning the coup and saying that they \\"trust that the political crisis affecting the partner and friendly nation and its people, can be quickly and peacefully resolved through means that will allow the recovery of democratic coexistence\\". * ‚Äì Foreign Ministry issued a brief statement expressing its concern over the situation and hoped for the order to be restored in Thailand. * ‚Äì The Foreign Affairs Ministry, through a press release, reiterated its concern about the current situation in the \\"allied nation\\" of Thailand and condemned the \\"break of the institutional order that was caused by the coup\\".

He also states that Indonesia will communicate with Myanmar, which is ASEAN chairperson for 2014 to \\"mobilize ASEAN‚Äôs contribution in establishing a condition conducive for the restoration of political condition in Thailand\\". * ‚Äì Fumio Kishida, the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement calling for the rapid restoration of democracy in Thailand. * ‚Äì The Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised Malaysian citizens to avoid travelling to Thailand for the time being and postpone any non-essential visits to the country. Malaysian citizens present in Thailand are also advised to abide by the curfew for personal safety and security reasons. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had commented that the coup in Thailand will not affect Malaysia politically or economically, saying that since independence in 1957 Malaysians have been law-abiding citizens. * ‚Äì Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Charles Jose said \\"the Philippines supports a peaceful resolution of the present situation\\" and \\"hopes for an early return to normalcy consistent with democratic principles, the rule of law and the will and interest of the Thai people.\\" * ‚Äì The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for a prompt return of the political process and constitutional protections. * ‚Äì The South African government, through its spokesman Clayson Monyela, condemned the coup and called on \\"all relevant parties to work speedily and through an inclusive process towards the restoration of constitutional order\\". * ‚Äì A spokesperson for the Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed \\"grave concern\\" over the coup. * ‚Äì The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey stated that, \\"We regret the decision of the Thai armed forces to suspend the constitution and take control of the government.

The Foreign Office announced that it would review military ties with Thailand and cancelled a number of military visits. * ‚Äì Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement condemning the coup, saying that he is \\"disappointed\\" by the army's decision and \\"this act will have negative implications for the U.S.‚ÄìThai relationship, especially for our relationship with the Thai military.\\" The Cobra Gold joint military drill proceeded, but military aid was suspended. * ‚Äì Vietnamese government representatives traveled to Thailand to meet with representatives of the Thai government as a show of support for the change of government. = Non-governmental sector = * A group of Thai studies scholars from twenty universities in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly published an open letter in which they said, \\"You [General Prayut] requested that citizens 'carry out their lives and occupation as usual', but nothing could be normal about the political and social conditions put in place by the coup. The coup cannot be a measure for peace because the coup itself is the use of violence.\\" They called on the NCPO to return immediately to constitutional rule by a civilian government and to provide a concrete timeline for such return. * Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement saying that arresting peaceful anti-coup activists is a \\"dangerous precedent\\" and \\"maintaining public order cannot be an excuse for violating human rights.\\" It also urged the NCPO to clarify the whereabouts of those arrested and detained. AI later denounced the military action against leading anti-coup activist Sombat Boonngamanong, describing it as part of \\"a systematic and widening crackdown on key human rights\\". Its Asian director Richard Bennett said \\"This is the latest in a disturbing wave of arrests of people purely voicing disquiet about the military regime. The army's course of action is looking increasingly like a purge.\\" * The Asian Human Rights Commission condemned the NCPO for threatening academics and activists, called for the immediate release of the detainees, and expressed grave concern over the rapid decline of human rights protections in the country. * Human Rights Watch described the NCPO's actions as the exercise of \\"draconian martial law powers\\" and called for the immediate end thereof. Its Asian director Brad Adams said, \\"The Thai army needs to recognize that the government should be determined by the ballot, not the bullet.\\" * Noam Chomsky said he was \\"deeply disturbed to learn about the threats against Professor Pavin Chachavalpongpun\\" and hoped that those threats will quickly be withdrawn and that Pavin can \\"resume his life without government repression\\". * Stars of the Hunger Games showed their support for anti-coup protesters who have been using the films' three-fingered salute as a way of showing opposition. One of the cast members, Natalie Dormer, described the use of the salute as \\"incredible\\" and said \\"Anything that galvanises people in a positive way to fight against oppression cannot be criticised in any shape or form.\\"  Impacts  The United States suspended US$3.5m in military aid to Thailand from its overall aid package of US$10.5 million and cancelled military engagements, including military visits and training. It also urged tourists to cancel trips and halted non-essential visits by its governmental officers. Some border checkpoints between Thailand and neighbouring states were closed following the coup. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports said on 27 May that the arrival of \\"foreign tourists dropped by 20%\\". The coup also resulted in the cancellation of American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's concert ‚ÄúThe Red Tour‚Äù, formerly scheduled on 9 June 2014, in Bangkok, and the postponement of several events, including USA Fair 2014 scheduled for 30 May‚Äì2 June 2014. Asia Sentinel reported on 9 June 2014 that Thai rights groups estimated that some 200 people remained in detention since the coup happened. After the NCPO vowed on 11 June 2014 to deal with illegal foreign workers in Thailand, saying \\"we see illegal workers as a threat\\", a very large number of foreign migrants, more than half of whom were women and children, left the country the same day. The International Organization for Migration described the event as a \\"sudden influx\\" and expressed its concern. The BBC reported on 16 June 2014 that more than 180,000 Cambodians fled Thailand after the NCPO announced the crackdown. A group of Cambodians died in a car accident on their way to the border and this enraged the Cambodian government, which said the Thai military must be held responsible for all the problems that have occurred. Burmese migrants in northern Thailand were arrested and were released only after a \\"protection fee\\" was paid. Rights groups said employers in southern Thailand had also advised their foreign workers to go into hiding in the woods or rubber plantations to avoid arrest.

Plot Sheri Campari (Melanie LaPatin) is the single mother of two daughters: Tasi (Shannon Lea) and Toni (Laurel Vail). Sheri is training Tasi to become a professional competitive ballroom dancer with the help of Toni and flamboyantly gay dance partner Cedric Michaels (Benji Schwimmer). They are always training and the pressure is growing as the prospects of becoming professional get closer. Toni sees Tasi throwing up in the bathroom and thinks it's because of the diet their mother enforces to maintain Tasi's figure. Toni tells Tasi to confide in her but Tasi tells her is none of her business. Later on, it is let known that Tasi is pregnant with twins. The father is a neighbor who apparently doesn't want the responsibility and argues with Tasi at the restaurant where Toni works. Cedric takes Toni to a dancing club where he disappears with a boyfriend. Alone in the club, Toni meets Mona Saunders (Nicole Dionne) whom Toni leads in dancing. Mona takes Toni to her home and they end up getting involved in a lesbian relationship.

Cedric and Tesi convince Toni to take part in the upcoming dancing competition to replace Tasi. Toni agrees on the condition that they both help her train and that her partner will be Mona. Tesi is relieved as she perceives that her pregnancy will be less of an issue with Sheri than Toni's lesbianism. When Sheri sees Toni practicing with Mona, she storms out. The sisters have to fend on their own with the help of Cedric and Mona who take the sisters for the first time to a grocery store which was always Sheri's job. Eventually, they go to the dance competition but the judges do not approve Toni and Mona's participatipation as it is against their bylaws.

It was formed in September 2012 in the Raqqa Governorate. At the end of 2015, it joined Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve as part of the American-led intervention in Syria. During an interview by Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi in 2015, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa's media director stated that the group wants a \\"civil democratic state\\". He also claimed that the group had no relations with the Syrian National Coalition based in Turkey. Between the end of 2015 and mid-2017, the group was known as Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa (), or the Front of Raqqa Revolutionaries. History =Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa= Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa's founder and commander is Ahmad al-Othman bin Alloush, a member of an Arab tribe in the Raqqa region, commonly known by his nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Raqqawi. With the start of the Syrian Civil War, Abu Issa participated in protests against the Syrian government in Raqqa city, and was arrested twice. In 2012, he established an armed group in the Raqqa area. On 19 September, rebel groups captured the border town of Tell Abyad. Abu Issa's group soon merged with 6 others in the area to form Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa, initially based in Tell Abyad and part of the Revolutionary Military Council in Raqqa Governorate. In December 2012, 3 rebel groups in and around Raqqa joined Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa. In the same month, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa joined a coalition called the Raqqa Liberation Front, along with other groups including the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigade. Alongside al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham, these groups captured Raqqa city after a 3-day battle in early March 2013. After the battle, these groups laid siege on the 17th Division, 93rd Brigade, and Tabqa Air Base around Raqqa. Since April 2013, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa cooperated with al-Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and other rebel groups in the area. By July 2013, the group added the word \\"Islamic\\" to its name, and appeared in a joint statement with ISIL in front of the latter's Black Standard. Despite publicly cooperating, however, tensions began to rise between Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa, ISIL, and Ahrar al-Sham. In September 2013, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa pledged allegiance to the al-Nusra Front, part of al-Qaeda. and became part of it, although it was not fully integrated into al-Nusra. During the time Liwa al-Thuwar al-Raqqa was part of al-Nusra, it fought the Kurdish-led People's Protection Units (YPG) in Tell Abyad, and was accused by Kurdish officials of involvement in the abduction of Kurds and looting in Raqqa city. In January 2014, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa led the fight against the ISIL in the city of Raqqa, and was expelled from al-Nusra Front. After ISIL expelled Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa and other rebel groups from Raqqa city, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa moved into the northern Raqqa Governorate countryside and allied itself with the YPG and the Kurdish Front. In July 2014 the faction and 10 other groups threatened to leave the Aleppo and Raqqa governorates if they were not aided by other rebels in their fight against ISIL. In September 2014, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa joined the YPG-FSA Euphrates Volcano joint operations room. It received anti-tank missiles and other equipment from the United States through the ≈ûanlƒ±urfa border crossing as part of the Syrian Train and Equip Program to fight ISIL. In mid-2015, it participated in the YPG-led offensive towards the Syrian border city of Tell Abyad. In June, fighters from Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa were near the Turkish border, whilst the group was also fighting ISIL in the southern city of Ayn Issa, on the Raqqa road. Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa was able to grow considerably in size because of the influx of both rebels from Turkey and locals who wanted to fight ISIL. The current size of the brigade is unknown, but numbers in the hundreds at least. In October 2015, the group stated it received military equipment from the United States and YPG in order to fight ISIL north of Raqqa. The group also stated its intention to capture the city of Raqqa from ISIL. Analyst Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi claimed that Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa wants Syria to become a unitary civil democratic state. =Reorganisation under the SDF banner= In November 2015, the group merged with Tribal Army of Tell Abyad to form Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa which became part of a greater coalition in northern Syria. However, some members of Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa did not join the SDF, despite the leadership joining. Tensions between the People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Tribal Army grew after alleged YPG atrocities against the Arab populations of northern Syria. In response the YPG with their Arab allies blockaded the region held by Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa, after ISIL attacks increased from the region held by Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa, which became susceptible to an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant attack in late December 2015. On 6 January 2016, the group issued a statement claiming it was disbanding as a consequence of the blockade, although the cause of the disbanding has been disputed. After disbanding they continued to use the Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa name. In late 2015, the group reappeared, announcing it had decided to join the Syrian Democratic Forces. On 20 October 2016, Thuwar al-Raqqa established an all-female battalion named the \\"Free Women of Raqqa Battalion\\". Three of Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa's former subgroups, the Raqqa Hawks Brigade, Raqqa Martyrs Brigade, and the Free Men of Raqqa Brigade, participated in the Raqqa campaign. while Jabhat Thuwar al- Raqqa was planned to be involved in taking the city itself. During the Raqqa offensive, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa's political bureau condemned the offensive for being led by the YPG. This caused tensions between the group's political bureau, who opposes the YPG, and the overall leader and military commander of Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa, Abu Issa, who is allied with the YPG. In response, the SDF besieged and raided the group's headquarter. On 10 December 2016, the second phase of the Raqqa campaign was announced. Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa participated in the offensive under the SDF. Tensions rose again on 25 December and several military commanders in Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa reportedly announced their defection to the Raqqa Hawks Brigade. 2 days later, the Thuwar al-Raqqa commanders declared on video that they were captured by the Raqqa Hawks Brigade and forced to announce their defection, and that they are still with Thuwar al-Raqqa. On 19 May 2017, Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa held a meeting with other SDF member groups in negotiating the role that the former would play in the Raqqa campaign. After SDF commander Hussam Awak promised the unit that \\"its role [in Raqqa] will be essential, especially in the civil and humanitarian affairs\\", Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa sent a convoy of troops to participate in the offensive. In May 2018, tensions began to build up between members of Arab tribes, including Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa, and the rest of the SDF and the Raqqa Internal Security Forces (RISF) over recruitment issues in Raqqa. A curfew was put in place in both Raqqa city and the rest of the governorate on 23 June, as the SDF and RISF besieged Thuwar al-Raqqa's headquarters and arrested between 90 and 200 of its members the next day. By 25 June, the SDF and RISF captured all of Thuwar al-Raqqa fighters and their weapons in Raqqa, completely defeating the group, and the curfew was ended. Following Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa's defeat by the SDF and RISF, Abu Issa met with tribal leaders and SDF officials to discuss surrender and reconciliation. He was reportedly offered a position in the SDF general command. Abu Issa would later go on to deny he was ever arrested by the SDF or the RISF.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpuPypKj5i0 See also * List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War References Category:Anti-government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:Syrian Democratic Forces Category:Free Syrian Army Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Category:Military units and formations established in 2012 ","title":"Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa"},{"id":"42826197","text":"Psyrassaforma janzeni is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Forces of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth were commanded by Field Hetman of Lithuania, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, while Russians were led by Dmitry Pozharsky. The battles ended in tactical Russian victory.  Prelude  After the Battle of Klushino in summer of 1610 Tsar Vasili IV of Russia was deposed and taken to Warsaw. The Polish-Lithuanian army entered Moscow on September 21, 1610, and the boyars, clergy and citizens of Moscow, in fear of False Dmitry II, accepted the Polish Prince Wladyslaw IV Vasa as new Tsar. But the foreign Tsar was not universally accepted outside Moscow, and the country was ransacked by Poles, mercenaries and gangs of robbers of every nation. In March 1611, citizens of Moscow rebelled against Poles, and the Polish garrison was besieged in Kremlin by the First People's Militia, led by Prokopy Lyapunov, governor of Ryazan. Poorly armed militia failed to take the fortress, and soon fell into disorder: Lyapunov was murdered by Cossack leader Ivan Zarutski. Amidst anarchy and breakdown of central government, citizens of Nizhny Novgorod led by Kuzma Minin assembled the Second People's Militia, under the command of Prince Dmitry Pozharsky. Well armed and organized, Second People's Militia took Yaroslavl in March of 1612 and set up provisional government of all Russia, getting support and provisions from many cities of Russia and Siberia. Getting news that a relief Polish army under Hetman Chodkiewicz was approaching Moscow, Minin and Pozharsky entered Moscow in August 1612 and besieged Polish garrison in Kremlin.  First Battle  On September 1, 1612, Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces unsuccessfully tried to break the siege of the Moscow Kremlin, and rescue the Commonwealth garrison under Miko≈Çaj Stru≈õ which was present there. To achieve this, they attacked from the west, towards the suburbs of Moscow. Polish hussars, backed by Polish, Hungarian and German infantry, managed to break the Russian lines. At the same time, however, the right wing of the Commonwealth forces was exposed, which was immediately noticed by the Don Cossacks (allied with the Russians) of Dmitry Trubetsky. Their cavalry attacked, managing to disperse the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces. At the same time, the Commonwealth units in the Kremlin tried to attack the Russian positions, but also failed. On this day, both sides lost some 1000 men.  Second Battle  On September 3 Chodkiewicz decided to attack Moscow via its southern suburb, the Zamoskvorechye District. Some 600 Hungarian infantrymen managed to reach the walls of the Kremlin. They were followed by main Commonwealth units, which however were halted in the narrow streets of the district. After a Russian counterattack, Chodkiewicz ordered a retreat, losing several hundred men.  Outcome  Both battles ended in tactical victory of the Russians. They managed to repel the Commonwealth army, and the garrison of the Kremlin, which had run out of supplies, capitulated on November 7, 1612. News of the capitulation reached Polish King Sigismund III on December 8 at Volokolamsk, less than 30 kilometers away. Upon finding out about this, the king, who was on his way to help the garrison, decided to halt the march and head back to Poland.  Sources  * Andrzej Andrusiewicz, Dzieje Dymitriad 1602‚Äì1614, t.

On 18 July 1580, King Stefan Batory called a council of his hetman, during which two plans were designed - either to march towards Pskov, or to attack Smolensk. After a discussion, a compromise was achieved, in which capture of Russian-held Velikiye Luki was designed. After the siege, Polish-Lithuanian forces were to march towards Pskov, to cut links between Livonia and Muscovy. The fortress of Velikiye Luki, located by the Lovat River, was made of wood and earth. Next to it, a wooden town stood, which was burned by the Commonwealth forces so as it would not give cover to the defenders. The siege began on September 1 with an artillery barrage and infantry attack. Velikiye Luki was set in flames, and the still burning fortress surrendered on September 5. Hungarian mercenaries, who were first to enter it, began widespread looting, not paying attention to the fire, which in the meantime reached the gunpowder magazine. The magazine exploded, killing app. 200 Poles and Hungarians, together with defenders of the fortress. See also *Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars  Sources  * J.

Life  = Youth and travels to Italy = He came from a wealthy aristocratic family. As part of his education, he made frequent visits to the picture gallery at the Schloss Belvedere, where he decided that he would like to be a painter. After some resistance from his parents, he became enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1815.Constantin von Wurzbach: Hempel, Joseph Ritter von. In: Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich.Vol. 8, Verlag L. C. Zamarski, Vienna 1862, S. 299.@ German WikiSource At that time, Classicism was the predominant style taught there, but it was beginning to fall into disfavor among the students. Staircase to Heaven (1855) In the Spring of 1821, he took a trip to Rome with a stopover at Florence, where he made the acquaintance of Leopold Kupelwieser and other like-minded young artists who encouraged his dislike of the Academy's style. He continued to Rome, copying paintings and producing scenes from nature, then returned home in 1825. = Early career = In Vienna, he continued his artistic studies, but also took classes in philosophy from Friedrich Schlegel and attended lectures on botany. He converted to Catholicism in 1827 and married, ultimately having ten children. In 1832, he acquired the lordly estates of Kattau and Missingdorf, near Horn in Lower Austria. He then created a series of altarpieces for the surrounding parish churches, at his own expense, and contributed to their general restoration. However, he apparently missed the mental stimulation of a large city, selling his properties in 1839 and returning to Vienna. Initially, he was excited by the Revolution of 1848, even going so far as to join the \\"National Guard\\", but his aristocratic upbringing reasserted itself and he moved with his family to Klagenfurt, where he started his own art school at the local Lyceum. He relocated again in 1850, this time to Bolzano, but the climate was too damp and cold for his ailing wife and his children were not getting a good education, so he moved to Graz. The Christ Child on a Seesaw (1850) = Later years = In 1859, once again feeling the need to be a landowner, he acquired estates in Vrbovec and Rakovec, Croatia. The agricultural land was a good investment, but he and his family were isolated as they didn't speak any Croatian. After four years, he sold the land and returned to Graz where his wife died two years later. At that time, he gave up oil painting and devoted himself entirely to botanical drawings of wild plants. Eventually, his eyesight deteriorated to the point where he couldn't paint or draw, so he began to write poetry, producing a verse comedy called \\"Graf Biegler\\" and two verse dramas; \\"Raphael\\" and \\"The Oath\\". None of them are currently available. He died suddenly while visiting his daughter Karoline and her husband.

The characters are described, below, using in-universe tone. Alice Alice (portrayed by Milla Jovovich) is the protagonist of the Resident Evil film series. The plot of each film generally revolves around her struggle with the Umbrella Corporation. Alice also appears in the film's novelizations which go into greater detail of her backstory. In the first film, Resident Evil, Alice is depicted as suffering from amnesia, gradually realizing her abilities as a highly trained private security operative. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction, her character is represented as \\"a supremely efficient killing machine\\" and bio-weapon. Alice is an \\"iconic figure and is closely associated with the series,\\" becoming more skilled and rugged throughout the series. Alice's superhuman abilities, as well as the use of various styles of martial arts and gunplay make her something of a superhero character. For example, in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, after her exposure to the T-virus, she displays psychic powers akin to those of Alexia Ashford. In Extinction, her powers are even more developed - she displays even greater control over her telekinesis (although she experiences blackouts and massive headaches if she pushes her powers too far). In Resident Evil: Afterlife, Alice's superhuman abilities have been taken away by Albert Wesker, who injected her with a serum that disabled her T-virus cells; however, at the end of Resident Evil: Retribution, Wesker injects her with the T-Virus and restores her powers, saying that Alice and her powers are the last, best hope for humanity. In Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, after being betrayed by Wesker, Alice undertakes a final mission into the Hive with the help of Claire Redfield and the Red Queen to save what is left of humanity. In this movie, she displays none of her powers despite Wesker restoring them at the end of Retribution, with the Red Queen commenting about Wesker having only pretended to restore her powers. Alice is an original character created for the films, although writer Paul W. S. Anderson noted that Alice was based on the strong women in the Resident Evil games. Anderson initially toyed with the idea of the film being an allegory to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, but the idea was not followed through completely. Despite this, the film contains various references to the work, which included Alice's name.Resident Evil DVD audio commentary with Paul W.S. Anderson, Jeremy Bolt, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez Although the name Alice was given as the character's name prior to Resident Evil's release and is listed in the credits, her name is not actually spoken until the second film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Rain Ocampo Rain Ocampo (played by Michelle Rodriguez) is introduced in the first Resident Evil film, in which she works for the Umbrella Corporation's commando force. During the outbreak in The Hive, Rain and the other operatives are sent down to shut the Red Queen down and contain the infection. During The Hive incident, Rain and Alice become very close. Rain is bitten by one of the infected and is on the point of death when Alice administers the antivirus to her. However it is too late to reverse the effects so that Rain dies and has to be killed by Matt when she revives as a zombie. Several clones of Rain Ocampo are introduced in Resident Evil: Retribution, including a \\"Good Rain\\", created as a test subject for the Umbrella Corporation's live tests on the human response to viral outbreaks, a \\"Bad Rain\\", who works for Jill Valentine, and a \\"Zombie Rain\\". Good Rain, along with a little girl named Becky who is the daughter of an Alice clone, survives a test scenario of the T-virus in a suburban situation. Good Rain is killed when a Licker throws her into a pillar, breaking her neck. Bad Rain helps fight against Alice and her allies and injects herself with the Las Plagas parasite, making her super-strong and invincible. Bad Rain kills Luther West and nearly kills Alice before Alice shoots out the ice under her feet, dropping her into an ocean full of Las Plagas zombies who devour her. During a deleted scene, Zombie Rain is seen during the New York simulation. She charged Ada and Alice from the left, emerging from an alley and attempted to blindside Alice. Alice reacts quickly enough that she kills the clone with a shot to the head. Matt Addison Matt Addison (played by Eric Mabius) and Matt/Nemesis (played by Matthew G. Taylor) appears in Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse. He is an anti-Umbrella activist posing as a newly transferred Raccoon City police officer, who has sent his sister to work Umbrella Corporation to steal some information to expose Umbrella for illegal activity. When the T-virus is released at the Umbrella \\"Hive\\", the red queen seals the Hive, killing everyone inside including Matt's sister. Matt is arrested by a group of umbrella operatives, led by One. Along with Alice, he is then taken to the hive where they are met by a horde of zombies. Matt and Alice are separated and Matt comes across his zombified sister. Alice saves Matt's life, but he later becomes infected when they are attacked by a Licker. Matt begins to mutate, and Alice is preparing to give him the anti-virus when the mansion door bursts open and a group of Umbrella scientists take him. He is then put into the \\"Nemesis Program\\". In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Matt has been transformed into the mutation \\"Nemesis T-Type\\", programmed to eradicate all remaining STARS operatives. He tracks Alice down and they are forced to fight to the death. Alice realizes Nemesis is Matt and refuses to kill him. Nemesis joins forces with Alice and they defend themselves from a helicopter, sent by the Umbrella forces to kill them. However, in the ensuing battle, Nemesis (Matt) is crushed by wreckage and presumed dead. If he survived, he was killed when a nuclear weapon destroyed the city. K-Mart K-Mart (played by Spencer Locke) is a young woman in Claire Redfield's convoy. In Resident Evil: Extinction, K-Mart explains that she changed her name after Claire and the others had found her in a Kmart store. She states she did not like her name and decided to change it because all those she knew from before the outbreak were dead. In the film's original script, K-Mart's real name is Elizabeth Jane Case. In the novelisation of the film, Carlos reveals that her original name was Dahlia. K-Mart and Claire are close and Locke has said her character sees Claire as an older sister. K-Mart is close with Mikey, and even more so with Carlos; in the novelisation of the film and in a scene that was deleted from the film, it is stated she has a crush on him. K-Mart also bonds with Alice; she stays with Alice and gives her a bracelet when Alice passes out from using her powers to save the convoy. Locke has said that K-Mart \\"definitely look[s] up to Alice in this movie a lot.\\" K-Mart survives through most of the film by hiding in the vehicles, although she does kill a few zombies. In a zombie attack, she is nearly killed by L.J. who has turned into a zombie himself, but Carlos saves her. At the end, she is one of the few who have survived long enough to depart in a helicopter headed for Alaska, piloted by Claire. In Resident Evil: Afterlife, K-Mart has been captured by the Umbrella Corporation to be experimented upon. She is rescued by Alice, Claire and Chris Redfield, but is at first too addled to do anything. She later aids Alice in battle, knocking out Bennett and tossing Alice her shotgun, allowing Alice to (temporarily) defeat Wesker with a shot to the head. She is later seen standing on deck with the other survivors when Umbrella commandos attack the ship, her whereabouts are unknown. Becky Becky (played by Aryana Engineer) is a clone of a young deaf girl, residing in the \\"Suburban Raccoon City\\" environment of the Umbrella Prime facility. In Resident Evil: Retribution, she is first introduced as the deaf \\"daughter\\" of a clone of Alice and her \\"husband\\" Todd, a clone of Carlos Olivera. During a \\"bio hazard\\" test, Becky lost her father, while her mother hid her; unknown to Becky, the Alice clone was killed by the zombified Todd. When the real Alice arrives with Ada Wong, Becky mistakes Alice for her mother; Alice decides to take Becky along despite Ada's objections. Mostly unknowing of the truth about her existence, Becky followed Alice and her comrades. When an Uber-Licker kidnapped her, Becky was rescued by Alice; however, they unfortunately had to escape through the clone storage room. Partly realising the truth, Becky asked Alice if she was her mother; Alice responded that she was now. They were rescued and taken with Ada, Leon, and Jill to Washington DC, where the last of humanity had established their base in the White House. She is presumably killed along with everyone but Alice when Wesker betrays the survivors and destroys the White House. Red Queen The Red Queen (played by Michaela Dicker, Megan Charpentier, Ave Merson-O'Brian and Ever Gabo Anderson) is a character of the Resident Evil film series. The Red Queen was created by the director Paul W. S. Anderson as a homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL 9000. She appears as the main antagonist in the first film, an antagonist in the fifth film, and returns in the sixth film as a supporting character. In Resident Evil, the Red Queen's holographic avatar was modeled on the daughter of Umbrella's head programmer. She monitors the Hive and the Spencer Mansion above. When the T-Virus was released, she sealed the exits and killed the Umbrella employees; she also released a gas that left Alice out cold with amnesia. When an Umbrella U.B.C.S. commando team is sent to investigate, she kills most of them with her defense systems. She warns against entering the Hive, but they shut her down. She is later forced to help the survivors find a way out, since her main circuit breakers were disabled to prevent rebooting. As the Anti-Virus has slimmer chance of working the longer one is infected, she demands Rain be killed; however, she is then shut down by Kaplan. In an early draft of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Angie, the daughter of T-Virus' creator Dr. Charles Ashford, was to be revealed as the girl on whose appearance the Red Queen was based, and her father as the person that build the supercomputer that houses her. When the filmmakers realized they would need a large amount of flashback footage from the previous film to explain the connection to those in the audience that had not seen it, they decided to drop the idea, removing it from the canon. Nevertheless, some people have made the connection due to Angie's appearance and accent strongly evoking the Red Queen. The novelization of Resident Evil: Extinction also explicitly states the connection. In Resident Evil: Extinction, Alice encounters the White Queen, a sister artificial intelligence to the Red Queen, who similarly looks like a young girl, but dressed in white. The White Queen justifies her sister's actions, as the most logical path to contain the viral outbreak inside The Hive, from spreading. Nevertheless, she had decided to assist Alice by attempting to synthesis a cure to the outbreak after revealing her DNA to be potentially able to counteract the T-Virus. The Red Queen makes a reappearance in Resident Evil: Retribution, portrayed by child actress Megan Charpentier with another actress, Ave Merson-O'Brian, providing her voice. After the Raccoon City incident, she was reactivated and placed in control over Umbrella Prime, an underground laboratory in Kamchatka. By the time Retribution begins, she has assumed control over Umbrella itself and is waging war against the human race, including Wesker, using various bioweapons. The Red Queen reappears in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, this time portrayed by Ever Gabo Anderson, the real daughter of Milla Jovovich (Alice) and Paul W. S. Anderson, the film's writer/director. In The Final Chapter, the Red Queen contacts Alice to warn her that the last human settlement will be destroyed in 48 hours. The Red Queen directs Alice back into the Hive to find a potent antivirus that will kill everything infected with the T-virus upon contact. The Red Queen is revealed to have been created based upon Alicia Marcus, the daughter of Umbrella co-founder James Marcus (with Ever Gabo portraying young Alicia in flashback footage). The Red Queen is willing to aid Alice as she has been programmed to protect human life, but is also unable to directly harm Umbrella forces due to another directive in her programming. During the final battle in the Hive, the Red Queen is able to aid Alice by dropping a blast door on Wesker after the adult Alicia Marcus (played by Jovovich, as all Alices are clones of Alicia) fires him. The Red Queen is later shut down by Doctor Isaacs, but first she taunts \\"Doctor Alexander Isaacs and the Umbrella High Command. You are all going to die down here\\", echoing her words to Alice and the soldiers in the first movie. When Isaacs is killed, the Red Queen reactivates herself and recalls the Umbrella forces sent to destroy the last human settlement, saving humanity. After the Hive is destroyed and the antivirus released, the Red Queen is revealed to have survived the Hive's destruction when she contacts Alice and explains how Alice survived the antivirus. The Red Queen then displays Alicia Marcus' childhood memories for Alice, memories that Alicia had uploaded into the AI so that Alice would have them as well. Although the character originated in the films, the Red Queen also appears in the 2007 game Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, voiced by Tara Platt. Her character appears as a database computer which provides information relating to the Arklay Incident and T-virus development. In the game's chapter \\"The Umbrella's End\\", the T-A.L.O.S. (Tyrant Armored Lethal Organic System) is monitored and controlled by the Red Queen. In the game, the Red Queen AI is self-aware and can take these measures based on its own judgment.

Lloyd Jefferson ‚ÄúLJ‚Äù Wade  Lloyd Jefferson \\"LJ\\" Wade (portrayed by Mike Epps) is a main character and protagonist appearing in Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction. When the zombie outbreak begins in Raccoon City in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, LJ is handcuffed in the police station next to a zombified prostitute. He is saved when Jill Valentine arrives and kills all of the zombies in the police station and free LJ, ordering him to flee the city. While driving through the city later, LJ becomes distracted by another zombified prostitute and crashes his car. He links up with S.T.A.R.S., but becomes the only survivor when Nemesis slaughters everyone in the building. At first, Nemesis focuses his fire on the officers and then ignores LJ as an unarmed threat after he disarms himself. LJ is contacted by Charles Ashford and joins the effort to rescue Angela Ashford. During the final battle at City Hall, LJ hijacks the Umbrella helicopter and knocks Major Timothy Cain unconscious when he tries to escape. LJ survives the helicopter crash and helps to rescue Alice from an Umbrella facility at the end of the movie. In Resident Evil: Extinction, five years after the beginning of the zombie apocalypse, LJ is a member of Claire Redfield's convoy alongside Carlos and had developed a relationship with convoy nurse Betty. While investigating a deserted motel, LJ kills two zombies, but not before he gets bitten by one. LJ hides his infection from everyone else and helps Betty saved the convoy's children when they come under attack by zombified crows. The convoy is saved by the sudden appearance of Alice, but Betty is killed, devastating LJ. As the convoy moves towards the ruins of Las Vegas for supplies, LJ's condition begins rapidly deteriorating, though he continues to hide the truth from his friends. During the Super Undead attack, LJ manages to kill two before running out of ammunition and being forced to hide in a truck with K-Mart. When a Super Undead attacks the truck, LJ's condition has deteriorated so much that K-Mart is forced to kill the zombie herself with a shotgun in the truck. Unnoticed by K-Mart, LJ dies shortly afterwards and reanimates. As he tries to attack K-Mart, LJ is pulled from the truck by Carlos whom he bites. Devastated by his zombified friend's state, Carlos kills the undead LJ with a shot to the head, but is left fatally infected by the T-virus, leading to his later sacrifice to clear a path for the convoy survivors.  Major Timothy Cain  A high-ranking member of the Umbrella Corporation's military, the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasures Services, or U.B.C.S., Cain is placed in charge of the quarantine of Raccoon City when word of the Hive being reopened and the infected within escaping reaches Umbrella, guarding the Raven's Gate Bridge that serves as the only means out of the city for the uninfected civilian population. When one man at the checkpoint drops dead of a heart attack and reanimates as a T-virus infected zombie, Cain is forced to seal the exit and send everyone back into the city to their doom with a show of force by having his men fire their weapons into the air to intimidate them. Cain later has Alice and Matt Addison, now the Nemesis, awoken to face each other in battle, and upon learning of Dr. Charles Ashford trying to help Alice and the other survivors escape Raccoon City before Umbrella destroys it with a tactical nuclear bomb to cover up their mistakes, captures Ashford and confronts the group on the roof of the Raccoon City Hall, forcing Alice into fighting the Nemesis by killing Ashford and threatening to do the same to his daughter Angela, L.J., Carlos, and Jill if Alice still refuses. Though Alice is able to defeat Nemesis, she refuses to kill him upon realizing he's Matt. Cain tries to have Nemesis kill Alice instead, but Nemesis, having regained his memories, turns on Cain and takes out his Umbrella troops, before sacrificing himself to take out the Umbrella attack helicopters with his Stinger, being crushed by the resulting debris. Cain tries to escape on the transport helicopter that was to be Alice and the others' way out of the city, but Alice, infuriated by Cain's actions, throws him out of the helicopter after it starts to take off, causing him to break his leg when he lands back on the roof. Surrounded by the zombie horde, Cain tries to fight them off with a discarded pistol, but realizing his fate, turns the gun on himself to commit suicide, but finds that he's out of bullets. In an ironic twist, the first zombie to reach and bite him was the reanimated Dr. Ashford. Cain is vaporized with the zombie horde when the tactical nuke detonates over Raccoon City Hall and obliterates the city.  Charles Ashford  A high-ranking scientist with Umbrella, Ashford is evacuated out of Raccoon City when word of the Hive being reopened and the infected within escaping forces Umbrella to pull all their employees in Raccoon City out of the area before establishing their quarantine perimeter. Although Ashford is safely evacuated, his daughter Angela, who was pulled out of her class at Raccoon City Elementary, doesn't make the rendezvous when her evacuation vehicle is struck by a tanker truck driven by a T-virus infected driver, killing the Umbrella security personnel sent to retrieve her, while she escapes and retreats back to her school, remaining there as the virus infects her teachers, classmates, and other residents of the city, including a set of R.P.D. K-9 police dogs when the school was properly evacuated by the R.P.D. after suggestion from former S.T.A.R.S. officer Jill Valentine. Fearing for his daughter's safety, Ashford is able to hack into Raccoon City's CCTV system, and contacting Alice and other survivors, such as Jill, L.J., and members of the U.B.C.S., like Carlos, he offers them a way out of the city before Umbrella has it nuked to cover up their actions in return for the rescue and return of his daughter. Though Angela is safely recovered, Ashford's actions are discovered by Major Cain, and he is taken hostage as Cain confronts the escapees at the rendezvous point at Raccoon City Hall. When Alice refuses to fight Nemesis under Cain's orders, Ashford is mercilessly executed by Cain as a show of force to get her to fight Nemesis, with Cain threatening to kill Angela, Jill, Carlos, and L.J. next if she continues to resist. After Cain is left to fend for himself by Alice while she and the other survivors escape before the city is nuked, Ashford gets his revenge for Cain killing him when the T-virus reanimates him as a zombie, and he is the first to reach Cain and begins to devour him before the rest of the horde join him and they are all vaporized when the nuke detonates over Raccoon City Hall.  Alexander Isaacs  Doctor Alexander Roland Isaacs (played by Iain Glen) is the main antagonist of the Resident Evil series, though this is not known until Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. One of the two founders of the Umbrella Corporation, Isaacs was the true mastermind behind the release of the T-virus as revealed in The Final Chapter, planning to wipe the world clean of humanity and repopulate it with the Umbrella elite kept in cryogenic stasis in the Hive beneath Raccoon City. Isaacs murdered his partner Doctor James Marcus and raised Marcus' daughter Alicia who inherited her father's half of the company, allowing him to control it and her. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Isaacs, later revealed to be a clone, experiments upon Alice and Matt Addison in flashbacks, transforming Matt in the Nemesis. He later revives Alice after she dies in a helicopter crash following the destruction of Raccoon City and enhances her powers. When Alice escapes the facility, Isaacs lets her go and activates \\"Program: Alice.\\" Five years later in Resident Evil: Extinction, Isaacs hunts for Alice in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of North America while performing experiments using Alice's blood and clones of her in an attempt to find a cure for the T-virus. Isaacs' experiments create the Super Undead which he unleashes upon Claire Redfield's convoy in the ruins of Las Vegas while trying to simultaneously capture Alice. After his efforts fail, Isaacs flees back to base, but not before getting bitten by a Super Undead. Despite taking massive quantities of the anti-virus, Isaacs mutates into a creature with near-invulnerability and telekinetic abilities that surpass Alice's own. Isaacs slaughters the Umbrella staff and battles Alice through the recreation of the Hive. In a final confrontation in the Laser Corridor, Isaacs is destroyed when an Alice clone takes control of the laser grid and uses it to slice him to pieces. This particular clone appeared to be more of an employee of the company, working as virologist and subservient to Albert Wesker, closer in nature to the clones of Alice's allies used as shock troopers in Resident Evil: Retribution than the clone that would later appear in The Final Chapter. In The Final Chapter, after being captured by an Umbrella convoy leading an army of Undead to Raccoon City, Alice is shocked to find it commanded by Isaacs, having thought him dead years before. Isaacs uses human captives dragged behind the tank to lure the Undead to follow him. Alice quickly realizes that the Isaacs she previously fought was just a clone with Isaacs telling her that he was awoken from stasis to finish leading the destruction of humanity. Alice eventually manages to escape, chopping off Isaacs' hand in the process. Isaacs leads his army against the last human settlement in the ruins of Raccoon City, but Alice commands an effective defense, destroying the army and Isaacs commandos. Isaacs himself manages to escape, and takes command of another Umbrella army, slaughtering a tank crew and leading the army into the crater leading to the Hive in an effort to stop Alice once and for all. In the Hive, Alice encounters another Isaacs, awoken by Wesker, who reveals himself to be the real Alexander Isaacs and the one Alice encounter in the convoy to be a clone who was unaware of his true nature. The real Isaacs has technological upgrades that give him an advantage against Alice, predicting her every move. Isaacs reveals Alice's own true nature as a clone of Alicia Marcus and his plan to kill both Alice and Alicia which will give him full control of Umbrella. Alicia uses her fifty percent control of Umbrella to fire Wesker, allowing the Red Queen, allied with Alice, to crush Wesker's legs with a door. Isaacs flees with the anti-virus that can stop the T-virus once and for all and shuts the Red Queen down so that she can't help Alice anymore. Isaacs proves to be more than a match for both Alice and Claire Redfield, slicing off three of Alice's fingers in the Laser Corridor, but being apparently defeated when she places an activated grenade in his pocket at the same time. Isaacs life support system revives him in time to stop Alice from releasing the anti-virus, but he is then confronted by his clone. In an ironic twist, Isaacs is stabbed to death by his own clone when the clone can't accept that he isn't the real Isaacs, a piece of programing in the clones that Isaacs had earlier found amusing. The Isaacs clone is killed by his own Undead army, allowing Alice to retrieve and release the anti-virus as the Hive is destroyed by explosives she planted. The destruction of the Hive and the Umbrella elite within cements the end of Umbrella and Isaacs plan while the Red Queen is able to reactivate herself once Isaacs is dead and call off the Umbrella attack on the remaining human settlements.  James Shade/One  James Shade was a soldier in charge for collecting Alice from the Hive. He was killed when a laser sliced him into pieces. He later reappeared in Resident Evil: Retribution as a clone trooper loyal to Umbrella. Near the end of the movie, he shot dead by one of Alice's allies, Barry, who is then killed by Shade's own allies.

This network of partners works together to connect lands and people from Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada to the Adirondacks in New York State.Map of the A2A Region, drawn by Ken Buchan, 2014. http://www.a2acollaborative.org/uploads/7/6/8/5/7685208/1904164_orig.jpg?330 The Algonquin to Adirondacks region represents a critical link for biodiversity and resilience in North America.  History  In the 1990s, the Ottawa Valley chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society convened a committee to discuss a landscape conservation effort to ensure ecological connectivity and help restore biodiversity from Algonquin Park to the Adirondacks, along the Frontenac Arch. The Algonquin to Adirondacks (A2A) Conservation Association (now Collaborative) was incorporated in 2002 to enhance habitat connectivity and maintain native biodiversity in the region. The organization is similar to its sister conservation corridor in western North America, the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, and Two Countries, One Forest (a project of the Wildlife Conservation Society), in conducting landscape conservation work across international boundaries. In the first decade (2002-2012) the A2A Conservation Association worked to support partner organizations, and conduct projects with their help, on the Canadian side of the Thousand Islands region of the St. Lawrence River. This area was strategic because it is the pinch point of the A2A Region and the communities on the Canadian side were very engaged in conservation efforts. Projects included water quality analyses, shoreline analyses, and creating resources for landowners. During two visioning workshops in 2012, partners identified the need for the A2A Conservation Association to be reimagined as a Collaborative. This led to a change in name and organizational structure. In response to the notable lack of American representation, partners also called for the A2A Collaborative to better embody its name by becoming a less local and more regional initiative with more American representation. Concerted outreach led to new American partners and American members of the Board of Directors. In 2014, the A2A Collaborative received capacity-building support from the Ontario Trillium Foundation to hire a full-time coordinator and hold partner events. The inaugural A2A Collaborative Partner Meeting in Brockville, Ontario, March 29‚Äì30, 2014, saw 42 participants representing 31 different organizations across the A2A Region.  Biodiversity  Mammals: In the A2A Region there are an estimated 54 species, including wolf, marten, lynx, moose, black bear, ermine, fisher, and grey fox, which is considered threatened. Birds: More than 165 confirmed species of breeding birds in the region ‚Äî eight vulnerable species and two endangered. As a result, 60% of the area falls into the highest possible class for number of species (>104 species/100 km2). Reptiles: 17 species, five of which are uncommon. Plants: 81 rare species, including sedges, orchids, cacti, legumes, asters, gentians, ferns, and half of Canada's remaining population of wild ginseng.  Vision  The A2A Collaborative's vision is of \\"an A2A region comprising a resilient, ecologically interconnected landscape that sustains a full range of native wildlife and enhances people's quality of life for generations to come.\\"  Recognition  In 2004, the A2A Collaborative was recognized by the North American Native Plant Society, with the Paul McGaw Memorial Conservation Award, for its efforts to maintain and restore the natural connectivity for flora and fauna. In 2010, the A2A Collaborative was recognized by Ontario Nature, with the Steve Hounsell Greenway Award, for its major contributions toward the Greenway vision.  Challenges  * Reducing habitat fragmentation * Fostering landowner enthusiasm and commitment * Sustaining organizational capacity * Shifting from a local focus to a more regional perspective * Making concrete progress toward the vision  Projects  Connectivity Analysis: In partnership with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, and supported by the McLean Foundation, the A2A Collaborative is currently conducting a connectivity analysis of the A2A Region to help prioritize conservation efforts. Examples of such efforts include land trust purchases or conservation easements, species-at-risk programs, and landowner education. Highway 401 Wildlife Crossings: In partnership with the Ontario Road Ecology Group, and supported by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources's Species At Risk Fund, the A2A Collaborative is identifying the most important areas for wildlife crossings to be built or enhanced. This work is being done along highway 401 between Gananoque and Mallorytown, where the parallel St. Lawrence River is narrow and north-south migration is most feasible. A2A Trail: A new project to build a hiking trail from Algonquin to Adirondacks parks with the goals of fostering an identity for the region, recreational possibilities, increased human well-being, and local economic activity.

Description  The 9700 was intended for high-volume applications. It included a disk drive and a modified Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11/34 as a print controller and rasterizer. It could connect to an IBM mainframe via a parallel channel. It offered an input bin that could hold up to 2500 sheets of paper (20lb bond/75gsm) and an auxiliary input bin for an additional 400 sheets. It had two output stackers, each capable of holding 1500 sheets. An operator control console consisted of a CRT display terminal and keyboard. It optionally included a 9 track tape drive which could be used to load documents for printing, to supply software and bitmapped fonts, or run backups. Historic importance In 1980, Richard Stallman and some other hackers at the MIT AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly installed Xerox 9700. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's need to be able to freely modify the software they use, thus the launch of the Free Software movement. Chapter 1.

Due to its obscurity, it remains one of the rarest films to this day, most likely due to lack of promotion, and the fact that this film was primarily produced in Mexico, as it is difficult for a Mexican animated production to get into the United States market, according to producer Fernando de Fuentes.

In fact, Cede is actually a New York City-based partnership of certain employees of DTC.Senate Report. Disclosure of Corporate Ownership. December 27, 1973. Cede is a separate legal person from Depository Trust Company, which is owned by DTC Participants, who are banks and brokerage houses, and not employees of DTC. One reason Cede is structured as a partnership is that each general partner can order transfers of stock registered in the name of the partnership without the need of presenting a separate corporate resolution to the stock issuer's transfer agent or stock registrar to validate the authority of the transfer.

He is known for his notable education and training of neurosurgeons, his many recognition awards, and for his editorship of Surgical Neurology ‚Äî An International Journal of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience from 1987 to 1994. Early life and education He was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. His mother was a Canadian graduate nurse, and his father a prominent surgeon. In fact, Alexander came from a distinguished family of scholars that spans several generations. His paternal grandfather Eben Alexander was a diplomat, scholar, and a professor of Greek at the University of North Carolina as well as U.S. Minister to Greece 1892-1896. Alexander's adopted son, Eben Alexander III followed his father's footsteps as an academic neurosurgeon, and wrote the book, Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife (2012). Alexander trained in surgery at the Peter Bent Brigham hospital during 1939-42, joining the U.S. Air Force in 1942. During his military service, Alexander transferred to the ground forces, went overseas to New Guinea, the Philippines, and Japan and was awarded the Bronze Star for action in Mindanao, the Philippines. Following his service in the Army Medical Corps, he continued his training in Boston at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, The Children's Hospital, and as a research fellow at Harvard, then at Toronto General Hospital and Yale University School of Medicine, before joining the Wake Forest faculty in 1949. Career Alexander joined the academic faculty at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in 1949 and became Professor and Chief of Neurosurgery. He was Chief of Staff of the North Carolina Baptist Hospital from 1953‚Äì73 and also Chairman of Wake Forest Baptist Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, 1953-1973. He retired as Chief of service in 1978, and became Emeritus in 1983. Nevertheless, he remained active in his profession, serving as editor of the prominent journal, Surgical Neurology 1986-1994 and Associate Editor of the North Carolina Medical Journal 1986-2004. Alexander was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from both the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Society of Neurological Surgeons (SNS) in 1989. He was also awarded Wake Forest's highest honor, the University's Medallion of Merit in 1990. He had also received his Local Hadassah Humanitarian Award 1958. He served as president of both The Society of Neurological Surgeons (SNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), from which he received the Association's highest award, the Cushing Award for Outstanding Service, in 1984. His contribution to the fields of neurology and neurosurgery include over 200 publications with interests ranging from pediatric neurosurgery to cervical spine (vertebral column) disease, fractures of the spine, brain tumor research and congenital anomalies.

Plot Paolo Torregiani is a night watchman who has been working in Lucca for twenty years in a security agency. After a violent argument with his colleague Alcide, he tries to make peace but he finds him in a puddle of blood, hit by a bullet in the abdomen, inside a shoe factory where he was guarding. It is a place that Paolo knows well because Oscar, the owner, lives in the same complex with his Russian wife Nadia. Since Daria left him, Paolo began to invade Nadia and spend part of the night next to her windows. That night, by chance, Paul can talk to her, as she accompanies her to search for the husband who is not aware of the incident. Nadia is upset: she tells Paolo a confused story, tells of a brother, Dimitri, to whom she would hide her new life in Italy including the wedding with Oscar. Dimitri spent a few years in jail and now seems to be coming to Italy, perhaps upset to have been kept unaware. Nadia does not dare to reveal this story to Oscar and fears that Dimitri may be involved in the events of that night; then she asks Paolo to protect her and keep Dimitri under control in case she meets him. From that moment on, Paolo starts to split between the episode about his colleague and this 'assignment' that allows him to stay close to the woman he wants. The events lead him to discover that Dimitri is not the brother but Nadia's lover. Gettin in the house of Russo, a colleague, Paul realizes that he has a standard of living above normal, and then the truth emerges: Russo, Oscar and another nightwatchman were in collusion, Alcide blackmailed Russo who killed him.

The film documents three rock bands‚ÄîCocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and My Bloody Valentine‚Äîand their influence on shoegazing and other alternative rock genres. Beautiful Noise features extracts from over 50 interviews with bands and artists, as well as archival footage and music videos. Green commenced production on Beautiful Noise in early 2005 with producer and editor Sarah Ogletree; production was largely completed by 2008 although the project stagnated due to various financial and legal issues. In response, Green began a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in hopes of securing final financial investment for the film's release. The campaign was supported by several of the bands featured in Beautiful Noise through social media. Beautiful Noise was announced for release in May 2014 and premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival in Seattle, Washington on May 31, 2014. Overview Beautiful Noise documents the underground music movement in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focusing in particular on the Scottish ethereal/dream pop band Cocteau Twins, Scottish noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain and the Irish alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine. The film explores \\"how their groundbreaking music inspired generations of bands\\", including shoegazing artists Ride, Slowdive, Chapterhouse, and Lush. Beautiful Noise features extracts from over 50 interviews with members of various bands, as well as \\"special appearances\\" from The Flaming Lips vocalist‚Äìguitarist Wayne Coyne, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins and Robert Smith of The Cure. In addition to interviews, Beautiful Noise includes never-before-seen footage, television appearances, music videos and tour projections of the film's featured bands. The film also \\"highlights new bands influenced by [shoegazing]\\", such as A Place to Bury Strangers, Wild Nothing and M83. Production Beautiful Noise was written and directed by Eric Green, produced and edited by Sarah Ogletree and presented by their studio company HypFilms. Green conceived the idea for the project in late 2004 after concluding that there were \\"a million documentaries about the Beatles, punk [and] rap\\" but no similar documentaries about bands he was a \\"longtime fan\\" of. Pre-production of Beautiful Noise began in early 2005 and by March, Green and Ogletree had commenced production on the film. Green's interviews with the film's featured cast \\"spanned over several years\\". In 2007, an email was leaked to a journalist about Beautiful Noise. Several prominent publications, including The Guardian, NPR and Pitchfork Media reported on the film and \\"inspired a wider of level of interest\\" from the public. As a result, Green and Ogletree began a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to raise finances to cover licensing of the music featured in the film, as well as clearances and distribution. Green hoped to raise $75,000 on Kickstarter and the campaign was supported by various artists raising awareness via social media. The project was successfully funded on December 16, 2012 and a further $9,740 was pledged after a total of 1,511 users contributed. During early stages of production, from 2005 to 2007, Ogletree edited various versions of Beautiful Noise from rough scripts provided by Green. Multiple edits of the film featured archival footage with \\"personally custom designed art\\" which was the result of collaborations with artist Angus Cameron. Medicine founder Brad Laner also contributed a musical score to the film. Following public awareness of the film after the 2007 email leak, John Nugent and Timothy O'Donnell contributed further artwork to the film, presented alongside Cameron's additions. A final edit of Beautiful Noise was completed by Ogletree after Green's successful campaign on Kickstarter. Release Beautiful Noise was originally set for release in 2008. Green and Ogletree attempted to find a distributor, however several factors‚Äîincluding the expense of music clearance and licensing, the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and the general decline in DVD sales‚Äîprompted \\"an ever-elusive\\" release date. Upon starting the campaign on Kickstarter, Green mentioned an estimated release date in 2013, although delays in licensing affected the appraisal. Beautiful Noise was subsequently announced for release in May 2014; the film premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival in Seattle, Washington on May 31 and the international premiere was held at the Sheffield Doc/Fest in Sheffield, England on June 8.

Overview Traditional basketball statistics analyze individuals independently of their teammates or competitors and traditional player positions are determined by individual attributes. In contrast, these network based analytics are obtained by constructing a team or league level player networks, where individual players are nodes connected by the ball movement or by some measure of similarity. Then the metrics are obtained by calculating network properties, such as degree, density, centrality, clustering, distance etc. This approach enriches the analysis of basketball with new individual and team level statistics and offers a new way of assigning position to a player. Team level statistics The biggest contribution to the team level metrics came from Arizona State University researchers led by Jennifer H. Fewell. Using 2010 NBA first round playoff data, they constructed the networks for each team using players as nodes and ball movement between them as links. They distinguish the trade-off between not necessarily mutually exclusive division of labor and team\`s unpredictability that are measured by Uphill downhill flux and Team entropy respectively. Team entropy - a measure of unpredictability and variation in teams offense, higher entropy meaning more variation. It is calculated as aggregated individual Shannon entropies, where unpredictability is measured as uncertainty of the ball movement between any two nodes.Fewell J.H., Armbruster D, Ingraham J, Petersen A, Waters JS (2012) Basketball Teams as Strategic Networks. PLoS ONE 7(11): e47445. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047445 http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0047445 Uphill downhill flux - measures the division of labor, or the expertize in moving the ball to the player with the best shooting percentage. According to Fewell et al. It can be interpreted as an average change in potential shooting percentage per pass. The metric is calculated as a sum of the differences between the shooting percentages of the nodes at the ends of each edge : F = \\\\sum_{i eq j} p_{ij} \\\\ (x_i - x_j) , where p ij is the probability of the link between players i and j, xi and xj are their shooting percentages. Other measures include Team clustering coefficient - a direct application of a clustering coefficient. It measures how interconnected are the players, whether the ball moves via one node or whether in many ways between all the players. Team degree centrality - similarly to the previous metric, it measures if there is one dominant player in the team. It is calculated by the formula C_D = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in V} \\\\frac{deg(v^*) - deg(v)} {\\\\mid V \\\\mid - 1} where deg(v) is the degree of the node v, deg(v*) is the highest degree node, V is the number of nodes. Combined low clustering and high degree centrality mean that the defense can put double team on the dominant player, since without him ball team experiences problems in moving the ball. Average path length - number of passes per play. Path flow rate - number of passes per unit time. It measures how quickly the team moves the ball. Deviation from maximum operating potential - using players as the nodes and ball movement and links and true shooting percentage as efficiency, analogy can by made to the traffic network. Each individual is assumed to have a skill curve f(x), which is declining in the number shots taken. Individual maximization of the efficiency yield f(x_1)=f(x_2)...=f(x_i) whereas to maximum efficiency is achieved by solving \\\\frac {dF}{dx_1} = \\\\frac {dF}{dx_2}... =\\\\frac {dF}{dx_i} , where F = x_1f(x_1) + x_2f(x_2)...+x_3f(x_3) The difference between these two constitute the teams deviation from the maximum potential.Brian Skinner (2011) The Price of Anarchy in Basketball, Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports 6(1), 3 (2010), https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1801v4 Individual statistics Success/Failure Ratio - the number of times the player (node) was involved in the successful play divided by the number of times the player was involved in the unsuccessful play. The metric is obtained from the team play by play network. Under/over performance - the metric is calculated by mapping the bipartite player network. Players are connected if they were a part of one team. The links are weighted by how successful was the team, where the players played together. Then node centrality measures are compared to the reference centrality distributions for each node obtained by bootstrap - based randomization procedures and p - values are calculated. For example p - value of player i is given by : p_i = \\\\frac {\\\\sum_{k=1}^J (I\\\\pi_{i^*k} \\\\ge \\\\pi_i^0)}{J} , where œÄi* is the reference centrality score, œÄi0 is the calculated centrality score, J - number of iterations. High p - values indicate under-performance, low - over-performance.Piette, J, Pham, L. and Anand, S.

Then based on node clusters players were grouped into 13 positions.Jeff Beckham \\"Analytics Reveal 13 New Basketball\\" Positions, \\"https://www.wired.com\\" 04.30.2012 Offensive Ball-Handler Player that specializes in scoring and ball handling, but has low averages of steals and blocks.

Bouv√© is based out of the Behrakis Health Sciences Center on Northeastern's Boston campus. The college offers four undergraduate programs and over 34 graduate programs, including its online-based accelerated nursing program. The current dean of Bouv√© is Carmen C. Sceppa. Present day = Curriculum = The Bouv√© College of Health Sciences contains 4 undergraduate programs and over 34 graduate programs within its 3 schools: Health Professions, Nursing, and Pharmacy. According to Bouve's own learning outcomes, graduates of the program apply knowledge of the basic sciences, understand and analyze the US healthcare system, apply research methods and analytic strategies, communicate health information effectively and appropriately, appreciate the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in population health, and utilize global perspectives. The mission statement as a College of Health Sciences is to represent the center of excellence in health professional education, research, and service, and emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of today's team approach to healthcare. The structure of the college fosters cross-disciplinary interaction among faculty and students, encourages innovation in the education of both entry level and advanced practice health professionals, and recognizes the autonomy of each profession. The Bouv√© College partners with health care delivery systems and the community to give students and faculty access to practice sites that prepare graduates to meet the health care needs of their urban neighbors and society. The college has an accelerated Bachelor/Graduate Degree Program which includes a PlusOne Bachelor's/Master's degree program. This allows students to accelerate the process of completing their master's degree by implementing graduate credit courses, which contribute to both the undergraduate and graduate degree. The accelerated program includes the following programs: BS in Health Science & MPH (Master of Public Health Science), PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) & MPH, and BS in Psychology & MS in Applied Behavior Analysis. Bouv√© has a variety of research opportunities to give students a chance to actively participate in the field, labs, and clinical settings starting from as early as their first year. Presently, the college has nine research labs, including a robot and gait assisted rehab lab, neuro-physical therapy lab, and cancer survivor-ship center. Bouv√© research ranges from studies at the cellular level to the global systems that impact health across communities. The Arnold S. Goldstein Simulation Laboratory is intended for students to apply immersive, hands-on experiential training across all disciplines. Using video capture technology, simulation bays, debriefing rooms, and high-tech patient simulators, students translate theoretical concepts to real skills, working with ‚Äòpatients‚Äô or actors. = Ranking = Based on US News college rankings from 2018 to 2019, Bouv√© College of Health Sciences was ranked #20 in Best Physician Assistant Programs, #33 in Best Pharmacy Schools, #40 in Best Physical Therapy Schools, and #50 in Best Nursing Schools within the Graduate Level Schools. = Administrator = Carmen Sceppa is currently the dean of the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences at Northeastern University. Sceppa, who has served as the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs since 2018, is a physician and scientist, having published more than 75 scholarly articles focused largely on healthy aging. = Student life = There are approximately 4,000 students, 220 faculty and staff, and 40,000 alumni in the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences. In accordance with Northeastern University's emphasis on globally minded students, more than 380 Bouv√© students had global learning experiences in 32 countries in 2017. History Bouv√© as an institution began originally as a separate school in 1925 with the goal of providing a curriculum in physical education. Its founder, Marjorie Bouv√©, created the school after resigning from her post at the Boston School of Physical Education in 1925. While the school succeeded in increasing enrollment in its beginning years, it was hamstrung by its lack of accreditation to grant four- year degrees. Marjori√© petitioned the Massachusetts Board of Education in 1929 to authorize the school as a degree-granting institution but was unsuccessful in her efforts. Due to decreased enrollment and reduced tuition revenues during the years of the Great Depression, the Boston School of Physical Education proposed a merging of the two schools. Marjorie accepted the proposal and also chose to affiliate the renamed Bouv√©-Boston School of Physical Education with Simmons College. The agreement allowed the newly formed school to provide three-year degrees focusing on physical therapy or physical education, or a four-year Bachelor of Science degree through Simmons. This relationship with Simmons continued until 1949. Marjorie also formed another agreement with Tufts College in 1942 which allowed graduates from Bouv√© to pursue further education at Tufts through its Division of University Extension. At this point, Ruth Page Sweet, a former graduate of Boston University, had taken on the role of Director for Bouv√©-Boston. Another shift occurred around a decade later. In October 1960, the Trustees of Tufts College approved the proposal to grant the Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy degree. Tufts President Nils Y. Wessell decided in 1962 that the university should re-evaluate the practice of allowing strictly professional degrees. It was decided that the university as a whole would place an emphasis on liberal arts education, with a focus on professional experience only as electives and an optional fifth year of study. In addition to this, Nils believed that students of the affiliates in the Bouv√©-Boston School should be required to meet the bachelor's degree requirements met by students enrolled in other colleges within the university. These changes ran against Bouv√©-Boston's focus on professional training throughout the students' four years of schooling, and Tufts was unwilling to accept alternate proposals offered by Bouv√©-Boston administrators. The affiliates at Bouv√©-Boston were faced with a choice: accept these changes and continue a partnership with Tufts, or disaffiliate. Ultimately Bouv√©-Boston School leaders were unable to resolve their differences and chose to disaffiliate. In 1965, Bouv√©-Boston School joined Northeastern University as an on-campus college. = Boston School of Physical Education = The Boston School of Physical Education was founded with the stated intention of training young women in the principles of self-comportment and as a platform for advocacy of the importance of physical education for societal well-being. The development of physiotherapy curriculum, which revolved around the study of Biology and Anatomy in their earliest forms, expanded the scope of the school. Leaders and students promoted the school's offerings through common publication venues and regional mailing campaigns. Open to students from surrounding colleges and universities as well as the general public, demonstrations gave physical therapy students the opportunity to practice treatment interventions and physical education students to practice the teaching of sports or games. When the Boston School of Physical Education first opened their doors, the school only granted a diploma in physical education. With students returning from service as reconstruction aides in WWI, physiotherapy courses quickly became an optional component of many school curriculums, including at Boston School of Physical Education. Although physiotherapy did not become a separate course of study until the 1950s, students increasingly enrolled at Bouv√©-Boston because of its reputation as a leader in the movement to professionalize the discipline. In the 1960s, Bouv√©-Boston implemented another new major in recreation education, which trained students to guide people of all ages through relaxing and creative leisure-time activities. Throughout all periods of curricular expansion over time, Bouv√© has continued to maintain high enrollment standards. The Boston School of Physical Education and its successors adopted a holistic approach to the teaching of physical education and physical therapy. All curricular components functioned as an integrated unit just as students were expected to exemplify a balanced character and the highest attainments of their profession. The school also prioritized professional experience during enrollment at Boston School and its successors. In the case of physical education students, teaching in local grade schools provided the opportunity to test the principles taught in their classroom education. = Founders = The seven founders of the Boston School of Physical Education were a close-knit group of friends. Bessie Barnes and Miriam Tobey graduated as members of the first class from the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics in 1893. Mary Florence Stratton earned her diploma in 1900, and Caroline Baxter, Marjorie Bouv√©, Marguerite Sanderson, and Grace Shepardson followed in 1903. Upon graduation, six accepted teaching positions in the Boston area. Marguerite Sanderson became a physiotherapy aide at a local medical gymnasium. Bouv√©, Stratton, and Sanderson primarily developed the Boston School of Physical Education from idea to reality. All served as trustee-managers, and Sanderson became President of the School in 1913. A Massachusetts native, Director of the Bouv√©-Boston School of Physical Education Marjorie Bouv√© received a diploma from the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics and a BS in Education from Boston University. Bouv√© taught at Bradford Academy, Smith College, and in the Boston public schools before joining the development team behind the Boston School of Physical Education. She served as Director of three institutions for over thirty-five years, participated in numerous national organizations devoted to advancing physical education, and presided over the Eastern District Association of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. Ruth Page Sweet, a graduated member of the Boston School of Physical Education class of 1919, went on to become a physical educator. Ruth's qualities helped her to recruit students for the Bouv√© program by looking not just in the Boston area, but expanding to the New York Metropolitan area as well. Ruth returned to the school in 1929. She served as Director of the Bouv√©-Boston School for 12 years. To recognize Ruth's achievements, a student dormitory was named in her honor at the Boston School of Physical Education. = Student life = The Boston-Bouv√© College had its own building on the Northeastern University campus. Additionally, Northeastern provided additional facilities such as the Warren Center, a camping area wholly owned and operated by the University, a natatorium, new handball courts, and the Mugar Life Sciences building. These met the needs of both physical education and physical therapy programs. Students assumed many leadership responsibilities throughout the history of Bouv√©. From forming their own government to organizing special activities, they helped to determine the school's standards and identity. Participating in interschool activities, volunteering at local community centers, and even wearing the school uniform projected a self-assured, amiable attitude for potential students and donors. The collective independence and sense of purpose of the student body crafted Bouv√© into an institution that appealed to the brightest young minds in the fields of physical therapy, physical education, and recreation.  Rules and regulations  Bouv√© rules and regulations covered all aspects of student life, especially in the first half of the twentieth century. From academic honesty to health regimens and dress, the honor code attempted to form students into upright, well-mannered, self- motivated individuals. Many of the restrictions applied to student housing; until Ruth Page Sweet Hall opened in 1958, the majority of students lived in houses administered by house mothers. Rules changed slowly over time, but the underlying principles of decorum remained. Additionally, the School advocated the highest standards of healthy living, including eight hours of sleep, six glasses of water, and thirty minutes of daily exercise.  Uniforms  Clothing shaped group identity as much as the other recreational activities and rituals at Bouv√©. Before mass-produced clothing became common, students ordered custom fit outfits from local tailors, which ensured uniformity in cut and color. A catalog from the store of Gertrude Gibson Robinson, a graduate of the Boston School of Physical Education, appealed to potential shoppers through comfort and practical concerns. Each successive generation of students bemoaned the uniform requirement. Whether complaining about lack of choice or the restrictions placed upon movement, these frequent yet light-hearted jests became a school tradition in themselves.  Student government  The first student government formed in 1919 as the brainchild of a camp conversation. Students petitioned Marjorie Bouv√©, and she agreed. The girls applied the same dedication and intensity to self-government as they did to their coursework and camp activities. Students administered the honor code, planned many of the school functions, promoted school community, and bridged the gap between classmates and the administration. To ensure continuity, the president and vice president of each senior class wrote a report covering both practical and abstract matters for the incoming officers. The Monomettes, students who had completed their two years at camp, returned to advise younger students and act in a semi-administrative capacity alongside teachers. They served as mediators for campers and instructors, resolving concerns about uniforms, time for lights-out, and locations for smoking. Government officers also initiated a ritual of their own, the transfer of a long silver chain from the current to the rising president.  Singing  Bouv√© students in the early twentieth century inherited the traditions of the school's founders, most notably singing as a leisure activity. Each member of the entering class received a songbook at the beginning of the year, and song leaders encouraged the classes to learn a variety of pieces. The alma mater and ceremonial songs cultivated a sense of school-wide unity while Blue and White team songs instilled a sense of pride. Classes passed a corpus of school songs to the successive generations. New students also contributed to the canon. Silly or serious, devoted to the school or to its founders, each song reflected the emphasis placed upon tradition and holistic education. Through singing, students united to pay tribute to their history.  Blue and White At the school's founding, Bouv√© teams competed against teams from the Sargent School and the Posse-Nissen School, the two other institutions of physical education in Boston. The intramural, Blue-White competition, however, comprised most of the athletic competitions for the BSPE student body. Athletic and scholastic events, as well as demonstrations of school spirit all, fell under the Blue-White divide. The teams vied for achievement points throughout the year, but the competition was not designed to forge a bitter rivalry between the opponents. Rather, heated battles in the classroom or on the field allowed fellow students to display their skill against each other. Song and ceremony shaped the Blue-White competitions. Team song leaders demonstrated their spirit with team cheers, most often composed by members of the team as new versions of familiar chants. The winner of the yearlong competition received a silver candlestick engraved with the date and name of the victor. The team had the honor of displaying the candlestick with a candle of their respective color. The annual event infused an attitude of continuous competition into Bouv√© culture.  Special occasions  From the first day of the academic year, extracurricular activities injected a dose of levity into rigorous courses of study. Student government oversaw orientation week activities, which included picnics and meetings between Big and Little Sisters. As girls began arriving from across the country, orientation week became an important period of acclimation and a rite of passage into new school culture. Although Bouv√© remained a single-sex school until its merger with Northeastern University, men were allowed to attend school-sponsored dances and parties. In particular, theater, swim, and dance performances filled the Parents‚Äô Weekend and Class Day programs.  Alumni  Bouv√© alumni remembered their days at school with great fondness. Those from the early years particularly carried a strong sense of having broken new ground for women in higher education. When Dean Emerita Catherine Allen began collecting the school's history, many alumni answered her call to share a ‚Äúflavor of the times.‚Äù Students and staff from the early years responded with special vigor. Their reminisces portray life at Bouv√© in the early twentieth century as a whirl of activity, a period when women navigated between the gender norms of older generations and the free-spirited independence of the modern woman. Differences in opinion often arose between faculty and students, but pride in the school's achievements united these groups.

Russia provides approximately about 25% of natural gas consumed in the European Union; approximately 80% of those exports travel through gas pipelines across Ukrainian soil prior to arriving in the EU. According to The World Factbook estimate, the country also has the largest proven reserves (48 trillion cubic meters (tcm)). OPEC figures also place Russia first, with an estimated 49 tcm, 24% of the world's proved reserves; however, BP estimates put Russia second behind Iran with 33 tcm.BP Statistical Review of World Energy . Additionally, Russia is likely to have the largest volume of undiscovered natural gas deposits, an additional 6.7 tcm, according to US Geological Survey estimations. Russia consumes approximately 457 bcm a year, second only to the United States. Disputes with Ukraine Since 2005, the Russian gas supplier Gazprom and the Ukrainian oil and gas company Naftogaz have been involved in a number of disputes. These disputes have grown beyond simple business disputes into transnational political issues that threaten natural gas supplies in numerous European countries dependent on natural gas imports from Russian suppliers, which are transported through Ukraine. During 2005, Russia claimed Ukraine was not paying for gas, but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the EU from the pipelines. Ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation, but later Naftogaz admitted that natural gas intended for other European countries was retained and used for domestic needs. The dispute reached a peak on 1 January 2006, when Russia cut off all gas supplies passing through Ukrainian territory. On 4 January 2006, a preliminary agreement between Russia and Ukraine was achieved, and the supply was restored. The situation calmed until October 2007 when new disputes began over Ukrainian gas debts. This led to reduction of gas supplies in March 2008. During the last months of 2008, relations once again became tense when Ukraine and Russia could not agree on the debts owed by Ukraine. In January 2009, this disagreement resulted in supply disruptions in many European nations, with eighteen European countries reporting major drops in or complete cut-offs of their gas supplies transported through Ukraine from Russia. In September 2009 officials from both countries stated they felt the situation was under control and that there would be no more conflicts over the topic, at least until the Ukrainian 2010 presidential elections. However, in October 2009, another disagreement arose about the amount of gas Ukraine would import from Russia in 2010. Ukraine intended to import less gas in 2010 as a result of reduced industry needs because of its economic recession; however, Gazprom insisted that Ukraine fulfill its contractual obligations and purchase the previously agreed upon quantities of gas. On 8 June 2010, a Stockholm court of arbitration ruled Naftogaz of Ukraine must return of gas to RosUkrEnergo, a Swiss-based company in which Gazprom controls a 50% stake. Russia accused the Ukrainian side of siphoning gas from pipelines passing through Ukraine in 2009. Several high-ranking Ukrainian officials stated the return \\"would not be quick\\". Agreement with China On 21 May 2014, Russia and China announced an agreement between state controlled gas companies Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corporation after a decade of negotiations. Under the agreement, Russia will supply China 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas each year for 30 years, starting in 2018. Both countries will be responsible for building new infrastructure to make the transport possible. Russia will spend about US$55 billion to build a pipeline from Siberia to Vladivostok, while China will spend $20 billion on infrastructure within its borders. The Kovykta and Chayanda gas fields which will supply the majority of the natural gas are currently largely undeveloped. Tentative agreements had been reached several times since 2005, but each time final negotiations broke down over price. The agreed upon price was not disclosed, but those familiar with the situation said getting a lower price than European buyers was a key demand of China in the negotiations. However, Russian representatives said the price would fluctuate based on the market price of oil, making the deal closer to what Russia had wanted than to what China had been asking for. The total value of the deal was estimated at US$400 billion. It will increase Russian exports to countries not part of the former Soviet Union by 25% and make China the country's 2nd largest customer, after Germany. The agreement was reached as Chinese and Russian leaders met to discuss greater cooperation in Asia without involvement of Western powers. It was seen as an important political and economic victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin. It allows Russia to diversify its natural business outside of Europe and weakens the force of economic sanctions placed by the West in the aftermath of the 2014 Crimean crisis. More generally, it allows Russia to reduce its isolation due to the crisis in Ukraine. For China, the deal helps lessen its dependence on coal to produce electric power, using a cleaner method of electricity generation through natural gas. It also helps meet the country's growing demand for natural gas.  Subsidies  There is a long history of subsidy of natural gas in Russia. Subsidies for natural gas has been one of the reasons for the limited growth of renewable energy in the country. However, it is difficult to estimate the extent of subsidy, as there is no benchmark price. Often netback calculations have been used, but there are arguments against their validity in determining the size of domestic subsidies. \\"Netback\\" is the price that Russian gas is sold for at the border, minus the cost of transportation and taxes imposed on exports. However, it is not certain that the domestic price should be the same as the price obtained at the border. The alternative would be to look at the supply chain for natural gas, identify any losses incurred and classify these as indirect subsidies. However, due to the complexity of the supply chain (including upstream operations, trunk pipelines, distribution grid and local utilities - sometimes owned by commercial entities, sometimes by municipalities or other authorities), it is difficult to identify the size of financial losses. Automotive use NefAZ bus with methane gas engine in Belgorod The use of natural gas cars in Russia is encouraged by the government. Aftermarket conversion kits are sold by companies like Italgas, while some GAZ Group vehicles are sold with natural gas systems. As of late 2016, Gazprom has a network of 254 filling stations in the country, with plans to reach 500 stations by 2020. The NEFAZ bus manufacturing company makes gas- powered buses using Daimler engines. A natural gas variant of the Lada Vesta was introduced in 2017.

Kehoe (; November 18, 1893 ‚Äì November 24, 1992) was an American toxicologist and a leader in occupational health. Kehoe was the foremost medical advocate for the use of tetraethyllead as an additive in gasoline. Family and education Kehoe was born in Georgetown, Ohio, on November 18, 1893 to Jeremiah and Jessie Kehoe. Robert studied at Ohio State University. After his graduation at the University of Cincinnati (UC) medical school in 1920 he was a resident in pathology at the Cincinnati General Hospital. Shortly after obtaining his M.D. he married Lucille Marshall. Occupational health When he was an instructor in the UC Department of Physiology in 1924, he was hired by Charles Kettering for General Motors (GM) to examine health issues related to the production of tetraethyllead (TEL). In 1925 Kehoe became the chief medical advisor of the Ethyl Corporation, a position he held until his retirement. In 1930, he became the director of the newly created UC Kettering Laboratory of Applied Physiology, the first university-based laboratory devoted to toxicological problems peculiar to industry. The laboratory was funded by the stakeholder companies, GM, DuPont, and Ethyl Corporation. At the Kettering Laboratory, Kehoe was commissioned by DuPont to produce a study to show that the carcinogen 2-Naphthylamine, then widely used by DuPont and shown to produce cancer in nine out of ten employees exposed to it, was safe. Kehoe was named Professor of Industrial Medicine at UC and put together an interdisciplinary team to investigate occupational health issues. Advocacy of lead in gasoline Working at the GM Research Laboratory at Dayton, Ohio, Charles F. Kettering and his assistant Thomas Midgley Jr.. studied anti-knocking agents. In 1921, the team directed by Midgley discovered TEL's anti-knocking property, which would eliminate the knock in internal combustion engines, allowing them to be built with higher compression ratios. GM proceeded to file a patent for the use of TEL as an additive in gasoline. In August 1924, after Standard Oil of New Jersey discovered a lower-cost method to synthesize TEL, it teamed up with GM to establish the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce TEL as a gasoline additive with the help of DuPont.Alan P. Loeb, \\"Birth of the Kettering Doctrine: Fordism, Sloanism and Tetraethyl Lead,\\" Business and Economic History, Vol. 24, No. 2, Fall 1995. Soon, workers at Ethyl plants fell ill and a number of them died from lead poisoning. Kettering hired Kehoe to develop protocols for the workers handling TEL. Kehoe soon became the main medical advocate for the position that the use of TEL in gasoline is safe and gained prominence as the industry's expert at government and public health hearings. As almost all research support concerning leaded gasoline came from industry, and most was channeled to him, he held \\"an almost complete monopoly\\" on data for half a century. Kehoe claimed that presence of lead in humans and other organisms was normal and that exposure to low lead levels was not harmful. Although lead had been known to be highly toxic since antiquity, Kehoe‚Äôs beliefs were not seriously contested until after Clair Cameron Patterson‚Äôs publication in 1965. Patterson argued that global lead contamination was taking place and that it had started gradually with the Industrial Revolution but had been markedly accelerated once leaded gasoline had entered the market. In a 1966 government hearing chaired by Senator Edmund Muskie, Kehoe stated that his laboratory \\"was the only source of new information (about lead exposure)\\" and \\"had wide influence (in the US and abroad) in shaping the point of view and activities... of those who are responsible for industrial and public hygiene\\". Because leaded gasoline had been found \\"safe\\" by the U.S. Surgeon General in the 1920s (see below), and ambient lead had been \\"demonstrated\\" through Kehoe's work to not constitute a public health hazard over the succeeding decades, it took years for Patterson's findings to change the prevailing view of the toxicity of ambient lead. The validation of Patterson's refutation of Kehoe's research required new, more precise research by several others, but ultimately the medical/public health argument prevailed. Kehoe's work is now considered discredited. By 2014, a majority of countries had discontinued the use of leaded gasoline in automobiles. Yet leaded gasoline continues to be produced and used, for example, for private aviation in the United States. The Surgeon General's review of gasoline lead and the Kehoe Rule Yandell Henderson, Alice Hamilton and others raised doubts about the safety of tetraethyl lead early on. When the public became aware that workers at TEL plants had fallen ill and deaths had occurred, the Surgeon General, Dr. Hugh Smith Cumming, called for a conference, and TEL production was voluntarily suspended. At the conference, held May 20, 1925, the advocates of lead argued that the use of leaded gasoline raised public health issues that were novel.Alan P. Loeb, \\"Paradigms Lost: A Case Study Analysis of Models of Corporate Responsibility for the Environment,\\" Business and Economic History, Vol. 28, No. 2, Winter 1999, at 95. They also asked to be informed what their duty was, implying that they were not guilty of violating any rule because no rule had previously been established. Portraying their responsibility as a blank slate opened up the issue to be addressed by a new policy approach, and Dr. Kehoe provided the logic that would resolve the controversy by filling in that blank. In his testimony at the conference, Kehoe offered (speaking on behalf of the companies engaged in the Ethyl Gasoline enterprise) to discontinue the sale of gasoline containing lead \\"if it can be shown ... that an actual danger is had as a result...\\" But, he reasoned, if it could not be shown \\"on the basis of facts,\\" a product this economically beneficial should not be \\"thrown into the discard on the basis of opinions.\\" Kehoe's offer thus acted as a decision rule (hence, \\"the Kehoe Rule\\"), setting out a choice point and two alternative paths that could be followed, depending on what was shown as proof at that choice point.Loeb (1999) The Kehoe Rule had two significant characteristics. First, it placed the burden of proof on the opponents of tetraethyl lead, who would have to show that use of TEL was unsafe if any constraint on its use were to be instituted. If the finding of fact was inconclusive and did not provide an uncontestable showing of proof, then TEL would be allowed. Second, it balanced the interest in protecting public health against the economic benefits of TEL, which the advocates of TEL had promised would be in the form of conservation of fuel. The alternative approach, the precautionary principle, would have required proof that TEL was safe before it could be used. While the Kehoe Paradigm (or Kehoe Rule)Alan P. Loeb, \\"Birth of the Kehoe Rule: Implications of the Surgeon General's Review of Tetraethyl Lead, 1925-26,\\" presented at the 1997 biennial meeting of the American Society for Environmental History, Baltimore, Maryland, March 7, 1997;a copy was provided to Nriagu, who cited it in his article. assumes that in the absence of clear evidence of risk, there is no risk of significance, the precautionary principle assumes that there is a possible risk until it is proved otherwise. Nriagu asserted that with the large investments by industry, the social and economic climate of the time, and the belief in progress, the outcome of the 1925 conference was preordained. TEL production resumed, and soon, leaded gasoline was commonly used. That there were alternatives to the use of TEL was falsely denied by the industry. Application of the Kehoe Rule made it critical for the industry to fund and control the research in lead toxicity. That was done through the Kettering Laboratory, under Kehoe‚Äôs direction. The Kehoe Rule was beneficial to those engaged in the gasoline lead industry, as all that was necessary was to characterize any criticism as fraught with uncertainty. In the case of lead toxicity, Kehoe's laboratory dominated the scene for decades, attesting to the safety of leaded gasoline and deconstructing any criticism. The credibility of Kehoe's research was bolstered for decades by the support of the US Public Health Service and American Medical Association. Using the Kehoe Rule, Ethyl Corporation was a winner in either situation: if its product was actually safe, Ethyl would be seen as a responsible party. If, however, its product was unsafe, it would take decades to demonstrate that with certainty. The process of getting to certainty could be prolonged by challenging the methods and results and calling for more data, and while it was going on the product would continue to generate profits. Kitman indicates that the strategy taken by the lead industry, referring to use of the Kehoe Rule, similarly \\"provided a model for the asbestos, tobacco, pesticide and nuclear power industries, and other(s)... for evading clear evidence that their products are harmful by hiding behind the mantle of scientific uncertainty.\\" Kettering Laboratories under Kehoe's leadership also certified the safety of the fluorinated refrigerant, Freon, \\"another environmentally insensitive GM patent that would earn hundreds of millions before it was outlawed.\\" Death Kehoe retired in 1965. He became Professor Emeritus of Occupational Medicine at the university upon his retirement. He died in Cincinnati in 1992 at the age of 99.

It proved to be one of the most important battlegrounds during the war. A statue can be found at Corvin k√∂z, near Corvin‚Äìnegyed (Budapest Metro), to mark this important event in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The battle is known for starting the career of Gergely Pongr√°tz , founder of Jobbik. Prelude Due to a lack of jobs, declining quality of life, and the failure of the Hungarian economy, an uprising occurred on October 24, 1956. The Corvin Passage was immediately recognized by the rebels as a strategic location due to its importance as a traffic junction, and its strategic value near the Kilian Barracks and the Budapest Radio Station. The Passage also provided a good defense point, with narrow streets that limited the movement of larger vehicles such as tanks and trucks.http://www.allworldwars.com/Revolutionary-Forces-of-the-Hungarian- Revolution-1956-by-Zoltan-Virag.html Figure 1.The Corvin Passage Early Battle L√°szl√≥ Iv√°n Kov√°cs is said to have first fought at the Corvin Passage in October during the early stages of the Hungarian Revolution (1956). He first began demonstrating outside of a radio station and later that day used a gun on √úll≈ëi Avenue to fight against Soviet tanks. On October 26, he joined other armed revolutionaries in Corvin where he eventually became the leader of a unit of 1,000. It was here that he set up his base in Corvin's resident cinema where his successor, Gergely, also set up command. The soldiers at Corvin had already resisted a Soviet offensive on October 24 and the Soviets were later defeated, suffering heavy casualties. The Soviet strategy then was to gather intelligence and attack with a renewed offensive on October 28. To direct the offensive the Soviets appointed the leader of the 33rd Mechanized Infantry Division, Gennady Ivanovich Obaturov who had taken part in the Budapest offensive during 1944. However, over reliance on heavy artillery, poor intelligence and insufficient planning resulted in the failure of the offensive. On October 29, the Soviets withdrew from the city until October 31. Despite his successes as a commander, after November 1, L√°szl√≥ was replaced with Gergely for unknown reasons who continued the defense of the passage until November 9. Under Gergely Pongr√°tz On the third floor of the circular structure in this picture is where the cinema where L√°szl√≥ set up his command is located Nicknamed 'Bajusz' for his 'Twirly' mustache, Gergely Pongr√°tz fought in less harmonious circumstances than his predecessor. Though he commanded 4,000 militia compared to his predecessors 1,000, he still had to contend with a renewed Soviet offensive which had turned back toward the city and attacked on November 5. His soldiers fought from the windows of buildings, destroying Soviet tanks with makeshift Molotovs. With these tactics, Gergely gained a degree of success destroying a reported 12 tanks and inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviets. However, under heavy Soviet artillery and mortar fire, the defense of the passage became steadily more difficult and with the desertion of 300 troops on November 6, the defense became more and more difficult until fighting against the Soviets became solely guerrilla. Then on November 9, Gergely's forces were defeated and he fled to Austria, alongside many of other Hungarian revolutionaries. He would remain in exile until 1991.

Known by his peers and students as ‚ÄúDr. Mojdehi‚Äù, his excellence, independence, and reform orientation and principled leadership, propelled him through the hierarchy of universities in Iran and ultimately resulted in his appointment as Iranian Minister of Health in 1978. Early life and education Born into a privileged family, Mojdehi's father was a career civil servant and was Commander of Langarood and Ghazvin regions, among others. His mother was a large landowner. Mojdehi graduated from high school and received his diploma with distinction from Shahpour High School in Rasht, Iran, in 1940. From 1940 to 1946, he attended the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, where he distinguished himself and joined the faculty. He completed a post-doctoral program at the University of Edinburgh. He completed a fellowship program in 1966 at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore, Maryland.  Career  After his return to Iran in 1966, he rejoined the faculty of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) (Persian: ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥⁄ØÿßŸá ÿπŸÑŸàŸÖ Ÿæÿ≤ÿ¥⁄©€å ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ) as Professor of Internal MedicineN.M. Mojdehi MD and M. Moine MD,\\"Treatment of Hepatic Coma by Exchange Transfusion A Report of Three Cases\\", \\"ACTA MEDICA IRANICA\\", 1967 see footnote with a specialty in Infectious Disease. A prot√©g√© of the late Dr. Manouchehr Eghbal, Dr. Mojdehi quickly rose through the ranks at the University, becoming a full Professor in 1967. In 1971, Dr. Mojdehi was tapped to become Dean of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. From 1967 to 1969 Dr. Mojdehi served as Vice Chancellor of Tehran University under Chancellor Alikhani, where he distinguished himself by resolving a major protest at Pahlavi Hospital by para-medical personnel. In 1974, at the command of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad RezƒÅ ShƒÅh Pahlavƒ´, and on the advice of Asadollah Alam, Minister of Court, Dr. Mojdehi assumed the role of Chancellor at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (FUM) (Persian: ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥⁄ØÿßŸá ŸÅÿ±ÿØŸàÿ≥€å ŸÖÿ¥ŸáÿØ), the largest research university in Eastern Iran. After two years in Mashad, in 1974 to 1976, Dr. Mojdehi returned to Tehran where he was elected to the Senate, representing Tehran in 1976.  Views  Known for his depth of understanding, affection for students, humor, up-to-date teachings, Hollywood good looks, and elegant dress, Mojdehi's lectures were highly popular with his students. His lectures left indelible impressions on legions of medical students many of whom today live and practice outside of Iran. During his tenure as Dean of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, he instigated significant reforms to ensure that promotions were based upon merit rather than political connections, leading to the forced retirement of several ineffective, but politically influential professors. Mojdehi's reforms had the salutary effects of improving morale and bolstering the reputation of the medical school.Meybodi Radio Show - Interview with Professor Jalal Matini (second interviewee of show), Mojdehi reluctantly left his position at Tehran University of Medical Sciences to assume leadership of Ferdowsi University at Mashhad. He promptly lifted the spirit of the Ferdowsi University community by again instituting reforms to ensure that faculty members were recognized based on merit rather than political connections and taking other affirmative steps to improve the faculty's morale. While at Ferdowsi, during the ceremonial visits by the late Shah of Iran, Mojdehi refused to allow the military brass to lead the ceremonial processions. Proclaiming that teachers and professors were more important to the well being of the country than the military, Mojdehi informed the Governor of Khorassan Province that he would decline the invitation extended to University professors to participate in processions with the Shah, unless the University staff led the processions. At his insistence, University professors were promoted to the head of the receiving line in procession with the Shah, which sent a message that, while under his leadership, the University and its personnel decisions would not be either influenced or controlled by the government. During his tenure, Mojdehi also developed a professor exchange program between Georgetown University and Ferdowsi University.\\"Ferdowsi University of Mashhad\\" Mojdehi's declined to accept a gift by the Governor of Khorassan Province of a deed of valuable property, insisting that the property instead be given to the University, to be used in perpetuity as a residence by future Chancellors of the University during their time of service. Consistent with his past principles and focus on instituting necessary reforms, his speeches on the Senate floor raised awareness of the need for progress in the areas of health and development, and he quickly gained a reputation as an advocate for liberalization and change. Given his reputation as a reformer and agent of positive change, in 1978, when controversy swirled around the existing cabinet appointee in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Sheikoleslami, Dr. Mojdehi was appointed Minister of Health in the Amouzegar Cabinet. He stayed on as Minister of Health in Sharif Emami's Cabinet, but soon clashed with another cabinet member, Monuchehr Azmoun. Azmoun sought to block Mojdehi's decision to appoint a deputy who was Jewish in the Ministry of Health.Tony Allaway, \\"Shah Faces a Double Challenge as Riots and Strikes Continue\\", \\"The London Times\\", October 8, 1978 Unwilling to bend to the influence of Azmoun, Mojdehi unilaterally resigned as Minister of Health, without seeking the permission of the Shah. Unilateral resignations by cabinet ministers were unprecedented, and Mojdehi's public resignation based upon a matter of principle forever etched his reputation as a man of integrity and courage.\\"Mojdehi Resignation Sparks Rumours\\", \\"Kayhan International Edition\\", October 10, 1978 Following the revolution, due to his prior public service in the pre-revolutionary government, Mojdehi was imprisoned at Ghasre prison from May until August 1979. Mojdehi's well-known reputation for excellence in internal medicine and singular ability to diagnose difficult cases served as a means of his release. Over 120 physicians signed a petition addressed to the then leaders of the country asking for his release, given his service to the country. In addition, as fate would have it, a senior and highly influential cleric fell ill and the cause of his illness could not be determined. In search for a cure, the senior cleric identified Mojdehi as the best physician to diagnose the cleric's illness. Later, the grateful cleric was instrumental in securing the release of Mojdehi after six months of imprisonment.  Publications  *Mojdehi NM. Infectious Diseases. Tehran, Iran 1951. *Mojdehi NM.

The track was written by the Kinks' main songwriter, Ray Davies. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"Animal Farm\\" visit an escapism theme (one that would be returned to in \\"Apeman\\" and \\"Supersonic Rocket Ship\\"), with the singer wanting to flee to \\"where real animals are playing.\\" He yearns \\"to be back there, among the cats and dogs and the pigs and the goats on Animal Farm, [his] animal home.\\" The singer dreams of his girlfriend, \\"though she's far from home,\\" but in his fantasy on animal farm, \\"she's by [his] side.\\" The singer then offers to \\"take [her] where real animals are playing,\\" \\"on Animal Farm.\\" When talking about \\"Animal Farm\\", Ray Davies said, \\"This was just me thinking everybody else's mad and we are all animals anyway - which is really the idea of the whole album.\\" \\"Animal Farm\\" has a folk feel, similarly to many other tracks on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. Andy Miller wrote in his book, 33 and 1/3 book Kinks' The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society that \\"'Animal Farm' has a noticeably bigger sound than much of the rest of the album, with plenty of reverb applied to the drums, percussion and the tack piano that picks out the song's opening riff.\\" When talking about the vocal line of \\"Animal Farm\\", Ray Davies said, \\"'The sky is wide' is a line I knew I could just about reach that note and, to me, the whole record is the way I sing that line. I knew that before it was recorded. I must have been so confident, so sure of myself.\\" Recording A mellotron was used to impersonate strings in the track rather than using actual string instruments. Drummer Mick Avory claims that \\"Animal Farm\\" was recorded in Pye Studios 1. The recording of Animal Farm was somewhat controversial. Bassist Pete Quaife stated, \\"There was a big fight about 'Animal Farm'. I thought the bass should be playing the piano introduction as well. Both Ray and Dave threw a hissy fit and said no. So it's not there. I was a bit angry and sour about that one.\\" Release \\"Animal Farm\\" was first released on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society as the eighth track on said album. However, the track was eventually used as the B-side to the Japanese-only single, \\"Village Green\\". The track was also released on The Kinks' compilation album Picture Book, and an alternate stereo mix of the track made its debut on the 2004 Sanctuary Records special deluxe edition of The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. Reception \\"Animal Farm\\" has received positive feedback from reviewers. J.H. Tompkins of Pitchfork Media said of \\"Animal Farm\\", \\"There's a clue to who [Davies] was in the song 'Animal Farm', which opens with a cascade of chords played on a warm, acoustic 12-string, the folk music staple once used on songs like the Rooftop Singers' 1963 hit 'Walk Right In'. Davies' opening lines, forced to share space with the tongue filling his cheek, are a mouthful. 'This world is big and wild and half insane/ Take me where the animals are playing,' he sings, raising the Union Jack, while looking back through the chaos of the day to find a simpler, safer world.\\" AllMusic's Stewart Mason said, \\"Indulging his whimsical streak ... Ray Davies invests \\"Animal Farm\\" with an endearing blend of silliness and genuine yearning. The imagery in parts is twee enough to have come from the pen of A.A. Milne, but Davies sings of his yearning to escape to the country in terms that sound much more real and personal than any of the other similarly themed 'getting our heads together in the country' songs that started appearing around 1968. The arrangement makes a nice hook out of a rolling start to each verse, the first line sung exaggeratedly slowly to a halting acoustic guitar before the full band comes in.\\" The track is also a favorite of multiple members of The Kinks. Pete Quaife stated his favorite Kinks songs to be \\"Animal Farm\\", \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" and \\"Dead End Street\\". Ray Davies also seems to be fond of the track. The Judybats, an alternative rock band from Tennessee covered this song on their 1992 album Down in the Shacks Where the Satellite Dishes Grow.

The play is obviously influenced by the Russian Revolution that year. It takes place in an imaginary country which has recently experienced a similar revolution. The two main characters are the daughter of the ruler, who once ran away to join the circus as a girl, and now supports the revolution, and an army officer who opposes it. Characters *Annajanska *General Strammfest *Schneiderkind *First Soldier Plot General Strammfest, whose family has served the Panjandrums of Beotia for 700 years is unhappy about working for the new, very unstable, revolutionary government. He can't make up his mind whether to send his reports to the provisional government or one of the competing factions: \\"Maximillianists\\" or the \\"Oppidoshavians\\". He hopes to restore the old regime. He soon learns that Grand Duchess Annajanska, the beautiful daughter of the Panjandrum, has escaped from the palace to which the royal family have been confined. Reports state that she has eloped with an officer. Who is this man and what are their plans? News arrives that the Duchess has been captured, but not her lover. Annajanska enters, adopting the haughty air of a princess. The general questions her about the elopement, but she denies it ever happened. The General is concerned that her lover intends to start his own faction, but what is it? Annajanska asks to speak to him in private, but he refuses. She contemptuously ignores him, produces a revolver, and forces everyone else to leave at gunpoint. She tells the General to abandon his counter-revolutionary dreams. She wants no more Panjandrums. Attachment to the old regime is just keeping the people in thralldom. He should work for their liberation. Strammfest argues that revolutions typically create more oppression, not less. The Duchess says that the people will have to be forced to be free. New leaders will arise who will push things forward. She wants a new energy to be unleashed, saying \\"I am for anything that will make the world less like a prison and more like a circus.\\" She would happily appear on stage as the \\"Bolshevik Empress\\". As for suggestion that she eloped with an officer - she opens her cloak to reveal a military uniform underneath. She is the mystery officer herself. Productions It was first produced on 21 January, 1918 at the Coliseum Theatre. It was originally described as a translation of the work of an imaginary Russian writer called Gregory Biessipoff: \\"Annajanska, the Wild Duchess, play in one act from the Russian of Gregory Biessipoff\\".Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad, Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw, A. & C. Black, 1929, p.213. The lead role was played by Lillah McCarthy. The \\"wonderful white uniform\\" she theatrically unveils at the end of the play was designed by Charles Ricketts.The Times, January 22, 1918, p.23 Interpretations J.W. Hulse argues that Shaw's work always implies a tension between the writer's reformist and anarchist tendencies. His Fabianism was disturbed by Bolshevik radicalism, while his anarchic side looked forward to the wildness of revolution. Gareth Griffith says that though Shaw portrays both pro and anti-revolutionary views, the play is clearly pro-revolution. He argues that \\"Shaw's letters from the period do not suggest he feared a Bolshevik victory and, though the play does affirm the challenge of revolution, that affirmation was far from straightforward.\\" Gareth Griffith, Socialism and Superior Brains: The Political Thought of Bernard Shaw, Routledge, New York, 1995, p.289 The play is set in \\"Boetia\\", a term for a province of ancient Greece proverbial for the stupidity of its inhabitants, a meaning that was common in English at the time the play was written.The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories, Merriam-Webster, 1 Jan 1991, p.360 References Category:Plays by George Bernard Shaw Category:1917 plays ","title":"Annajanska, the Bolshevik Empress"},{"id":"42827622","text":"The 2007 Harvard Crimson football team represented Harvard University in the 2007 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

He wrote his own lyrics. Although some of his songs relied on tunes by composers such as Charles Coote, most adapted their tunes from old folk songs.Let me make a nation's songs, and let who will make their laws, Roy Hudd, The Hiss and Boo Company; retrieved 19 May 2014.

Clifton undertook a nationwide tour between 1865 and 1867, with his own Cosmopolitan Concert Company, and for some years lived in Glasgow. He was married and had one child, Fanny Alice, who died aged six months. He died aged 40 in Shepherd's Bush, London, and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. One of his obituaries stated: \\"The popularity which his songs attained is best denoted by the fact that even now they are whistled by every street-boy, played by every barrel organ and sung in every town and hamlet in the United Kingdom.\\" The critic Peter Gammond describes Clifton as \\"one of the great pioneers of music-hall song.\\" Clifton's work survives (in an adapted form) into the present day, as the Tyneside Music Hall song Cushie Butterfield (still sung at Newcastle United matches) is sung to the same tune as \\"Pretty Polly Perkins\\" and is a parody of it.

He is the founder of the Centre for Metabolic Surgery, a weight-loss centre located in Mumbai. He was appointed as the Honorary Assistant Professor of Surgery at the Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Group of Hospitals by the State Government of Maharashtra in 1994. Career Dr Goel started his surgical career in 1988 after his post-graduation in surgery. In 1992-93, he spent 6 months in Austria for a postgraduate course in gastrointestinal surgery at the University of Vienna. He started his laparoscopy surgical practice in 1993. His interest in bariatric surgery started in 1999-2000 after observing surgeries by Dr Michel Suter at Laussane & Dr V Frering in Lyon. This started his bariatric journey as he performed the first gastric band in India in 2000. He was invited to start the bariatric surgery department at the largest private hospital, Bombay Hospital in 2002. His work has been presented at international meetings of IFSO, ASMBS & IASO in Crete, Sydney, Geneva, San Diego, Dallas, New York, Rustsu, Las Vegas, and Delhi. He completed his preceptor program of American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) with Dr Mal Fobi in Los Angeles. In April 2012, Dr Goel underwent an intense training in robotic surgery at the Rothmans Hospital, Buffalo, USA. He has performed surgeries on several Bollywood personalities, leading corporate captains like Subrato Roy. Dr. Goel performs the procedure, surgery which helps in weight loss, childhood obesity and diabetes management =SGIT= A study with Dr. Goel as the Principal Investigator at Bombay Hospital showed that by repositioning a portion of the intestine and at the same time reducing the size of the stomach, the production of diabetes-causing hormones in the body could be regulated successfully. The study published in the International Journal of Diabetes in Developing Countries underlined how the procedure, called Ileal Transposition with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SGIT), could offer hope to millions who suffer from Type II diabetes despite having normal weight. =Fighting with Obesity= The sedentary lifestyle of Indians is the main reason behind increasing number of obese people. The food Indians eat - both traditional and modern - is high on calories. Plus, most people are inert and have absolutely no exercise in their daily routine. Apart from the lifestyle, there are reasons beyond human control as well, contributing to making India a country of obese people. Dr. Goel has performed surgery across different lifestyle strata. =Childhood Obesity= There is a 2.5% of childhood obesity in India which has taken its toll in the urban children, Dr Goel has been working with these obese children where they have acquired through excessive consumption of caloriedense food, frequent eating out and lack of physical activity are the main reasons for severe obesity in young children. =Diabetes Management= 62 million people suffering from diabetes reside in India. There is a rising demand for insulin in the country, there is a pressing need for the government and the regulator to bring the prices down. Insulin which is used within the body in a constant proportion to remove excess glucose from the blood, which otherwise would be toxic, this helps in controlling the disease. Dr. Goel, highlights the metabolic surgery which was primarily for weight loss in significantly obese people was seen to result in diabetes control in most of the patients. =Bariatric Surgery gets insurance= While bariatric surgeries essentially lead to weight loss, the procedure helps in controlling of diabetes and hypertension. These surgeries were initially recommended for morbidly obese people, but in the last five years they are being offered to diabetic patients who are not obese. Dr. Goel has been a supporter for insurance companies to insure and cover the weight loss surgery.

Those efforts initially lead swimmers to reduce the early sagging one-piece swimsuits down to briefs only. With the development of new materials that tightly fit the body and offered lower resistance to water than human skin, this trend was reversed to a complete body coverage from heels to neck and wrists. FINA banned full-body suits from competition effective from 1 January 2010, stating that it \\"wishes to recall the main and core principle is that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete\\". Goggles were used in the crossing of the English Channel back in 1911, but only in 1970 appeared at international competitions. With the advent of rubber technology, latex swimming caps became mass-produced in the 1920s, and more efficient silicone caps appeared in the 1970s. Today, competitive swimwear is a major business for companies like Speedo, Arena and TYR and its development involves such institutions as NASA and Australian Institute of Sport. chaperone in the middle East German swimmers wearing skinsuits at the 1976 national championships Early years Olympic Games have been the most important international swimming competition. While men's events were an integral part of all Olympics, women's races were introduced only in 1912, and until 1924 were limited to a couple of freestyle events. Public nudity was a major concern in designing early swimwear. It was a major factor behind the non-participation of American women in the 1912 Olympics. At those Games British women wore full-body silk suits of such a volume that they could be passed through a wedding ring. The suits were complemented by bras and bikini-style briefs as they became transparent when wet. Women's coaches were rare at early Olympics, and to further reduce the chances of harassment women were accompanied by chaperones. Even men wore one-piece swimsuits covering the body from hips to shoulders up to the 1940s.Daily News, pp. 1, 5 In 1928, Speedo introduced their racerback silk suit that was optimized to fit the body shape.Daily News, p. 6 It uncovered the shoulder blades, which almost resulted in disqualification of Clare Dennis at the 1932 Olympics, but became a norm by 1936.Daily News, p. 7 Meanwhile, men were allowed to swim in bare- chest suits in 1936, and in briefs only at the 1948 Olympics.Daily News, p. 8 In 1956, Speedo became the first company to introduce nylonDaily News, pp. 9, 12 and in the 1970s elastane to their swimsuits that improved their elasticity, durability and water drag ‚Äì 21 out of 22 records at the 1972 Olympics were broken using nylon/elastane suits. Naƒëa Higl in a Jaked skinsuit in 2010 At the same Olympics, East German swimmers adopted suits that were tightly following the body shape, the so-called \\"skinsuits\\". They were initially made of cotton and became virtually transparent when wet. The revealing shape and transparency caused outrage among US swimmers; meanwhile, at the 1973 World Aquatics Championships, East German women won 10 of 14 events and set seven world records. Those championships became the turning point for the world to adopt the skinsuit, modified with novel synthetic materials, as a standard competitive swimwear. Biomimetic suits In 2000, Speedo launched the Fastskin suit series that mimicked shark skin. Their surface contained bumps and ridges that channeled the water over the swimmer's body approximately 3% more efficiently than traditional materials. Those suits covered most of the body, from neck to ankles and wrists, and their shape was optimized for specific swimming strokes, compressing some body parts while allowing more freedom to the others.Daily News, p. 14 Those suits were approved for the 2000 Olympics, where they helped win 83% of the medals. By the next Olympics, similar suits had been developed by Tyr Sport, Inc., but they were not approved by the FINA. Non-textile swimsuits The LZR Racer Suit unveiling at a press conference in New York City in February 2008. In February 2008, Speedo launched the LZR Racer swimsuit based on woven elastane- nylon and polyurethane (50%). The suit was developed by Italian company Mectex, in association with the Australian Institute of Sport and NASA, which provided wind tunnel testing facilities. The suits were manufactured at Petratex, a textile factory in Pa√ßos de Ferreira, Portugal, where the technology is patented. Like other suits used for high competition racing, LZR Racer allows for better oxygen flow to the muscles, and holds the body in a more hydrodynamic position, while repelling water and increasing flexibility. The seams of the suit are ultrasonically welded to further reduce drag. The suit is 100% chlorine resistant and quick in drying. Endorsed for competitive use by FINA prior to the Beijing Olympics, the suit reportedly can lower racing times by 2‚Äì4%, This was corroborated at the Beijing Olympics, where swimmers wearing the suit set 23 out of 25 world records and won 94% of the races and 89% of the medals.PHELPS SECURES HIS PLACE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS AFTER LANDING HIS EIGHTH GOLD MEDAL! Speedo. 17 August 2008 Following the LZR Racer example, alternative non-textile suits have been introduced by other companies in 2008. Some of them like the Arena X-Glide, Jaked01 and Adidas Hydrofoil were entirely made of polyurethane. By 24 August 2009, more than 130 world records had been broken by swimmers wearing non-textile suits, and more than 90 of them were set with the LZR Racer. =FINA rule changes= In an abrupt reversal of opinion, the FINA Congress voted almost unanimously to revert its previous policy and ban all body-length swimsuits. The decision was taken in Rome on 24 July 2009, during the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. The new policy states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the waist to the knee, and women's counterparts from the shoulder to the knee. FINA also ruled that the fabric used must be a textile or a woven material and that a suit may not have any fastening devices such as a zipper (drawstrings on male jammers are allowed). Textile was defined as any open-mesh material like cotton, Nylon, Lycra, etc. The new regulations took effect on 1 January 2010, and the previous records set in non-textile suits remain valid. Goggles Thomas William Burgess wearing his motorcycle goggles in 1911 The first competitive swimmer to use goggles was Thomas William Burgess, during his crossing of the English Channel in 1911. His motorcycle goggles leaked water, yet they protected his eyes from water splashes during his breaststroke-only swim. In 1926, Gertrude Ederle also used motorcycle goggles when crossing the Channel. She swam crawl and therefore sealed her goggles with paraffin to render them water tight. Meanwhile, the vast majority of pool swimmers had no eye protection until the late 1960s, which limited their training time due to the eye irritation with disinfectants added to the pool water. When the first commercial goggles were introduced to competitive swimmers in 1968 they were met with limited success because of their fixed and rigid shape. Most swimmers could not fit them to their face and complained about leaks, especially after starts and turns. Only two years later David Wilkie became the first swimmer to use goggles in international pool competitions, at the 1970 Commonwealth Games. Goggles were first allowed at the Olympics in 1976, and many athletes used them in preparation at the 1972 Games. Caps Swimming caps were used since the early 1900s, when they were made of cotton, silk, or rubberized fabrics and often featured an \\"aviator- style\\" chin strap to hold the cap in place. Stretchable and water-tight latex caps became widely available in the 1920s and more durable and smooth silicone caps in the 1970s. Further efforts to improve silicone caps went into eliminating wrinkles, which resulted in the seamless caps and then in more rigid \\"racing dome\\" caps of globular shape.

Education and career  Iris Lillian Doerr Long was born December 8, 1934 in New York City, New York. Her family was of German descent. At Hunter College, she completed a bachelor of arts in 1955 and a master of arts in chemistry in 1964. Long worked as an organic chemist in several research hospitals, including eleven years at Sloan-Kettering, there she worked on developing nucleosides - experience that would later help her understand the workings of AZT drugs. She left Sloan-Kettering and earned her doctor of philosophy in 1972 at the University of Connecticut. Her dissertation was titled Lactones as Possible Carcinogens and Tumor Inhibitors. Long's doctoral advisor was Robert E. Willette. After her doctoral studies, Long worked briefly at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. She later ceased working professionally as a chemist, and was acting as a stay at home carer for her mother, who was unwell. It was during this time that she became aware of the AIDS crisis and the potential use of drugs similar to those she had worked on to treat it.  Activism  Despite having no connection to the gay community, or HIV/AIDS sufferers, Long began to volunteer with the Community Research Initiative (CRI), distributing drugs that could possibly help against the virus to those infected. Many of the drugs being taken were anti-cancer drugs. However, around March 1987 she attended a meeting of ACT-UP and was struck by the group's approach. She brought the group information on a clinical trial carried out on HIV positive patients by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and was able to explain the types of drugs being used. This proved to be her greatest gift; explaining the complex range of drugs out there to the group. Following this she helped for the Treatment and Data Committee to review medical information and report back to the larger group. She would go on to organize the AIDS Treatment Registry.

By mass, it is about 20 000 times sweeter than sucrose and about 110 times sweeter than aspartame.Nabors 2012, p. 2‚Äì3 It has no notable off- flavors when compared to sucrose and tastes sweet a bit longer than aspartame and is chemically more stable. It can be blended with many other natural and artificial sweeteners.Nabors 2012, p. 31‚Äì44 Advantame can be used as a table top sweetener and in certain bubblegums, flavored drinks, milk products, jams and confectionery among other things. In 2013, it was approved for use foods within EU with the E number E969. In 2014, FDA approved advantame as a non- nutritive sweetener and flavor enhancer within United States in foods generally, except meat and poultry. Safety The FDA acceptable daily intake of advantame for humans is 32.8 mg per kg of bodyweight (mg/kg bw), while according to EFSA it is 5 mg per kg of bodyweight (mg/kg bw). Estimated possible daily intakes from foods are well below these levels. NOAEL for humans is 500 mg/kg bw in EU. Ingested advantame can form phenylalanine, but normal use of advantame is not significant to those with phenylketonuria. It also has no adverse effects in type 2 diabetics. It is not considered to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. The Center for Science in the Public Interest ranks advantame as safe and Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association as generally recognized as safe. Sweetness Relative sweetness of advantame varies. It depends on the concentration and food/matrix in which it is used. In water solutions of advantame, that are equivalently sweet to water solutions of 3‚Äì14 percentage sucrose by weight (wt%), advantame is 7000‚Äì47700 times sweeter. Relative sweetness of advantame increases logarithmically as the sucrose concentration of a comparably sweet sucrose solution increases, but eventually reaches a plateau. By extrapolation, sweetness of an advantame water solution is estimated to reach a maximum at a concentration that is equivalent to a 15.8 wt% sucrose water solution. Chemistry Advantame is formally a secondary amine of aspartame and 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propanal (HMPA). Structurally advantame resembles a combination of aspartame and phyllodulcin. Advantame has 2 stereocenters and 4 stereoisomers. Advantame can be made from aspartame and vanillin. Vanillin is transformed to HMPA in 4 steps. 3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde (HMCA) is formed in the third step. HMCA is hydrogenated to HMPA in the final step. HMPA is selectively hydrogenated with palladium on aluminium oxide and platinum on carbon in one step to advantame in methanol with aspartame. Product is crystallized. Crude crystals are washed, recrystallized, washed and dried. At 15 ¬∞C the solubility of advantame is 0.76 g/l in water, 7.98 g/l in ethanol and 1.65 g/l in ethyl acetate. At 25 ¬∞C the solubilities are 0.99 g/l, 13.58 g/l and 2.79 g/l, respectively. At 40 ¬∞C the solubilities are 2.10 g/l, 38.27 g/l and 7.96 g/l, respectively. At 50 ¬∞C the solubilities are 3.10 g/l, 98.68 g/l and 16.00 g/l, respectively. Advantame as a dry powder degrades very slowly at 25 ¬∞C and 60% relative humidity and can last for years under such conditions. It can last for more than a year in aqueous solutions at pH 3.2. This corresponds to the typical pH of soft drinks. It degrades faster at higher temperatures and humidity, but is generally more stable than aspartame. Unlike aspartame, advantame doesn't form a diketopiperazine via intra- molecular cyclization due to steric hindrance by the vanillyl group. Metabolism In humans, 89% of the ingested advantame is excreted in feces and 6.2% in urine. Some is excreted unchanged, but most as metabolites. Advantame is poorly absorbed, rapidly metabolized and only small amounts of it and its metabolites can be detected in blood shortly after ingestion. 52% of the ingested dose is excreted in feces as de-esterified advantame and 30% as N-(3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl))propyl-L-aspartic acid and as an equivalent molar amount of phenylalanine. 1% of the ingested dose is excreted in urine as the aforementioned aspartic acid analog, 1.9% as 5-(3-aminopropyl)-2-methoxyphenyl and 2.3% as de-esterified advantame. Methanol forms in de-esterification, but this is considered insignificant at advantame concentrations intended to be used in foods, and in comparison to methanol naturally formed in body and to methanol naturally found in foods. History Ajinomoto developed advantame and announced its structure publicly in print in 2008. At first advantame was identified by the laboratory code ANS9801. Aspartame, neotame and aspartame N-substituted with asparagine via amide bond (covered in US patent 5,286,509) were selected as the lead compounds for research that lead to advantame.

This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The l-diversity model is an extension of the k-anonymity model which reduces the granularity of data representation using techniques including generalization and suppression such that any given record maps onto at least k-1 other records in the data. The l-diversity model handles some of the weaknesses in the k-anonymity model where protected identities to the level of k-individuals is not equivalent to protecting the corresponding sensitive values that were generalized or suppressed, especially when the sensitive values within a group exhibit homogeneity. The l-diversity model adds the promotion of intra-group diversity for sensitive values in the anonymization mechanism. Attacks on k-anonymity While k-anonymity is a promising approach to take for group based anonymization given its simplicity and wide array of algorithms that perform it, it is however susceptible to many attacks. When background knowledge is available to an attacker, such attacks become even more effective. Such attacks include: * Homogeneity Attack: This attack leverages the case where all the values for a sensitive value within a set of k records are identical. In such cases, even though the data has been k-anonymized, the sensitive value for the set of k records may be exactly predicted. * Background Knowledge Attack: This attack leverages an association between one or more quasi-identifier attributes with the sensitive attribute to reduce the set of possible values for the sensitive attribute. For example, Machanavajjhala, Kifer, Gehrke, and Venkitasubramaniam (2007) showed that knowing that heart attacks occur at a reduced rate in Japanese patients could be used to narrow the range of values for a sensitive attribute of a patient's disease. Formal definition Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred for k-anonymity data, the l-diversity method was created to further k-anonymity by additionally maintaining the diversity of sensitive fields. The book Privacy-Preserving Data Mining ‚Äì Models and Algorithms (2008) defines l-diversity as being: The paper t-Closeness: Privacy beyond k-anonymity and l-diversity (2007) defines l-diversity as being: Machanavajjhala et. al. (2007) define ‚Äúwell-represented‚Äù in three possible ways: # Distinct l-diversity ‚Äì The simplest definition ensures that at least l distinct values for the sensitive field in each equivalence class exist. # Entropy l-diversity ‚Äì The most complex definition defines Entropy of an equivalent class E to be the negation of summation of s across the domain of the sensitive attribute of p(E,s)log(p(E,s)) where p(E,s) is the fraction of records in E that have the sensitive value s. A table has entropy l-diversity when for every equivalent class E, Entropy(E) ‚â• log(l). # Recursive (c-l)-diversity ‚Äì A compromise definition that ensures the most common value does not appear too often while less common values are ensured to not appear too infrequently.

Preview.  Definition of policy networks  Although the number of definitions is almost as large as the number of approaches of analysis, Rhodes aims to offer a minimally exclusive starting point: \\"Policy networks are sets of formal institutional and informal linkages between governmental and other actors structured around shared if endlessly negotiated beliefs and interests in public policy making and implementation.\\"  Possible typologies of policy networks  As Thatcher notes, policy network approaches initially aimed to model specific forms of state-interest group relations, without giving exhaustive typologies. = Policy communities vs. Issue networks = The most widely used paradigm of the 1970s and 1980s only analyzed two specific types of policy networks: policy communities and issue networks. Justifications of the usage of these concepts were deduced from empirical case studies. Policy Communities in which you refer to relatively slowly changing networks defining the context of policy-making in specific policy segments. The network links are generally perceived as the relational ties between bureaucrats, politicians and interest groups. The main characteristic of policy communities ‚Äì compared to issue networks ‚Äì is that the boundaries of the networks are more stable and more clearly defined. This concept was studied in the context of policy-making in the United Kingdom. In contrast, issue networks ‚Äì a concept established in literature about United States government - refer to a looser system, where a relatively large number of stakeholders are involved. Non-government actors in these networks usually include not only interest group representatives but also professional or academic experts. An important characteristic of issue network is that membership is constantly changing, interdependence is often asymmetric and ‚Äì compared to policy communities ‚Äì it is harder to identify dominant actors. = Other possible typologies = New typological approaches appeared in the early 1990s and late 1980s with the aim of grouping policy networks into a system of mutually exclusive and commonly exhaustive categories. One possible logic of typology is based on the degree of integration, membership size and distribution of resources in the network. This categorization ‚Äì perhaps most importantly represented by R. A. W. Rhodes ‚Äì allows the combination of policy communities and issue networks with categories like professional network, intragovernmental network and producer network. Other approaches identify categories based on distinct patterns of state-interest group relations. Patterns include corporatism and pluralism, iron triangles, subgovernment and clientelism while the differentiation is based on membership, stability and sectorality.  Roles of policy network analysis  As the field of policy network analysis grew since the late 20th century, scholars developed competing descriptive, theoretical and prescriptive accounts. Each type gives different specific content for the term policy network and uses different research methodologies. = Descriptive usage = For several authors, policy networks describe specific forms of government policy-making. The three most important forms are interest intermediation, interorganizational analysis, and governance.  Interest intermediation  An approach developed from the literature on US pluralism, policy networks are often analyzed in order to identify the most important actors influencing governmental decision-making. From this perspective, a network-based assessment is useful to describe power positions, the structure of oligopoly in political markets, and the institutions of interest negotiation.  Interorganizational analysis  Another branch of descriptive literature, which emerged from the study of European politics, aims to understand the interdependency in decision-making between formal political institutions and the corresponding organizational structures. This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of overlapping organizational responsibilities and the distribution of power in shaping specific policy outcomes.  Governance  A third direction of descriptive scholarship is to describe general patterns of policy-making ‚Äì the formal institutions of power-sharing between government, independent state bodies and the representatives of employer and labor interests. Text. = Theoretical usage = The two most important theoretical approaches aiming to understand and explain actor's behavior in policy networks are the following: power dependence and rational choice.  Power dependence  In power dependence models, policy networks are understood as mechanism of exchanging resources between organizations in the networks. The dynamic of exchange is determined by the comparative value of resources (f.e. legal, political or financial in nature) and individual capacities to deploy them in order create better bargaining positions and achieve higher degrees of autonomy.  Rational Choice  In policy network analysis, theorists complement standard rational choice arguments with the insights of new institutionalism. This \\"actor-centered institutionalism\\" is used to describe policy networks as structural arrangements between relatively stable sets of public and private players. Rational choice theorists identify links between network actors as channels to exchange multiple goods (f.e. knowledge, resources and information). = Prescriptive usage = The prescriptive literature on policy networks focuses on the phenomenon's role in constraining or enabling certain governmental action. From this viewpoint, networks are seen as central elements of the realm of policy-making at least partially defining the desirability of status quo ‚Äì thus a possible target of reform initiatives. The three most common network management approaches are the following: instrumental (a focus on altering dependency relation), institutional (a focus on rules, incentives and culture) and interactive (a focus on communication and negotiation).  New directions and debates  As Rhodes points out, there is a long-lasting debate in the field about general theories predicting the emergence of specific networks and corresponding policy outcomes depending on specific conditions. No theories have succeeded in achieving this level of generality yet and some scholars doubt they ever will. Other debates are focusing on describing and theorizing change in policy networks. While some political scientists state that this might not be possible, other scholars have made efforts towards the understanding of policy network dynamics. One example is the advocacy coalition framework, which aims to analyze the effect of commonly represented beliefs (in coalitions) on policy outcomes.

It is located in barangay Panal, Tabaco City, Albay. History It was founded in 1945, right after the liberation period when competition courses where then in order. Because of the ravages of war, the Albay High School under the principalship of Mr. Benigno Reyes was temporarily transferred to Tabaco at the Qua Chee Gan Building, but graduation exercises that year were held in Albay. When classes opened the following year, there was a move to return the Albay High School to Legazpi, but prominent citizens of the province opposed the movement. Spearheaded by Congressman Casimiro Binamira, the former Governor Saturnino Benito, the late Atty. Simplicio B. Pe√±a, and local and provincial leaders worked for the retention of the high school in Tabaco. They succeeded and Mr. Pastor Escalante was appointed principal of that Albay High School in Tabaco. However, due to the problem of the buildings, school necessities and other things, classes were shifted from Qua Chee Gan to Golinco and later to Poblete Buildings with students furnishing the school necessities such as chairs and tables. That school year was remarkable, for the first High School day was celebrated with Marichu Crisol reigning as Miss Tabaco High School. However, happy things for the Tabaque√±os ceased as they stood in protest against another move of returning Tabaco Albay High School to its former site. Again the people of Tabaco were backed up by the prominent professionals. The first record rallies in the locality were held at the town plaza. The people stood as one and succeeded in swaying the government to a worthy cause. But the enthusiastic people of Tabaco were not contented with the establishment of A.H.S. in Tabaco. So, they worked much harder and more cohesively. With the first PTA President Dr. Mariano Cruel, the members of the PTA created Emergency Committee headed by Fr. Rustico Burce with equally industrious members such as Mr. Narciso Baclao, Mrs. Narcisa A. Alparce and Mrs. Piedad R. Almonte to raise funds for a permanent school site.

In the heavily Democratic year of 1974, he was the GOP sacrificial lamb in the gubernatorial race against the incumbent George Wallace, who won the third of his four terms in the office. Background McCary was a son of Cicero Columbus McCary (1877-1948) and the former Annie Mae Power (1890-1944). He attended public schools in Anniston in Calhoun County in northeastern Alabama. He graduated in Anniston from Jacksonville State University, then known as Jacksonville State Normal School, and then New York University. He then returned to Anniston to engage in the real estate business and became involved in community and political matters. Political life McCary served in both houses of the Alabama State Legislature but the dates are uncertain, based on the newspaper stories at the time of his 1981 death. McCary ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Alabama in 1946; the office was won instead by another Democrat, James C. Inzer. McCary attributed his switch in parties to the need for a combination of political reform and the establishment of a two-party system in his native state. Forrest French, a former Calhoun County Republican chairman, described McCary, accordingly, as \\"frank, full of candor, and we agreed in the party approach to politics. ... He constituted the [party] framework that was in existence even in the lean times.\\" After his race against Wallace in which he polled less than 15 percent of the ballots cast, McCary said that despite his expected defeat, he believed that he had \\"accomplished my purpose. And I think the only hope for the Republican Party at the state level is to offer the voters a choice for all offices in all elections.\\" Though the Alabama GOP had offered no nominee against George Wallace in either 1962 or 1970, it had fielded then U.S. Representative James D. Martin of Alabama's 7th congressional district in the 1966 general election against Wallace's first wife and political stand-in, Lurleen Wallace. At that time, Alabama governors could not succeed themselves.Billy Hathorn, \\"James Douglas Martin and the Alabama Republican Resurgence, 1962-1965\\", Gulf Coast Historical Review, Vol. 8, No. 2 (Spring 1993), pp. 68-69 McCary was a close friend of Democrat James B. Allen, a two-term lieutenant governor who was elected in 1968 to the United States Senate. Allen supported Wallace in 1974; Wallace subsequently appointed Allen's second wife, Maryon Pittman Allen, to fill the remaining months of Allen's term after the senator's unexpected death on June 1, 1978. McCary ran in the special election to choose Allen's successor for a two-year term but was defeated, 72-28 percent, by intraparty rival, George W. Nichols. Nichols then withdrew from the contest, and James D. Martin of Gadsden replaced him as the nominee; Martin lost, 55-43 percent, to Democrat Donald W. Stewart of Anniston, who had defeated Maryon Allen in the special Democratic primary. After years of political failure, McCary lived to see a Republican breakthrough in Alabama in 1980 with the victories of Ronald Reagan as U.S. President and retired Admiral Jeremiah Denton to the same U.S. Senate seat earlier filled by Allen and sought by McCary.Billy Hathorn, \\"A Dozen Years in the Political Wilderness: The Alabama Republican Party, 1966‚Äì1978\\", Gulf Coast Historical Review, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring 1994), pp. 34-36 Personal life About 1960, at the age of fifty-three, McCary wed the former Margaret Pauline Waters (1922-2004), a native of Detroit, Michigan, who moved to Alabama for her senior year of high school. From 1943 until their divorce in 1959, she was married to James Dillard Sloan, Sr. (1920-1988), the father of McCary's stepson, Anniston lawyer and former Circuit Judge James D. Sloan, Jr. (born c. 1944). McCary had two daughters, from a previous marriage, Eileen M. Cline, formerly of Troy, Virginia, and from the second marriage, Anne Margaret McCary Childers (born c. 1967) of Gadsden. Anne Childers is the widow of Ted Childers (c. 1960-2012) and the mother of three children. McCary was affiliated with the Episcopal Church of St. Michael and All Angels in Anniston.

He won the show's 28th season, Survivor: Cagayan, as well as the 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War, the first all-winners season. In the interim, he competed in the 34th season, Survivor: Game Changers, where he was the second person voted out. As a Survivor player, he was noted for his strategic, dominant gameplay, with which he was able to manipulate other contestants while avoiding being voted against at Tribal Council, as well as his humor. Vlachos is also known for his long-lasting \\"Cops R' Us\\" partnership with fellow contestant and police officer Sarah Lacina, who won Survivor: Game Changers, the two participating in the same three seasons they appeared on. In February 2015, following Vlachos' first season on the show, Survivor host Jeff Probst published a list of his \\"Top 10 Survivor Winners of All Time,\\" ranking Vlachos fourth, stating that he had \\"never seen anyone play with that much energy and juggle that many balls at once, and pull it all off.\\" Upon winning the 40th season and its accompanying $2 million prize, Vlachos became the first man to win Survivor twice (and second person altogether after Sandra Diaz-Twine). He has won the most amount of money from Survivor among all contestants, totaling just over $3 million across his three seasons. Martin Holmes of Vulture called Vlachos the \\"King of Survivor\\", a counterpart to Diaz-Twine's \\"Queen\\". Personal life Vlachos was born on September 10, 1973, the son of Greek immigrants. He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, idolizing law enforcement officers, and dreamed of one day becoming one. He graduated high school in 1992 and spent several years working in various different jobs while \\"partying\\" with his friends and working on his automobiles. He states that despite this recreational period in his life, he did not smoke, drink alcohol, or do drugs. He began bodybuilding when he was 20, an activity with which he says he was \\"obsessed\\". He began working out in his basement with plastic weights filled with sand, and graduated to iron weights in about a year. In 2000, Vlachos became a Jersey City police officer. On February 5, 2014, he saved a 69-year- old man who had a massive heart attack on his lawn in nine inches of snow. In 2007, Vlachos began dating a fellow police officer named Marissa Ann. They dated for approximately three years before he proposed to her on July 24, 2010. They married on June 2, 2012, and their daughter, Anastasia Marie, was born on February 16, 2013, five months before Vlachos left to film Survivor: Cagayan. Two months after arriving home, Vlachos and Marissa discovered she was two months pregnant with their second child, a son they named Constantine Anthony, who was born on June 9, 2014.Helling, Steve (June 10, 2014). \\"Tony Vlachos Welcomes Son Constantine Anthony\\". People. As of 2019, Vlachos is a resident of Allendale, New Jersey. Survivor =Cagayan= Vlachos was cast on the 28th season of the CBS reality television show Survivor. The theme of the season was Brawn vs. Brains vs. Beauty. Vlachos was cast as a \\"brawn\\" and started out on the Aparri tribe. Before the first tribal swap, Aparri dominated the immunity challenges and did not go to tribal council. During this time, Vlachos formed an alliance, dubbed \\"Cops-R-Us\\", with fellow police officer Sarah Lacina. Despite this alliance, Vlachos lied to Lacina about his profession, claiming he was a construction worker. Vlachos also became close with Trish Hegarty and was wary of the popularity of former NBA All-Star Clifford Robinson. Vlachos was able to find the Aparri tribe's hidden immunity idol with help of the clue he found in the reward they received after winning a challenge. At the final tribal council, the jury ultimately chose him as the winner with a vote of 8-1, beating martial arts instructor Woo Hwang. Aftermath In March 2020, Briana Kranich, writing for Screen Rant, ranked Survivor: Cagayan the best season Survivor. In a 2015 interview, host Jeff Probst listed Vlachos as one of his top 10 favorite Survivor winners ever, and one of his top 6 favorite male winners, commenting, \\"I like Tony because he's unlike any winner we've ever had. He's the Tasmanian Devil. He played an incredibly reckless game, but he was so gifted that he could make a mistake and recover because he was lapping you so that he was able to actually catch back up and fix his mistake. It's almost like he had his own time machine. I've never seen anyone play with that much energy and juggle that many balls at once, and pull it all off.\\" In 2016, Vlachos became a part of the Survivor Hall of Fame, along with Tina Wesson and Rupert Boneham. Due to Xfinity TV's discontinuation of the award in 2017, he is the newest Survivor player (by season recency) to be inducted. =Game Changers= At the end of the reunion show for the 33rd season, Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X, Vlachos was confirmed to be a participant in the 34th season: Survivor: Game Changers.Dehnart, Andy. (May 21, 2016).\\"Survivor 34 cast identified; chaotic casting changes its twist\\". Reality Blurred. Vlachos adapted his style to approach the season with a gameplay distinct from his Cagayan strategy, which involved an alliance with fellow police officer Sarah Lacina, surveillance from a spy nest, orchestrating attacks upon vulnerable targets, beginning his search for idols immediately after arriving at the beach in full view of his tribemates, framing others by planting an idol in someone else's belongings, and feigning an intimate personal bond with multiple tribe members. Dalton Ross, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called this strategy \\"one of the most aggressive games ever.\\" However, when he informed Diaz-Twine about his spy nest, she informed other tribe members, and ultimately campaigned to have him voted out. Despite this, Vlachos later stated in an interview with CBS that because she was voted out after him, the two of them became friends during the considerable time they spent on the pre-jury trip to Vietnam. In a January 2020 interview, he stated that losing Game Changers helped prepare him for Winners at War. = Winners at War = During the promotional trailer for the season during the reunion show for the 39th season, Survivor: Island of the Idols, Vlachos was confirmed to be a participant in the 40th season: Survivor: Winners at War. Vlachos started on the Dakal tribe. At the final tribal council, he garnered 12 of the 16 jury votes, making him the show's second two-time winner, and earning him the season's $2 million reward.Benutty, John; Dixon, Marucs James (May 13, 2020). \\"'Survivor‚Äô 40 finale recap: Who won ‚ÄòWinners at War‚Äô ‚Äî Ben, Denise, Michele, Sarah, Tony or Edge of Extinction returnee?\\" GoldDerby.

According to biographer Pirenne, Hecht was a \\"brilliant lecturer and expositor.\\" Pirenne continues, :The lack of synthesis discernible in present-day knowledge and teaching perturbed him, and he took an active interest in all the human implications of science. He dealt with persons and ideas on the basis of their intrinsic worth,... Explaining the atom When World War II ended with the use of atomic weapons which had been developed in secret by the Manhattan Project, Hecht was concerned that the American public was uninformed about the development of this new source of energy. He wrote a book Explaining the Atom (1947), to educate the public. He wrote, :So long as one supposes this business is mysterious and secret, one cannot have a just evaluation of our possessions and security.

Women in the Second World War took on many different roles during the War, including as combatants and workers on the home front. The Second World War involved global conflict on an unprecedented scale; the absolute urgency of mobilizing the entire population made the expansion of the role of women inevitable, although the particular roles varied from country to country. Millions of women of various ages died as a result of the war. World patterns Several hundred thousand women served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The Soviet Union, for example, integrated women directly into their army units. The United States, by comparison, elected not to use women in combat because public opinion would not tolerate it.D'Ann Campbell, online edition \\"Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union\\", Journal of Military History (April 1993), 57:301-323 Instead, like in other nations, approximately 350,000 women served as uniformed auxiliaries in non-combat roles in the U.S. armed forces. These roles included: administration, nurses, truck drivers, mechanics, electricians, and auxiliary pilots. Women also took part outside of formal military structure in the resistances of France, Italy, and Poland, as well as in the British SOE and American OSS which aided these. Women were forced into sexual slavery; the Imperial Japanese Army forced hundreds of thousands in Asia to become comfort women, before and throughout World War II. Allies =Australia= Australian women played a larger role in World War 2 than they had done in World War I. Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942. =Canada= roundhouse jobs during World War II. Photo taken January, 1943. When war began to look unavoidable in the late 1930s, Canadian women felt obligated to help the fight. In October 1938, the Women's Volunteer Service was established in Victoria, British Columbia. Soon, all the provinces and territories followed suit and similar volunteer groups were emerged. \\"Husbands, brothers, fathers, boyfriends were all joining up, doing something to help win the war. Surely women could help as well!\\"Gossage, Carolyn. ‚Äò‚ÄôGreatcoats and Glamour Boots‚Äô‚Äô. (Toronto:Dundurn Press Limited, 1991) In addition to the Red Cross, several volunteer corps had designed themselves after auxiliary groups from Britain. These corps had uniforms, marching drills and a few had rifle training. It became clear, that a unified governing system would be beneficial to the corps. The volunteers in British Columbia donated two dollars each to pay the expenses so a representative could talk to politicians in Ottawa. Although all of the politicians appeared sympathetic to the cause, it remained \\"premature\\" in terms of national necessity. In June 1941, the Canadian Women's Army Corps was established. The women who enlisted would take over *Drivers of light mechanical transport vehicles *Cooks in hospitals and messes *Clerks, typists, and stenographers at camps and training centres *Telephone operators and messengers *Canteen helpers On July 2, 1942 women were given permission to enlist in what would be known as the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Lastly the Royal Canadian Navy created the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service (WRENS). The WRENS were the only corps that were officially a part of their sanctioning body as a women's division. This led to bureaucratic issues that would be solved most easily by absorbing the civilian corps governed by military organizations, into women's divisions as soldiers. According to the RCAF the following are the requirements of an enlisted woman: #Must be at least 18 years of age, and younger than 41 years of age #Must be of medical category A4B (equivalent of A1) #Must be equal to or over 5 feet (152 cm), and fall within the appropriate weight for her height, not being too far above or below the standard #Must have a minimum education of entrance into high school #Be able to pass the appropriate trades test #Be of good character with no record of conviction for an indictable offence Women would not be considered for enlistment if they were married and had children dependent on them. Training centres were required for all of the new recruits. They could not be sent to the existing centres as it was necessary that they be separated from male recruits. The Canadian Women's Army Corps set up centres in Vermilion, Alberta and Kitchener, Ontario. Ottawa and Toronto were the locations of the training centres for the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force. The WRENS were outfitted in Galt, Ontario. Each service had to come up with the best possible appeal to the women joining, for they all wanted them. In reality, the women went where their fathers, brothers and boyfriends were. Women had numerous reasons for wanting to join the effort; whether they had a father, husband, or brother in the forces, or simply felt it a duty to help. One woman blatantly exclaimed that she could not wait to turn eighteen to enlist, because she had fantasies of assassinating Hitler. Many women aged 16 or 17 lied about their age in order to enlist. The United States would allow only women who were at least twenty-one to join. For their young female citizens, Canada was the logical option. Recruitment for the different branches of the Canadian Forces was set up in places like Boston and New York. Modifications were made to girls with US citizenship, having their records marked, \\"Oath of allegiance not taken by virtue of being a citizen of The United States of America\\". Women had to undergo to medical examinations and meet fitness requirements as well as training in certain trades, depending on the aspect of the armed forces of which they wanted to be a part. Enlisted women were issued entire uniforms minus the undergarments, for which they would receive a quarterly allowance. To be an enlisted woman during the creation stages was not easy. Besides the fact that everyone was learning as they went, they did not receive the support they needed from the male recruits. To begin with, women were initially paid two-thirds of what a man at the same level would make. As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man. A female doctor however, would receive equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in propaganda films. Proudly She Marches and Wings on Her Shoulder were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, they would be able to retain their femininity. Other problems faced early on for these women were those of a more racial nature. An officer of the CWAC had to write to her superiors regarding whether or not a girl of \\"Indian nationality\\" would be objected to for enlistment. Because of Canada's large population of immigrants, German women also enlisted, creating great animosity between recruits. The biggest difficulty was the French- Canadian population. In a document published on the 25 November 1941, it was declared that enlisted women should \\"unofficially\\" speak English. However, seeing the large number of capable women that this left out, a School of English was stabled for recruits in mid-1942. In 1942, Mary Greyeyes-Reid became the first First Nations woman to join the Canadian Forces. She was featured in photographs to represent native people in the forces, yet at the same time was not welcome in the barracks due to discrimination. Once in training, some women felt that they had made a mistake. Several women cracked under the pressure and were hospitalized. Other women felt the need to escape, and ran away. The easiest and fastest way out of the service was pregnancy. Women who found out that they were expecting were given a special, quickly executed, discharge. The women who successfully graduated from training had to find ways to entertain themselves to keep morale up. Softball, badminton, tennis, and hockey were among popular pastimes for recruits. Religion was of a personal matter to the recruits. A minister of sorts was usually on site for services. For Jewish women, it was custom that they were able to get back to their barracks by sundown on Sabbath and holidays; a rabbi would be made available if possible. At the beginning of the war 600,000 women in Canada held permanent jobs in the private sector, by the peak in 1943 1.2 million women had jobs.Veterans Affairs Canada, \\"Women at War,\\" Government of Canada, 2013-08-02 Women quickly gained a good reputation for their mechanical dexterity and fine precision due to their smaller stature. Women also had to keep their homes together while the men were away. \\"An Alberta mother of nine boys, all away at either war or factory jobs ‚Äì drove the tractor, plowed the fields, put up hay, and hauled grain to the elevators, along with tending her garden, raising chickens, pigs, and turkeys, and canned hundreds of jars of fruits and vegetables\\". In addition to physical jobs, women were also asked to cut back and ration. Silk and nylon were used for the war efforts, creating a shortage of stockings. Many women painted lines down the back of their legs to create the illusion of wearing the fashionable stockings of the time. =India= Women train to become officers of the Indian Women's Auxiliary Corps Women train for air raid precaution (ARP) duties in Bombay, 1942 In India, policies resembled those of Great Britain, except that women were not used in anti-aircraft units, and there was no conscription of women for munitions work.Yasmin Khan, The Raj At War: A People's History Of India's Second World War (2015) The Women's Auxiliary Corps operated from 1939 to 1947, with peak strength of 850 officers and 7,200 auxiliaries in the Indian army. A small naval section operated in the Royal Indian Navy.Alan Harfield, \\"The Women's Auxiliary Corps (India),\\" Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research 83, no 335 (Autumn 2005), pp 243-254 The nationalist movements in India during the war split on military service. Mahatma Gandhi opposed fascism and on his advice youths from India joined the armed forces to fight with Britain along with allies. One faction of Congress led by Subhas Chandra Bose was so opposed that it cooperated with Nazi Germany, and actually enlisted soldiers who fought alongside Japanese soldiers against the British and Indians in Burma. The \\"Rani of Jhansi Regiment\\" involved these women in combat on behalf of the Indian National Army. It was active from 1943-45. Bose spent a good deal of effort on him developing anti-British anti-imperialist ideology designed to mobilize models of women as mothers and sisters in Indian tradition. Bose argued that the direct involvement of women was necessary to achieve total independence of India from the colonial powers. Bose articulated a modern definition of female heroism that involved combat. In actual practice, very few of his female soldiers were directly involved in combat; they largely had support roles in logistics and medical care.Carol Hills and Daniel C. Silverman, 1993. ‚ÄúNationalism and Feminism in Late Colonial India: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment‚Äù, Modern Asian Studies 27#4 (1993) pp 741-760.Joyce C. Lebra, Women Against the Raj: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2008). =Italy= After 1943 Italian women joined the anti-fascist resistance, and also served in the fascist army of Mussolini's rump state that formed in 1943. They did not serve in the main Italian army. Some 35,000 women (and 170,000 men) joined in the Resistance. The women were used as auxiliary support and were not allowed in senior ranks. Most did cooking and laundry duty. Some were guides, messengers, and couriers near the front lines. A few were attached to small attack groups of five or six men engaged in sabotage. Some all-female units, engaged in civilian and political action. The Germans aggressively tried to suppress them, sending 5000 to prison, deporting 3000 to Germany. About 650 died in combat or by execution. On a much larger scale, non-military auxiliaries of the Catholic Centro Italiano Femminile (CIF) and the leftist Unione Donne Italiane (UDI) were new organizations that gave women political legitimacy after the war.Dan A. D'Amelio, \\"Italian Women In The Resistance, World War II,\\" Italian Americana, 19#2 (2001), 127-141. =Poland= 1939 Invasion of Poland, 1939, among their colleagues interred at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Cemetery The Polish military maintained a number of Women's Military Assistance Battalions, trained by the Przysposobienie Wojskowe Kobiet (Female Military Training) and commanded by Maria Wittek. During the Invasion of Poland they saw combat, playing auxiliary roles in defensive action. Janina Lewandowska was a pilot. Marianna Cel was a member of Henryk Dobrza≈Ñski's guerilla unit 1939-1940. Underground Krystyna Skarbek worked for Polish underground in Hungary and later joined SOE. Writer Zofia Kossak- Szczucka helped Jews during the Holocaust, was arrested and imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Wanda Jakubowska survived Auschwitz and directed The Last Stage, a concentration camp film. El≈ºbieta Zawacka was a paratrooper, courier and fighter. Gra≈ºyna Lipi≈Ñska organised an intelligence network in Germany occupied Belarus 1942-1944. In occupied Poland women played an important role in the resistance movement. Their most important role was as couriers carrying messages between cells of the resistance movement and distributing news broadsheets and operating clandestine printing presses. During partisan attacks on Nazi forces and installations they served as scouts. About 40,000 of Polish women were imprisoned in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Zofia Posmysz survived two camps and described her story, inspiring Passenger 1953 film. Wanda Jakubowska was imprisoned in Auschwitz and after the war directed a classic film The Last Stage. Jewish women fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and several smaller fights.Yad Vashem, Partisans and Underground The Stroop Report contains a picture of HeHalutz female fighters captured with weapons. During the Warsaw Rising of 1944, female members of the Home Army were couriers and medics, but many carried weapons and took part in the fighting. Among the more notable women of the Home Army was Wanda Gertz who created and commanded DYSK (Women's sabotage unit). For her bravery in these activities and later in the Warsaw Uprising she was awarded Poland's highest awards - Virtuti Militari and Polonia Restituta. Many nurses were murdered on September the 2nd, 1944. Anna ≈öwirszczy≈Ñska was a nurse and expected to be executed. She described later the Rising in her poems. One of the articles of the capitulation was that the German Army recognized them as full members of the armed forces and needed to set up separate prisoner-of-war camps to hold over 2000 female prisoners-of-war. Ma≈Çgorzata Fornalska was one of important Communist activists, arrested and killed by Germans. Helena Woli≈Ñska-Brus was influential in Communist underground Gwardia Ludowa, later Armia Ludowa. Many female teachers organized underground education. Many women worked for ≈ªegota: Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, Irena Sendler, Antonina ≈ªabi≈Ñska. Armed forces A number of all-female units in the Polish forces in exile were also established. These included the Anders Army, the Women's Auxiliary Service which was deployed in Italy and served across the Polish Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Soviet First Polish Army had the Emilia Plater Independent Women's Battalion, whose members took part in fighting as part of sentry duties. Extermination *The Holocaust Stefania Wilczy≈Ñska cooperated with Janusz Korczak working in a Jewish orphanage in Warsaw Ghetto, they died in Treblinka extermination camp. *Romani genocide *Gentiles Thousands of women were killed during Pacification actions in German-occupied Poland. Tens of thousands were killed by Ukrainian nationalists in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. Tens of thousands of non-Jewish women were shot in August 1944 at Warsaw during Ochota massacre and Wola massacre. Concentration camps and slave work Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, Seweryna Szmaglewska, Krystyna ≈ªywulska were imprisoned in Auschwitz and later described their experiences in novels. Many women were Zivilarbeiters or camp or prison inmates who had to work for Germans. There existed a camp for girls in Dzier≈ºƒÖzna, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship, a subcamp of the Polen-Jugendverwahrlager der Sicherheitspolizei in Litzmannstadt. Babies born by the prisoners were starved in Nazi birthing centres for foreign workers.

More than 800,000 women served in the Soviet Armed Forces during the war, which is roughly 3 percent of total military personnel, mostly as medics.The United States Military Academy (2015). \\"West Point History of World War II, Vol. 1\\"Bernard A. Cook (2006). \\"Women and war: a historical encyclopedia from antiquity to the present\\". ABC-CLIO. p.546. About 300,000 served in anti-aircraft units and performed all functions in the batteries‚Äîincluding firing the guns.Campbell 1993K.

Women also saw combat in infantry and armored units, and female snipers became famous after commander Lyudmila Pavlichenko made a record killing 309 Germans (mostly officers and enemy snipers). =Great Britain= The Monument to the Women of World War II, London Workplace When Britain went to war, as before in World War I, previously forbidden job opportunities opened up for women. Women were called into the factories to create the weapons that were used on the battlefield.Carruthers, Susan L. \\"'Manning the Factories': Propaganda and Policy on the Employment of Women, 1939-1947.\\" History 75.244 (1990): 232-56. Web. Women took on the responsibility of managing the home and became the heroines of the home front. According to Carruthers, this industrial employment of women significantly raised women's self-esteem as it allowed them to carry out their full potential and do their part in the war. During the war, women's normative roles of \\"house wife\\" transformed into a patriotic duty. As Carruthers put it, the housewife has become a heroine in the defeat of Hitler. The roles of women shifting from domestic to masculine and dangerous jobs in the workforce made for important changes in workplace structure and society. During the Second World War, society had specific ideals for the jobs in which both women and men participated. When women began to enter into the masculine workforce and munitions industries previously dominated by men, women's segregation began to diminish. Increasing numbers of women were forced into industry jobs between 1940-1943.Gazeley, Ian. \\"Women‚Äôs pay in British Industry during the second world War.\\" Economic History Review. (2008): 651-671. Web. As surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, the percentage of women in industrial jobs went from 19.75 per cent to 27 per cent from 1938-1945. It was very difficult for women to spend their days in factories, and then come home to their domestic chores and care-giving, and as a result, many women were unable to hold their jobs in the workplace. Britain underwent a labour shortage where an estimated 1.5 million people were needed for the armed forces, and an additional 775,000 for munitions and other services in 1942. It was during this \\"labour famine\\" that propaganda aimed to induce people to join the labour force and do their bit in the war. Women were the target audience in the various forms of propaganda because they were paid substantially less than men. It was of no concern whether women were filling the same jobs that men previously held. Even if women were replacing jobs with the same skill level as a man, they were still paid significantly less due to their gender. In the engineering industry alone, the number of skilled and semi-skilled female workers increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent from 1940-1942. According to Gazeley, even though women were paid less than men, it is clear that women engaging in war work and taking on jobs preserved by men reduced industrial segregation. A female machinist talking with Eleanor Roosevelt during her goodwill tour of Great Britain in 1942 Pte Elizabeth Gourlay transmitting a radio message. Queen Elizabeth in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, April 1945 In Britain, women were essential to the war effort. The contribution by civilian men and women to the British war effort was acknowledged with the use of the words \\"home front\\" to describe the battles that were being fought on a domestic level with rationing, recycling, and war work, such as in munitions factories and farms and men were thus released into the military. Women were also recruited to work on the canals, transporting coal and munitions by barge across the UK via the inland waterways. These became known as the \\"Idle Women\\", initially an insult derived from the initials IW, standing for Inland Waterways, which they wore on their badges, but the term was soon adopted by the women themselves. Many women served with the Women's Auxiliary Fire Service, the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps and in the Air Raid Precautions (later Civil Defence) services. Others did voluntary welfare work with Women's Voluntary Services and the Salvation Army. Women were \\"drafted\\" in the sense that they were conscripted into war work by the Ministry of Labour, including non-combat jobs in the military, such as the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS or \\"Wrens\\"), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF or \\"Waffs\\") and the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). Auxiliary services such as the Air Transport Auxiliary also recruited women.Shelford Bidwell, The Women's Royal Army Corps (London, 1977) In the early stages of the war such services relied exclusively on volunteers, however by 1941 conscription was extended to women for the first time in British history and around 600,000 women were recruited into these three organizations. In these organizations women performed a wide range of jobs in support of the Army, Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy both overseas and at home. These jobs ranged from traditionally feminine roles like cook, clerk and telephonist to more traditionally masculine duties like mechanic, armourer, searchlight and anti-aircraft instrument operator. British women were not drafted into combat units, but could volunteer for combat duty in anti- aircraft units, which shot down German planes and V-1 missiles.See Campbell 1993Frederick Arthur Pile, Ack-Ack (London, 1949), Civilian women joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which used them in high-danger roles as secret agents and underground radio operators in Nazi occupied Europe.Nigel West, Secret War: Story of S.O.E. (1993) Propaganda British Women's Propaganda was issued during the war in attempts to communicate to the house- wife that while keeping the domestic role, she must also take on a political role of patriotic duty.Gingrich, Nadine. \\"\\"Every Man Who Dies, Dies for You and Me. See You Be Worthy\\": The Image of the Hero as Rhetorical Motivation in Unofficial War Propaganda, 1914-1918\\" War, Literature & the Arts: An International Journal of the Humanities. November 1, (2005): 108-117. Web. Propaganda was meant to eliminate all conflicts of personal and political roles and create a heroine out of the women. The implication with propaganda is that it asked women to redefine their personal and domestic ideals of womanhood and motivate them go against the roles that have been instilled in them. The government struggled to encourage women to respond to posters and other forms of propaganda. One attempt to recruit women into the labour force was in one short film My Father's Daughter. In this propaganda film a wealthy factory owner's daughter begs to do her part in the war, but her father carries the stereotypical belief that women are meant to be caretakers and are incapable of such heavy work. When one foreman presents one of the most valuable and efficient workers in the factory as the daughter, the father's prejudices are eliminated. The encouraging message of this short film is \\"There's Not Much Women Can't Do\\". Military roles The most common role of women in active service was that of a searchlight operator.De Groot, Gerard J. \\"\`I Love the Scent of Cordite in Your Hair': Gender Dynamics in Mixed Anti- Craft Batteries\\". History 82.265 (1997): 73-92. Web. All of the members of the 93rd Searchlight Regiment were women. Despite being limited in their roles, there was a great amount of respect between the men and women in the mixed batteries. One report states \\"Many men were amazed that women could make adequate gunners despite their excitable temperament, lack of technical instincts, their lack of interest in aeroplanes and their physical weaknesses\\". While women still faced discrimination from some of the highly stereotypical older soldiers and officers who did not like women \\"playing with their guns\\", women were given rifle practice and taught to use anti-aircraft guns while serving in their batteries. They were told that this was in case the Germans invaded. If that were to ever happen, they would be evacuated immediately. ATS spotter at a 3.7-inch AA gun site, December 1942 WAAF nursing orderlies selected to fly on air-ambulance duties to France, 1944 Three quarters of women who entered the wartime forces were volunteers, compared to men who made up less than a third. Single or married women were eligible to volunteer in WAAF, ATS or WRNS and were required to serve throughout Britain as well as overseas if needed, however the age limits set by the services varied from each other. Generally women between 17 and 43 could volunteer and those under 18 required parental consent. After applying, applicants had to fulfill other requirements, including an interview and medical examination; if they were deemed fit to serve then they were enrolled for the duration of the war. WRNS was the only service that offered an immobile branch which allowed women to live in their homes and work in the local naval establishment. WRNS was the smallest of the three organizations and as a result was very selective with their candidates. Of the three organizations, WAAF was the most preferred choice; the second being WRNS. ATS was the largest of the three organizations and was least favoured among women because it accepted those who were unable to get into the other forces. ATS had also developed a reputation of promiscuity and poor living conditions, many women also found the khaki uniform unappealing and as a result favoured WRNS and WAAF over ATS. Over 640,000 British women served in various auxiliary services of the British armed forces.https://www.csmonitor.com/The- Culture/2018/0525/From-paranurses-to-snipers-Exhibit-focuses-on-women-s-WWII- contributions Limitations Whilst women were limited in some of their roles, they were expected to perform to the same standard as a male soldier performing the same role, and although they could not participate in frontline combat, they still manned anti-aircraft guns and defences which actively engaged hostile aircraft above Britain. Women went through the same military training, lived in the same conditions and did almost the same jobs as men, with the exception of not being able to participate in front-line combat. This important distinction meant that women did not tend to be nominated for medals of valour or bravery, because they were only awarded for \\"active operations against enemy in the field\\", which women could not take part in. Women were also distinct because of the titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to be no different from their male counterparts. They wore the same rank insignia as their male counterparts. Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached to despite their different insignia. The only major difference between an ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman was not allowed to be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the female officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers under whom they served directly. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely in the hands of the ATS, removing male influence from the process. Volunteers Despite their obvious distinctions from men, women were eager to volunteer. Many of the servicewomen came from restricted backgrounds; therefore they found the army liberating. Other reasons women volunteered included escaping unhappy homes or marriages, or to have a more stimulating job. The overwhelming reason for joining the army, though, was patriotism. As in World War I, Great Britain was in a patriotic fervour throughout World War II to protect itself from foreign invasion.Crang, Jeremy A. \\"'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry.\\" Defence Studies 8.3 (2008): 381-95. Web. Women, for the first time, were given the opportunity to help in their native land's defense, which explains the high number of female volunteers at the beginning of the war. Despite the overwhelming response to the call for female volunteers, some women refused to join the forces; many were unwilling to give up the civilian job they had, and others had male counterparts that were unwilling to let them go . Others felt that war was still a man's job, and not something women should be involved in. Similar to the men's forces, women's forces were mostly volunteer throughout the war. When women's conscription did come into effect, however, it was highly limited. For example, married women were exempt from any obligation to serve unless they chose to do so, and those who were called could opt to serve in civil defense (the home front). WAAF plotters at work in the Operations Room at No. 11 Group RAF at Uxbridge in Middlesex, 1942 During the war, approximately 487,000 women volunteered for women‚Äôs services; 80,000 for WRNS, 185,000 for WAAF and 222,000 for ATS. By 1941 the demands of the wartime industry called for women's services to be expanded so that more men could be relieved of their previous positions and take on more active roles on the battle field. Of all the women's services, ATS needed the greatest number of new applicants; however due to ATS' lack of popularity, they were unable to gain the estimated 100,000 new volunteers needed. To try and change women's opinions on ATS, living conditions were improved and a new more flattering uniform was made. In 1941 the Registration for Employment Order was introduced in hopes of getting more women enrolled. This act could not force women to join the forces, but instead required women aged from 20‚Äì30 to try to find employment through labour exchanges and provide information on their current employment and family situations. Those who were deemed eligible were persuaded into the war industry because the Ministry of Labour did not have the power to force. Propaganda was also used to persuade women into the women's services. By the end of 1941, ATS had only gained 58,000 new workers, falling short of expectations. Ernest Bevin then called for conscription and by late 1941 with the National Service Act it became compulsory for women aged from 20‚Äì30 to join military service. Married women were exempt from conscription, but those who were eligible had the option to work in war industry or civil defense if they did not want to join one of the services. Women were able to request which force they wished to join but most women were put into ATS because of its need for new applicants. The National Service Act was repealed in 1949 but by 1944 women were no longer being called up for service because relying on volunteers was thought to be enough to complete the required tasks during the final stages of war. Women also played an important role in British industrial production during the war, in areas such as metals, chemicals, munitions, shipbuilding and engineering. At the beginning of the war in 1939 17.8% of women made up employment in these industries and by 1943 they made up 38.2%. With the start of the war there was an urgent need to expand the country's labour force and women were seen as a source of factory labour. Before the war, women in industrial production worked exclusively on assembly, which was seen as cheap and undemanding work, but during the war women were needed in other areas of the production process that had previously been carried out by men, such as Lathe operation. The Ministry of Labour created training centres that gave an introduction to the engineering process, and by 1941 women were allowed entrance as the importance of the engineering industry grew and became a large source of female employment. Areas such as aircraft manufacture, light and heavy general engineering and motor vehicle manufacturing all saw an increase in female employment during the war. Aircraft production saw the largest rise in female employment as it rose from 7% in 1935 to 40% in 1944. At the start of the war men who were already in engineering were prevented from going to war because engineering was seen as an important industry to war production but in 1940 there became a need for more female workers to supply the necessary labour for factory expansion. By 1941 with the shortage of skilled labour the Essential Workers Order was introduced which required all skilled workers to register and prevented workers from quitting from jobs that were deemed essential to the war effort without agreement from a National Service Officer. The Registration for the Employment Order in 1941 and the Women of Employment Order in 1942 also attempted to get more women into the workforce. The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18‚Äì45 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted into it with some even being transferred from agricultural production. Interpretation of aerial photographs A vital job was interpreting aerial photographs taken by British spy planes over Allied Europe.Downing, Taylor. \\"Spying from the Sky.\\" History Today 61.11 (2011): 10-16. Web. There was equality in this work that was not found anywhere else during the war: women were considered equal to men in this field.Downing, Taylor. \\"Spying from the Sky.\\" History Today 61.11 (2011): 10-16. Web Women played a role in the planning of D-Day in this capacity ‚Äì they analyzed the photos of the Normandy Coast. Women as photo analysts also participated in the biggest intelligence coup of the war ‚Äì the discovery of the German V1 flying bomb. The participation of women allowed these bombs to be destroyed. Civilian pay scales Although many women were doing jobs that men had previously done during the war, there were still pay distinctions between the two sexes. Women's pay was significantly lower than men's pay. The average female in manufacturing was earning $31 per week while the average male earned $55 per week. Equal pay was rarely achieved as employers wanted to avoid labour costs. Skilled work was often broken down into smaller tasks and labelled skilled or semi-skilled and then paid according to women's pay rates. Women who were judged to be doing \\"men's work\\" were paid more than women who were thought to be doing \\"women's work\\" and the employers' definition of this varied regionally. Women were receiving closer wages to their male counterparts; however despite the government's expressed intentions, women continued to be paid less than men for equivalent work and were segregated in terms of job description, status, and the hours they put in. In 1940 Ernest Bevin persuaded engineering employers and unions to give women equal pay to men since they were taking on the same tasks that men previously had; this became the Extended Employment of Women Agreement. Generally, pay increases depended on the industry; industries that were dominated by women before the war, like textiles and clothing, saw no changes in pay. However the gap between male and female earnings narrowed by 20-24% in metals, engineering and vehicle building and by 10-13% in chemicals, which were all deemed important to the war effort. Overtime hours also differed, with women getting 2‚Äì3 hours and men 9-10 a week. Women‚Äôs hours were still regulated because of their perceived responsibilities to take care of their family and household. High profile The British gave high prestige to their women's units who therefore escaped much of the vulgar commentary. The two daughters of Prime Minister Churchill were both in uniform. In February 1945, Princess Elizabeth joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service as an honorary second subaltern with the service number of 230873. She was a driver for the Second Subaltern Windsor Unit. Post-war Post-war, women turned to marriage or to civilian jobs. The Army returned to the male-dominated field it was before the war.De Groot, Gerard J. \\"\`I Love the Scent of Cordite in Your Hair': Gender Dynamics in Mixed Anti-Craft Batteries\\". History 82.265 (1997): 73-92. Web \\"[Demobilisation] was a big disappointment to a lot of us. It was an awful and wonderful war. I wouldn't have missed it for anything; some of the friends we made were forever\\" one female recounted after being dismissed from service to return to her normal job. Married women were released from service sooner at the end of the war, so they could return home before their husbands to ensure the home was ready when he returned from the front. Despite being largely unrecognised for their wartime efforts in the forces, the participation of women in World War II allowed for the founding of permanent women's forces. Britain instituted these permanent forces in 1949, and the Women's Voluntary Services are still a standing reserve force today.Harris, Carol. \\"Women Under Fire in World War Two\\".

The Communist Yugoslav National Liberation Movement claimed 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the Antifascist Front of Women (AF≈Ω), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AF≈Ω managed schools, hospitals and local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army. It stressed its dedication to women's rights and gender equality and used the imagery of traditional folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the partizanka.Barbara Jancar, \\"Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview,\\" Studies in Comparative Communism (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164. After the war, women were relegated to traditional gender roles, but Yugoslavia is unique as its historians paid extensive attention to women's roles in the resistance, until the country broke up in the 1990s. Then the memory of the female soldiers faded away.Vesna Drapac, \\"Resistance and the Politics of Daily Life in Hitler's Europe: The Case of Yugoslavia in a Comparative Perspective,\\" Aspasia 2009 3: 55-78Barbara Jancar-Webster, Women and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941-1945 (1990) Axis and associated countries =Finland= Finnish women took part in defence: nursing, air raid signaling, rationing and hospitalization of the wounded. Their organization was called Lotta Sv√§rd, named after the poem, where voluntary women took part in auxiliary work of the armed forces to help those fighting on the front. Lotta Sv√§rd was one of the largest, if not the largest, voluntary group in World War II. They did not fire guns, a rule in Lotta Sv√§rd.Charles Leonard Lundin, Finland in the Second World War (Indiana UP, 1957) =Germany= The majority of German girls were members of League of German Girls (BDM). The BDM helped the war effort in many ways. On the eve of war 14.6 million German women were working, with 51% of women of working age (16‚Äì60 years old) in the workforce. Nearly six million were doing farm work, as Germany's agricultural economy was dominated by small family farms. 2.7 million worked in industry. When the German economy was mobilized for war it paradoxically led to a drop in female work participation, reaching a low of 41% before gradually climbing back to over 50% again. This still compares favorably with the UK and the US, both playing catchup, with Britain achieving a participation rate of 41% of women of working age in 1944. However, in terms of women employed in war work, British and German female participation rates were nearly equal by 1944, with the United States still lagging. The difficulties the Third Reich faced in increasing the size of the work force was mitigated by reallocating labor to work that supported the war effort. High wages in war industries attracted hundreds of thousands, freeing up men for military duties. Prisoners of war were also employed as farmhands, freeing up women for other work.Adam Tooze, The Wages of Destruction (2006) The Third Reich had many roles for women. The SS-Helferinnen were regarded as part of the SS if they had undergone training at a Reichsschule SS but all other female workers were regarded as being contracted to the SS and chosen largely from Nazi concentration camps. 3,700 of women auxiliaries (Aufseherin) served for the SS in the camps, the majority of which were at Ravensbr√ºck.Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women For War: German and American Propaganda, 1939-1945 (1979) Women also served in auxiliary units in the navy (Kriegshelferinnen), air force (Luftnachrichtenhelferinnen) and army (Nachrichtenhelferin).Gordon Williamson, World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services (2003).Karen Hagemann, \\"Mobilizing Women for War: The History, Historiography, and Memory of German Women's War Service in the Two World Wars,\\" Journal of Military History (2011) 75#4 pp 1055-1094 During the war more than 500,000 women were volunteer uniformed auxiliaries in the German armed forces (Wehrmacht). About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses, and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy. In the Luftwaffe they served in auxiliary roles helping to operate the anti-aircraft systems that shot down Allied bombers on the German homefront. By 1945, German women were holding 85% of the billets as clericals, accountants, interpreters, laboratory workers, and administrative workers, together with half of the clerical and junior administrative posts in high-level field headquarters. Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with four main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, the secular DRK (Red Cross) and the \\"Brown Nurses\\", for committed Nazi women. Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the Iron Cross for heroism under fire. In contrast, the brief historiography Nurses in Nazi Germany by Bronwyn Rebekah McFarland-Icke (1999) focuses on the dilemmas of German nurses forced to look the other way while their incapacitated patients were murdered.Bronwyn Rebekah McFarland- Icke, Nurses in Nazi Germany (1999) German military brothels =Italy= Italian Social Republic Mussolini's Italian Social Republic, a puppet state of Nazi Germany, gave their women roles as \\"birthing machines\\" and as noncombatants in paramilitary units and police formations (Servizio Ausiliario Femminile). The commander was the brigadier general Piera Gatteschi Fondelli.M. Fraddosio, \\"Woman and War: Aspects Of Womens Militancy During Fascism, From Civil Mobilization to the Origins Of The Servizio- Ausiliario-Femminile in the Italian Social-Republic.\\" Storia Contemporanea 20#6 (1989): 1105-1181.Petra Terhoeven, \\"Frauen im Widerstand: Das Beispiel der Italienischen Resistenza\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaft, 2004. 52#7 pp. 608-625. =Japan= Japanese women were typically not formed into auxiliary units. However, in some cases, such as the civilian resistance in Okinawa to the American invasion, they performed informal services. On Okinawa, the students and faculty of Daiichi Women's High School and Shihan Women's School were mobilized as a nursing unit by the Japanese army. Military nurses participated in medical experiments. Comfort women Comfort women were women and girls forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. The name \\"comfort women\\" is a translation of the Japanese euphemism ianfu (ÊÖ∞ÂÆâÂ©¶) and the similar Korean term wianbu (ÏúÑÏïàÎ∂Ä). Ianfu is a euphemism for sh≈çfu (Â®ºÂ©¶) whose meaning is \\"prostitute(s)\\". Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, with numbers ranging from as low as 20,000 to as high as 360,000 to 410,000, in Chinese sources; the exact numbers are still being researched and debated. Many of the women were from occupied countries, including Korea, China, and the Philippines, although women from Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan (then a Japanese dependency), Indonesia (then the Dutch East Indies), East Timor (then Portuguese Timor), and other Japanese-occupied territories were used for military \\"comfort stations\\". Stations were located in Japan, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, then Malaya, Thailand, Burma, New Guinea, Hong Kong, Macau, and French Indochina.. A smaller number of women of European origin from the Netherlands and Australia were also involved. According to testimony, young women from countries in Japanese control were abducted from their homes. In many cases, women were also lured with promises of work in factories or restaurants; once recruited, the women were incarcerated in comfort stations in foreign lands.; ; ; . =Romania= Pilot Mariana DrƒÉgescu ready to take off with a wounded man on board, September 1942. Romanian women played a role in the Royal Romanian Air Force. Inspired by the Finnish Lotta Sv√§rd, the Ministry of the Air set up a specialized air ambulance unit called the 108th Medevac Light Transport Squadron, better known as the White Squadron (Escadrila AlbƒÉ), which included mostly female pilots and included Mariana DrƒÉgescu, Nadia Russo, Virginia Thomas, and Marina »òtirbei. The unit was active between 1940-1943, participated in the campaigns at Odessa and Stalingrad and rose to fame during the war as the only unit of its kind in the world. Romanian women also served as pilots in other transport and liaison units during the war. Captain Irina Burnaia, for example, commanded the Bessarabian Squadron between 1942-1944. After the war and the Communist seizure of power in Romania, the White Squadron's service was largely ignored and its former members faded into obscurity. However, since the Romanian Revolution there has been a new wave of recognition of the female aviators, as exemplified by Mariana DrƒÉgescu's promotion to the rank of Commander (Comandor) in 2013.

She was a respected feminist and labour activist, as well as a founding member of the Vancouver Women's Caucus, in 1988, the Euphoniously Feminist and Non-Performing Quintet in 1970, Simon Fraser University's Women's Studies Program in 1975, and Mayworks in 1988. For thirty years, Benston worked locally, nationally, and internationally writing articles, giving speeches, and lobbying politicians on behalf of the women's and labour movement. Benston died of cancer on 7 March 1991.  Academic work  Margaret Benston obtained an undergraduate degree in chemistry and philosophy and a PhD in theoretical chemistry from the University of Washington in 1964. Following this, she worked as a post-doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin. Benston joined Simon Fraser University as a charter faculty member in 1966 in the Department of Chemistry. She was one of the founders of Women's Studies program in the mid-1970s, and taught in the program part-time. Best known for articles such as \\"Infrared Spectroscopy\\" in The Annual Review of Physical Chemistry and \\"New Force Theorem\\" in The Journal of Chemistry and Physics, Benston continued as a practicing scientist throughout her life, but also went on to be more involved in feminism and activism. Her 1969 essay, The Political Economy of Women's Liberation, was one of the first Marxist feminist critiques from a Canadian perspective. This article helped establish the framework for much of the feminist debates in the 1970s, as it was one of the first to use a Marxist parameter to explain the oppression of women. The article was later reproduced in books such as Liberation Now? Women in a Made-Made World and Feminist Frameworks, it was also translated into Spanish, French, Italian, Swedish, German, and Japanese. In the 1980s, Benston became interested in computer science. She switched fields and received a joint appointment in the Women's Studies and Computing Science departments. Thereafter she explored the relationship between computerization, women, and work. Benston was the first to argue that women formed a reserve army of labour, a group that could be manipulated in a certain way because women are responsible for the reproduction of labour power. She argued that women's domestic and wage labour were essential to the flow of capitalist production and that women could not be fully integrated into wage labour without a full transformation in both of the forms of labour, which ultimately would mean a transformation of capitalism. In turn, this created the view that women form a class because of their domestic labour, this became known internationally as the domestic labour debate.  Personal life and activism  Committed to social justice, Benston was a founding member of the Euphoniously Feminist and Non-Performing Quintet, groups who taught feminist labour and anti-war songs to audiences at picket lines and rallies. As a labour activist, she helped found Vancouver Mayworks (a cultural festival celebrating workers), the Vancouver Women's Caucus, a New Left political craze that swept Simon Fraser University in the late 1960s, and Women's Skills Development of British Columbia. A music fan, she played a leading role in establishing the Vancouver Folk Music Festival. Benston also helped start the Vancouver Mayworks, a festival that celebrated workers' culture. Mayworks is currently a Festival of Labour and the Arts, with active participants in Parksville, Comox Valley and Campbell River, on Vancouver Island. With five other women (Mary Vickers, Hilda Ching, Abby Schwarz, Mary Jo Duncan, Diana Herbst), Benston founded The Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology (SCWIST) in Vancouver in 1981, which aims to \\"support and promote the education of girls and women through programs and activities that we develop in partnership with the community.\\" Benston died in 1991 at age 52, after a long battle with cancer.  Legacy  The Maggie Benston Centre at Simon Fraser University was the second campus building named after a woman at the university (the first being the Madge Hogarth residence). The Margaret Lowe Benston Memorial Graduate Bursary in Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies is named after her. The purpose of this award is to provide financial support for students in the MA and PhD programs in the Department of Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies at Simon Fraser University. Begun in 1994, the \\"Margaret Lowe Benston (MLB) Lecture Series in Social Justice is financed by an endowment established in her memory. There is an annual event hosted by the Department of Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies at Simon Fraser University. Events are often lectures but have also included dance performances and film presentations (ex. My Name Was January). Some past speakers/presenters include Alex Sangha, Elina Gress, Lenee Son, Velvet Steele, and Natasha Adsit (2019), Susan Stryker (2014), Maude Barlow, Sitara Thobani (2008), Arno Kamolika, Doudou Diene, Lisa Helps, Becki Ross & Jamie Lee Hamilton, Joan Sangster, Chris E.

One of the later novels in Vestdijk's career, it was published in 1966 by Nijgh & Van Ditmar. Hella Haasse, in a lengthy analysis in her Lezen achter de letters, calls it a \\"novel of conscience\\", and one of his most cynical ones. Agnes Andeweg notes Gothic elements in the novel. Plot The plot revolves around the rather undeveloped, faceless Peter H√∂llriegl, an Austrian soldier during World War II who returns home after Russian captivity. Silent and unable or unwilling to adapt to a normal life at home, he is subjected to a variety of treatments and investigations, one of which concerned with paranormal occurrences surrounding his homecoming and his presence: his homecoming was preceded by multiple appearances of a ghost in his mother's Gasthof. Two of the \\"investigators\\" are a retired geology professor from the German Rhineland, Dietrich Genzmer, and a Dutch businessman, Louis Holk, and their experiences with Peter are recounted in the first and last of three parts. Peter, in the meantime, is apprenticed as a mountain guide but quits without explanation. A trip he takes with some old friend to a fair ends in confusion when the young men, drunk, attend a private sex show and Peter explodes in rage when a young woman is groped. The middle part concerns Peter's family, which on the advice of their doctor sends him to a local monastery which also operates a pilgrimage church and a bar/restaurant; Jakobus, a monk who in a previous life was active in the city, is charged with attempting to understand what happened to Peter in Russia and why he is as traumatized as he apparently is. The young woman who runs the bar develops a friendship with him; as it turns out she has also been traumatized and has been taken in to redeem a sexually compromised past. The section ends with Peter's return to his family after what appears to be a group of ghosts terrorizes the monastery. In the third part, Holk and Genzmer return to the Gasthof, and attempt to draw Peter out by taking him on a mountain tour. While stopping near a cliff, a ghost appears and causes Peter to jump off the mountain. An explanation for his trauma is offered when (by chance) Peter's past in Soviet Russia is revealed: he had been part of a German garrison occupying a small village where they lived fairly peacefully with the locals, until orders came that those locals were to be killed‚Äîwhich they did, in a variety of ways involving torture and denigration. Genre Vestdijk himself had defined the genres of psychological novel and novel of intrigue; the latter, he said, is the kind of novel mostly concerned with action and events and the consequences those events have on the characters. P. Kralt, in a monograph on Vestdijk's work, said Het spook en de schaduw, combines those two genres because of its plenitude of events great and small (all recounted in great, sometimes too great detail, as Kralt notes) while it focuses consistently on the effect of the protagonist's actions on the other characters. Landscape and themes According to Haasse, the Alps, which figure frequently in Vestdijk's poetry and prose, represent a type of hell, a place which in all its whiteness and height attracts people and simultaneously rejects them: Haasse notes the similarity with Herman Melville's white whale in Moby-Dick, and the resemblance with the words Alp (German for \\"nightmare\\") and Albe (denoting white priestly vestments but also suggesting \\"elf\\" or \\"gnome\\"). His epistolary novel De overnachting (1947) has a plot line involving a love triangle in the Alps, his trilogy Symphonie van Victor Slingerland (1957-1959) is likewise partly set in the Austrian Alps, and De arme Heinrich (1958), Een Alpenroman (1961), and Het genadeschot (1964) are also Alpine novels. Het spook en de schaduw is set in the Eastern Alps of Tirol, in the Mieminger Chain, renamed \\"Diedinger chain\\" in the novel, with the mountain Serles (renamed \\"Erles\\") from the Stubai Alps dominating the view. Reception The novel has received somewhat mixed reviews. A contemporary review in the Utrechts Nieuwsblad praised the author for his \\"marvelous storytelling technique\\". Kralt called it \\"a virtuoso novel\\" but unsatisfactory, lacking greatness. More recently, in a series reevaluating Vestdijk's work for NRC Handelsblad, Dutch novelist Maarten 't Hart ridiculed the novel as \\"endless chatter about demons and ghosts\\", and criticized Vestdijk's style and the appearance of \\"real\\" ghosts. 't Hart concludes that the novel (which he thinks might be inspired by William Faulkner's Soldiers' Pay) shows \\"les defaults de ses qualit√©s\\", and reserves praise only for the characterization of Hollriegl.

It is the fourth track on his World Peace Is None of Your Business album and was released as the second single off the album via digital download on 20 May 2014, through Harvest and Capitol Records. This song depicts the story of someone who's desperately searching for a man in the midst of a prostitution environment in Istanbul. One mysterious and poignant piece of music. After the line \\"Oh, what have I done\\", the singer once again shows his brilliance, by creating an atmosphere where the listener is invited to imagine what sort of deeds have been done by the searcher. Such ability demonstrates a level of conversational situation between Morrissey and the person who is listening this story (may it be intentional or not). In the end of the song Morrissey declares that he found the missing person: \\"I lean into a box of pine, identify the kid as mine.\\" These words suggest that the person is no longer alive. Then Boz Boorer and the band drag us into a secret Arabian garden, a place of grieve.

The work is also known as The Strange Case of Jekyll Hyde, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or simply Jekyll & Hyde.Stevenson published the book as Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (without \\"The\\"), for reasons unknown, but it has been supposed to increase the \\"strangeness\\" of the case (Richard Dury (2005)). Later publishers added \\"The\\" to make it grammatically correct, but it was not the author's original intent. The story is often known today simply as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or even Jekyll and Hyde. It is about a London legal practitioner named Gabriel John Utterson who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr Henry Jekyll, is the Scots pronunciation of the name, but is the accepted general pronunciation. and the evil Edward Hyde. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of the language, with the vernacular phrase \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" referring to persons with an unpredictably dual nature: outwardly good, but sometimes shockingly evil. Inspiration and writing Robert Louis Stevenson Stevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how human personalities can reflect the interplay of good and evil. While still a teenager, he developed a script for a play about Deacon Brodie, which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and which was produced for the first time in 1882.Swearingen, Roger G. The Prose Writings of Robert Louis Stevenson. London: Macmillan, 1980. (ISBN) p. 37. In early 1884, he wrote the short story \\"Markheim\\", which he revised in 1884 for publication in a Christmas annual. According to his essay, \\"A Chapter on Dreams\\" (Scribner's, Jan. 1888), he wracked his brains for an idea for a story and had a dream, and upon wakening had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Biographer Graham Balfour quoted Stevenson's wife Fanny Stevenson: > In the small hours of one morning,[...] I was awakened by cries of horror > from Louis. Thinking he had a nightmare, I awakened him. He said angrily: > \\"Why did you wake me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale.\\" I had awakened him > at the first transformation scene. Lloyd Osbourne, Stevenson's stepson, wrote: \\"I don't believe that there was ever such a literary feat before as the writing of Dr Jekyll. I remember the first reading as though it were yesterday. Louis came downstairs in a fever; read nearly half the book aloud; and then, while we were still gasping, he was away again, and busy writing. I doubt if the first draft took so long as three days.\\" Inspiration may also have come from the writer's friendship with Edinburgh-based French teacher Eugene Chantrelle, who was convicted and executed for the murder of his wife in May 1878. Chantrelle, who had appeared to lead a normal life in the city, poisoned his wife with opium. According to author Jeremy Hodges, Stevenson was present throughout the trial and as \\"the evidence unfolded he found himself, like Dr Jekyll, 'aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde'.\\" Moreover, it was believed that the teacher had committed other murders both in France and Britain by poisoning his victims at supper parties with a \\"favourite dish of toasted cheese and opium\\". As was customary, Mrs. Stevenson would read the draft and offer her criticisms in the margins. Robert Stevenson was confined to bed at the time from a haemorrhage. In her comments in the manuscript she observed that in effect the story was really an allegory, but Robert was writing it as a story. After a while, Robert called her back into the bedroom and pointed to a pile of ashes: he had burnt the manuscript in fear that he would try to salvage it, and thus forced himself to start again from nothing, writing an allegorical story as she had suggested. Scholars debate whether he really burnt his manuscript; there is no direct factual evidence for the burning, but it remains an integral part of the history of the novella. Stevenson re-wrote the story in three to six days. A number of later biographers have alleged that Stevenson was on drugs during the frantic re-write; for example, William Gray's revisionist history A Literary Life (2004) said he used cocaine while other biographers said he used ergot.Possibly with the help of cocaine, according to William Gray's revisionist history Robert Louis Stevenson: A Literary Life (2004). However, the standard history, according to the accounts of his wife and son (and himself), says he was bed-ridden and sick while writing it. According to Osbourne, \\"The mere physical feat was tremendous and, instead of harming him, it roused and cheered him inexpressibly\\". He continued to refine the work for four to six weeks after the initial revision. The novella was written in the southern English seaside town of Bournemouth, where Stevenson had moved to benefit from its sea air and relatively warmer climate. The name Jekyll was borrowed from the Reverend Walter Jekyll, a friend of Stevenson and younger brother of horticulturalist and landscape designer Gertrude Jekyll. Plot Gabriel John Utterson and his cousin Richard Enfield reach the door of a large house on their weekly walk. Enfield tells Utterson that months ago, he saw a sinister-looking man named Edward Hyde trample a young girl after accidentally bumping into her. Enfield forced Hyde to pay ¬£100 to avoid a scandal. Hyde brought them to this door and provided a cheque signed by a reputable gentleman (later revealed to be Doctor Henry Jekyll, a friend and client of Utterson). Utterson is disturbed because Jekyll recently changed his will to make Hyde the sole beneficiary. Utterson fears that Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll. When Utterson tries to discuss Hyde with Jekyll, Jekyll tells Utterson he can be rid of Hyde when he wants and for Utterson to drop the matter. One night in October, a servant sees Hyde beat Sir Danvers Carew, another one of Utterson's clients, to death. The police contact Utterson, who leads officers to Hyde's apartment. Hyde has vanished, but they find half of a broken cane (the other half having been left at the crime scene). Utterson recognizes the cane as one he had given to Jekyll. Utterson visits Jekyll, who shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the trouble that he has caused. However, Hyde's handwriting is similar to Jekyll's own, leading Utterson to conclude that Jekyll forged the note to protect Hyde. For two months, Jekyll reverts to his former sociable manner, but in early January, he starts refusing visitors. Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance. In late February, during another walk with Enfield, Utterson starts a conversation with Jekyll at a window of his laboratory. Jekyll suddenly slams the window and disappears. In early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson and says Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for weeks. Utterson and Poole break into the laboratory, where they find Hyde wearing Jekyll's clothes and apparently dead from suicide. They find a letter from Jekyll to Utterson. Utterson reads Lanyon's letter, then Jekyll's. Lanyon's letter reveals his deterioration resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drink a serum that turned him into Jekyll. Jekyll's letter explains that he had indulged in unstated vices and feared discovery. He found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. Jekyll's transformed body, Hyde, was evil, self-indulgent, and uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll controlled the transformations with the serum, but one night in August, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep. Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night, he had a moment of weakness and drank the serum. Hyde, his desires having been caged for so long, killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations. Then, in early January, he transformed involuntarily while awake. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid capture. He wrote to Lanyon (in Jekyll's hand), asking his friend to bring chemicals from his laboratory. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the serum, and transformed into Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll's involuntary transformations increased in frequency and required ever larger doses of serum to reverse. It was one of these transformations that caused Jekyll to slam his window shut on Enfield and Utterson. Eventually, one of the chemicals used in the serum ran low, and subsequent batches prepared from new stocks failed to work. Jekyll speculated that one of the original ingredients must have had some unknown impurity that made it work. Realizing that he would stay transformed as Hyde, Jekyll decided to write his \\"confession.\\" He ended the letter by writing this: \\"Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\\" With these words, both the document and the novella come to a close. Characters =Gabriel John Utterson= Gabriel John Utterson, a lawyer and close loyal friend of Jekyll and Lanyon for many years, is the main protagonist of the story. Utterson is a measured and at all times emotionless, bachelor ‚Äì who nonetheless seems believable, trustworthy, tolerant of the faults of others, and indeed genuinely likable. However, Utterson is not immune to guilt, as, while he is quick to investigate and judge the faults of others even for the benefit of his friends, Stevenson states that \\"he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done\\". Whatever these \\"ill things\\" may be, he does not partake in gossip or other views of the upper class out of respect for his fellow man. Often the last remaining friend of the down-fallen, he finds an interest in others' downfalls, which creates a spark of interest not only in Jekyll but also regarding Hyde. He comes to the conclusion that human downfall results from indulging oneself in topics of interest. As a result of this line of reasoning, he lives life as a recluse and \\"dampens his taste for the finer items of life\\". Utterson concludes that Jekyll lives life as he wishes by enjoying his occupation. =Dr Henry Jekyll/Mr Edward Hyde= Dr Jekyll is a \\"large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast\\", who occasionally feels he is battling between the good and evil within himself, leading to the struggle between his dual personalities of Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. He has spent a great part of his life trying to repress evil urges that were not fitting for a man of his stature. He creates a serum, or potion, in an attempt to separate this hidden evil from his personality. In doing so, Jekyll transformed into the smaller, younger, cruel, remorseless, evil Hyde. Jekyll has many friends and an amiable personality, but as Hyde, he becomes mysterious and violent. As time goes by, Hyde grows in power. After taking the potion repeatedly, he no longer relies upon it to unleash his inner demon, i.e., his alter ego. Eventually, Hyde grows so strong that Jekyll becomes reliant on the potion to remain conscious throughout the book. =Richard Enfield= Richard Enfield is Utterson's cousin and is a well known \\"man about town.\\" He first sees Hyde at about three in the morning in an episode that is well documented as Hyde is running over a little girl. He is the person who mentions to Utterson the actual personality of Jekyll's friend, Hyde. Enfield witnessed Hyde running over a little girl in the street recklessly, and the group of witnesses, with the girl's parents and other residents, force Hyde into writing a cheque for the girl's family. Enfield discovers that Jekyll signed the cheque, which is genuine. He says that Hyde is disgusting looking but finds himself stumped when asked to describe the man. =Dr Hastie Lanyon= A longtime friend of Jekyll, Hastie Lanyon disagrees with Jekyll's \\"scientific\\" concepts, which Lanyon describes as \\"...too fanciful\\". He is the first person to discover Hyde's true identity (Hyde transforms himself back into Jekyll in Lanyon's presence). Lanyon helps Utterson solve the case when he describes the letter given to him by Jekyll and his thoughts and reactions to the transformation. After he witnesses the transformation process (and subsequently hears Jekyll's private confession, made to him alone), Lanyon becomes shocked into critical illness and, later, death. =Mr Poole= Poole is Jekyll's butler who has been employed by him for many years. Poole serves Jekyll faithfully and attempts to be loyal to his master, but the growing reclusiveness of and changes in his master cause him growing concern. Finally fearing that his master has been murdered and that his murderer, Mr Hyde, is residing in Jekyll's chambers, Poole is driven into going to Utterson and joining forces with him to uncover the truth. =Inspector Newcomen= Utterson joins this Scotland Yard inspector after the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. They explore Hyde's loft in Soho and discover evidence of his depraved life. =Sir Danvers Carew, MP= A kind, 70-year-old Member of Parliament. The maid claims that Hyde, in a murderous rage, killed Carew in the streets of London on the night of 18 October. At the time of his death, Carew is carrying on his person a letter addressed to Utterson, and the broken half of one of Jekyll's walking sticks is found on his body. =Maid= A maid, whose employer - presumably Jekyll- Hyde had once visited, is the only person who has witnessed the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. She saw Hyde murder Carew with Jekyll's cane and his feet. Having fainted after seeing what happened, she then wakes up and rushes to the police, thus initiating the murder case of Sir Danvers Carew. Analysis of themes Richard Mansfield was mostly known for his dual role depicted in this double exposure. The stage adaptation opened in Boston in 1887, a year after the publication of the novella. (Picture 1895) Literary genres that critics have applied as a framework for interpreting the novel include religious allegory, fable, detective story, sensation fiction, Doppelg√§nger literature, Scottish devil tales, and gothic novel. =Dualities= The novella is frequently interpreted as an examination of the duality of human nature, usually expressed as an inner struggle between good and evil, with variations such as human versus animal, civilization versus barbarism sometimes substituted, the main thrust being that of an essential inner struggle between the one and other, and that the failure to accept this tension results in evil, or barbarity, or animal violence, being projected onto others.Sanford, John A. Evil The Shadow Side of Reality. Crossroad (1981) In Freudian theory, the thoughts and desires banished to the unconscious mind motivate the behaviour of the conscious mind. Banishing evil to the unconscious mind in an attempt to achieve perfect goodness can result in the development of a Mr Hyde-type aspect to one's character. In Christian theology, Satan's fall from Heaven is due to his refusal to accept that he is a created being (that he has a dual nature) and is not God. This idea is suggested when Hyde says to Lanyon, shortly before drinking the famous potion, \\"...and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\\" This is because in Christianity, pride (to consider oneself as without sin or without evil) is a sin, as it is the precursor to evil itself. In his discussion of the novel, Vladimir Nabokov argues that the \\"good versus evil\\" view of the novel is misleading, as Jekyll himself is not, by Victorian standards, a morally good person in some cases.\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: An Introductory Essay.\\" Signet Classic, 2003 =Public vs private= The work is commonly associated today with the Victorian concern over the public and private division, the individual's sense of playing a part and the class division of London.Saposnik, Irving S. \\"The Anatomy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\" SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900 11.4, Nineteenth Century (1971): pp. 715‚Äì731. In this respect, the novella has also been noted as \\"one of the best guidebooks of the Victorian era\\" because of its piercing description of the fundamental dichotomy of the 19th century \\"outward respectability and inward lust\\", as this period had a tendency for social hypocrisy.Nightmare: Birth of Victorian Horror (TV series) Jekyll and Hyde.... (1996) =Scottish nationalism vs. union with Britain= Another common interpretation sees the novella's duality as representative of Scotland and the Scottish character. In this reading, the duality represents the national and linguistic dualities inherent in Scotland's relationship with the wider Britain and the English language, respectively, and also the repressive effects of the Church of Scotland on the Scottish character.The Beast Within The Guardian, 13 December 2008 A further parallel is also drawn with the city of Edinburgh itself, Stevenson's birthplace, which consists of two distinct parts: the old medieval section historically inhabited by the city's poor, where the dark crowded slums were rife with all types of crime, and the modern Georgian area of wide spacious streets representing respectability.Robert Louis Stevenson and His World, David Daiches, 1973 Reception =Publication= The book was initially sold as a paperback for one shilling in the UK and for one penny in the U.S. These books were called \\"shilling shockers\\" or penny dreadfuls. The American publisher issued the book on 5 January 1886, four days before the first appearance of the UK edition issued by Longmans; Scribner's published 3000 copies, only 1250 of them bound in cloth. Initially, stores did not stock it until a review appeared in The Times on 25 January 1886 giving it a favourable reception. Within the next six months, close to forty thousand copies were sold. As Stevenson's biographer Graham Balfour wrote in 1901, the book's success was probably due rather to the \\"moral instincts of the public\\" than to any conscious perception of the merits of its art. It was read by those who never read fiction and quoted in pulpit sermons and in religious papers.Graham Balfour, The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson, volume II, pp 17-18 By 1901, it was estimated to have sold over 250,000 copies in the United States.Tim Middleton, Introduction to The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: The Merry Men and Other Stories, Wordsworth Editions, 1993, pp. 9 =The stage version of Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde= Although the book had initially been published as a \\"shilling shocker\\", it was an immediate success and one of Stevenson's best-selling works. Stage adaptations began in Boston and London and soon moved all across England and then towards his home country of Scotland. The first stage adaptation followed the story's initial publication in 1886. Richard Mansfield bought the rights from Stevenson and worked with Boston author Thomas Russell Sullivan to write a script. The resulting play added to the cast of characters and some elements of romance to the plot. Addition of female characters to the originally male-centered plot continued in later adaptations of the story. The first performance of the play took place in the Boston Museum in May 1887. The lighting effects and makeup for Jekyll's transformation into Hyde created horrified reactions from the audience, and the play was so successful that production followed in London. After a successful ten weeks in London in 1888, Mansfield was forced to close down production. The hysteria surrounding the Jack the Ripper serial murders led even those who only played murderers on stage to be considered suspects. When Mansfield was mentioned in London newspapers as a possible suspect for the crimes, he shut down production. Adaptations Poster from the 1880s There have been numerous adaptations of the novella including over 120 stage and film versions alone. There have also been many audio recordings of the novella, with some of the more famous readers including Tom Baker, Roger Rees, Christopher Lee, Anthony Quayle, Martin Jarvis, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Gene Lockhart, Richard Armitage, John Sessions, Alan Howard, Rory Kinnear and Richard E. Grant. A musical was created by Frank Wildhorn, Steve Cuden, and Leslie Bricusse. There was also a video game adaptation released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988 developed by Advance Communication Co., and received mixed reviews upon release but would be panned in retrospect.

He is especially noted for his Impressionistic landscape paintings of southern California deserts and seascapes. Biography Fries was born in Hillsboro, Ohio on August 14, 1854 and raised in Cincinnati. He was the seventh of eleven children born to John and Martha Fries. In 1872, at the age of 18, Fries began an apprenticeship as a lithographer at Gibson and Company in Cincinnati. In 1874 he began working as a photographer and lithographer for the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette. In that same year he also began attending night classes at the McMicken School of Design, which later became the Art Academy of Cincinnati. From 1874 until 1890 Fries worked for various publications as an illustrator, photographer, and lithographer in the Cincinnati area. In 1887 he married Addie Davis and in 1890 the couple bought a small farm in Waitsfield, Vermont, where they lived for six years. In 1896 Charles, Addie and their six- year-old daughter Alice left Vermont and moved to California. After a brief stay at Mission San Juan Capistrano, the family finally settled in San Diego in 1897 and Charles remained a resident of San Diego for the remainder of his life. During his career he took many extended camping trips into the deserts and mountains of southern California where he sketched and painted many of his works. Fries prospered as the city grew and he exhibited widely, including shows in New York, San Francisco, and Berkeley. He was an active member of the arts community of San Diego for many years. In 1918 he was a founding member of the La Jolla Art Association, along with other prominent San Diego artists, including Maurice Braun and Alfred Mitchell. In 1919 he was elected president of the San Diego Art Guild. In 1929 he was a founder of the Associated Artists of San Diego. In 1936, at the age of 82, Fries made one final sketching trip into the mountains east of San Diego and in 1937 he participated in the Federal Art Project. Charles Fries died at home on December 15, 1940.

In the episode, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer attend the Ravenswood Founders Day Celebration party at the cemetery in hopes of tracking down Alison, who they believe is still alive and on the run from A. While there, the girls encounter a masked figure following their every move and unexplained supernatural occurrences. Meanwhile, Caleb meets Miranda, a girl in the foster system looking for her uncle, while on the bus to Ravenswood and helps her deal with some issues stemming from her past in the town. \\"Grave New World\\" was watched by 3.18 million viewers and garnered a 1.4 rating, even with the previous episode and up from last year's Halloween episode.

Plot Aria (Lucy Hale), Emily (Shay Mitchell), Hanna (Ashley Benson) and Spencer (Troian Bellisario) arrive at the Ravenswood Founders Day Celebration party, donning nineteenth-century attire. While at the party, Ezra (Ian Harding) calls Aria to check on her and advises her to be careful. He puts on his mask for his costume and enters the party. The girls spot Luke (Brett Dier) wearing a vintage soldier's costume similar to the one they found in Ezra's apartment. The girls split up to find Alison and examine Luke. Hanna spots two short blond figures in red coats while Emily is separated from Aria by Mrs. Grunwald (Meg Foster), who warns them to go away. Aria finds Leah (Elizabeth Whitson) in a ditch, pulls her out and learns that Luke is Olivia's cousin. While on a bus to Ravenswood, Caleb (Tyler Blackburn) is approached by Miranda (Nicole Gale Anderson) after being frightened by the man (Irwin Keyes) she was sitting next to. Miranda tells Caleb about her past life and how she is going to Ravenswood to meet her uncle. Just as Caleb asks about her uncle, Miranda runs off to get some chips from the old man in the back of the bus. As she reaches into the bag, he awakens from sleep and she runs back to her seat. Caleb apologizes to Miranda about asking about her uncle and tells her his story about his uncle. Miranda tells him about her foster parent and decides to get off at the upcoming stop and go home. As she gets up to leave, she notices the man from the back of the bus and decides to stay. As the girls, frightened and anxious, reconvene, they spot Red Coat and chase after her. They land in a mausoleum, but find that Red Coat has disappeared. The girls notice a spot in the mausoleum and discover a secret passageway. As they walk in, the door behind them closes without warning. The girls continue trekking through the passageway as gusts of wind begin hitting the girls. When the wind stops, Hanna has gone missing. Hanna, while trying to find the girls, notices the phrase \\"HELP ME\\" written in red on the wall. As she turns on her cellphone light to read the message, she notices a swarm of rats on the ground and runs through a passageway, which leads to a door to a room in a mansion. Unbeknownst to her, a masked Ezra is lurking behind her. Hanna continues walking through the mansion until she finds a telephone booth. She tries to use the telephone, but it turns out to be a gag. Hanna tries to leave but finds herself locked in with three lights closing in on the outside. The lights suddenly disappear and the phone rings with a vintage record playing on the other end. Caleb and Miranda arrive in Ravenswood and go their separate ways. Miranda walks into the mansion to explore. Meanwhile, Aria, Emily and Spencer find their way into the mansion and notice blood dripping from the ceiling. They suddenly hear Alison's voice and head off to find her, but Spencer gets separated from them. While trapped in the booth, Alison's face appears, but is dragged away and the masked man's image appears in its place. Miranda then frees Hanna from the booth and together they try to find a way out of the mansion. They enter a room filled with coffins, which triggers a painful memory for Miranda. As they leave, Miranda notices a booklet and takes it with her Aria and Emily find a room with an open window and prepare to leave the house and get help. As they hear Alison's screams, the girls retreat and the window's jagged glass shuts behind them. Meanwhile, Spencer walks into a greenhouse where she discovers the masked man waiting for her. They wrestle before Spencer picks up hedge cutters. She slices the man's hand and knocks him out. She reaches for his mask, but he awakens and grabs her. She breaks free before hitting her head against a wooden ledge. He picks up the hedge cuts ad stands over her. Caleb finds Miranda and Hanna while Aria and Emily find an unconscious Spencer. Hanna shows Caleb and Miranda the door to the passageway, but the door won't open. Meanwhile, Miranda finds a grave marker with her name and image on it. Aria, Emily and Spencer listen to Alison's cries for help and discover a tape recorder with her voice playing. Mrs. Grunwald enters the room and tells the girls that it is her room and the tape was stolen from her office. She later has a psychic feeling, warning \\"One of you has been touched by the one Alison fears the most.\\" Hanna learns from the girls that Alison is gone. Aria, Emily and Spencer find the car with a slashed tire. Miranda decides to go back into the house; Hanna sends Caleb off to help Miranda and returns to the girls, who have found the spare tire missing. Ezra pulls up and offers the girls a ride back to Rosewood. When they reach Rosewood, they discover Red Coat watching them and chase her into Spencer's backyard. Red Coat reveals herself as Alison and tells the girls she doesn't have time. She tells them that she wants to come back home but it still isn't safe. She runs away as Ezra approaches Aria with her phone. Back at Ravenswood, Miranda and Caleb discover a grave marker with Caleb's name and image on it. Production In March 2013, Pretty Little Liars was renewed for a fifth season and green lighted for a spinoff series, Ravenswood, which would premiere in October of that year. ‚ÄúGrave New World‚Äù was directed by Ron Lagomarsino and written by Joseph Dougherty, Oliver Goldstick and I. Marlene King. Filming for the episode took place over a 10-day time span, beginning on May 31, 2013 and concluding on June 10, 2013. The episode was filmed in between filming for the eighth episode, ‚ÄúThe Guilty Girl‚Äôs Handbook‚Äù, and filming for the ninth and tenth episodes of the season, ‚ÄúInto the Deep‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Mirror Has Three Faces‚Äù. The episode served as a backdoor pilot for the series‚Äô spinoff Ravenswood, featuring guest appearances from Nicole Gale Anderson as Miranda and Brett Dier as Luke, the main cast of the show. Elizabeth Whitson appears in this episode as a character named Leah, who is apparently Luke's cousin. However, when this episode was shot Whitson was still going to play Olivia, Luke's twin sister. The role was recast with Merritt Patterson for the actual show, after this episode was shot but before the first episode for Ravenswood was shot. Reception =Ratings= \\"Grave New World\\" originally aired on October 22, 2013, as part of the 13 Nights of Halloween programming special on ABC Family, and was followed by the series premiere of the Pretty Little Liars spinoff, Ravenswood. The episode marks the third annual Halloween special from the series, each premiering apart from the regular summer and winter seasons. The Halloween themed episode was viewed by 3.18 million viewers, up 14 percent from the previous Halloween special (2.75 million viewers). It was the third most-watched broadcast in the history of programming block and the second most-watched episode of the season. The episode also acquired a 1.4 ratings share among adults ages 18 ‚Äì 49, translating to 1.8 million viewers, up 25 percent from the previous year's special and ranks as the top rated broadcast within the 13 Nights of Halloween programming block and the third highest rated episode in the series. \\"Grave New World\\" also amassed 1.16 million tweets on Twitter, becoming the seventh episode of the series to garner over 1 million tweets. =Reviews= Nick Campbell of TV.com expressed a mixed opinion about the episode, writing \\"We can't really say it was a disappointing outing for the Liars because of the ending, but it was almost a cheap trick to salvage a series full of weak events by pulling the Alison trump card.\\" Lindsay Sperling of We Got This Covered lauded the episode's scenery, saying \\"The combination of the less intense tones and the ominous music might be a bit much when considered in the context of multiple episodes but I‚Äôd say that the new aesthetic choices are a welcome change, and looked more on par with what Pretty Little Liars generally delivers.\\" Caroline Preece of Den of Geek called the episode \\"average\\" and opined that the episode \\"might have been the weakest Halloween special yet. \\" Elizabeth SanFilippo of Examiner.com gave the episode three out of five stars, writing that \\"the final moment of the \\"PLL\\" special was what made this episode worth watching.\\" The A.V. Club's Caroline Siede gave the episode a C+, finding the ‚Äúslow and atmospheric‚Äù pace of the special unfitting for the series while praised the Liars' costumes, Spencer's in particular. Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic gave the Halloween-themed episode two and a half stars (out of five), calling it \\"a disappointing follow-up, spending more time setting up the mysterious new show Ravenswood than advancing the plot of Pretty Little Liars.\\" Lopez further added that the episode fell short of the \\"great background information coupled with a spooky story\\" in the season two Halloween special, \\"First Secret\\", and the \\"wild ride with an shocking final surprise\\" in the previous Halloween special, \\"This Is a Dark Ride\\".

Reserve Bank of India cancelled its licence in June 2012 under section 22 of the Banking regulations Act, 1949. History Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank was registered as a cooperative society in Gujarat on 27 September 1968. It began business within a fortnight, on 10 October, in Ahmedabad's Madhavpura spice-market area dealing with grocery traders. It received its banking licence 26 years later, on 19 August 1994, and became an interstate cooperative bank in April 1996. Three years later, in 1999, its status improved to that of a scheduled bank. Involvement with stock brokers and impact of the 2001 Sensex crash In 1999‚Äì2000, when the bank had 50,000 public depositors, it started lending out large sums of money to stock brokers in gross violation of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules and regulations. The MMCB had issued pay orders worth to stock broker Ketan Parekh, which he discounted at Bank of India. The bank had also lent money to Mukesh Babu and Sirish Maniar of the brokerage firm Maniar Group. At the time banks in India were not allowed to lend more than to stock brokers. In early 2001 Parekh and other brokers made a large sum of money when the Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex saw a bull run; however, when the dotcom bubble burst, the Sensex dropped down to 3,000 points, and Parekh and the bank started having problems. On 8 March 2001, the news broke out that the bank had given a huge guarantee to Parekh which he lost in the stock crash. As little remained in the bank's coffers, public depositors began withdrawing their money; only a few were successful. Prior to the scam, the Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank was the largest urban cooperative bank in Gujarat. It had a deposit base of in March 2001, half of which was from other banks. Seeing the condition of the bank and fear of losing their money among the depositors the RBI restricted the bank's operations on 13 March 2001. The Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies superseded the bank's board, whose 12 members were # Ramesh Chandra Parikh (Chairman) # Devendra Pandya (MD) # Ramanlal Parikh # Natverlal Desai # Manilal Shah # Prabhudas Kothari # Purushottamdas Shah # Pravinchandra Shah # Pravinchandra Patel # Dinesh Majumdar # Sevantilal Shah # Natverlal Thakker Investigation and steps taken by RBI On 13 March 2001 the RBI found out that the bank's net worth was ‚àí, its deposit erosion was 90.9% and gross non-performing assets were 88.2% and . The next day, the registrar superseded the board and appointed an administrator as the overseer of the bank. On 23 August a scheme for reconstruction of the bank was approved by the RBI for a period of 10 years. Further investigations revealed that after chairman Ramesh Chandra Parikh's son Vinit had lost in the stock-market crash, his losses were paid for through the bank's funds. By February 2004 the bank was able to recover from other banks; Ketan Parekh had returned only . He was arrested that August, and in December a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court set up for the case cancelled Parekh's conditional bail after he failed to pay the promised . In June 2003, a New Delhi court granted the CBI a five-day remand of the two Maniar Group stockbrokers ‚Äì Shirish Manyar and Mukesh Babu. Chargesheets were filed against MMCB chairman Parikh, its CEO Devendra Pandya, Ketan Parekh and his associate Dharmesh Joshi. Joshi's bank account in London containing ¬£6 million was frozen by the CBI in March 2006. Cancellation of licence Reserve Bank of India found out on 31 March 2011 that the bank's net assets were worth - and deposit erosion was 100 percent, the gross non performing assets were - and losses were . After the reconstruction scheme expired on 23 August 2011 and after seeing no major improvement in the bank's performance the RBI advised the Government of India on 26 December to liquidate the bank. On 4 January 2012 the Central Task Force for Cooperative Urban Banks also gave the same advice to the Government of India. The Reserve bank issued a showcause notice to the bank on 16 March 2012 asking why it banking licence should not be cancelled. The cooperative bank replied that the main reason for the failure of the restructuring scheme was the unwillingness of the other cooperative banks to fulfill their commitments and it suggested another revival plan in which an NRI was willing to give to the bank for a period of 10 years through the World Bank. It was able to recover only from public defaulters and were debt on Ketan Parekh. Also the bank neither had any background information regarding the NRI who was willing to help nor the source of his funds. Seeing this the RBI cancelled the bank's licence with effect from 4 June 2012. As of 5 June 2012 Parekh had paid only . Parekh alone had to pay at the interest rate of 12% per year resulted . As of June 2013, 700 civil and 230 criminal cases filed by the bank were pending in various courts. Several cases were filed against the bank and in 70 of these cases trial hadn't begun as of March 2014. One of the accused Ramesh Chandra Parikh, former chairman of the bank died in 2007 while in judicial custody. In January 2011 the public prosecutor in the case, Chetan Shah demanded re-investigation of the case. Aftermath After the scam was unfolded the RBI restricted the cooperative banks from providing money to brokerage firms, giving assistance against securities such as shares and debentures and formed task forces to formulate revival plans for the banks that were affected. In most cases the affected bank was merged to a bigger Urban Cooperative Bank. The banking regulatory authority increased the number of inspections of balance sheets of cooperative banks from once in two years to every year. A parliamentary panel was set up to investigate in the stock market scam. The panel found out that the urban cooperative banks were manipulating their activities and that in absence of any inspecting authority many brokerage firms were using funds provided by these banks to manipulate the market. After the scam cooperative banks found it difficult to win back the trust and confidence of their customers. Chairman of the National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks & Credit Societies Ltd, H K Patil had said; > The MMCB episode came as a big storm to the cooperative movement. However, > the movement withstood and overcome the storm and for past few years, > cooperative banks are seen doing fairly well. The regulator, too, has taken > a note of the operations of UCBs, The Bank filed a large number of cases against various defaulters. CID and Central Bureau of Investigation filed several charge sheets. In the case, a defaulter agreed to pay back the withstanding amount case against him was closed. Over 40 cases against defaulters were still pending in Mumbai as of July 2012. Government bodies like Bank of India and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation were given priority for due recovery. After the scam Securities and Exchange Board of India, the regulatory body for the Indian stock markets was given more power in investigating cases against manipulation and insider trading and to impose heavy penalty and initiate criminal proceedings. Chartered accounted M.M. Chitale played a key role in the formulation and execution of restructuring scheme. The committee under Chitale recommended that the bank should be allowed to make payments under a restructuring scheme. He refused to accept any fees for his work. MMCB repaid due to 268 banks in installments. The RBI issued a circular on 21 July 2004 to the banks that had deposited money with the MMCB to treat their deposits to the bank as non-performing assets and submit the particulars of their deposits to the reserve bank. MMCB auctioned properties of defaulters worth on 3 November 2004. Parekh was arrested after the scam garnered media attention. A lower court granted him bail on the condition that he will pay back to the bank in three years ending 24 August 2004. He failed to fulfill the condition and filed a plea in the Gujarat High Court to change the terms and conditions of the bail but the court asked him to withdraw the plea. Ketan Parekh offered to pay in 5 installments by May 2005 but the MMCB rejected his proposal. Nitin Constructions agreed to pay it owed to the MMCB and Dharnendra Agro Foods that owed Rs to the bank agreed to pay back the withstanding amount. In August 2005 the bank disbursed which included 25% of the principal amount and interest at the rate of 3% per annum to its public depositors and other cooperative banks in Rajkot. Till March 2011 there were 1,645 Urban Cooperative Banks registered with the Reserve Bank of India. RBI had received 158 proposals for merging some of these banks and it issued no-objection certificates to 95 of these proposals. Only 6 UCBs had assets greater than . Political allegations In July 2010 Arjun Modhwadia, an Indian National Congress politician alleged that Amit Shah who was a former director of the bank, had received in bribe from Ketan Parekh in exchange for help in the case. During the 2014 Indian general election Digvijay Singh also made similar allegations. In August 2011 before the term for the restructuring sceme was to finish a delegation representing the banking industry met with the Secretary of Union agriculture ministry P K Basu. However RBI cancelled the bank's licence in June 2012. Liquidation committee In 2013 the bank had to recover from a total number of 851 defaulters including 18 members of the broker Parikh's group which owed and another owed by 833 defaulters. Chaman Kumar, a retired Indian Administrative Service officer had been appointed the liquidator. The other members of liquidation committee were; * P S Shenoy (former chairman of Bank of Baroda) * Siddharth Sinha (IIMA professor) * Kaushik Patel (Chartered accountant) In 2012 the bank owed a total of : * to 281 banks * to Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation * as interest * to Bank of India * to public account holders * to Reserve Bank of India Till 2013 the bank had launched 5 One time settlement schemes; in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2013.

The character first appeared in a trilogy of Spider-Man novels written by Adam-Troy CastroSpider- Man: Gathering Of The Sinister Six; Spider-Man: Revenge Of The Sinister Six; and Spider-Man: Secret Of The Sinister Six before appearing within the comic books themselves. The Gentleman made his film debut in 2012 in The Amazing Spider-Man, portrayed by actor Michael Massee.Credits for The Amazing Spider- Man 2 confirm this initially unnamed character is the Gentleman Publication history The Gentleman was introduced in Adam-Troy Castro's novel, Spider- Man: The Gathering of the Sinister Six. His brother, Karl Fiers, murdered Spider-Man's parents.The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5 The Gentleman appears in the novels Spider-Man: Revenge of the Sinister Six, and Spider-Man: Secret of the Sinister Six, in which he was killed off. The character made his debut in the Marvel Comics continuity in Civil War II: Kingpin #4, published in October 2016 as part of the Civil War II event. Fictional character biography =In the novels= Born Gustav Fiers, the man who would become known as the Gentleman went on to develop a lethal reputation in the criminal underworld, known for conducting elaborate plans to increase his own wealth, involved behind the scenes in various significant events in global history. He possessed a strong disdain for the rest of humanity, considering the majority of the human race common wastes of space incapable of having any real impact on anyone or anything else save for providing raw materials or cannon fodder for the 'superior breed' such as himself- although he wouldn't allow this to affect business deals due to the potential barriers against useful profit- enjoying visiting the poorer parts of the world so that he could see evidence of this belief. Despite his disdain for humanity, he could still form friendships with others, learning over time that he genuinely cared for his younger brother and developing a strong respect for the Red Skull, providing him with various information and resources during the Second World War even if he didn't share the Skull's prejudices and moral beliefs. In the 1930s, Fiers had a series of confrontations with Doctor George Williams of the US Treasury, with Williams playing a key role in a crucial defeat of one of Fiers' plans. In response, Fiers not only arranged for Williams' wife to be killed by a bomb on their wedding night, but even sent Williams a congratulatory telegram timed to arrive just after the bomb went off. As a result, Williams spent the next sixty years hunting Fiers, becoming the most renowned expert on the criminal. At some point in his career, he nearly killed the Canadian operative known as Logan, but Logan was saved by the actions of Richard and Mary Parker, who had been working as double agents in Fiers' organization. When Fiers learned that the Parkers were now employed by Albert Malik, the second Red Skull, he put aside his usual disdain for Malik- who he acknowledged as a pretender to the title and regarded as operating out of his league- to warn him about the Parkers, requesting in return only that he spare the Parkers' son Peter so that he could be more of a challenge later in life. As Peter Parker grew up, Fiers' agents learned about the accident that allowed Peter to become Spider- Man, but although amused at this turn of events, he kept Peter's identity to himself, even killing the investigators who had brought him this information. During this time, Fiers acquired a ward in the form of a young woman known as Pity, the daughter of unspecified old enemies of his who possessed enhanced strength, speed, and a form of psionically-induced darkness, whom he brutally forced to serve him through a twisted form of brainwashing whereby she would hate him and yet be incapable of defying him. He also formed a working relationship with Peter's first adversary, the Chameleon, although the Chameleon was unaware of Fiers' interest in Spider-Man. As superhumans became more common, Fiers adopted the code name of 'the Gentleman' to better fit in with this new world. However, when Fiers learned that Peter's actions had resulted in the death of his brother- who was acting as the Skull's assassin the Finisher-The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5 he vowed to devise a plan that would thoroughly devastate Peter Parker's life and overshadow all his old victories.Spider-Man: The Secret of the Sinister Six, Ibooks, 2002 Eventually arriving in New York, Fiers arranged for the Chameleon to recruit Spider-Man's enemies Doctor Octopus, Electro, Mysterio and the Vulture to form a new incarnation of the Sinister Six (with Pity as the sixth member of the team). As the first part of Fiers' plan, he arranged for the various members of the Six to mount a 'Day of Terror', with four of them taking hostages at various points around the city while Electro and Pity stole an initially-unidentified tank from a secret storage facility (concealing Electro's absence by having Mysterio pose as Electro). This culminated in a battle in the Daily Bugle that ended with Fiers revealing his role in events to Spider-Man, as well as his role in the Parkers' deaths and some details of Pity's background, but Spider- Man was unable to capture the Gentleman at this time. While Spider-Man and the strategic action group S.A.F.E. made contact with George Williams to conduct more research into the Gentleman, Fiers began to buy up various works of art from around the world, also planting a bomb in the Parker household while Peter was absent. After another raid by the Six ended with them stealing a powerful electro-magnetic generator, S.A.F.E. realized that the Gentleman intended to use Electro to trigger the generator and create an electro- magnetic pulse in downtown Manhattan that would have erased all computer records- Spider-Man noting that the need for Electro to power the generator was Fiers' public reason for using the Six instead of more manageable mercenaries, although his private reason was his vendetta against Peter Parker- with Fiers subsequently releasing the contents of the stolen tank from his private plane; a special catalyst that would essentially destroy all ink it came in contact with, erasing all paper records as well as electronic ones. The resulting loss of information would trigger a worldwide financial collapse, as gang warfare became the only way to survive amid the chaos and destruction caused by the detonation of the generator. Fiers had spent so much time buying works of art as he wanted to ensure that he would have material wealth available to him after the dollars he had used to pay the Six became virtually worthless.Spider-Man: The Revenge of the Sinister Six, Ibooks, 2001 Unfortunately for Fiers, as he prepared to depart New York as the Six arranged to set off the generator (all unaware of the Catalyst), he was taken by surprise by the Chameleon, who had posed as his driver to learn where Fiers was storing his newly-acquired treasures and then shot him after reaching the plane; Fiers had always been able to see through the Chameleon's disguises in the past, but was left speculating that the Chameleon had been planning such a coup for years and simply allowed Fiers to 'recognise' him so that he could strike at the most profitable moment. Although the Chameleon-as-Fiers was then confronted by Doctor Octopus- who had deduced that Fiers had an ulterior motive beyond detonating the generator and resented his subordinate position in this current incarnation of the Six- the two villains were caught by Spider-Man and Pity; Electro, Mysterio and the Vulture had all been defeated before they could set off the generator, and Spider-Man had convinced Pity to help him find the Gentleman by pointing out the danger of Octavius's absence given his obvious vendetta against his subordinate position in the current iteration of the Sinister Six (everyone was so focused on Octavius that they failed to register the Chameleon's absence from the fight until they were already on the plane). While Spider-Man and Pity boarded the plane, S.A.F.E. found the Gentleman dying of his wounds in the airport. In a final confrontation with his enemy, Williams mocked the Gentleman's focus on wealth now that he had lost his entire fortune through paying the Six and buying his treasures. When Fiers grimly protested that he could not die penniless, Williams mockingly tossed a penny into a corner of the hangar, noting that Fiers might manage to reach it before the bloodloss took him to Hell. Dying of his wounds with nobody to claim his body, Fiers was laid to rest in an unmarked pauper's grave, while the plane carrying most of his new treasures crashed into the sea during the fight between Spider-Man, Pity, the Chameleon and Doc Ock. Spider-Man and the Chameleon were recovered from the crash, but Octavius merely went missing for a few months after he fell out during the fight, and Pity dropped off the radar, while the bomb that Fiers had planted in the Parker house was found and disabled by Wolverine (who had learned about the Gentleman's return to action but decided that protecting Peter was more important than trying to join an already-efficient team to ensure his own revenge). =In comics= The Gentleman was revealed to have survived when he resurfaced during Civil War II as an associate of the Kingpin, marking the character's first appearance in a Marvel comic book. After S.H.I.E.L.D. announces that Fisk was killed by the Punisher, the Gentleman and Jigsaw argue over what their next course of action should be, and like the rest of the Kingpin's allies they agree to follow Fisk's protege Janus. Powers and abilities The Gentleman may not have any super-human abilities but his vast wealth gives him virtually unlimited resources. Those resources and the Gentleman's exceptional intellect and talent for scheming and manipulating make him an incredibly dangerous foe. The Gentleman's bodyguard, Pity, has the psionic ability to create and control synthetic darkness that no light can breach; she could generate an equivalent burst of light that inspired positive emotions in those who saw it, but Fiers had apparently trained her not to use that light as he felt that it was of no use to him. Pity also has enhanced speed, strength, and reflexes sufficient to engage Spider-Man in battle. In other media * The Gentleman appears in the mid-credits scene of The Amazing Spider-Man, portrayed by Michael Massee and credited as \\"Man in the Shadows\\". He visits Dr. Curt Connors in his cell at Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, asking him if he told Peter Parker the truth about his father. After Connors denies that he did, the Man in the Shadows leaves the room suddenly by mysteriously vanishing. * The Gentleman returns in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, portrayed once again by Michael Massee.https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/466620/The- Amazing-Spider-Man-2/cast Following the film's climax, he visits Harry Osborn, who is incarcerated in the Ravencroft Institute for his crimes as the Green Goblin. The Gentleman speaks with Osborn about a group he is forming. Osborn informs the Gentleman that all he needs to form the team is located at the \\"special projects\\" room at Oscorp Tower. It's implied the man in the beginning of the film who attempts to murder Peter's parents Richard and Mary Parker was in fact the Gentleman's brother, Karl Fiers, under the behest of Norman Osborn.

William Vint, 1819 engraving Life Vint was born at High Thrunton, near Whittingham, Northumberland, on 1 November 1768. He was educated at Alnmouth and at Warrenford grammar school. About the age of 15 he was placed under the tuition of Samuel Walker, minister at Northowram, with whom he studied theology. He soon became known as a preacher, and on 25 December 1790 was appointed minister at Idle in Yorkshire. In 1795 the academy at Northowram was dissolved, and several of the students were temporarily placed with Vint, who taught them theology. Edward Hanson of London then worked to set up a regular academy at Idle; it began in a small way in 1800, and Vint, the only tutor, at first only took on four pupils. The establishment prospered, and on 21 June 1826 it became known as Airedale Independent College. Vint continued to direct it until his last illness, when on 5 March 1834 it moved locally to Undercliffe. Besides acting as tutor to Airedale College, Vint was minister of Idle till his death there on 13 March 1834. He was buried in the graveyard of the chapel. Works A press was established at Idle in 1824 under the management of his brother, John Vint, at which Vint's 17 publications were printed. Besides sermons, he was the author of: * Strictures on Mr. Morison's Discourse on the Millennium, 1829. Against John Morison. * An Enquiry into the Origin of Opinions relative to an Expected Millennium, 1830. He edited: * Life and Works of Oliver Heywood, 1827‚Äì5, 5 vols. * Illustrations of Prophecy by Joseph Lomas Towers, 1828, 2 vols. * The Suffering Christian's Companion, a selection of discourses, 1830. * The Active Christian's Companion, 1830. * The Privileged Christian's Companion, 1830. * Jonathan Edwards, Humble Attempt to promote Explicit Agreement and Visible Union of God's People in extraordinary Prayer for the Revival of Religion, 1831. * A Selection of Hymns, 3rd edit. 1834. Family Vint married Sarah Sharp of Idle, who died on 5 November 1855. By her he left six sons and two daughters.

The track was released on 13 December 2013 by Universal Music Group as a promotional tool for the album. \\"No Better\\" is an electropop and trip hop ballad with elements of hip hop, in which Lorde discusses an infatuation. Music critics opined that the single has similar musical style to songs from Pure Heroine.  Background and composition \\"No Better\\" was written by Lorde (credited under her birth-name Ella Yelich-O'Connor) and Joel Little. On 13 December 2013, the track was released as a digital download single on the iTunes Store. The single was made available for free until 19 December as a part of the iTunes Store's \\"12 Days of Gifts\\" Christmas promotion. \\"No Better\\" is an electropop and trip hop ballad with hip hop elements. The song has a similar sonority to that of other songs from Pure Heroine, featuring Lorde's \\"feathery\\" vocals and minimal production. It incorporates \\"woozy\\" basslines, and \\"pulsing\\" synthesisers in its instrumentation, making the song's melody \\"dreamy\\", according to Whitney Phaneuf of HitFix. Lyrically, the song features Lorde \\"[celebrating] an infatuation that deepens as the seasons change\\". At the first verse, she sings \\"We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers / And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover\\". During the chorus the bass beat becomes more intense as Lorde sings \\"Go all the way / Have your fun, have it all\\".  Reception  Marc Hogan from Spin wrote that the song \\"flits between fairly vivid first-person details\\", while Whitney Phaneuf from HitFix labelled \\"No Better\\" a \\"sexy\\" track. Eric Danton of Rolling Stone opined that the lyrics of the song are \\"girlish and knowing\\". Writing for Slate, L. V. Anderson shared that \\"No Better\\" is reminiscent of some of the best tracks on Pure Heroine, but also \\"lighter, simpler [...] and more confectionary than most of her debut album\\", in spite of its dark theme. \\"No Better\\" entered the New Zealand Artists Singles Chart at number seven on 23 December 2013.

Bluestone Alley composed by Congfei Wei is Piano Tiles 2 song level it is original composition of Piano Tiles 2, other songs by Congfei Wei is Aurora and Forest of Blocks. If the player taps on a white tile, the player will lose the game and be signaled by an off-tune note. Piano tiles 2 had a long tile tap, double tiles, rapid tiles and slide tiles, and use one song per game, will unlocked 3 new songs per level up and its first level song is Little Star.  Modes  * Classic Mode There is a set number of tiles the player must touch to win. The screen moves manually, at the rate which the tiles are touched.

The game lasts until one tile is missed in between, or a white tile is tapped. It contains a wide variety of variants, all of which are in a similar mode known as Arcade+ Mode. Piano Tiles 2 use only arcade mode per songs with some long tile tap, double tiles, rapid tiles and slide tiles and however after 3 stars the speed is constantly increasing as earning crowns and song loop. * Zen Mode There is a set time limit and the player may attempt to press as many tiles as possible before the time runs out. As with classic mode, the screen moves at the rate which black tiles are pressed. * Rush Mode The screen scrolls automatically, similar to arcade mode. The scroll speed gradually increases and the player is forced to tap tiles at a continuously increasing pace. The player inevitably loses, at which point the game reveals how many tiles per second he or she was able to touch. Piano Tiles 2 is primarily based on Rush Mode, featuring different songs. * Relay Mode Similar to zen mode, but the time limit can be reset by tapping tiles. If the player is unable to tap fifty tiles before the time runs out, the game ends. The screen moves at the player's pace in the same way as classic and zen mode. * Arcade + mode All tiles move the same as in Arcade mode with added extras. ‚Ä¢ Bomb ‚Äì Tiles with skull and cross bones should not be tapped. If tapped the game ends. ‚Ä¢ Lightning ‚Äì The screen goes dark. Then lightning goes on the screen. ‚Ä¢ The Dress ‚Äì The tiles are striped black and blue.

DiVincenzo was first elected to the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1990. He served as the board's president for eight terms. Prior to becoming freeholder, DiVincenzo held public jobs in Essex County as a parks supervisor, teacher, and athletics coordinator. County Executive DiVincenzo was elected county executive in 2002 and was reelected for a fourth term in November 2014. He received the backing of the state's Democratic establishment including Bob Menendez, Cory Booker, Stephen Sweeney, Vincent Prieto, Donald Payne Jr. and Steve Fulop.

In 2011, DiVincenzo while still in office began to collect pension as County Executive. He justified the move by claiming that it is legal and a good decision for his family. =Statewide influence= DiVincenzo is generally considered to be a power broker and political boss of the Essex County political machine, exerting much influence on county and state politics. In 2011 in The New York Times, New Jersey State Senator Kevin O'Toole (R-Essex) is quoted as saying that \\"in terms of Democratic politics, Joe D. is becoming the king of North Jersey.\\" Crossing party lines, he endorsed Republican Governor Chris Christie in his successful 2013 re-election bid. Campaign spending violations investigation In October 2013, questions arose regarding DiVincenzo's campaign spending. The state Election Law Enforcement Commission (ELEC), in 16-count complaint, alleged that he failed to properly report nearly $72,000 in campaign expenditures and improperly spent more than $16,000. In May 2014, it was the commission announced it would not hold a hearing until after election, tentatively in January 2015. It is unclear whether the ELEC will hear the case. The four-person board, by law required to include two Democrats and two Republicans, has been without a Democratic member since Governor Christie has not appointed one. One Democrat, Walter Timpone, recused himself without explanation leading to Divincenzo's lawyers claims that there must be a quorum. The case is unlikely to proceed. Governor Christie chose not to replace the Democrat, effectively crippling the ELEC. Personal life After residing for 34 years in Nutley, he moved with his wife Donna to Roseland in 2013. He has two children, Kimberly DiVincenzo-Root and Joseph DiVincenzo.

It was created on May 5, 2014 by President Benigno Aquino III. The PAFSAM has oversight responsibilities for the four largest executive agencies which were formerly under the purview of the Department of Agriculture (DA): the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA), the National Food Authority (NFA), the National Irrigation Administration (NIA), and the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA). Former Senator Francis Pangilinan was named as the first PAFSAM. Background The post of PAFSAM was created amidst accusations of DA involvement in the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam. Agencies under the DA had allegedly used PDAF monies to make payments to NGOs with links to Janet Lim-Napoles; in Congressional testimony, she provided a list of names of people involved in the scam. Secretary of Agriculture Proceso Alcala was not mentioned in this list, but he was still reported to be under pressure to resign. President Aquino's Memorandum Order No. 70 of May 5, 2014 created the post of PAFSAM, while Executive Order No. 165, signed on the same day, reassigned four former Department of Agriculture agencies to the Office of the President so that they could be overseen by the new PAFSAM. Transfer of agencies The transferred agencies represented three-quarters of the DA's P68.59 billion budget, leading the Manila Standard Today to describe the situation as Alcala \\"los[ing] Agri control\\" and being \\"reduced to a mere titular head\\". However, the DA retained control over the National Dairy Corporation and thirty-five smaller agencies. Opposition politicians including Jonathan dela Cruz of Abakada were dissatisfied with the mere reduction in Alcala's powers, and continued to call for President Aquino to dismiss him. After the reassignment of the four agencies from the DA to the PAFSAM, two of Alcala's appointees ‚Äî Orlan Calayag of the NFA and Euclides Forbes of the PCA ‚Äî submitted what they referred to as \\"courtesy resignations\\", stating that they wanted to allow Pangilinan to be able to appoint his own preferred candidates to lead their respective agencies. Alcala's other appointee, NIA administrator Claro Maranan, decided to serve out the rest of his originally-appointed term until June, though his acting senior deputy administrator Felix Razo resigned on May 5. FPA director Norli Gicana, who was not an Alcala appointee, did not make any comment on whether or not he would resign. Policies and programs President Aquino appointed Pangilinan, the former head of the Senate's Committee on Agriculture, as the first PAFSAM with a mission to \\"clean up\\" the DA; in media comments, Pangilinan speculated that Aquino felt pressure to deal with agriculture issues, and with only two years of his term remaining, said that Aquino decided that drastic measures were necessary. In media comments in late May 2014, Pangilinan stated his belief \\"secure farmers\\" were a prerequisite for food security in the Philippines, but that \\"[a] new generation refuses to go into farming\\". He also suggested the need for establishment of model farms to promulgate new technologies to farmers.

Geographical region  In the Book of Documents, Yongzhou is mentioned as one of the legendary Nine Provinces of China's prehistoric antiquity. From the Western Zhou dynasty to the Western Jin dynasty, the name Yongzhou was applied to the area around the imperial capital, whether it was the Wei Valley (also known as Guanzhong) or the territory around Luoyang. When Emperor Wu of the Western Han dynasty created the 13 inspectorates (Âà∫Âè≤ÈÉ®; ), the western part of Yongzhou became part of Liangzhou Inspectorate (ÂáâÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÈÉ®) and its eastern part was governed by the Colonel-Director of Retainers (Âè∏Èö∂Ê†°Â∞â).  Han province  When Emperor Wu of Han relocated the Han capital to Luoyang, he briefly established a formal Yong Province. However, he abolished it soon after.  Han inspectorate  In 194, the Eastern Han government established a Yongzhou Inspectorate overseeing the commanderies of Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, Dunhuang, and Xihai (Ë•øÊµ∑) west of the Liang River. The inspectorate seat was at Guzhang (ÂßëËáß). In the year 213, the Liangzhou Inspectorate was eliminated and the commanderies of the Three Guardians (‰∏âËºî, ) were absorbed as part of Yongzhou Inspectorate.  Wei inspectorate  In 220, amid the Three Kingdoms Era, the Wei government reconstituted the Liangzhou Inspectorate from the eight commanderies of Yong Province west of the Liang River. Yong Province was established as an inspectorate to the east of Liangzhou and the Yellow River, near the commanderies of the Three Guardians near the capital of Chang'an, with the inspectorate seat at Chang'an. The situation remained the same throughout the Three Kingdoms period and Western Jin dynasty.  Former Qin province  The Former Qin dynasty suddenly shifted Yongzhou to Anding Commandery (ÂÆâÂÆöÈÉ°) in present-day Zhenyuan and Puban Commandery (Ëí≤ÂùÇÈÉ°) in present-day Yongji. Southern & Northern geographical regions  During the time of rival dynasties in the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, the Northern Wei, Western Wei and Northern Zhou dynasties in the north referred to Yongzhou as to the environs of Chang'an with its government seat at Chang'an, while the Eastern Jin dynasty and the Southern Dynasties in the south referred to Yongzhou as the environs of Xiangyang.  Sui province  After the reunification of China by the Sui dynasty, Yong Province's administrative centre was permanently set at Chang'an. During the Sui administrative reforms in 607 to transform the provincial system into a commandery system, Emperor Yang renamed Yong Province to Jingzhao Commandery (‰∫¨ÂÖÜÈÉ°).  Tang province  When the Tang dynasty was established, it was reverted for some time back to Yong Province, until Emperor Xuanzong converted it again to Jingzhao Prefecture (‰∫¨ÂÖÜÂ∫ú).

Up to a dozen explosives were thrown at shoppers from the windows of the SUVs. The SUVs crashed into shoppers then collided with each other and exploded. 43 people were killed, including 4 of the assailants, and more than 90 wounded, making this the deadliest attack of the Xinjiang conflict. The event was designated as a terrorist attack. Background On 30 April 2014, two suicide bombings killed three and injured seventy-nine, leaving a level of high security in the region and the train station where the attack occurred \\"like a fortress\\", with men bearing arms at ticket gates, multiple police trucks in the city, and checkpoints. The region had experienced a more volatile year leading up to the May bombings, and Uyghurs worry at the influx of Han Chinese into the region and controls upon their religion and culture, which they fear are being destroyed. Attack Gongyuan Street (the location of the attack) After the market blasts, √úr√ºmqi entered a state of enhanced security with each school, university, residential area entrance, avenue, and vital junction having concrete barricades set up in order to defend against similar ramming attacks by vehicles. This image shows many concrete barricades on Henan East Road, New Downtown, √úr√ºmqi. The attack struck a morning market on North Gongyuan (Park) Street beside People's Park in Saybagh District of central √úr√ºmqi. It is a busy market serving neighbourhood residents, frequented especially by the elderly. According to residents, most customers of the market are Han Chinese, though many vendors are Uyghur. At 7:50 am CST (although China only has one official time zone, √úr√ºmqi has an unofficial time zone two hours behind Chinese Standard Time, making the time 5:50 am local time), at a time when few people were about due to the early hour, two SUVs without license plates, but flying flags with Uyghur writing, travelling southward, were driven through metal barriers into an area with shoppers. The drivers of the SUVs ran people down while up to a dozen explosives were thrown out the car windows. The vehicles then had a head-on collision, resulting in a large explosion \\"with flames shooting as high as a one-story building\\". A cordon was set up to keep onlookers back, but pictures depicting a large black smoke cloud were posted on Weibo, and images showed bodies lying on the floor and destroyed market stalls. Within ten minutes, the injured began to be transported to hospitals. Police and more emergency-service vehicles arrived in the following 30 minutes. Within a few hours, Paramilitary police were patrolling the area, and photographers and videographers were forced to delete images and not to take new ones. A day after the attack, Chinese state media reported that it was perpetrated by five suicide bombers. 43 people were killed, including four of the assailants, and more than 90 were wounded. The fifth suspect was arrested. Most of the victims were Han Chinese, including many elderly shoppers. Response Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang responded to the incident by promising \\"decisive actions against terrorist attacks\\", and stated that a ‚Äústrike-first‚Äù strategy would be implemented. They also called on government officials in the region to do everything they could to ensure that the injured were assisted, the crime investigated and the perpetrators punished severely.

He was born in Trieste when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1918 he moved with his family to Ljubljana, part of the newly created Yugoslavia. After military training as a reserve officer, he began his career with the National Bank of Yugoslavia in Split where he also developed his skill as an artist.http://www.prah.net/slovenia/slovenians/rapotec/index.htm  Early life  Stanislav Rapotec was born in Trieste in 1913, however he grew up in Ljubljana as his family moved there during 1918. He studied economics at the University of Zagreb from 1933 to 1939. In 1939, he moved to Split, where he worked at a bank. He decided to take up painting during this time.  World War II  Rapotec was mobilized into the Royal Yugoslav Army before the invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany and Italy on 6 April 1941. Rapotec was taken prisoner by the Germans, but subsequently escaped to Split controlled by the Italian army. Rapotec escaped to Split, where he fought for the Yugoslavian government in exile. He had also visited Jerusalem, where he met Julian Amery of the British Special Operations Executive. In January 1942, he covertly returned to Split. ≈Ωarko Todoroviƒá, the leader of the Chetnik resistance, also organized radio communication between Rapotec and Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. He spent April to June of that year in Zagreb. During this time he met with the Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac five times. Later in July, he went back to the middle eastern region. He was feared lost by the allies. He has traveled from Split to Mostar to Zagreb (where he had sheltered for 2 and a half months and met surviving Jews and Serbs) to Belgrade, and finally to Turkey.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-stanislaus- rapotec-1287785.html  Life as a painter  After the war, Stanislav moved to Adelaide, Australia, where he started to paint again. In 1955, he moved to Sydney. He started using his name in Latinized form (Stanislaus, or simply Stan). In 1961, he won Blake Prize for Religious Art. He was a member of the group of Sydney-based abstract artists called the Sydney 9. After his wife, Andree, had died, he traveled and painted all across Europe. He died in Sydney due a stroke in 1997.  Legacy  Stanislav Rapotec is famous for his art works, which are all exhibited in London, Rome, Paris, and the U.S..

Among his achievements is the derivation of the Meir-Wingreen Formula, and proposing a solution for the 0.7 anomaly puzzle in quantum point contacts.  Career  Meir was educated in Tel Aviv University, where he obtained a PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics under the supervision of Amnon Aharony and Yoseph Imry. He held postdoctoral positions at MIT (1989‚Äì91), with Patrick Lee, and at the University of California at Santa Barbara (1991‚Äì94), with Walter Kohn. In 1994 he joined the physics department at Ben Gurion University, Beersheba, Israel as a faculty member. He holds a visiting position at Princeton University. Meir has published more than 100 papers in refereed journals. Early in his career he concentrated on transport through quantum dots, explaining the Coulomb oscillations in the measured electric current. In the process he derived the Meir-Wingreen formula for the electric current through interaction system, a now textbook formula. Later on he made numerous contributions to the field of transport in disordered systems, in particular to the issue of phase transitions in such media, such as the metal- insulator transition in two-dimensions and the Superconductor Insulator Transition in thin films, and to the field of strong correlation effects in mesoscopic devices, in the particular the manifestation of the Kondo effect. In the latter context he suggested a solution for the long standing puzzle of the 0.7 anomaly ‚Äì the observation of a step in the conductance of quantum point contacts, around the value of 0.7 2e2/h (where e is the electron charge and h the Planck constant), in addition to the expected integer steps. This explanation is based on an emergence of a quasi-localized state in the quantum point contact, associated with slow electrons above the point contact barrier, an observation that has been verified experimentally. In recent years he has extended his research to the field of biology, together with his colleague Ned Wingreen from Princeton University.

As such, it is becoming an important addition to material flow accounting. Introduction In recognition of the increasing importance of global resource use mediated by international trade for environmental accounting and policy, new perspectives have been and are currently being developed within environmental accounting. The most prominent among these are consumption-based accounts compiled using environmentally extended input-output analysis. Consumption-based indicators of material use are commonly referred to as ‚Äúmaterial footprints‚Äù (comparable to carbon footprints and water footprints) or as raw material equivalents (RME) for imported and exported goods. Raw material equivalents or material footprints of traded goods comprise the material inputs required along the entire supply chain associated with their production. This includes both direct and indirect flows: For example, the ore mined to extract the metal contained in a mobile phone as well as the coal needed to generate the electricity needed to produce the metal concentrates would be included. In order to allocate domestic extraction to exported goods, information on the production and trade structure of an economy is required. In monetary terms, information on the production structure is contained in commonly available economy-wide input-output tables (IOT) which recently have been combined with trade statistics to form multi-regional IO (MRIO) tables. Input-Output Analysis for EEIOA In the following, a short introduction to input-output analysis and its environmental extension for the calculation of material footprints or RME indicators is provided. The inter-industry flows within an economy form an matrix and the total output of each industry forms an vector . By dividing each flow into an industry (i.e., each element of ) by the total output of that same industry, we obtain an matrix of so-called technical coefficients . In matrix algebra, this reads as follows: A = Z \\\\times \\\\hat{x}^{-1} where: : \\\\hat{x} represents the vector diagonlized into a matrix (\\\\hat{x} = I\\\\vec{x}) Matrix contains the multipliers for the inter-industry inputs required to supply one unit of industry output. A certain total economic output is required to satisfy a given level of final demand . This final demand may be domestic (for private households as well as the public sector) or foreign (exports) and can be written as an vector. When this vector of final demand is multiplied by the Leontief inverse , we obtain total output . is the identity matrix so that the following matrix equation is the result of equivalence operations in our previous equation: \\\\vec x = \\\\left ( I - A \\\\right )^{-1} \\\\times \\\\vec y The Leontief inverse contains the multipliers for the direct and indirect inter-industry inputs required to provide 1 unit of output to final demand. Next to the inter-industry flows recorded in , each industry requires additional inputs (e.g. energy, materials, capital, labour) and outputs (e.g. emissions) which can be introduced into the calculation with the help of an environmental extension. This commonly takes the shape of an matrix of total factor inputs or outputs: Factors are denoted in a total of rows and the industries by which they are required are included along columns. Allocation of factors to the different industries in the compilation of the extension matrix requires careful review of industry statistics and national emissions inventories. In case of lacking data, expert opinions or additional modelling may be required to estimate the extension. Once completed, can be transformed into a direct factor requirements matrix per unit of useful output , and the calculation is analogous to determination of the monetary direct multipliers matrix (see first equation): F = M \\\\times \\\\hat x ^{-1} Consumption-based accounting of resource use and emissions can be performed by post-multiplying the monetary input-output relation by the industry-specific factor requirements: E = F(I-A)^{-1} \\\\times \\\\vec y This formula is the core of environmentally extended input-output analysis: The final demand vector can be split up into a domestic and a foreign (exports) component, which makes it possible to calculate the material inputs associated with each. The matrix integrates material flow data into input-output analysis. It allows us to allocate economy-wide material requirements to specific industries. With the help of the coefficients contained in the Leontief inverse , the material requirements can be allocated to domestic or foreign (exports) final demand. In order to consider variations in production structures across different economies or regions, national input-output tables are combined to form so- called multi-regional input-output (MRIO) models. In these models, the sum total of resources allocated to final consumption equals the sum total of resources extracted, as recorded in the material flow accounts for each of the regions. Critical Issues Environmentally extended input-output analysis comes with a number of assumptions which have to be kept in mind when interpreting the results of such studies: > Homogeneity of products: Calculations based on the standard IO model make it > necessary to assume that each economic activity produces only one physically > homogeneous product. In reality, however, the high level of aggregation of > activities (e.g., in most European IO tables, all mining is included in the > same activity irrespective of the specific material) leads to inhomogeneous > outputs. In addition, many industries generate by-products (e.g., a paper > mill may also produce saw dust); and this additionally violates the > assumption of homogeneity of outputs. Along the same lines, when this method > is used to ascribe environmental impacts, not all the products in a given > sector have the same emissions. An average is used. But for instance in > terms of power generation, the emissions from coal based power generation > are very different from those of solar power generation. An assumption is > made here that the global mixture is being used, when actually power > generation may be available only from one source. Homogeneity of prices: In > using the standard IO model, it is also necessary to assume that each > industry sells its characteristic output to all other economic activities > and to final consumers at the same price. In reality, however, this is not > always true as illustrated by the example of electricity which costs less in > the primary than in the tertiary sectors and/or final consumption. In > addition, the aforementioned heterogeneity of industry output will cause > this assumption to be violated: For example, a sector buying mostly aluminum > from the non-ferrous metal industries is likely to pay a different price > than a sector that mostly buys rare earth metals. Constant Returns to Scale: > IO models assume that when production is scaled, all the inputs and outputs > scale by the same factor. Allocation of investments: In creating a > consumption-based account of material flows, it is necessary to decide how > investments are allocated within the production and consumption structure. > In national accounting, investments are reported as part of final demand. > From a consumption-based perspective, they can also be thought of as an > input into the production process (e.g., machinery and production > infrastructure are necessary inputs to production). The manner in which > capital investments are included and how (or if) they are depreciated, > significantly impacts the results obtained for the raw material equivalents > of exports. If infrastructure investments (whether in monetary terms or as > domestic extraction of construction materials) are not depreciated over > time, importing one and the same product from an emerging economy currently > building up its infrastructure will be associated with much more embodied > material than importing it from a mature economy which has significantly > invested into its infrastructure in the past. Understanding the impact and eventually resolving these methodological issues will become important items on the environmental accounting research agenda. At the same time, interest is already growing in the interpretability of the results of such consumption-based approaches. It has yet to be determined how responsibility for material investments into the production of exports should be shared in general: While it is true that the importing economy receives the benefit of the ready-made product, it is also true that the exporting economy receives the benefit of income.

It is located about east of Kambalda and north east of Norseman on the western edge of the Nullarbor plain in the Goldfields- Esperance region of Western Australia. Kinclaven occupies an area of and is mostly composed of deflated limestone plains with regular karst depressions surrounded by bindii grasslands along with areas of calcrete plains covered with myall woodlands and mixed shrubland. The property is able to carry a flock of 33,250 sheep. The station is an amalgamation of several leases including Seemore Downs and Premier Downs. The area was first used for pastoral pursuits in the early 1900s by J. D. Ryan, who ran stock to supply meat to the workers on the Trans-Australian Railway line, which passed through the holding. In the 1920s the lease was acquired by the Dimer brothers who also owned Nanambinnia. By the 1930s the Dimers had sunk more wells in the area and installed windmills, the built cattle yards and constructed a small cottage on the property. The Dimers continued to acquire surrounding leases through the 1930s and in 1936 the homestead building was taken from the Eyre repeater station and was moved to the Seemore Downs lease and rebuilt. The building had originally been built in 1877. By the 1960s leases in the area were reallocated comprising much larger and more viable areas. M. H. Kittle took up Seemore Downs and Premier Downs and established an outcamp at Endeavour bore. He also employed a station manager and changed the herd to shorthorn cattle. In 1971 the Hogg family acquired the leases for between Seemore Downs and Gunnadorah and named it Kinclaven after the Scottish village where he had been born. By 1978, after a four years of below average rainfall, the property was carrying 700 head of cattle. In 1982 the Hoggs acquired the leases of Seemore Downs and Premier Downs then further leases were added to the station in 1987.

Life Walker was born in Dublin and educated under Thomas Ball. An invalid with acute asthma, in his earlier years he travelled a great deal for his health, and for many years lived in Italy. Walker's main work is Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards (1786), an important source for, among others, the life of the Irish harper Turlough Carolan. Lesa N√≠ Mhunghaile is of the view that the translations of Irish poems in this publication were influenced by Ossian, but also were considered by the author to improve on the originals. Walker's Historical Essay on the Dress of the Ancient and Modern Irish (1788) was also concerned with the recovery of the Irish past. Walker was aware of the tension between national revival and the bardic note of loss. Walker was one of the original members of the Royal Irish Academy and contributed papers to its Transactions. Besides his more important writings (see below) he also wrote Anecdotes on Chess in Ireland, a paper contributed to Charles Vallancey's Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis. He also left works in manuscript, including a journal of his travels and materials for Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers of Ireland. Francis Hardy, biographer of the Earl of Charlemont, undertook a biography of Walker, finished in 1812, but then suppressed by the family. On Hardy's death the materials were handed to Edward Berwick, who does not seem to have completed the work. Many of Walker's letters are printed in John Nichols's Literary Illustrations. After his time in Italy, Walker settled down in a house called St. Valerie, Bray, County Wicklow, with art treasures and an extensive library. Here he passed the rest of his life. He died on 12 April 1810 in Enniskerry, County Wicklow, and was buried on 14 April in St Mary's Churchyard, Dublin. Works *Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards (London: T.

Description  The music played by a rock band is built on the basis of elements of folk-rock, punk, ska and is decorated with a colorful addition of forceful melodies. In general the style of the band can be described as folk punk.  History The first performance of the group was held in November 23, 2010 in Lviv in Nabutky Etnoclub and Lviv Art association Dzyga. Over the next two years, the band toured with performances in almost every major city in Western Ukraine, having played more than 50 concerts (including the performance in one of the largest Ukrainian festivals of music and art, which is festival \\"Zahid\\"). On March 26, 2013 the band presented their debut mini-album (EP) called \\"Percha\\", which included 5 songs. On March 31, 2013 the band took part in a radio project Tysa FM Live, doing online tracks live from the debut album. Later \\"Trystavisim\\" was invited to take part in the filming of television programs on the first national TV channel (Folk- music) and TVI (Music for Adult with Maria Burmaka). On August 13, 2013 was presented a debut video clip for the song called \\"Dyslocatsiya\\" which received approving reviews from music critics.

For resource use In-use stocks of buildings, infrastructure, and (durable) products play several important roles in social metabolism: * They supply physical services such as transportation or shelter to people. * They are ‚Äòcapital containers‚Äô and ‚Äòresource repositories‚Äô representing large accumulations of fixed capital and materials; for example, steel and concrete in buildings. * They are ‚Äòdynamics determiners‚Äô; their lifetime determines replacement flows and when new technologies can penetrate the market. * They are ‚Äòwealth watchers‚Äô and can serve as an indicator of the amount of services utilized within a given socio-economic system. * They are ‚Äòconsumption couplers‚Äô because their technical properties determine the energy and material throughput required to operate them. * They are ‚Äòcity shapers‚Äô as the location and density of buildings determines transport patterns and other parameters of the urban fabric. Dynamic stock modelling (DSM) explicitly considers these different roles of in-use stocks. DSM has a long tradition in modelling population and fixed capital; over the last twenty years, applications for product and material stocks have been developed. Age-cohort- based models, state-of-the-art in DSM, are of a descriptive nature: Each age- cohort is assigned an expected lifetime and the cohort‚Äôs use phase ends when its lifetime elapses. At any given point in time, in-use stocks are composed of different age-cohorts, each with its specific material content and energy efficiency. In DSM, the assumed total stock size is determined by exogenously specified parameters such as population and per capita service level and the age-cohort lifetime model can be used to adjust the inflows into and the outflows from stocks. Further applications DSM is the basis for many other types of modelling; examples include integrated assessment models, system dynamics models, population balance models, and dynamic material flow accounting (MFA) models. The latter are an important manner in which the material and technological detail of MFA is enhanced. DSM of materials additionally allows for the modelling of the end-of-life product flow which is the sum of all discarded products leaving the use phase according to the lifetime distribution chosen. This enables forecasting of waste volume and recycling potential and provides essential information for resource and energy use reduction strategies. The connection between dynamic DSM and waste input- output (IO) models, a special IO model type designed for handling waste, is currently under development and will allow for simultaneous assessment of environmental impacts of material production and recycling.

John Howkins developed the concept in 2001 to describe economic systems where value is based on novel imaginative qualities rather than the traditional resources of land, labour and capital.:John Howkins (2001; 2nd Edition, 2013), The Creative Economy, Chap 1. Compared to creative industries, which are limited to specific sectors, the term is used to describe creativity throughout a whole economy. Some observers take the view that creativity is the defining characteristic of developed 21st century economies, just as manufacturing typified 19th and early 20th centuries.OCED 2014 Forum .  Definitions of a creative economy  Definitions of a modern creative economy continue to evolve.John Howkins, ‚ÄòCreative Ecologies‚Äô, 2009, Chap 2. When John Howkins popularized the term ‚Äúcreative economy‚Äù in 2001, he applied the term to the arts, cultural goods and services, toys and games, and research and development. The most common models of the creative economy share many elements. Howkins‚Äô creativity-based model includes all kinds of creativity, whether expressed in art or innovation.John Howkins, 2013, op cit., Chap 1. The narrower culture-based models concentrate on arts, design and media and are normally restricted to nominated industries.DCMS Mapping Document, 2nd edition, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creative- industries-mapping-documents-2001. The term increasingly refers to all economic activity that depends on a person's individual creativity for its economic value whether the result has a cultural element or not. In this usage, the creative economy occurs wherever individual creativity is the main source of value and the main cause of a transaction. There are several ways to measure a creative economy. It is possible to use the same indicators as in other economies, such as producer outputs, consumer expenditure, employment and trade. Businesses also use valuation, value chains, price and transactional data. There are additional indicators of intellectual property. However, measuring intangibles such as ideas, design, brands and style presents a challenge.Robert S Kaplan and David Norton, ‚ÄòStrategy Maps: Converting Intangible Assets into Tangible Outcomes‚Äô, 2004; and International Accounting Standards, ‚ÄòIAS 38: Intangible Assets‚Äô, revised 12 May 2014. Furthermore, the nature of work is different, with a high proportion of part- time workers and with many transactions being non-financial. Governments have been slow to adjust their national statistics to capture the new forms of creative occupations, productions and transactions. As a result, national data on employment, GDP and trade is often unreliable. America and the UK are in the process of adjusting their national statistics to measure their creative economies more accurately.US Department of Commerce, ‚ÄòPreview of 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Producer Accounts, March 2013; and Howkins, 2013, page 153.  History  The roots of today's creative economy go back to two main themes on the nature of work and especially the relationship between the individual and their work. The first started with the industrial revolution and focussed on urbanisation, information and knowledge, and was developed by economists and management writers.Peter Drucker, ‚ÄòThe Landmarks of Tomorrow‚Äô, 1959; and Daniel Bell, ‚ÄòThe Coming of Post-Industrial Society, 1973. In the second half of the 20th century these ideas were expressed as the Post-Industrial Society, Information Society, Knowledge Society and Network Society. These concepts prioritised data and knowledge over the individual's creation of new ideas and made little reference to an individual's personal creativity or the cultural context. The second theme was the arts and culture. Europe began to recognise culture's economic elements and to develop the concepts of cultural industries and creative industries in the 1990s. These prioritised culture, design and media. This approach was led by the British Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) which designated 14 creative industries in 1998, later reduced to 12.Creative Industries Mapping, Documents 2001: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creative- industries-mapping-documents-2001. Other developments at the turn of the century include Richard Florida‚Äôs creative class and Charles Landry‚Äôs creative city.Richard Florida, ‚ÄòThe Rise of the Creative Class: And how it‚Äôs transforming work, leisure, community and everyday life‚Äô, 2002.Charles Landry, ‚ÄòThe Creative City: A toolkit for urban innovators‚Äô 2000. The primary role of individual creativity as the defining source of the new economy was put forward by John Howkins in 2001.John Howkins, The Creative Economy, 2001. He prioritised creativity rather than either information or culture. He defined a creative product as an economic good, service or experience resulting from creativity and with the characteristics of being personal, novel and meaningful. He said its defining characteristics are twofold: it results from creativity and its economic value is based on creativity. Howkins‚Äô second edition of The Creative Economy in 2013 shows an even greater awareness of the importance of creativity and the need to include all economic activity. Howkins acknowledges that creative economies have been found in many societies over time. ‚ÄòCreativity is not new and neither is economics but what is new is the nature of the relationship between them‚Äô.John Howkins, The Creative Economy, 2013. He suggests this new relationship reflects increases in higher education, shifts in employment patterns, market liberalisation, higher average wages, more leisure time and increasing urbanisation. In 2013 the British NESTA criticised the UK government culture-based approach saying, ‚ÄòFor example, the definition doesn‚Äôt include a large (and growing) software segment of the creative industries‚Äô.Hasan Bakhshi, Ian Hargreaves and Juan Mateos- Garcia, ‚ÄòA Manifesto for the Creative Economy‚Äô, NESTA, 2013. It proposed a new model based on creative intensity. This uses five criteria to measure the extent to which a specific occupation is creative, regardless of whether the worker is in a nominated industry. The criteria include novelty, a resistance to mechanisation and non-repetitiveness. Creative economies are more commonly found in market-based economies where they can benefit from intellectual and artistic freedom, lack of censorship, access to knowledge, availability of private capital, and the freedom to set market prices and where the population is able to exercise their own choice in terms of what choose to buy or rent. Command economies may allow selected individuals to be creative but cannot sustain a creative economy. The growth of China's economy since 1980 has been stimulated by market-based creativity and innovation.Marina Guo, ‚ÄòCreative Transformations‚Äô, 2011. Europe, America, Japan, China and other countries see creativity as the dominant economic force affecting jobs, economic growth and social welfare. The 2014 OECD Forum declared ‚ÄòCreativity and innovation are now driving the economy, reshaping entire industries and stimulating inclusive growth‚Äô.OECD 2014 Forum .‚ÄòThe 'creative economy', and the broad spectrum of creative industries that it encompasses, is increasingly important in the 21st century's global economy‚Äô (Colette Henry and Anne de Bruin, 2011).Entrepreneurship and the Creative Economy: Process, Practice and Policy Ruth Towse and Christian Handke, ‚ÄòCreative Economy, Creative Cities‚Äô, 2013.

The Estate Originally a fruit farm planted with apples, pears and plums, Furneaux farm was purchased by Charles and Zelda Fox in 2005 after an inter-regional search for Cap Classique-specific terroir. The cellar was built in 2010 with an underground storage capacity of 200 000 bottles. In concordance with advice on clone and site selection from viticulturist Paul Wallace, 6.3ha of land was planted to 10 blocks of vines. These face north-east and south on an elevation between 230m and 300m above sea level. Perold-trellised rows were planted in a north-west to south-east direction primarily to minimise wind damage. An analysis conducted by soil scientist Johann Lanz indicates that the soils are mainly Tukulu with a thin horizon of clay grading into weathered shale in the subsoil. These soils are well suited to quality wine production. Water is well retained so drip irrigation is used twice a year at most. Kevin Watt has been the consultant viticulturist since 2008.

Due to the friendliness of the reptiles, it has become popular among tourists and the pond is now reliant on tourism to ensure the population of crocodiles remain fed and healthy. It is also known as Chiefs pond.  Description  The pond is located in Paga in the Upper East Region of Ghana, and is outside Bolgatanga, the regional capital. It is inhabited by wild West African crocodiles, with some up to 90 years old. The crocodiles are so tame that local children can swim in the pond alongside them without being harmed. Paga is known to be a trade center for centuries and closer to the Burkina Faso border. During the period of the slave traders in mid 1800s, they use Paga as a gateway to the Gulf of Guinea which points from the north.  History  The locally told origin of the pond was that a crocodile brought a dying man to the pond to drink, who after surviving, declared the pond to be sacred and that no harm should come to the crocodiles. This legend of the crocodiles is claimed to date back to about 600 years. The crocodiles are considered to be totems for these local people. Another story states that a man was trapped against the water's edge by a lion, when he bargained with a crocodile that none of his children would harm his kind if he would kill the lion. It is believed that the souls of the people of Paga resides in these crocodiles. It is an offence to kill crocodiles in Paga, or eat crocodile meat.  Tourism  The crocodiles at Paga are very friendly. Visitors can sit, touch and take photographs with the crocodiles. The crocodiles roam freely throughout the pond, and are brought to the shore when the guides whistle loudly. Tourists can then take photographs while holding the crocodile's tails, after the guide has fed them a chicken. There are concerns that the pond is now too reliant on tourism, with caretaker Salifu Awewozem saying in 2009 that the elderly crocodiles require specialist care, and the only time additional food is provided to the reptiles is when tourists pay for the chickens when they pose for photographs. Tourists use Paga as an opportunity to see preserved slave camps. The also enjoy village tours and evening drumming and dancing by any local cultural group could be arranged for them.  Tourists Site in Paga  The Pikworo Slave Camp is located in Paga- Nania. It was created purposely for holding slaves that are brought down from the north. Slaves were forced to walk about 150km to the south to the slave market at Salaga. They are then taken to the coast for shipment.

The mediaeval mansion house formerly standing on this site was the ancient seat of the Pollard family Sculpted reliefs of three faces, c. 1300, now set into wall of facade of Way Barton, St Giles in the Wood parish, Devon. Two females wearing wimples below, with a mustachioed male apparently wearing a coronet, above Way is a historic estate in the parish of St Giles in the Wood, Devon. It is situated about 2 miles north-east of the village of St Giles in the Wood and about 4 miles north-east of the town of Great Torrington. It was described by Hoskins (1959) as \\"the fons et origoLatin: \\"Fount/spring/source and origin\\" of the mighty tribe of Pollard\\" and had been acquired by them from the de la Way family at some time before 1242.Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p.470 One of the earliest members descended from this family to reach national prominence was Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465-1526), Justice of the Common Pleas from 1514 to 1526, of Grilstone, Bishop's Nympton, described by Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) in his Worthies of England as one of several Devonshire men \\"inundated with a genius to study law\\". The former mansion of the Pollards at Way is now represented by the farmhouse known as Way Barton. Reset into the front wall of the house is a stone sculpture dated about 1300 showing the faces of two ladies wearing wimples and above them the smaller face of a man.Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.707 In 1309 Robert Pollard was granted by the Bishop of Exeter licence to build an oratory at Weye, of which no trace remains in the present house.Coulter, James, Ancient Chapels of North Devon, 1993, p.64 Descent of the estate =Lord M Way= Arms of de la Way: Argent, a chevron sable between three mullets gules (often shown as mullets pierced) The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (died 1640) (who lived at Winscott in the same parish of St Giles in the Wood) stated Way to have been the residence of the de la Way family during the reign of King John (1199-1216), and to have been granted, during the reign of Edward I (1272-1307), by Walter de la Way, the son of William de la Way, to Walter Pollard, which grant was witnessed by Sir Henry Sully and Sir Thomas Merton.Risdon, Tristram (died 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.274, Torrington The arms of de la Way were later quartered by their descendants the Pollard family and by the Davie family (later Davie Baronets of Creedy, Sandford). The usual explanation of this usage of the de la Way arms is as given for example in the 1771 Baronetage of England, by Kimber and Johnson:Kimber, E., & Johnson, Richard, The Baronetage of England, Volume I, London, 1711, pp.416-19, Davie of Creedy :\\"The inhabitants of this seat\\" (i.e. Way, erroneously said to be situated in the parish of Horwood, another Pollard seat) \\"and ancestors of this family, were first of all known by the name of De-la-Wey, and the first of them mentioned in their pedigree had coat armour, which hath ever since continued the fame to this family, although their names have diversly been written, De-la-Wey, then Dewy, De-Vie, and afterwards contracted and softened into Davie; unto which variation it was the more subject, for that many hundred years since, one Walter Pollard, matching with the daughter and heir- general of this family, became owner of the said ancient habitation, called Wey, which gave name to the family, as aforefaid, and which, ever since the said marriage, hath continued with the Pollards, who, in respect of that match, do also, at this day, quarter the coat of the Davies\\". The family of Davie of Creedy is said by the Devon topographer Rev. Swete (died 1821)Gray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend John Swete, 1789-1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, Vol.3, p.120 to have derived from the family of de Way (Latinised to de Via, of which \\"Davie\\" is said to be a corrupted form) of the manor of Way in the parish of St Giles in the Wood,Way, sometimes stated incorrectly to be in the parish of Horwood, 3 miles north-east of Bideford (i.e. Swete, vol.3, p.98) near Great Torrington, Devon.

Background Born in Standard in northern La Salle Parish in North Louisiana, Blackmon was one of two daughters of Robert Samuel Kinnison and the former Emma Horne. Her sister, Dorothy Kinnision, preceded her in death. In 1967, Blackmon became the first woman to receive a degree in industrial management from the College of Business Administration of the University of Louisiana at Monroe. In 1968, she became the first woman elected president of the Louisiana Realtors Association. She was instrumental in securing the property which became the West Monroe Post Office as well as the acquisition of Glenwood Mall and its conversion to a Medical Mall. In 1974, she was the first woman in Louisiana to receive the Realtor designation of \\"Certified Commercial Investment Member.\\" She was the first woman named to the Louisiana Board of Commerce and Industry, an appointment that she received in 1976 from then Lieutenant Governor Jimmy Fitzmorris. She was a former director of the West Monroe Chamber of Commerce. Political life In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 1983, Blackmon led the Republican insurance agent Robert Charles Payne (born c. 1943) by 14 votes, 3,244 (22.5 percent) to 3,230 (22.4 percent). Four other candidates held the actual majority of the votes cast, 55 percent, but were eliminated in the general election between frontrunners Blackmon and Payne. Blackmon then defeated Payne, 5,295 (53.9 percent) to 4,523 (46.1 percent), but her seat would turn Republican with the 1995 election. During her one term in the legislature, Blackmon and Kathleen Blanco of Lafayette were two of only five women in both houses of the state legislature. Blanco was subsequently elected governor of Louisiana in 2003, with her friend Blackmon's support.\\"Former state representative Blackmon dead at 89\\", Monroe News-Star, May 22, 2014 While serving in the state House, she helped to secure the I-20 Camp Road Interchange in Ouachita Parish.

Fellow Democrat Charles Anding, a labor union official from West Monroe, who led in the primary with 4,569 votes (29.8 percent), was placed into a general election with Republican David Glen Haynes (born c. 1954), who received 3,984 primary votes (26 percent). Anding then narrowly defeated Haynes to claim the seat. Haynes had also run unsuccessfully for this same House seat in 1983. Death at 89 Blackmon and her late husband, Dr. Edward S. Blackmon, Jr., had two children, Dr. Larry Blackmon and wife Dency, and Jan Mattingly and husband, Dale, all of West Monroe. The couple had a second home on Caney Lake in Jackson Parish and traveled widely throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia during their time together. Blackmon died at the age of eighty-nine. Services were held on May 23 in the Feazel Chapel of the First Baptist Church of West Monroe, where she was a long-time member. Burial followed at Mulhearn Memorial Park in Monroe.

During World War I, she was the flagship of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian Army, the Romanian Navy and Army, and the French Army. She reverted to the name Bosna in May 1917, after the original SMS Temes was raised and returned to service. After brief service with the Hungarian People's Republic at the end of the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Vardar. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission. During the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she was the flagship of the 1st Monitor Division, and along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border during the first few days of the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, the monitors' navigation was difficult, and they were scuttled by their crews on 11 April. Some of her crew may have been killed when a demolished bridge collapsed onto a tugboat after they abandoned ship. Some tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most surrendered to the Germans at Sarajevo on 14 April. The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor, where they were captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April. Description and construction Vardar was a Sava-class river monitor built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, and was laid down as Bosna at Linz in 1914, as part of the Austro- Hungarian 1914‚Äì15 Naval Program. She was named after the river Bosna, but was renamed Temes (II) during construction, after the sinking of the original SMS Temes by a mine on the Sava River on 23 October 1914. Along with her sister ship , she had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . Her displacement was , and her crew consisted of 91 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered using steam generated by two Yarrow boilers driving two triple-expansion steam engines, and the ship carried of fuel oil. Its engines were rated at and she was designed to reach a top speed of . Her main armament was a twin gun turret of L/45 guns forward of the conning tower and a twin turret of L/10 howitzers aft of the conning tower. She also mounted twin L/26 anti-aircraft guns, two L/44 guns, and seven machine guns. The maximum range of her ≈†koda L/45 guns was , and her howitzers could fire their shells a maximum of . Her armour consisted of belt and bulkheads thick, deck armour thick, and her conning tower, gun turrets and cupolas were thick. Temes (II) was completed on 9 July 1915. Career =World War I= Temes (II) was commissioned into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, and was in action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated the city in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes (II) provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle- damaged monitor Enns but after receiving a direct hit in the crew quarters aft, she had to move out of range. She was run ashore to put out fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs. In November 1915, the other monitors were assembled at Rustschuk, Bulgaria. The geopolitical position of Romania was uncertain, with the Central Powers being aware that the Romanians were negotiating to enter the war on the side of the Entente. To protect the Danubian border between Romania and Bulgaria, the flotilla established a sheltered base in the Belene Canal. When the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916, the monitors were again at Rustschuk, having been joined by Temes (II) after her repairs were completed. The monitors were immediately attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors, but struck a lighter loaded with fuel. The 1st Monitor Division, including Temes (II), was tasked with escorting supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene, during which both Turnu MƒÉgurele and Zimnicea were shelled. On 9 May 1917, she was renamed SMS Bosna as the original SMS Temes was due to return to service after a complete rebuild. In April 1918, Bosna‚Äîalong with three other monitors, two patrol boats and a tug‚Äîwere formed into Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of Flottenkapit√§n (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff. Flottenabteilung Wulff was sent through the mouth of the Danube and across the Black Sea to Odessa, where it spent several months supporting the Austro- Hungarian troops enforcing the peace agreement with Russia. It returned to the Danube at the end of August, and was anchored at BrƒÉila on 12 September. On 16 October, Bosna and the rest of the 1st Monitor Division sailed from BrƒÉila to Belene. The Danube Flotilla then protected Austro-Hungarian troops withdrawing towards Budapest, fighting French and irregular Serbian forces as they withdrew, and arrived on 6 November. =Interwar period and World War II= After the Armistice of Villa Giusti signed by the Austro-Hungarians on 3 November 1918, Bosna was operated by the navy of the Hungarian People's Republic between 6 November and 13 December. She was then crewed by sailors of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918‚Äì19. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint- Germain-en-Laye concluded in September 1919, Bosna was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, but was officially handed over to the KSCS Navy and renamed Vardar in 1920. In 1925‚Äì26, Vardar was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval attach√© reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets. On 6 April 1941, the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began, and Vardar was based at Dubovac, as the flagship of the 1st Monitor Division, responsible for the Romanian border on the Danube, under the operational control of the 3rd Infantry Division Dunavska. She was commanded by Poruƒçnik bojnog broda Milivoj Kockar. On that day, Vardar and her fellow monitor Sava fought off several attacks by individual Luftwaffe aircraft on their base. Over the next three days, the two monitors laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border. On 11 April, the two monitors were forced to withdraw from Dubovac towards Belgrade, during which they came under repeated attacks by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. Vardar and her fellow monitor were undamaged, and anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade about 20:00, where they were joined by the monitor . The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant there was insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, charges on the bridge accidentally exploded and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed. After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 officers and men from the Vardar and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac. Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, they started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in two groups. The smaller of the two groups reached its objective, but the larger group only made it as far as Sarajevo by 14 April when they surrendered to German troops approaching the city. The Bay of Kotor was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April.

In it Joe Mantegna, Danny Aiello, and George Hamilton star as three celebrity tenors. Although they perform and have some good times together, they are rivals onstage and in their private lives. They also undergo intense scrutiny from the paparazzi and gossip press over their love lives and careers. The film was loosely inspired by the real life Three Tenors, Pl√°cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Jos√© Carreras. Plot The movie opens with a shot of a poster with three men in tuxedos under the name \\"Los Tres Tenores\\". Inside a theater in Mexico, one of the men, the dapper and refined French tenor Armand Dupres sings an operatic aria. Backstage, Spanish tenor Ricardo Palacios' wife tries to shoot him in the groin for cheating on her. Police take her away screaming, as Palacios and superstitious Italian tenor, Fabrizio Bernini, prepare to go onstage. Palacios hands his colleagues large Mexican sombreros and tells them to their disgust they must sing a mariachi number together. The concert turns into a disaster. A series of newspaper headlines follow their performance asking \\"Tenors or Clowns?\\" and explaining that his singing partners are suing Palacios for fraud. Paparazzi photographs follow showing Bernini kissing Palacios' wife and Dupres mourning his own wife's death. The action shifts ten years forward as Dupres is preparing to marry Palacios' daughter. The Frenchman's butler is horrified and tries to sabotage the union. Bernini has also married Palacios' now ex-wife. The Italian tenor does not want to attend Dupres' wedding, but his wife wants to be there for her daughter. She chides him about his insecurity, as he questions her whether Palacios was a better lover. Palacios also plans to attend his daughter's wedding at Dupres' French villa, but he has additional schemes in mind. He hires a call girl to pose as his fianc√©e to convince his former partners and ex-wife how well he is now doing. While learning facts about his life (e.g. he was born on a boat to Mexico), the call girl tries to seduce him but he refuses, saying that sex has gotten him into trouble in the past. Immediately, an irate chef confronts the tenor about sleeping with his daughter, whom he insists now has twins who sing constantly. On the way to Dupres' villa, Bernini feels ill because of his phobia of air conditioning and germs. At the villa, his wife and Dupres are briefly alone together. She threatens to tell her daughter and he threatens to tell her husband that they too were once lovers. Dupres and Bernini speculate over why Palacios is really attending the wedding. Dupres suggests that the Spaniard is more concerned with money than anything else. Once he arrives, Palacios tells his former colleagues that he has discovered \\"the new Three Tenors\\", in a bid to get them to return to performing together instead. Later, while his wife is painting his greying eyebrows dark, Bernini theatrically exclaims that everyone wants to replace him. She chides him for thinking the world revolves around himself. The following day, after Palacios sings a tango, the tenors have an argument. Dupres and Bernini express disgust that Palacios got them to record duets with pop singers, dress as mariachis, and promote Pizza Hut and the World Cup, when what they do is art. Palacios avers that repeating the same compositions over and over for rich people is not art. It is more important to him that 1.5 billion people watched them perform on television. Later that day, Palacios hears a new composition by Dupres' son performed by three singing waiters. Telling the son that he has conducted modern music like his, he convinces them to perform the composition at a party on the eve of Dupres' wedding, claiming to his former partners that these were his three young discoveries. Once they hear them sing, the older tenors begin to sing together too. After the party, Bernini unsuccessfully tries to kill himself, despairing over his thirty-year rivalry with Palacios, while Dupres' fianc√©e realizes she is actually in love with his son. The next day at the wedding Palacios, after bragging about his acting abilities in Otello, pretends to have a heart attack in order to distract the paparazzi while his daughter and Dupres' son run away together. Soon afterwards, Bernini sings \\"Nessun Dorma\\" at a Spanish opera house, while a poster with the title \\"The 3 Tenors the Return\\" is seen. Palacios comes out of his dressing room after a tryst with the call girl, and the three tenors go onstage to sing and dance the \\"Macarena\\".

More concerts, recordings, and a frenzy of publicity followed, including from the paparazzi and gossip books like The Private Lives of the Three Tenors. Variety discussed this background for the movie: \\"Inspiration is the well-documented squabbling and ego trips of the Pavarotti/Domingo/Carreras roadshow.\\" The film's director, however, did not intend the movie to be an actual portrayal of the real-life singers. \\"My film has nothing to do with the lives of the real Three Tenors,\\" G√≥mez Pereira said in an interview. \\"But if the Three Tenors did not exist, I would not have made this film.\\" La Vanguardia explained that the movie was much more broadly about art as a business, in addition to a portrayal of the vanities of opera singers. When asked whether the production encountered any problems from the real Three Tenors, the film's producer, Andr√©s Vicente G√≥mez, told the press that Carreras' lawyer had contacted them at the start of the project. However, upon learning that the movie would not be based on anyone's life, he never called them again. When asked why the character loosely inspired by Carreras was French instead of a Catalan from Spain, the producer joked that the change in nationality was \\"something to spare us from a trial.\\" La Voz de Galicia viewed the project as promising based on its subject matter: \\"If the personal and professional relationships of Domingo, Pavarotti, and Carreras have provided much to talk about, those of this fictional trio additionally promise a continuous laugh.\\" Characters The stars of the movie verified that Off Key was not intended as an accurate biographical portrayal and expanded on their fictional characters to the press. Like the director G√≥mez Pereira, Danny Aiello (Bernini in the film) insisted: \\"The parallelisms with the Three Tenors are inevitable, but our intention is not to interpret Pavarotti, Carreras, or Domingo...Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.\\" Aiello also joked to the press that he did not have time to eat enough pasta to be as big as the real Pavarotti. About Bernini he explained: \\"It's a crazy character, which gives me liberty to do many crazy things. He's unpredictable, Neapolitan, jealous, sophisticated.\\" Aiello added, \\"This is a film that speaks of love, hate, jealousies, friendship\\". He claimed that script was one of the funniest things he had read in fifteen years. George Hamilton, who played Dupres, noted: \\"It's a film about egos, styles, and eccentricities of three great singers, but we do not want to imitate anyone.\\" He also suggested that these sort of jealousies were common among actors too. According to Hamilton, Dupres is impeccable almost to the point of being kitsch and is always pursuing youth. He expressed pride in working with his real son, Ashley Hamilton, who played his son in the movie. He also explained that a special chemistry existed between Aiello, Mantegna, and himself and expressed the hope that the movie would help him to be better known in Europe. In a scene apparently later excised Joe Mantegna sang as Palacios in the movie. He explained to the press that his singing was, however, \\"more in the style of Dean Martin than Pl√°cido Domingo\\". About the movie he added: \\"I think that the real divos and their fans are going to like it, once they understand that it is not a documentary. They will be the ones who understand it best.\\" The actor also praised the film for making him laugh. One of the movie's screenwriters explained that he viewed the character of Palacios as someone who is extroverted and commercial- minded, while Dupres is more interior oriented and Bernini is quirky and superstitious. Music Three major operatic numbers are included in the movie. As the film starts, Dupres sings the \\"Flower Song\\" (\\"La fleur que tu m'avais jet√©e\\") from Bizet's opera, Carmen. In the aria, the character Don Jos√© tries to convince the wild Gypsy Carmen (also the name of Palacios' daughter in the movie) of the depth of his love for her. Jos√© Carreras recorded the complete role under the renowned conductor Herbert von Karajan in 1983, while Pl√°cido Domingo starred in a movie version of the opera in 1984. Later at the wedding party, the tenors sing the \\"Brindisi\\" (\\"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\\") from Verdi's La Traviata with Palacios' young discoveries. In the opera, the \\"Brinidisi\\" is also a toast sung at a party. The real Three Tenors, who always wore tuxedos in their joint concerts like their movie counterparts, performed this duet together as a trio many times. In 1994, they released a single of it that charted in Britain. The single came from their Three Tenors in Concert 1994 live recording from Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles during the World Cup. The concert was watched on television by 1.3 billion people worldwide. The aria that Bernini sings near the end of the film, \\"Nessun Dorma\\" from Puccini's Turandot, became Luciano Pavarotti's best-known song and reached the second spot on the British charts in 1990. He popularized the aria, which soon became a football anthem and regularly recorded by pop stars, in addition to classical singers. In the film, Palacios also briefly mentions the Verdi opera, Otello, Pl√°cido Domingo's signature role for almost three decades. For the movie, Spanish tenors Manuel de Diego and Jos√© Ferrero sang Palacios' and Dupres' numbers, respectively. Slovenian tenor Janez Lotriƒç performed Bernini's singing parts. The mariachi song, \\"Guadalajara\\", that brings the downfall of the tenors in the film, has been a lasting classic of the genre, sung by performers as diverse as Vicente Fernandez and Elvis Presley. Neither the Three Tenors, nor Domingo alone has recorded the song, although the Spanish tenor (who grew up in Mexico) has performed it live in a full mariachi outfit with sombrero. The year prior to the movie's release, Domingo won a Grammy for his recording of mariachi rancheras, 100 A√±os de Mariachi. In 1981, he released an album of tangos, Pl√°cido Domingo Sings Tangos, which included Carlos Gardel's classic, \\"El d√≠a que me quieres\\", which Palacios sings in the film. Domingo, who also conducts, periodically accompanies himself on the piano while singing, as does Palacios with this song. The movie also features an original piece written by Bernardo Bonezzi, which acts as Dupres' son's composition during the party scene. Reception The reviewer for Variety was unimpressed by the movie's screwball comedy script and likened it to a series of underwhelming English-language films made by Spanish moviemakers. He believed that the frenetic pace of the story cost the movie any depth of characterization. \\"Despite thesps' histrionics,\\" the reviewer wrote, \\"characters rarely escape stereotype, whether it be Mantegna's frenzied Spanish gesturing‚Äîthough his accent sounds more Italian‚ÄîHamilton sleepwalking through Dupres, or [the call girl] Violeta's desire to get rich quick.\\" The Spanish Fotogramas reviewer was more positive, comparing the film to elegant cinematic comedies of the 1950s. He praised the photography, gags, and the elegance of the director's staging, although he also noted that the movie was not a very refined comedy of entanglements. The film had a budget of $8.5 million, making it the most expensive Spanish production to that point. Actors' fees accounted for a significant portion of the budget. It had been pre-sold to thirty-two countries prior to its release. Although it received good advertising, its November 2001 opening in Spain was disappointing. It was released the following month in Italy and in 2002 in the United Kingdom and United States.

The film stars Joy Olasunmibo Ogunmakin, Alex Descas, Thibault Vin√ßon, and Lovely Kermonde Fifi and is a continuation of the theme Peck featured in his last documentary, Assistance Mortelle (Fatal Assistance), on international aid to Haiti following the earthquake of 12 January 2010 which opened at New York's Film Society of Lincoln Center in February 2014. The lead producers of the joint Haitian, French and Norwegian production were Peck and Remi Grellety.Raoul Peck‚Äôs Newest Film, ‚ÄúMurder in Pacot,‚Äù Is a Mystery Set in Haiti The story, a traditional stranger-comes-to-town plot line examining how the earthquake upended Haiti's strongly divided class system, is loosely inspired by the 1968 mystery Teorema by Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini. In that screenplay, which Pasolini adapted from his own novel, a mysterious stranger, played by Terence Stamp, intrudes an Italian family and seduces every member of the household before leaving as suddenly and mysterious as he came. The shooting location of Peck's film, a three level villa, lies in the already completely rebuild neighbourhood Pacot in Port-au-Prince. The first ideas for the film came when Peck drove daily through that wealthy area while shooting the documentary Assistance Mortelle seeing that the rich were equally affected by the earthquake. By mid-May 2014 the film was ready for editing and according to director Peck is expected to finish by September to be announced at the Toronto International Film Festival or the Venice Film Festival and released end of 2014.

Shortly after the earthquake they are visited by a team of foreign experts which tell them to repair the house or it will be razed. In order to earn some money for the repair they move to the previous servants' quarters and rent out the only still-intact room to Alex a foreign aid worker of unspecified nationality. The tenant, who came with good intentions to Haiti, meets soon a beautiful and naive 17-year-old Haitian girl, Andr√©mise, from a modest background who lives in the neighbourhood. To the couples surprise he moves in together with this sassy and enterprising young woman, who calls herself Jennifer to attract foreign men.

Lower Corner is a rural village that is strung along New Hampshire Route 109 on either side of its junction with School House Road, about one mile from the main village of Center Sandwich. The village was developed relatively early in Sandwich's history, although its oldest buildings now date to the early 19th century. There are 25 contributing structures, mostly residences. There are two buildings built as stores, including one of brick; all the other buildings are wood frame. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The town of Sandwich was first settled by Daniel Beede in the early 1770s, when he built a log cabin near Lower Corner. The village grew quickly, and was the site of Sandwich's first town meeting in 1772. By 1812 it was a prosperous country village, and was given the town's first post office. It was also the site of the town's first academy and congregational church, neither of which survive. The oldest buildings that survive date to the 1810s, and include a former tavern and a modest Cape style house. The Brick Store was built in 1845, and features ornate Italianate detailing, while the Wentworth Store, built in the 1830s, boasts more modest Greek Revival styling. The Greek Revival is the most common form of architectural expression in the district. Two house have full high-style Greek temple fronts, with two-story columns supporting a full- pedimented gable. One of these, the William Weed house, was probably one of the fanciest houses in town at the time of its construction c. 1850. It was eclipsed, however, by Chestnut Manor, located at the top of the hill. Built by Isaac Adams, a local who made a fortune in Boston, Massachusetts, it stands out because of its prominent location and its three-story tower, which is topped by a pyramidal slate roof and globe finial.

It is a complex, bacterial infection that causes pneumonia in calves which can be fatal. The infection is usually a sum of three codependent factors: stress, an underlying viral infection, and a new bacterial infection. The diagnosis of the disease is complex since there are multiple possible causes. The disease manifests itself most often in calves within four weeks of weaning, when calves are sorted and often sold to different farms; a common nickname for BRD is \\"shipping fever.\\" It is not known whether the stress itself, co-mingling, or travel conditions are at most to blame, and while studies have identified general stressing factors like transport and cold weather conditions, there is still no conclusive evidence on more specific factors (e.g. distance, transport mode, temperature, or temperature volatility). Causes BRD is a \\"multi-factorial syndrome\\" that is dependent on a number of different causes. The pathologic condition commonly arises where the causative organism becomes established by secondary infection, following a primary bacterial or viral infection, which may occur after stress, e.g. from handling or transport. Usually all three of these factors must be present in order to cause BRD. Viral agents are often present in the herd for an extended time, with almost no symptoms, and only cause severe complications with a bacterial infection. The bacterial agents most commonly linked with BRD are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. M. haemolytica serovar A1 is known as a particularly common bacterial cause of the disease. Viral agents include Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and Parainfluenza type-3 virus (PI-3).Bovine Respiratory Disease \\"Shipping Fever\\" in Cattle , Ram Kasimanickam / Washington State University Veterinary Medicine Extension, 2010 Clinical signs and diagnosis BRD often develops within 4 weeks of cattle transport. The biggest sign of the pneumonia that BRD causes is depression, shown as droopy ears, dull eyes, and social isolation. Additionally, most cows will have a fever above . Other symptoms include coughing, decreased appetite, and breathing difficulty. Treatment and control Because of the number of possible viral/bacterial precursors to BRD, there are a number of treatment options circling around the three main aggravators of the disease: Viruses, Bacteria, and Stress. =Vaccination= Vaccinations exist for several biological BRD precursors, but the multitude of possible precursors complicates the process of choosing a vaccine regime.Bovine Respiratory Disease, Clell Bagley and the Utah State University Cooperative Extension. Additionally, vaccines are not completely effective in stopping the disease, but are merely helpful in mitigation.Vaccination to Control Bovine Respiratory Disease (Presentation) , Amelia R. Woolums Many of the problems with vaccine effectiveness rest with improper use, such as failing to time vaccine doses appropriately, or not administering them before shipping. Vaccines are available for a number of viral/bacterial agents, including IBR, PI3, BVD, BRSV, Pasteurella, and Haemophilus somnus. Many of these vaccines can be given simultaneously, because of their similar dosing schedule. For example, IBR, PI3, BVD, and BRSV vaccines are often sold in combination with each other. =Antibiotics= In the absence of vaccination (often because calves are bought unvaccinated), antibiotics can help to stop the bacterial factors of the disease. The Virginia Cooperative Extension recommends Micotil, Nuflor, and Baytril 100 as newer antibiotics that do not need daily dosing, but also notes that Naxcel, Excenel, and Adspec are effective as well.Recognition and Treatment of Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex, John F. Currin and W. Dee Whittier / Virginia Cooperative Extension =Stress management= Stress often serves as the final precursor to BRD. The diseases that make up BRD can persist in a cattle herd for a long period of time before becoming symptomatic, but immune systems weakened by stress can stop controlling the disease. Major sources of stress come from the shipping processManagement Approaches to Reduce Transportation Stress Risk for BRD, Washington State University Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine Extension and from the co- mingling of cattle. Weather may be another possible factor. Cases are more common in the fall (although this is the traditional time to sell cattle), and while the relationship between weather and BRD is poorly understood, it is often suggested to avoid transporting cattle during extreme weather.

It is a multiplayer online simulation of pool and billiards.  Overview  Carom 3D is at least in part an accurate simulation of eight-ball, nine-ball, rotation pool, three-ball, four-ball and original six-ball. The game can be played in two different modes : first-person 3D perspective and fixed overhead view. Until 2005 it was freeware. It progressively became a free-to-play game with bonus items (cues, custom 3D character and profile, participation to daily tournaments) sold from 1 to US$5. The main aspect of Carom 3D is online confrontation with players from all over the world. Winning allows a player to get a better cue needed to perform high strength and full spin shots. Spinning, as in real life pool and billiards, takes an important role in Carom 3D, specially in pocketless games where most shots are not even possible without a deep knowledge of pool physics and spinning. Closure of the server From 2005 to 2010 more than one thousand users were playing at the same time every day on the Neoact servers, but the number of online players then decreased due to the lack of updates and Neoact focusing on other games (Astronest, Texas Hold'em, Fantasy Masters, Pokermania).

Her body was discovered six months later. The murder currently remains unsolved, although a man was taken in for questioning for her death in 2007. Additionally, another pair of men are under suspicion. Case Poupart, a mother of two, was last seen on May 20, 1990 with two men after leaving a party in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin at 4:00 AM. According to one witness, she was apparently being forced into a vehicle. Six months after she went missing, on November 22, 1990, hunters discovered her remains in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. After testifying in court, both men who she was last seen with denied abducting her, claiming that they were going to transport the woman home but instead dropped her off near a school. On November 22, 1990, her purse and identification were discovered underneath harvested trees. Her partial remains were subsequently found; she had apparently been sexually assaulted. Duct tape and plastic were also found, indicating that her killer or killers had attempted to hide the corpse. Later developments In 2007, a man was given several hearings in court after being accused of involvement in Susan Poupart's death, but the charges were later dismissed after witnesses declined to appear, although several others reportedly testified. The two men seen with Poupart after the party are considered persons of interest along with the other man. Interviews about the case continued to be conducted between the three, but the men have given little to assist authorities. In 2014, evidence was tested for DNA after advances with technology but did not unearth any new clues.

Early life Allman was the son of James C. Allman and his wife Sarah n√©e Lane. The family were entrepreneurs in Bandon in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Initially they ran a cotton mill at Overton, near Bandon, but when this declined they established Bandon Distillery in 1826. Business life Allman's distillery produced up to 600,000 gallons of whiskey per year, which was mostly exported. However, trade was badly hit by prohibition in the United States and by the great depression. Production stopped in 1925, and the business closed in 1929. Parliament At the general election in April 1880, Allman unsuccessfully contested the borough of Bandon. He lost by 15 votes (175:200) to the Conservative Percy Broderick Bernard, a nephew of the 3rd Earl of Bandon whose family had held the seat for most of the 19th century. However, Bernard resigned from the House of Commons in June 1880, and at the resulting by-election on 25 June 1880, Allman was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bandon. He had won 217 votes, against the 172 for the Conservative J. W. Payne. The borough was disenfranchised at the 1885 general election.

The distillery closed in 1929 following financial difficulties. However, agents for the company trading under the name Allman, Dowden & Co., may have continued to sell off the existing stock which had built up in bonded warehouses, in both cask and bottled form, until 1939. History In 1826, James C. Allman established a distillery in a converted 18th Century mill, following the failure of the family's cotton manufacturing business. There is no record of any previous distillery operating in Bandon, nor is there any record of Allman having prior experience in distilling himself. A report at the time, showed that production between October 1826 and October 1827 totalled some 63,023 gallons. Thereafter, the distillery grew in capacity over time as profits from the initial years of operating were reinvested in the business, reaching a capacity of 200,000 per annum by 1836, and by the mid-1800s the distillery had become the largest rural distillery in Ireland, with a capacity in excess of 500,000 gallons per annum. By 1846, Richard Allman had succeeded to the business, and by 1881 it was owned by Richard and his brother James C. Allman (junior), in a partnership trading as \\"Allman and Company\\". When Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery in 1887, it had become a significant enterprise, with a payroll of about 200. Boasting its own private railway line, and with the largest malting floors in the United Kingdom aside from those at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, which were marginally larger, Allmans' and was said to be \\"the most dominant landmark in rural Co. Cork\\". According to Barnard, Allman's whiskey was of \\"superior quality\\", and although it enjoyed a large trade in Ireland, was chiefly exported to \\"England, Scotland and the Colonies\\". At the time, the firm produced both traditional Irish single pot still whiskey and pure malt whiskey. The Bandon Distillery, circa 1885. In 1878, a fire broke out in the mill room of the distillery, destroying the mill, malthouse and 400 barrels of grain. The nearby bonded warehouses were saved by cutting down a timber bridge which connected them to the burning building. The damage, estimated to have amounted to ¬£6,000, was covered by insurance. The fire cost the life of one employee, a local man named Richard White, not connected with the establishment, who fell from a height of 12 ft while trying to extinguish the flames. In the late 19th and early 20th century, while many Scottish distillers were introducing Coffey stills, which were cheaper to run than the traditional pot stills, a debate raged amongst Irish distillers as whether to follow suit. Many Irish distillers, whether rightly or wrongly, considered coffey stills to produce an inferior spirit. Mirroring this debate, in 1904, another James C. Allman, the 82-year-old company senior manager banned its introduction at the Bandon Distillery, bringing him into conflict with company director JJ McDaniel, his nephew. In 1910, James C. Allman went to the high court to request that the company be wound down. However, he died before the company could be closed, with the shares passing to his three nephews, and JJ McDaniel becoming the controlling shareholder. However, the high costs of court action, coupled with the financial difficulties that many Irish distillers faced in the 1920s as Prohibition and the Anglo-Irish trade wars greatly reduced potential export markets meant that the planned Coffey still was never actually introduced, and the distillery was forced to cease production in 1925 just short of its centenary. This greatly impacted the local economy, as the distillery was both a large employer in the rural community, and a larger consumer of agricultural produce. Although some distillery buildings were operated as a mill through the 1930s, many were demolished, and the railway line uplifted following World War II. In 2016, an extremely rare, unopened bottle of Allman's whiskey dating from 1916 sold for ‚Ç¨6,600. According to the label, the whiskey was distilled in Bandon, but bottled at the Nuns' Island Distillery, County Galway. This bottle would be doubly rare, as the Nun's Island Distillery itself is believed to have closed circa World War I. As of 2016, another unopened bottle dating from before 1900 is listed for sale by a Dublin Whiskey shop. A son of the founder, and partner in the business, Richard Allman sat as a Member of the British Parliament from 1880 to 1885.

He is Crime Lab Director for the Central City Police Department, who takes Barry Allen into his lab on Captain Frye's orders. Singh appears as a recurring cast member on The CW television series The Flash played by Patrick Sabongui. This version is initially the Captain and later Chief of Police of the Central City Police Department. Fictional character biography David Singh is the director of the crime lab at the Central City Police Department. When he took over, the lab began to emphasize quantity of cases solved over quality, which resulted in the alienation of some longtime scientists, such as Patty Spivot. Barry Allen is back working for the C.C.P.D. and Captain Fyre has put him under Singh's charge. On his first day back Singh give him the case of the murdered Mirror Monarch. Then later Singh catches Barry looking through the Jason Hicks files, a case that had been closed and already went to trial. Barry explains that Jason's mother came to him for help and accuses Singh of pretending to give a damn about his job.Flash (vol. 3) #12 (July 2011) Singh is about to argue back but James Forrest calls him to his computer. Singh had Forrest check the Mirror Monarch's body for clues and Forrest found blood that did not belong to the victim on his glove. The blood matches Barry Allen, but instead of accusing Barry, Singh yells at him for contaminating the crime scene. He then belittles Barry saying, if he wants to accuse people of being sloppy he should make sure his cases are clean first.Flash Secret Files and Origins 2010 (May 2010) Later Singh notices the Hicks files are missing and so is Barry. Unknown to Singh, Barry gave the file to Iris West-Allen and she did some research and learned that the real murderer was Rory Tork. Once Jason Hicks was freed, Singh re-examined his job and realized he may have closed cases in haste. That is why his first order back in the office is to reopen all closed cases from the past six months. =Road to Flashpoint= David Singh has ordered reopening of every case closed by his department over the last six months, and has ordered his team to work overtime, including Saturdays. He then puts Barry Allen on the possible death case of the Elongated Kid. Later when Patty Spivot returns to the Crime Lab to do Barry a favor, Singh gives her a hard time, but he is happy that she is there to help. David Singh is the Crime Lab Director for the Central City Police Department. He reports directly to Captain Frye, and is not pleased with having to take Barry Allen into his lab on the captain's orders.Flash (vol. 3) #1 (June 2010) =Flashpoint= In this alternate reality, Singh is still head of the Central City Police Crime Lab, and he is one of the few people in Central City who believe Citizen Cold is really a murderer and not a hero; all he needs is some cold hard evidence. =The New 52= After the DC event Flashpoint, the entire DC Universe was altered into a five-year timeline. Singh is shown to be the same person he was prior to the New 52 except for several significant details. Upon Barry Allen's apparent death, Singh was put into a far more sympathetic light when he comforted Patty Spivot at his apartment. Singh is also secretly homosexual, being in a relationship with the ex-vigilante Pied Piper, who is a celebrated musician in Central City. Singh is shown to be a very good leader when Central City went under a black-out, dispersing his team out into the city to keep order and just as well getting his hands dirty in keeping the peace. Upon the Rogues battle with The Flash, Piper was injured and Singh was shown by his side during the fight.Flash (vol. 4) #1 (November 2011) In other media Patrick Sabongui plays David Singh on The CW's The Flash.

Education  After completing her undergraduate degree in Pharmacy at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, Nancy Papalopulu moved to London in 1986 to do a PhD at the National Institute for Medical Research, where she became one of Robb Krumlauf's first graduate students. There she studied the role of Hox genes in patterning the nervous system. She completed her PhD in 1990.  Career  In 1991, she moved to La Jolla, California to do postdoctoral work under the supervision of Chris Kintner at the Salk Institute. There she continued to investigate factors controlling neuronal patterning in the vertebrate embryo using Xenopus as a model system. It was at this point she began to become interested in how the timing of neuronal differentiation is controlled. In 1997, Nancy was awarded a Wellcome Trust Career Developmental Award and moved back to the UK to set up her own lab at the Gurdon Institute at the University of Cambridge to pursue this question. In Cambridge, Nancy shared lab space with Sir John Gurdon, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012 for his seminal work on Xenopus embryos that has underpinned our understanding of nuclear reprogramming. Her own work, and that of her lab members, focused on understanding how the cell cycle, cell polarity and location controls the balance of neuronal progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation in the developing vertebrate nervous system. In 2006 she moved her lab to the University of Manchester, where she became Research Group Leader of the Developmental Biology group in the Faculty of Life Sciences. In Manchester she has continued to investigate how the timing of neurogenesis is regulated during vertebrate development. Using computational modeling and experimental biology her group has discovered that oscillations of the microRNA miR-9 targets an important regulator of neuronal differentiation, HES1, allowing for precisely timed waves of neurogenesis. From January 2011 - January 2014, Nancy was Tissue Systems Section Head, representing Developmental Biology and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell- Matrix Research, approximately 40 research groups in the Faculty of Life Sciences. She is also an active member of the university's Women in Science group.

E. L. Barstow. 1902. Print. Jackson had 11 siblings: seven brothers and four sisters. His education began at formal school in Marstrand in V√§stra G√∂taland and from there he attended high school and college in Gothenborg, Sweden. During school vacations he worked as a private tutor, and while working for one of his clients, Captain Klase, he was inspired and encouraged to go to sea in 1852. He boarded a ship bound for New York City, but upon arrival there deserted his ship to sign on with another crew. He had signed on under the common Swedish surname Dahlin, but subsequently changed his last name to Jackson. H later took a train to Galesburg, Illinois, and settled down to work at a sawmill for five years. At this point he decided to return to New York and worked as a bartender in a saloon. He later met a group of Swedish immigrants from H√§lsingland, Sweden, who were headed west to Waupaca, Wisconsin. He joined the immigrant Swedes and became a schoolmaster in the area for the fall and winter term of 1858‚Äì1859 until he moved to Minnesota in the summer of 1859, where he met Rev. Peter Carlson, who traveled with him to the settlements of Kandiyohi County. He decided to attend Augustana College and Seminary in Chicago in the fall of 1860 under the direction of Rev. Lars Paul Esbjorn. He was ordained at the Synodical Convention in Galesburg, Illinois, in June, 1861. He subsequently returned to work in Monongalia County (now Kandiyohi County, Minnesota).

During the eighteenth century Age of Enlightenment around sixty independent √âcoles gratuites de dessin were established in France which provided drawing lessons to the general public, including to apprentices whose craft required the ability to draw. The schools were mostly established in provincial France between 1750 and 1792. In 1777 a royal declaration subjected the schools to the authority of the Acad√©mie Royale, but this did not hinder their development. The schools varied in size from single-teacher schools with a few dozen students to those in Bordeaux and Marseille which had more than twelve teachers and several hundred students. The Paris school of Jean-Jacques Bachelier may have had up to 1,500 students. Some of the schools taught painting and sculpture as well as drawing. √âcole Royale Gratuite de Dessin The √âcole Royale Gratuite de Dessin (Royal Free School of Art), also known as the √âcole Gratuite de Dessin or the Petite √âcole, was founded in 1766 by Jean- Jacques Bachelier,Benezit Dictionary of Artists and confirmed in 1767 by letters patent from Louis XV of France.

Several distinct known factors determine an entity/noun/referent's relative specificity, including: * Singular terms (e.g. proper names) * Habituality * Actual/Nonactual moods * Factivity * Negation Specificity does not rely on existence. This is because specificity relies on the uniqueness of an entity, regardless of whether it may or may not actually exist. For example, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a male sister‚Äù refers to no actual entity. However, the ambiguity of its specificity (are you looking for a particular male sister, or any male sister?) is retained.  Ambiguity in Languages with Unmarked Specificity  In English and many other languages, specificity is not typically marked. As a result, sometimes, specificity can be ambiguous. Consider the following example: * Every woman talked to a student. This has two interpretations. Under one reading, every woman talked to the same student (the class president, for example), and here the noun phrase a student is specific. Under the second reading, various students were talked to. In this case, a student is non-specific. \\"In contrast, in some languages, NPs in certain positions are always unambiguous with respect to specificity. The ambiguity is resolved through case marking: NPs with overt case morphology are specific, NPs without case morphology are nonspecific.\\" Some analytic and isolating languages like Samoan also use explicit specificity markings in nouns despite not having grammatical cases.  Relationship Between Specificity and Definiteness  Specificity and definiteness, while closely linked, are distinct semantic features. The two main nominal codings of definiteness are definite and indefinite. The former leads predominantly to a specific noun phrase. The latter can be either specific or non-specific. *I'm looking for the manager, Ms Lee. [definite, specific] *I'm looking for the manager, whoever that may be. [definite, non- specific] *There's a certain word that I can never remember. [indefinite, specific] *Think of a word, any word. [indefinite, non-specific] Note that to make the second example definite and non-specific requires a clarifying extra clause.

She has been a member of the National People's Assembly for several terms for the Resistance of Guinea-Bissau-Bafat√° Movement, as well as a presidential advisor. In 1999 she served for a brief time as mayor of the capital city Bissau. She was jailed for political reasons for three years during the 1970s and in 2003 again for several days. Recently she was ambassador to Gambia. Early life Zinha Vaz was born on 4 October 1952 in the capital city of Bissau and received her education in Portugal. She received a diploma in education from the Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias Educativas and in sociology from the Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias do Trabalho e da Empresa.Karibe Mendy, 393 She worked as a primary school teacher in Portugal and Guinea-Bissau. She later worked for the state gas and petroleum company DICOL as treasurer, chief of personnel and director of administration. Political career During the 1970s Zinha Vaz was critical of the one-party system set up by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) after independence of Guinea-Bissau from Portugal in 1974. During the reign of President Lu√≠s Cabral she was imprisoned between 1977 and 1980. After her release from prison Zinha Vaz continued her political activism. In 1986 the execution of six high political figures, including the first Vice President and Minister of Justice Paulo Correira and former Attorney General Viriato P√£, took place. The six were accused of attempting a coup. Zinha Vaz became a founding figure of the Resistance of Guinea-Bissau-Bafat√° Movement (RGB-MB). =Resistance of Guinea- Bissau-Bafat√° Movement= After the first multiparty elections in 1994, she became member of the National People's Assembly for the RGB-MB. The RGB-MB became the largest opposition party in parliament, conquering 19 out of 100 seats. Zinha Vaz was one of ten women legislators. Two of her family members also conquered seats for the RGB-MB, her brother Fernando Vaz and cousin H√©lder Vaz Lopes. As a member of parliament Zinha Vaz focused on fighting corruption and abuse of power by government officials. She also tried to further the role of women in Guinea-Bissau society. As a member of the Permanent Commission of the National People's Assembly Zinha Vaz tried to mediate between President Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira and Brigadier-General and coup- leader Ansumane Man√© in the Guinea-Bissau Civil War of 1998‚Äì1999. In April 1999 Zinha Vaz was named as mayor of the capital city Bissau. Her appointment as mayor led to tension in the city of Bissau as it was expected the PAIGC secretary general Paulo Medina would be appointed. Soldiers blocked off a street and set up roadblocks. Medina had earlier been mayor of the city. After Zinha Vaz was made mayor he tried to enter the buildings to retrieve documents. When Zinha Vaz tried to enter the city hall she was stopped by 24 soldiers armed with Uzi's. She found the city hall to be in state of chaos, with the airconditioners taken by her predecessor, wages not paid for a year and all out of funds. As the municipality did not have any computers, nor the funds to buy them Zinha Vaz asked with UNICEF if she could get old computers from them. During her time in office she also tried to upgrade the system of garbage collection in the city as to lessen the chance of a cholera outbreak. Zinha Vaz was reelected to the National People's Assembly on 28 November 1999 and gave up her position as mayor.Karibe Mendy, 394 During the same general elections Kumba Ial√° of the Party for Social Renewal won the Presidency. A coalition government under Prime Minister Caetano N'Tchama was set up in 2000 with help from RGB-MB and Zinha Vaz was made presidential advisor for political and diplomatic affairs. However, the coalition government fell one year later as RGB-MB politicians in the National People's Assembly managed to pass a motion of no-confidence. The five RGB-MB members of the cabinet then withdrew, including her cousin H√©lder Vaz Lopes (Minister of Economy and Regional Development) and brother Fernando Vaz (Secretary of State for Transport). On 12 February 2003 Zinha Vaz was arrested and detained in the Segunda Esquadra police station, as she was still a member of the National People's Assembly she had immunity and the arrest was therefore illegal. She had responded to President Kumba Ial√°'s defamation of her father, Jo√£o Vaz. Ial√° had called Vaz a traitor of Bissau-Guinean nationalist movement leader, Am√≠lcar Cabral, to the Portuguese PIDE. Zinha Vaz had responded by saying that when Kumba Ial√° was still a member of PAIGC in 1986 he had denounced the victims of the executions that led to the founding of the RGB-MB. Zinha Vaz was released from jail two days after her arrest, a travel ban was in place for her until July. For Ial√° the incident had no further consequences as he wished to appoint Zinha Vaz Minister of Foreign Affairs on 31 June 2003. She however refused. =Guinean Patriotic Union= In 2003 the RGB-MB fell apart and Zinha Vaz left the party together with her family members. Together they founded the Plataforma Unida, which disbanded five years later. After the 2004 National People's Assembly election she founded the Guinean Patriotic Union which did not participate in the Presidential elections of 2005, but supported PAIGC-candidate Malam Bacai Sanh√°. He however lost to former President Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira who had been deposed in the Civil War of 1999‚Äì2000. The Guinean Patriotic Union was the first party in Guinea-Bissau founded by a woman. The Guinean Patriotic Union competed in the 2008 parliamentary elections but did not manage to capture any seats, winning 0,61% of the total vote. Zinha Vaz was the party candidate for the Presidential elections of 2009, finishing ninth of eleven. Zinha Vaz was later made ambassador to Gambia, she served in that capacity until 6 November 2012. Women's rights Between 1992 and 2002 Zinha Vaz was the founder and president of the Women's Association of Economic Activity of Guinea-Bissau, as well as the Popular Creditbank Bambaram. The Bank provided funds for women working in the informal section of the economy. Between 1994 and 1999 Zinha Vaz was also president of the ad hoc Commission of Women and Child of the National People's Assembly.
