He is best remembered as the leader of the La Grange expedition, which searched for and recovered the bodies of three white settlers killed by Indigenous Australians, and subsequently killed a number of Indigenous people in an incident that remains controversial to this day. Early life Maitland Brown was born on 17 July 1843 at Grassdale near York, Western Australia. The son of Thomas Brown, he was educated by tutors, and in 1858 was apprenticed to his brother Kenneth at Glengarry. He was supposed to learn sheep farming, but was more interested in horse breeding. Exploration Brown was a volunteer member of the Francis Thomas Gregory's exploring expedition of 1861, which sailed to Nickol Bay, then explored first southward across the Hamersley Ranges to the Tropic of Capricorn, and later northward as far as the Oakover River. During the latter exploration the party suffered extreme danger from lack of water, and at one point Brown saved Gregory's life by riding back to the party's base camp and returning with a supply of water. The five-month expedition opened up large tracts of good pastoral land, but little with the potential to support agriculture. In 1865, Maitland Brown was again part of an expedition to the north. The year before, three explorers, Frederick Panter, James Harding and William Goldwyer, had set out from Roebuck Bay to explore the area around La Grange Bay. The Panter-Harding-Goldwyer expedition had failed to return, and it was rumoured that they had been attacked. When the Government learned of the missing men, it organised a search expedition. Maitland Brown offered his services and was appointed leader of the expedition. The La Grange expedition left Fremantle in February 1865, and on 3 April it found the missing men dead. They had been speared and clubbed to death, at least two of them in their sleep. Shortly after the discovery of the dead men, the expedition party engaged in a pitched battle with a group of Karrijarri men. Between six and twenty people were killed, with no injuries or deaths to the expedition party. Brown's journal states that the party had walked into an ambush, but most historians have interpreted the event as a punitive attack by Brown's party. Magisterial career Brown was appointed a Justice of the Peace later that year, and in 1866 was made Resident Magistrate at Greenough. During his time in the position, he became involved in a protracted dispute with the Governor, John Hampton, and the Colonial Secretary Frederick Barlee. Brown declined to obey an instruction to reverse a minor legal decision he had made, essentially on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a magistrate to reverse a decision on the instruction of the Government: \\"I have yet to learn that a magistrate has any right to pursue a course which in his view is in opposition to Law upon the mere instructions of the Governor\\"1. Hampton was angered by Brown's repeated refusal to obey him, and by the \\"tone and tenor\\" of his letters, which he thought insolent. Brown eventually resigned over the issue, but in the meantime, Hampton's appointment had ended. Acting governor John Bruce, who agreed with Brown's legal position, smoothed the matter over, and Brown withdrew his resignation. Brown was Resident Magistrate at Greenough until 1869, when he was appointed Government Resident and Resident Magistrate at Geraldton following the death of Alfred Durlacher. The following year a number of magisterial positions were reshuffled, and Brown was appointed Resident Magistrate at Bunbury. He was reluctant to take up the position, however, and took a long leave of absence. He still had not taken up the position in October 1870 when he was appointed to a nominee position on the Western Australian Legislative Council. In politics The role of nominee members of the Council was somewhat ambiguous at the time, there being some dispute over whether nominee members were obliged to vote with the government. Maitland Brown vigorously defended his right to vote according to his conscience, and did indeed vote against the government on a number of occasions. After Governor Weld dissolved the Council in 1871, new elections were held in 1872, and Brown was not nominated to the new council. Although Weld denied that he expected his nominee members to support the government, the decision not to re-nominate Brown was widely seen as a sign that the government expected its nominee members to \\"toe the line\\". In September 1874, Brown was elected unopposed to the Legislative Council's Geraldton seat, on a policy platform of opposition to responsible government. He had also nominated for the North District seat, but on his election in October 1874 chose to sit for Geraldton. On 16 February 1875, Brown married Amy Frances Howard, with whom he would have three sons and four daughters. In January 1876, Maitland Brown's brother Kenneth murdered his wife in a drunken argument. Maitland was prominent in the family's unsuccessful attempt to mount a defence of diminished responsibility, sparing neither his personal privacy nor his standing in the community in the failed attempt to save his brother from execution. Perceiving that his standing in the community had been damaged by the trial, Brown resigned his seat in the Council in March. He was persuaded to renominate, however, and was re-elected unopposed on 22 July. Brown's views changed markedly during his later years in the Legislative Council. Whereas he had earlier argued against the necessity of an \\"opposition\\", he later became himself firmly opposed to the government. He became an outspoken critic of nearly every government measure, and was especially critical of Governor Robinson. For a time he was widely recognised as the Leader of the Opposition, although on at least one occasion he repudiated the title. Brown's views on responsible government also changed. He had been one of the colony's staunchest opponents of responsible government, but by 1883 he had declared himself a supporter of the proposed change. Having been elected on a policy platform of opposition to responsible government, Brown considered it inappropriate to retain his seat after changing his opinion, so in April 1883 he resigned the seat of Geraldton for the second time. A few weeks later he was elected to the new seat of Gascoyne, which he would hold until his resignation in April 1886. Later life The Explorers' Monument On 7 April 1886, Brown resigned his seat in the Legislative Council for the last time. He then accepted a re-appointment to the position of Resident Magistrate at Geraldton. He remained in the position until his retirement from public life in 1904, nominally on grounds of ill health, but possibly due to his wife's alcoholism. Brown's wife died in early 1905, and shortly afterwards, on 8 May, Brown himself died in Perth. He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery, but in 1911 his remains were re-interred with the remains of Panter, Harding and Goldwyer in East Perth Cemeteries. In 1912, a monument to Brown was erected on the Fremantle Esplanade. Notes # Quoted in Cowan (1988).

Marriott played between 1919 and 1938 and was considered one of the best leg-break and googly bowlers of the time. He went on to teach, having served during World War I in the British Army. Marriott played in one Test match for the England cricket team in 1933 at the age of 37, taking 11 wickets. Early life Marriott was born at Heaton Moor near Stockport in Lancashire; his birth was registered as \\"Charlie Stowell Marriott\\".Charles Marriott, CricInfo. Retrieved 11 December 2018. His father, Joshua Marriott, was a solicitor. He was educated in Ireland, first at Monkston Park School in Dublin from 1904 to 1909 and then at The Royal School, Armagh between 1909 and 1912 before attending St Columba's College, Dublin from 1912 to 1913. He played cricket in the school XI at both Royal School and St Columba's and was a member of the St Columba's Officer Training Corps (OTC).Lewis P (2014) For Kent and Country, pp.247–253. Brighton: Reveille Press. . After leaving school Marriott enrolled at Dublin University where he was also a member of the OTC. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Military service Marriott enrolled in the Lancashire Fusiliers in September 1915 and was commissioned as a temporary Second Lieutenant in the 21st Reserve Battalion the following month. In March 1916 he was posted to France with the 16th Battalion and he was on the front line at Thiepval when the Battle of the Somme began and saw action during the first two days of the battle. He spent time on the front line at Ovillers and, later in the year, to the north of Arras and was promoted, first to Lieutenant and then to acting Captain, commanding a company. He was injured falling on frozen duckboards during early 1917 and spent some time convalescing in England before returning to the war, seeing action at Savy Wood, Saint-Quentin, Nieuwpoort and around Ypres during the summer. He was gassed near Nieuwpoort in July 1917 and evacuated home, spending time recovering in Dublin. Doctors determined that he was suffering from photophobia and had many of the classic signs of shell shock and that he was unfit for front line service. He spent early 1918 with the 3rd Battalion at Withernsea in Yorkshire and transferred to the Royal Air Force in July, joining the Cadet Wing at Hastings with the rank of Lieutenant for the remainder of the war. He was demobilised in April 1919. Cricket career Having played some cricket during the war, including for a side organised by FS Jackson at Lord's in 1918, Marriott made his first-class cricket debut for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University in May 1919.Father Marriott, CricketArchive.

He played 12 matches for Lancashire from 1919 to 1921. Marriott enrolled at Peterhouse College, Cambridge in 1919. He played for Cambridge University Cricket Club, making 17 first-class appearances for the side in his two years at Cambridge.

After Cambridge, Marriott went on to take up a post as a teacher of modern languages at Dulwich College in 1921. He took responsibility for cricket at the school between 1921 and 1926. The post allowed him to play for Kent County Cricket Club in the school holidays, although he initially declined Lord Harris' invitation to do so. He eventually accepted the opportunity and played for the Kent side between 1924 and 1937, making 101 first-class appearances for the county, taking 429 wickets. In his first season for Kent Marriott topped the county's bowling averages and was awarded his county cap. He took 10 wickets against Hampshire and 11 against Lancashire and had a \\"remarkable impact\\" on the side. He toured South Africa over the English winter of 1924/25 with SB Joel's XI, playing in eight of the 14 first-class matches during the tour and played regularly for Kent during August in each season until 1935, other than in 1930 when he played no first-class cricket. His last match for Kent came in 1937 against Sussex at Maidstone, and his final first-class match was the following year for Free Foresters against Oxford University. =International cricket= Marriott was selected in the squad for the 4th Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 1921, but didn’t make the final eleven. Marriott's only Test match was in the third Test against the touring West Indies at The Oval in 1933. He was aged 37 when he was called in to the England side as a replacement for the injured Hedley Verity. He took 11 wickets during the match, 5/37 in the West Indies first innings, and 6/59 in the second, making him the fourth cricketer to take two five wicket hauls on Test debut.

He bowled with a high bowling action, swinging his arm behind his back before he delivered the ball in a style which Wisden compared to Kent's great spin bowler Colin Blythe. He bowled an \\"immaculate length\\" at slow or medium pace and was \\"highly disciplined\\" in his approach to bowling, having developed his skills through what The Times called \\"endless practice\\". He used \\"cunning flighting\\" and \\"the ability to turn the ball sharply\\" to be an effective bowler \\"even on good pitches\\" and could be \\"unplayable\\" on helpful pitches. He bowled a \\"fierce\\" top-spinner and although he was able to bowl an effective googly, he used it relatively rarely, having injured himself at school whilst bowling the delivery.Haigh G (2002) Mystery Spinner: The life ad Death of an Extraordinary Cricketer.

Sakuya-hime is the wife of the god Ninigi. She met him on the seashore and they fell in love; Ninigi asked Oho-Yama, the father of Sakuya-hime for her hand in marriage. Oho-Yama proposed his older daughter, Iwa-Naga-hime, instead, but Ninigi had his heart set on Sakuya-hime. Oho-Yama reluctantly agreed and Ninigi and Ko-no-hana married. Because Ninigi refused Iwa-Naga, the rock-princess, human lives are said to be short and fleeting, like the sakura blossoms, instead of enduring and long lasting, like stones. Sakuya-hime became pregnant in just one night, causing suspicion in Ninigi. He wondered if this was the child of another kami. Sakuya-hime was enraged at Ninigi's accusation and entered a doorless hut, which she then set fire to, declaring that the child would not be hurt if it were truly the offspring of Ninigi.

It is a sub-set of water cycle management. Water is essential for our survival. The field of water resources management will have to continue to adapt to the current and future issues facing the allocation of water. With the growing uncertainties of global climate change and the long-term impacts of management actions, the decision-making will be even more difficult. It is likely that ongoing climate change will lead to situations that have not been encountered. As a result, alternative management strategies are sought for in order to avoid setbacks in the allocation of water resources. Ideally, water resource management planning has regard to all the competing demands for water and seeks to allocate water on an equitable basis to satisfy all uses and demands. As with other [resource management], this is rarely possible in practice. One of the biggest concerns for our water-based resources in the future is the sustainability of the current and future water resource allocation.Walmsly, N., & Pearce, G. (2010). Towards Sustainable Water Resources Management: Bringing the Strategic Approach up-to-date. Irrigation & Drainage Systems, 24(3/4), 191–203.

Of the water resources on Earth only three percent of it is fresh and two-thirds of the freshwater is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Of the remaining one percent, a fifth is in remote, inaccessible areas and much seasonal rainfall in monsoonal deluges and floods cannot easily be used. As time advances, water is becoming scarcer and having access to clean, safe, drinking water is limited among countries. At present only about 0.08 percent of all the world's fresh waterFry, Carolyn The Impact of Climate Change: The World's Greatest Challenge in the Twenty-first Century 2008, New Holland Publishers Ltd is exploited by mankind in ever increasing demand for sanitation, drinking, manufacturing, leisure and agriculture. Due to the small percentage of water remaining, optimizing the fresh water we have left from natural resources has been a continuous difficulty in several locations worldwide. Much effort in water resource management is directed at optimizing the use of water and in minimizing the environmental impact of water use on the natural environment. The observation of water as an integral part of the ecosystem is based on integrated water resource management, where the quantity and quality of the ecosystem help to determine the nature of the natural resources. As a limited resource, water supply poses a challenge. This fact is assumed by the project DESAFIO (the acronym for Democratisation of Water and Sanitation Governance by Means of Socio-Technical Innovations), which has been developed along 30 months and funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration. This project faced a difficult task for developing areas: eliminating structural social inequity in the access to indispensable water and public health services. The DESAFIO engineers worked on a water treatment system run with solar power and filters which provides safe water to a very poor community in the state of Minas Gerais. Successful management of any resources requires accurate knowledge of the resource available, the uses to which it may be put, the competing demands for the resource, measures to and processes to evaluate the significance and worth of competing demands and mechanisms to translate policy decisions into actions on the ground. For water as a resource, this is particularly difficult since sources of water can cross many national boundaries and the uses of water include many that are difficult to assign financial value to and may also be difficult to manage in conventional terms. Examples include rare species or ecosystems or the very long term value of ancient groundwater reserves. Agriculture Agriculture is the largest user of the world's freshwater resources, consuming 70 percent.Grafton, Q. R., & Hussey, K. (2011). Water Resources . New York: Cambridge University Press. As the world population rises it consumes more food (currently exceeding 6%, it is expected to reach 9% by 2050), the industries and urban developments expand, and the emerging biofuel crops trade also demands a share of freshwater resources, water scarcity is becoming an important issue. An assessment of water resource management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population or not .Molden, D. (Ed). Water for food, Water for life is A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. Earthscan/IWMI, 2007. It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity, where there is not enough water to meet all their demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. Regarding food production, the World Bank targets agricultural food production and water resource management as an increasingly global issue that is fostering an important and growing debate.The World Bank, 2006 The authors of the book Out of Water: From abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems, which laid down a six-point plan for solving the world's water problems. These are: 1) Improve data related to water; 2) Treasure the environment; 3) Reform water governance; 4) Revitalize agricultural water use; 5) Manage urban and industrial demand; and 6) Empower the poor and women in water resource management. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.Chartres, C. and Varma, S. Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World’s Water Problems FT Press (USA), 2010 Managing water in urban settings As the carrying capacity of the Earth increases greatly due to technological advances, urbanization in modern times occurs because of economic opportunity. This rapid urbanization happens worldwide but mostly in new rising economies and developing countries. Cities in Africa and Asia are growing fastest with 28 out of 39 megacities (a city or urban area with more than 10 million inhabitants) worldwide in these developing nations. The number of megacities will continue to rise reaching approximately 50 in 2025. With developing economies water scarcity is a very common and very prevalent issue. Global freshwater resources dwindle in the eastern hemisphere either than at the poles, and with the majority of urban development millions live with insufficient fresh water. This is caused by polluted freshwater resources, overexploited groundwater resources, insufficient harvesting capacities in the surrounding rural areas, poorly constructed and maintained water supply systems, high amount of informal water use and insufficient technical and water management capacities. In the areas surrounding urban centres, agriculture must compete with industry and municipal users for safe water supplies, while traditional water sources are becoming polluted with urban runoff. As cities offer the best opportunities for selling produce, farmers often have no alternative to using polluted water to irrigate their crops. Depending on how developed a city's wastewater treatment is, there can be significant health hazards related to the use of this water. Wastewater from cities can contain a mixture of pollutants. There is usually wastewater from kitchens and toilets along with rainwater runoff. This means that the water usually contains excessive levels of nutrients and salts, as well as a wide range of pathogens. Heavy metals may also be present, along with traces of antibiotics and endocrine disruptors, such as oestrogens. Developing world countries tend to have the lowest levels of wastewater treatment. Often, the water that farmers use for irrigating crops is contaminated with pathogens from sewage. The pathogens of most concern are bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms, which directly affect farmers’ health and indirectly affect consumers if they eat the contaminated crops. Common illnesses include diarrhoea, which kills 1.1 million people annually and is the second most common cause of infant deaths. Many cholera outbreaks are also related to the reuse of poorly treated wastewater. Actions that reduce or remove contamination, therefore, have the potential to save a large number of lives and improve livelihoods. Scientists have been working to find ways to reduce contamination of food using a method called the 'multiple-barrier approach'. This involves analysing the food production process from growing crops to selling them in markets and eating them, then considering where it might be possible to create a barrier against contamination. Barriers include: introducing safer irrigation practices; promoting on-farm wastewater treatment; taking actions that cause pathogens to die off; and effectively washing crops after harvest in markets and restaurants.Ilic, S., Drechsel, P., Amoah, P. and LeJeune, J. Chapter 12, Applying the Multiple-Barrier Approach for Microbial Risk Reduction in the Post-Harvest Sector of Wastewater- Irrigated Vegetables = Urban Decision Support System (UDSS) = Urban Decision Support System (UDSS) – is a wireless device with a mobile app that uses sensors attached to water appliances in urban residences to collect data about water usage and is an example of data-driven urban water management. The system was developed with a European Commission investment of 2.46 Million Euros to improve the water consumption behaviour of households. Information about every mechanism – dishwashers, showers, washing machines, taps – is wirelessly recorded and sent to the UDSS App on the user's mobile device. The UDSS is then able to analyse and show homeowners which of their appliances are using the most water, and which behaviour or habits of the households are not encouraged in order to reduce the water usage, rather than simply giving a total usage figure for the whole property, which will allow people to manage their consumption more economically. The UDSS is based on university research in the field of Management Science, at Loughborough University School of Business and Economics, particularly Decision Support System in household water benchmarking, led by Dr Lili Yang, (Reader) See also * American Water Resources Association * eWater * Hydrological optimization * Integrated urban water management * Integrated water resources management * List of water supply and sanitation by country * Overdrafting * Peak water * WASH (Water, sanitation and hygiene) * Water cycle management * Water footprint * Water management hierarchy * Water politics * Water resources law * Water Resources Research * Water scarcity  References External links * The World Bank's work and publications on water resources * * Management ","title":"Water resource management"},{"id":"2497646","text":"Even If and Especially When is the second studio album by the Seattle band Screaming Trees released in 1987.

It had a population of 772 people at the 2016 census, down from 797 at the 2006 census. History The Aboriginal name for the Brunswick area is Mue-De-La. The Brunswick River which runs just north of the town was surveyed by John Septimus Roe in 1830, and likely named by Governor Stirling after the Duke of Brunswick. Stirling was in command of HMS Brazen in 1813 when the ship was commissioned to take the Duke of Brunswick to Holland. The Duke was on the ship for five days. The first farm in the area, \\"Alverstoke\\", started in 1842 by Marshall Clifton, was producing wheat, barley and potatoes within a few years. A bridge was built over the Brunswick River at Australind to give settlers in the area easier access to what was then the main community in the Harvey District. In 1893, when the Perth-Bunbury railway was completed, no-one lived in the present-day townsite, but the Brunswick Farmers' Association was formed, with a post office and school operating nearby. In 1898, a junction was opened south of the river when the line to Collie opened, and a railway station was built. The population of the town was 68 (38 males and 30 females) in 1898. The town's centre underwent a significant upgrade in 2011 as part of the Royalties for Regions program, a dairy themed playground, landscaping and an underground power hub were all part of the 380,000 project that was opened by Brendon Grylls. Present day Brunswick Junction is mainly known today for dairying, to which a large Friesian cow (nicknamed Daisy) stands testament in a park in the centre of town. Peters Creameries produces milk products, butter and cheese from nearby dairy farmers. The town also hosts several historic buildings, including the shire hall, Catholic and Anglican churches and railway cottages, and the nearby Beela Valley has a scenic drive which takes in farming country east of the town as well as the Mornington forests.South West Attractions - Brunswick Junction.

Club career Born in Lomé, Togo, Mamam played for local clubs in Lomé before signing for English club Manchester United in 2003. However, work permit regulations meant that it was not possible for Mamam to play in the United Kingdom and he was sent on loan to play at Royal Antwerp until he was eligible for a Belgian passport. At the end of the 2006–07 season, after four seasons of playing on loan for Antwerp, Manchester United decided not to renew his contract. Having become a free agent, Mamam then signed a new one-year permanent deal with Royal Antwerp in time for the start of the 2007–08 season. He went on trial at Motherwell – who declined to sign Mamam in favour of another defender – and Birmingham City, but again failed to secure a deal due to work permit problems. He also went on trial with Toronto FC in the MLS in January 2010, before joining Belgian Third Division A team K.R.C. Mechelen until the end of the 2009–10 season.

Invented by René Descartes and originally used to locate positions on military maps, this skill is now assumed of everyone who wants to locate grid 7A on any map. Using point plotting, one associates an ordered pair of real numbers (x, y) with a point in the plane in a one-to-one manner. As a result, one obtains the 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. To be able to plot points, one needs to first decide on a point in plane which will be called the origin, and a couple of perpendicular lines, called the x and y axes, as well as a preferred direction on each of the lines. Usually one chooses the x axis pointing right and the y axis pointing up, and these will be named the positive directions. Also, one picks a segment in the plane which is declared to be of unit length. Using rotated versions of this segment, one can measure distances along the x and y axes. Having the origin and the axes in place, given a pair (x, y) of real numbers, one considers the point on the x axis at distance x from the origin and along the positive direction if x≥0, and the other direction otherwise. In the same way one picks the point on the y axis corresponding to the number y. The line parallel to the y axis going through the first point and the line parallel to the x axis going through the second point will intersect at precisely one point, which will be called the point with coordinates (x, y).

Probably the power was originally exercisable only when the fact was notorious, i.e. done in presence of the court. But it has long been exercised as to extra curial contempts. The term is also applied to the special powers given by statute or rules to the High Court of Justice and to county courts for dealing with certain classes of causes or matters by methods more simple and expeditious than the ordinary procedure of an action. But the phrase in modern times is applied almost exclusively forms of jurisdiction exercised by justices of the peace out of general or quarter sessions, and without the assistance. Overview Ever since the creation of the office of justice of the peace the tendency of English legislation has been to enable them to deal with minor offences without a jury. Legislation was necessary because, as Blackstone says, except in the case of contempts the common law is a stranger to trial without a jury, and because even when an offence is created by statute the procedure for trying must be by indictment and trial before a jury, unless by the statute creating the offence or some other statute another mode of trial is provided. In one remarkable instance power is given by an act of 1725 (12 Geo. I. c. 29, s. 4) to judges of the superior courts summarily to sentence to transportation (penal servitude) a solicitor practising after conviction of barratry, forgery or perjury (Stephen, Dig. Crim. Law, 6th ed., 113). In other words all the summary jurisdiction of justices of the peace is the creation of statute. The history of the gradual development of the summary jurisdiction of justices of the peace is stated in Stephen's Hist. Crim. Law, vol. i. ch. 4. The result of legislation is that summary jurisdiction has been conferred by statutes and by-laws as to innumerable petty offences of a criminal or quasi-criminal character (most of which in French law would be described as contraventions), ranging through every letter of the alphabet. The most important perhaps are those under the Army, Game, Highway, Licensing, Merchant Shipping, Post Office, Public Health, Revenue and Vagrancy Acts. A court of summary jurisdiction is defined in the Interpretation Act 1889 as \\"any justice or justices of the peace or other magistrate, by whatever name called, to whom jurisdiction is given by, or who is authorized to act under, the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, whether in England, Wales or Ireland, and whether acting under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts or any of them or any other act or by virtue of his commission or under the common law\\" (52 & 53 Vict. c. 63, S. 13 [11]). This definition does not apply to justices of the peace sitting to hold a preliminary inquiry as to indictable offences, or in the discharge of their quasi-administrative functions as licensing authority. The expression \\"Summary Jurisdiction Acts\\" means as to England and Wales the Summary Jurisdiction Acts of 1848 (11 & 12 Vict. c. 42) and 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c. 49) and any act amending these acts or either of them. These acts define the procedure to be followed by justices in those cases in which they are empowered by statute to hear and determine civil or criminal cases without the intervention of a jury or the forms of an action or indictment at law or a suit in equity. Besides these two acts the procedure as to the exercise of summary jurisdiction is also regulated by acts of 1857 (20 & 21 Vict. c. 1, c. 43), 1884 (47 & 48 Vict. c. 43) and 1899 (62 & 63 Vict. c. 22), and by the Summary Jurisdiction Process Act 1881 (44 & 45 Vict. c. 24). The act of 1848 repealed and consolidated the provisions of a large number of earlier acts. The act of 1857 provided a mode of appeal to the High Court by case stated as to questions of law raised in summary proceedings. The act of 1879 amended the procedure in many details with the view of uniformity, and enlarged the powers of justices to deal summarily with certain classes of offences ordinarily punishable on indictment. The act gives power to make rules regulating details of procedure. The rules in force in 1911 were made in 1886, but have since been amended in certain details. The act of 1884 swept away special forms of procedure contained in a large number of statutes, and substituted the procedure of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The act of 1899 added the obtaining of property by false pretences to the list of indictable offences that could sub modo be summarily dealt with. The statutes above mentioned form a kind of code as to procedure and to some extent also as to jurisdiction. Statutory authority As already stated, to enable a justice to deal summarily with an offence, whether created by statute or by-law, some statutory authority must be shown. A very large number of petty offences (contraventions) have been created (e.g. poaching, minor forms of theft, malicious damage and assault), and are annually being created #by legislation, or #by the by-laws of corporations made under statutory authority, or #by departments of state acting under such authority. The two latter classes differ from the first in the necessity of proving by evidence the existence of the by-law or statutory rule, and if need be that it is intra vires. In the case of offences primarily punishable only on summary conviction, the accused, if the maximum punishment is imprisonment for over three months, can choose a jury trial (act of 1879, s. 17). In the case of offences primarily punishable only on indictment, power to convict summarily is given in the following cases: #All indictable offences (except homicide) committed by children over seven and under twelve, if the court thinks it expedient and the parent or guardian does not object (1879, s. 10). #All indictable offences (except homicide) committed by young persons of twelve and under sixteen, if the young person consents after being told of his right to be tried by a jury (1879, S. 11; 1899, s. 2). #The indictable offences specified in sched. 1, col. 2 of the act of 1879 and in the act of 1899, if committed by adults, if they consent to summary trial after being told of their right to be tried by a jury (1879, s. 12). #The indictable offences specified in sched. 1, col. I. of the act of 1879 and the act of 1899, if committed by an adult who pleads guilty after due caution that if he does so, he is summarily convicted (1879, s. 13). Adults cannot be summarily dealt with under 3 or 4 if the offence is punishable by law with penal servitude owing to previous conviction or indictment of the accused (1879, s. 14). With all indictable offences under heads 1 to 4, summary jurisdiction depends on consent of the accused or a person with authority over him after receiving due information as to the right to go to a jury, and the punishments on summary conviction in such cases are not those that could be imposed after conviction or indictment, but were limited as follows: #Imprisonment for not more than one month or fine not exceeding 40s. and (or) whipping of male children (not more than six strokes with a birch) ; sending to an industrial school or reformatory. #Imprisonment with or without hard labour for not more than three months or fine not exceeding £10 and (or) whipping of males (not more than twelve strokes with a birch) ; sending to an industrial school or reformatory. #Imprisonment for not more than three months with or without hard labour or fine not exceeding £20. #Imprisonment with or without hard labour for not over six months. These limitations of punishment have had a potent effect in inducing culprits to avoid the greater risks involved in a jury trial. Where the offence is indictable the accused is brought before the justices either on arrest without warrant or on warrant or summons under the Indictable Offences Act 1848. and the summary jurisdiction procedure does not apply till the necessary option has been taken. Where the offence is indictable only at the election of the accused the summary jurisdiction procedure applies until on being informed of his option the accused elects for jury trial (act of 1879, S. 17). Procedure In the case of an offence punishable on summary conviction the procedure is ordinarily as follows: Information, usually oral, is laid before one or more justices of the peace alleging the commission of the offence. An information must not state more than a single offence, but great latitude is given as to amending at the hearing any defects in the mode of stating an offence. Upon receipt of the information the justice may issue his summons for the attendance of the accused at a time and place named to answer the charge. It is usual to summon to a petty sessional court (i.e. two justices or a stipendiary magistrate, or, in the city of London, an alderman). The summons is usually served by a constable. If the accused does not attend in obedience to the summons, after proof of service the court may either issue a warrant for his arrest or may deal with the charge in his absence. Occasionally a warrant is issued in place of a summons in the first instance, in which case the information must be laid in writing and be verified by oath. The proceedings must be begun, i.e. by laying the information, not later than six months after the commission of the offence, unless by some particular statute another period is named or unless the offence is what is called a continuing offence. In a certain number of summary cases the accused is arrested under statutory authority without application to a justice, e.g. in the case of rogues and vagabonds and certain classes of offences committed in the street in view of a constable or by night. Whether the accused is brought before the court on arrest with or without warrant or attends in obedience to summons, the procedure at the hearing is the same. The hearing is ordinarily before a petty sessional court, i.e. before two or more justices sitting at their regular place of meeting or some place temporarily appointed as the substitute for the regular court- house, or before a stipendiary magistrate, or in the city of London an alderman, sitting at a place where he may by law do alone what in other places may be done by two justices (1879, s. 20; 1889, s. 13). A single justice sitting alone in the ordinary court-house or two or more justices sitting together at an occasional court-house have certain jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, but cannot order a fine of more than 20s. or imprisonment for more than fourteen days (1879, s. 20 [7]). The hearing must be in open court, and parties may appear by counsel or solicitor. If both parties appear, the justices must hear and determine the case. If the defendant does not appear, the court may hear and determine in his absence, or may issue a warrant and adjourn the hearing until his apprehension. Where the defendant is represented by solicitor or counsel but is not himself present it is usual, except in serious cases, to proceed in his absence. If the defendant is present the substance of the information is stated to him and he is asked whether he is guilty or not guilty. If he pleads guilty the court may proceed to conviction. If he does not the court hears the case, and witnesses for the prosecution and defence are examined and cross-examined. If the complainant does not appear, the justices may dismiss the complaint or adjourn the hearing. If necessary rebutting evidence may be called, the prosecutor is not allowed to reply in the case of the defendant. On the completion of the evidence the court proceeds to convict or acquit. Where the case is proved but is trifling the court may, without proceeding to conviction, make an order dismissing the information subject to payment of damages for injury or compensation for loss up to £10 or any higher limit fixed by statute as to the offence, and costs, or discharging the accused conditionally on his giving security for good behaviour and on paying damages and costs (1907, c. 17, s. 1). To this order probationary conditions may be attached (s. 2). Subject to this provision, the punishment depends, as a general rule on the statute or by-law that defines the offence, and consists in imprisonment and (or) fine, except in cases where a minimum fine is stipulated for by a treaty, &c.;, with a foreign state, e.g. in sea fishery conventions. The court may mitigate the fine in the case of a first offence, even in a revenue case, or may reduce the period of imprisonment and impose it without hard labour, or substitute a fine not exceeding 25 for imprisonment. A scale is prescribed for imprisonment on failure to pay money, fines, or costs, adjudged to be paid on a conviction, or in default of a sufficient distress to satisfy the sum adjudged (1879, s. 5). Instead of sending the defendant to prison for not paying fine and costs the court may direct its levy by distress warrant, or may accept payment by instalments. In the case of distress the wearing apparel and bedding of the defendant and his family, and to the value of £5 the tools and implements of his trade, may not be taken (act of 1879, s. 21). If the defendant after going to prison can pay part of the money his imprisonment is reduced proportionally (Prison Act 1898, s. 9). The imprisonment is without hard labour unless hard labour is specially authorized by the act on which the conviction is founded. The maximum term of imprisonment without the option of a fine is in most cases six months, but depends on the particular statute. Imprisonment under order of a court of summary jurisdiction is in the common gaol (5 Hen. IV. c. 10), i.e. in a local prison declared by the home secretary to be the common gaol for the county, &c.;, for which the court acts. The place of imprisonment during remands or in the case of youthful offenders may in certain cases be elsewhere than in a prison. The court has power to order costs to be paid by the prosecutor or the defendant. Where the order is made on a conviction it is enforceable by imprisonment in default of payment or sufficient distress. The extent of the local jurisdiction of justices exercising summary jurisdiction is defined by s. 46 of the act of 1879 with reference to offences committed on the boundaries of two jurisdictions or during journeys or on the sea or rivers or in harbours. Proceedings under the Bastardy Acts are regulated by special legislation, but as to proof of service and the enforcement of orders and appeals are assimilated to convictions under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The same rule applies (except as to appeals) to orders made under the Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act 1895, as amended by the Licensing Act 1902. A warrant of arrest is executed by the constable or person to whom it is directed within the local jurisdiction of the issuing court; or a fresh pursuit within seven miles of its boundaries, without endorsement, in the rest of England and Wales, and in Scotland, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man after endorsement by a competent magistrate of the place where the accused is, and in Ireland by a justice of the peace or an inspector of constabulary. An English summons to a defendant or witness, except in respect of civil debts, is served in Scotland after endorsement by a competent magistrate there (Summary Jurisdiction Process Act 1881, 44 and 45 Vict. c. 24). The attendance of a witness who is in prison is obtained by writ of habeas corpus or by a secretary of state's order under the Prison Act 1898. If a witness does not attend on summons, he can be brought to the court by warrant, and if he will not answer questions lawfully put to him may be sent to prison for seven days or until he sooner consents to answer. Civil Jurisdiction In cases where justices have a summary civil jurisdiction, e.g. as to certain civil debts recoverable summarily, or to make orders to do or to abstain from doing certain acts, e.g. with reference to nuisances and building, the procedure differs in certain details from that in criminal cases. #The summons is issued on a complaint, which need not be in writing nor on oath, and not on an information, and warrants of arrest cannot be issued. #The rules as to the evidence of the defendant and spouse are the same as in civil actions. #The court's decision is by order and not by conviction. #The order if for payment of a civil debt or costs in connexion therewith is enforceable by distress and sale of the defendant's effects or by imprisonment, but only on proof that the defendant has had since the order means of paying and has refused or neglected to pay (1879, s. 35). Proceedings for the enforcement of local rates are not affected by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts except as to the power of submitting to the High Court questions of law arising on a summons to enforce rates (re Allen, 1894, 2 Q.B., 924). The functions of justices as to such rates are sometimes but not quite accurately described as ministerial, for their powers of inquiry though limited are judicial and of a quasi-criminal character. Appeal The orders and convictions of a court of summary jurisdiction are in many cases appealable to quarter sessions. The right to appeal is always dependent on the specific provisions of a statute. The Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879 gives a general power of appeal against an adjudication on conviction (but not on plea of guilty) to imprisonment without the option of a fine, whether as punishment for an offence or for failure to do or abstaining from doing any act, other than compliance with an order to pay money or find security or enter into recognizances or to find sureties (1879, s. 19). The procedure on the appeals is regulated and made uniform by the acts of 1879, ss. 31, 32; and 1884. These provisions are supplementary of the particular provisions of many statutes authorizing an appeal. The decisions of courts of summary jurisdiction on points of law are generally reviewed by a case stated for the opinion of the High Court under the acts of 1857 and 1879, but are occasionally corrected by the common law remedies of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari. The application of the last-named remedy is restricted by many statutes. The court of appeal has jurisdiction to review judgments and orders of the High Court dealing with appeals, &c.;, from the decisions of justices in the exercise of their civil jurisdiction; but not when the subject-matter is a criminal cause or matter. In proceedings between husband and wife for separation orders there is a special form of appeal on facts as well as law to the probate, divorce and admiralty division of the High Court (Summary Jurisdiction [Married Women] Act 1895; Licensing Act 1902, s. 5).

History thumbrightKeyCorp Headquarters in Cleveland KeyBank branch in Springboro, Ohio KeyBank Tower in Dayton, Ohio KeyBank North & South Tower in Buffalo, New York KeyBank Tower at City Creek Center in Salt Lake City, Utah KeyBank footprint KeyBank is the primary subsidiary of KeyCorp, which was formed in 1994 through the merger of Society Corporation of Cleveland (\\"Society Bank\\") and KeyCorp (\\"Old KeyCorp\\") of Albany, New York. The merger briefly made Key the 10th largest US bank. Its roots trace back to Commercial Bank of Albany, New York in 1825 and Cleveland's Society for Savings, founded in 1849. =Society Corporation (Society National Bank)= Society For Savings originated in 1849 as a mutual savings bank, founded by Samuel H. Mather. In 1867, the modest but growing bank built Cleveland's first skyscraper, the 10-story Society for Savings Building on Public Square. Despite erecting the tallest structure between New York and Chicago at the time, the bank remained extremely conservative. That aspect is highlighted by the fact that when it celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, it still only had one office although it had over $200 million in deposits. This conservatism helped the bank sidestep many depressions and financial panics. In 1958, Society converted from a mutual to a public company, which enabled it to grow quickly by acquiring 12 community banks between 1958 and 1978 under the banner Society National Bank. It went through another growth spurt from 1979 to 1989, as it acquired dozens of small banks and completed four mergers worth one billion dollars, most notably Cleveland-based Central National Bank in 1986. In 1987, Society CEO Gordon E. Heffern retired and was succeeded by Robert W. Gillespie, who, although just 42, was a major figure and part of the office of the chairman for more than 5 years. Gillespie was also named chairman.Executive Profile: Robert W. Gillespie Gillespie started as a teller with Society to earn money while he was finishing his graduate studies. Society Corporation acquired Toledo, Ohio-based Trustcorp in 1990 and Cleveland Trust, the major bank of holding company CleveTrust Corporation, in September 1991, a venerable Cleveland bank and Ohio's largest bank during the 1940s through the late 1970s. The Cleveland Trust deal established Society as a large regional bank. The jewel of Cleveland Trust was its robust personal and corporate trust businesses. However, its footing became unsteady due to bad real estate loans, forcing the resignation of Cleveland Trust chairman Jerry V. Jarrett in 1990. Moreover, Gillespie was able to outbid Society's larger rival, National City Corp., which also bid for Cleveland Trust. =Merger of Society and Key (1994)= Although Gillespie had built Society into a regional powerhouse in the Midwest, he wanted to vault the bank into the big leagues. He concluded Key, a bank with similar ambitions, was a suitable partner. Society and Key held talks in 1990 at Gillespie's prompting, but Riley decided to stay the course of smaller, more lucrative acquisitions with obvious synergies. Yet, news reports swirled that a possible merger was in the works in the fall of 1993. Key was the 29th largest U.S. bank with $26 billion in assets, while Society was the 25th largest with $32 billion in assets. Both needed a merger to improve their prospects. For its part, Key needed a succession plan due to the lack of an obvious successor to the 62-year-old Riley. In one week in June 1993, the bench had become barren - Chief Banking Officer James Waterston, hired the year before, quit and publicly stated that he was frustrated with the pace of achieving his goal of running a large bank. The head of KeyBank of Washington, Hans Harjo, was pushed out over an apparent dispute to move its headquarters from Seattle to Tacoma. It also became clear that Key had to undertake a technology infrastructure upgrade to connect its far-flung offices. Meanwhile, Society was in search of higher growth and longed to expand its presence outside of the so-called rust belt states of Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The merger was announced in early October 1993. This time it was Riley who made the first move; he called Gillespie while recuperating at his Albany home after breaking his hip in a horse-riding accident in Wyoming. The two quickly sketched out the deal. The banks were roughly the same size in assets and had very little geographic overlap, so it was touted as an out-of-market merger in which few branches needed to be sold off. It created a $58 billion banking behemoth with a footprint that literally stretched from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon. Furthermore, the deal plugged many of the perceived holes for both partners. The soft-spoken Gillespie was just 49 and Society had cultivated a deep bench of lieutenants. More importantly, Society had the computer systems and technology expertise to combine the two banks, along with Chief Information Officer Allen J. Gula. Riley also lamented the modest Albany International Airport, which lost service from several major airlines in the 1980s and complicated air travel for Key executives. Ohio also had lower state taxes than New York. Lastly, Society had recently built Society Center (now Key Tower), a 947-foot skyscraper that was more commensurate with a major bank headquarters than the modest buildings used in Albany. These issues made Cleveland the preferable location for the merged bank's headquarters. Conversely, Key's brand was more recognizable. The deal was structured as a merger of equals. The merged bank took the KeyCorp name, and operates under the charter of the old KeyCorp. However, Society was the nominal survivor; the merged bank was headquartered in Cleveland, and retains Society's pre-1994 stock price history. The Society name continued to be used in Society's former footprint for an additional two more years before it was retired in June 1996 and the charters were merged. Riley became chairman and CEO of KeyCorp and Gillespie became president and chief operating officer. Despite assurances from both Riley and Gillespie, the city of Albany and then-Governor Mario Cuomo openly fretted that the merger would be bad for the state capital since Key and its subsidiaries owned or leased more than 10% of Albany's commercial office space. By 2014, only about 225 non-branch employees were still based in Albany at the KeyCorp Tower. Riley planned to retire as CEO at the end of 1995. He decided to accelerate it by four months, however, instead stepping down on September 1, 1995. Gillespie took the helm as CEO and later chairman, allowing his protege Henry Meyer to become COO and later president. =Further transformation= While still integrating Society and Key, Gillespie attempted to turn Key into a financial services powerhouse. Between 1995 and 2001, Gillespie initiated nine significant acquisitions and 6 divestitures. In late 1998, Key bought Cleveland-based brokerage firm, McDonald & Co. for $653 million in stock. The McDonald acquisition was the largest non-banking deal in both size and impact on Key. McDonald was sold to the U.S. investment arm of UBS AG in 2007 for roughly $280 million. As a result, Key began processing all subsequent securities transactions under its new broker-dealer name, \\"KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc\\", in April 2007. However, investors became wary of all the Gillespie-era deals. Some believed that Gillespie was making all the moves to cover up poor performance, although in hindsight that appears to be far from truth. The concept was dubbed \\"burning the furniture\\", implying that Key would sell an asset to obfuscate earnings. For instance, Key sold its residential mortgage servicing to Countrywide Financial (now Bank of America Home Loans) in 1995, shareholder services in 1996, various chunks of the bank in 1997-1999 (i.e. Wyoming, Florida, and Long Island), and credit card operations to The Associates in 2000 (which was quickly thereafter acquired by Citigroup). But Gillespie was attempting to increase fee-income by acquiring high-growth businesses, including McDonald and equipment financing firm Leastec, and decreasing the exposure to the bank's shrinking population base in its primary footprint, so-called rust belt states such as Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Gillespie resigned from the CEO position on February 1, 2001, and then as chairman at the annual meeting on May 17 during which he was replaced by Henry Meyer. =2002–present= In October 2008, Key received approximately $2.5 billion in investment from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In March 2011, Key was one of the last major banks to pay back TARP funds. In January 2015, KeyBank participated in the construction debt financing syndicate behind the Balko Wind Project purchased from Apex Clean Energy by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments. On July 29, 2016, KeyCorp acquired First Niagara Bank for $4.1 billion in cash and stock. The deal strengthened Key's position in Upstate New York and New England, as well as entering Pennsylvania for the first time with a presence in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The deal made Key one of the largest banks in Pittsburgh, and gave it branches that were once part of crosstown rival National City Corp., which Key tried to acquire from PNC Financial Services following the National City acquisition by PNC in 2008 before being outbid by First Niagara. As a result, KeyCorp now held much of the core of what had been Marine Midland Bank, old KeyCorp's longtime rival. Five years earlier, First Niagara had acquired most of the upstate New York branch network of HSBC Bank USA, which had changed its name from Marine Midland in 1999; as mentioned above, Key had acquired 37 HSBC branches in 2012. As part of the transaction, 18 First Niagara branches in Erie and Niagara Counties in New York were sold to Northwest Savings Bank for antitrust reasons. KeyBank continues to play an important role in the regional economy of Cleveland, having 6,400 employees. In 2019, KeyBank announced it will be opening its first tellerless branch on May 13, 2019, in Boulder, Colorado. Instead of teller lines, the branch features private offices where clients can interact with bankers trained as \\"financial wellness consultants\\". =Naming rights and Sponsorships= KeyBank owns corporate naming rights to the following: *KeyBank Center in Buffalo, New York. Key acquired the naming rights as part of its purchase of First Niagara. The arena is home to the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League. *The First Niagara purchase also gained Key the rights to KeyBank Pavilion near Pittsburgh. *On April 11, 1995, the city of Seattle sold the naming rights to KeyCorp for $15.1 million, which renamed the Coliseum as KeyArena. In March 2009, the city and KeyCorp signed a new deal for a two-year term that ended December 31, 2010, at an annual fee of $300,000. The company no longer owns the naming rights to KeyArena and the building is now known as the Climate Pledge Arena.

The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than today's, with emphasis on vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well. Modern cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants not seen in the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, continue to be a cottage-garden mainstay—along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens. HistoryOrigins= Vernacular thatched cottages (built in 1812–1816) in Woburn Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, surrounded by garden. Cottage gardens, which emerged in Elizabethan times, appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits. One theory is that they arose out of the Black Death of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens. According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,Anne Scott-James, The Cottage Garden (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured topiary among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century. these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. Helen Leach analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental potager and the herb garden. She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of John Claudius Loudon. Loudon helped to design the estate at Great Tew, Oxfordshire, where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a smallholding or large garden—about an acre—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, Howard Colvin, Yale University Press, 2008 , p 659 Authentic gardens of the yeoman cottager would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty. =Development= The \\"naturalness\\" of informal design began to be noticed and developed by the British leisured class. Alexander Pope was an early proponent of less formal gardens, calling in a 1713 article for gardens with the \\"amiable simplicity of unadorned nature\\". Other writers in the 18th century who encouraged less formal, and more natural, gardens included Joseph Addison and Lord Shaftesbury. The evolution of cottage gardens can be followed in the issues of The Cottage Gardener (1848–61), edited by George William Johnson, where the emphasis is squarely on the \\"florist's flowers\\", carnations and auriculas in fancy varieties that were originally cultivated as a highly competitive blue-collar hobby. Restored Gertrude Jekyll border at Manor House, Upton Grey, Hampshire William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll helped to popularise less formal gardens in their many books and magazine articles. Robinson's The Wild Garden, published in 1870, contained in the first edition an essay on \\"The Garden of British Wild Flowers\\", which was eliminated from later editions. p. 63f. In his The English Flower Garden, illustrated with cottage gardens from Somerset, Kent and Surrey, he remarked, \\"One lesson of these little gardens, that are so pretty, is that one can get good effects from simple materials.\\"Massingham, p. 71. From the 1890s his lifelong friend Jekyll applied cottage garden principles to more structured designs in even quite large country houses. Her Colour in the Flower Garden (1908) is still in print today. Robinson and Jekyll were part of the Arts and Crafts Movement, a broader movement in art, architecture, and crafts during the late 19th century which advocated a return to the informal planting style derived as much from the Romantic tradition as from the actual English cottage garden. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1888 began a movement toward an idealised natural country garden style. The garden designs of Robinson and Jekyll were often associated with Arts and Crafts style houses. Both were influenced by William Morris, one of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts Movement—Robinson quoted Morris's views condemning carpet bedding; Jekyll shared Morris's mystical view of nature and drew on the floral designs in his textiles for her gardening style. When Morris built his Red House in Kent, it influenced new ideas in architecture and gardening—the \\"old- fashioned\\" garden suddenly became a fashion accessory among the British artistic middle class, and the cottage garden esthetic began to emigrate to America. Helen Allingham watercolor showing elite peonies and modern delphiniums in an idealised cottage garden, 1909 In the early 20th century the term \\"cottage garden\\" might be applied even to as large and sophisticated a garden as Hidcote Manor, which Vita Sackville-West described as \\"a cottage garden on the most glorified scale\\"Vita Sackville-West, \\"Hidcote Manor\\", Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society 74 (1949:476-81), as noted by Brent Elliott in \\"Historical Revivalism in the Twentieth Century: A Brief Introduction\\" Garden History 28.1, Reviewing the Twentieth-Century Landscape (Summer 2000:17–31) but where the colour harmonies were carefully contrived and controlled, as in the famous \\"Red Borders\\". Sackville-West had taken similar models for her own \\"cottage garden\\", one of many \\"garden rooms\\" at Sissinghurst Castle—her idea of a cottage garden was a place where \\"the plants grow in a jumble, flowering shrubs mingled with Roses,The \\"old roses\\" Vita Sackville-West was rediscovering were introduced from French growers in the 1830s and 1840s. See Graham Stuart Thomas, The Old Shrub Roses. herbaceous plants with bulbous subjects, climbers scrambling over hedges, seedlings coming up wherever they have chosen to sow themselves\\". The cottage garden ideal was also spread by artists such as water-colourist Helen Allingham (1848–1926). Another influence was Margery Fish (1892–1969), whose garden survives at East Lambrook Manor.ODNB entry for Margery Fish by Catherine Horwood Retrieved 1 December 2012. (Pay-walled) The cottage garden in France is a development of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens. Design While the classic cottage garden is built around a cottage, many cottage-style gardens are created around houses and even estates such as Hidcote Manor, with its more intimate \\"garden rooms\\". The cottage garden design is based more on principles than formulae: it has an informal look, with a seemingly casual mixture of flowers, herbs, and vegetables often packed into a small area. In spite of their appearances, cottage gardens have a design and formality that help give them their grace and charm. Due to space limitations, they are often in small rectangular plots, with practical functioning paths and hedges or fences. The plants, layout, and materials are chosen to give the impression of casualness and a country feel. Modern cottage gardens frequently use local flowers and materials, rather than those of the traditional cottage garden. What they share with the tradition is the unstudied look, the use of every square inch, and a rich variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. The cottage garden is designed to appear artless, rather than contrived or pretentious. Instead of artistic curves, or grand geometry, there is an artfully designed irregularity. Borders can go right up to the house, lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants. The overall appearance can be of \\"a vegetable garden that has been taken over by flowers.\\" The method of planting closely packed plants was supposed to reduce the amount of weeding and watering required. But some features, such as planted stone paths, turf pathways, or clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines, still need well- timed maintenance. =Materials= Paths, arbors, and fences use traditional or antique looking materials. Wooden fences and gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen to give the impression of an old-fashioned country garden. PlantsOverview= Until the late 19th century, cottage gardens mainly grew vegetables for household consumption. Typically half the garden would be used for cultivating potatoes and half for a mix of other vegetables plus some culinary and medicinal herbs. John Claudius Loudon wrote extensively on cottage gardens in his book An Encyclopædia of Gardening (1822) and in Gardener's Magazine from 1826. In 1838 he wrote \\"I seldom observe any thing in a cottage garden but potatoes, cabbages, beans, and French beans; in a few instances onions and parsneps, and very seldom a few peas\\". An 1865 issue of The Farmer's Magazine noted that in \\"Ireland and much of the Highlands of Scotland, potatoes are the only thing grown in the cottage- garden\\". Modern cottage garden plants are typically flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these may not have been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world. =Roses= 'Souvenir de la Malmaison', introduced before 1893, typical of a modern cottage garden. Cottage gardens are always associated with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, in contrast to the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4 ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6 ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade. The Provence rose or Rosa centifolia is the full and fat \\"cabbage rose\\" made famous by Dutch masters in their 17th-century paintings. These very fragrant shrub roses grow 5 ft tall and wide, with a floppy habit that is aided by training on an arch or pillar. The centifolia roses have produced many descendants that are also cottage garden favorites, including varieties of moss rose (roses with attractive 'mossy' growth on their flower stalks and flower buds). Unlike most modern hybrids, the older roses bloom on the previous year's wood, so they aren't pruned back severely each year. Also as they don't bloom continuously, they can share their branches with later- flowering climbers such as Clematis vines, which use the rose branches for support. A rose in the cottage garden is not segregated with other roses, with bare earth or mulch underneath', but is casually blended with other flowers, vines, and groundcover. With the introduction of China roses (derived from Rosa chinensis) late in the 18th century, many hybrids were introduced that had the remontant (repeat-blooming) nature of the China roses, but maintained the informal old rose shape and flower. These included the Bourbon rose and the Noisette rose, which were added to the rose repertoire of the cottage garden, and, more recently, hybrid \\"English\\" roses introduced by David Austin. =Climbing plants= Clematis vitalba Many of the old roses had cultivars that grew very long canes, which could be tied to trellises or against walls. These older varieties are called \\"ramblers\\", rather than \\"climbers\\". Climbing plants in the traditional cottage garden included European honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) and Traveller's Joy (Clematis vitalba). The modern cottage garden includes many Clematis hybrids that have the old appeal, with sparse foliage that allows them to grow through roses and trees, and along fences and arbors. There are also many Clematis species used in the modern cottage garden, including Clematis armandii, Clematis chrysocoma, and Clematis flammula. Popular honeysuckles for cottage gardens include Japanese honeysuckle and Lonicera tragophylla. =Hedging plants= In the traditional cottage garden, hedges served as fences on the perimeter to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others. =Flowers and herbs= Lavender Popular flowers in the traditional cottage garden included florist's flowers which were grown by enthusiasts—such as violets, pinks, and primroses—and those grown with a more practical purpose. For example, the calendula, grown today almost entirely for its bright orange flowers, was primarily valued for eating, for adding color to butter and cheese, for adding smoothness to soups and stews, and for all kinds of healing salves and preparations. Like many old cottage garden annuals and herbs, it freely self-sowed, making it easier to grow and share. Other popular cottage garden annuals included violets, pansies, stocks, and mignonette.Scott-James, The Pleasure Garden, p. 83. Perennials were the largest group of traditional cottage garden flowers—those with a long cottage garden history include hollyhocks, carnations, sweet williams, marguerites, marigolds, lilies, peonies, tulips, crocus, daisies, foxglove, monkshood, lavender, campanulas, Solomon's seal, evening primrose, lily-of-the-valley, primrose, cowslips, and many varieties of roses. Today herbs are typically thought of as culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they were considered to be any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender. =Fruits= Fruit in the traditional cottage garden would have included an apple and a pear, for cider and perry,The raw fruits, considered indigestible, were not much eaten before the twentieth century. gooseberries and raspberries. The modern cottage garden includes many varieties of ornamental fruit and nut trees, such as crabapple and hazel, along with non-traditional trees like dogwood.

They stem from various research fields in transportation, architecture and urban planning. The earliest examples of spatial network analysis using computers include the work of Garrison (1962), Kansky (1963), Levin (1964), Harary (1969), Rittel (1967), Tabor (1970) and others in the 1960s and 70s. Various fields of study have later developed specific spatial analysis software to suit their needs, including TransCAD among transportation researchers, GIS among planners and geographers, Axman among Space Syntax researchers, and various plugins for other software platforms. The list below gives and overview of some of the available software. Many of these were developed in academia and are freely available or freely available for academic research. In historical order: * Axman The (near) original developed by Nick Sheep Dalton of UCL to perform axial line analysis on computers running Mac OS, currently used in more than 50 countries. This spawned many offshoots such as Pesh (for the analysis of convex space networks) and SpaceBox (for the analysis of 'all-line' axial maps). * Spatialist Developed at Georgia Institute of Technology to implement theoretical innovations principally introduced by John Peponis, this software is plugs into the MicroStation CAD package to analyse networks of automatically generated 'e-spaces' and 's-spaces'. * Axwoman 1.0, written by Bin Jiang while at UCL, is a tool to perform axial analysis as a plug-in to ESRI products. * Axwoman 6.2, evolved from Axwoman 1.0 and many years of research by Bin Jiang and his team. Axwoman 6.2 is a free plug-in to ArcMap 10, combined with AxialGen in one single installer. Featured functionality include automatically generating natural streets and axial lines from OpenStreetMap data. The website also contains a set of tutorials for self- learning. * Depthmap Developed by Alasdair Turner of UCL, this software was first developed to generate isovists and perform visibility graph analysis of building systems on computers running Windows, but now includes the automatic generation of axial line networks and analysis of axial line networks and road segment line networks at anything up to the level of the USA or Europe. * OmniVista Developed by Nick Sheep Dalton and Ruth Conroy Dalton to perform a range of isovist measures on Mac OS computers. * Fathom, a commercial implementation of visibility graph analysis written by the Intelligent Space Partnership. * Mindwalk Developed by Lucas Figueiredo, This software performs spatial analysis over standard axial maps and new continuity maps. It is written in Java and runs on several platforms. Also known as xSpace, Mindwalk has been used as a research and teaching tool at several institutions since 2002 and now it is being distributed worldwide for academic and non-commercial purposes. * Isovist Analyst by Sanjay Rana while at UCL, this program creates isovists from building plans as a plug-in to ESRI products. * Ajanachara. Open source software developed by Gerald Franz at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics to perform visibility graph analysis of 3D Studio Max and VRML models. * Webmap Also developed by Nick Sheep Dalton at UCL, this software is free to use (although it requires registration), and allows users to analyse axial maps through a web browser interface. * Confeego Developed by the commercial company Space Syntax Limited, but available free for academic use, this software plugs directly into MapInfo Professional to analyse line axial networks. * AJAX by Mike Batty of UCL, performs both traditional axial network analysis (Batty calls this the primal analysis), and point-based visibility analysis introduced by Bin Jiang (which Batty calls the dual analysis). In a recent paper, Batty shows the elegant mathematical relationship between the two analyses. * OverView plug-in to AutoCad by Christian Derix for Aedas Architects in collaboration with the Center for Evolutionary Computing in Architecture CECA. Allows architects to do quick visual integration mapping via isovist analysis on their projects. Contains also the possibility to analyse non-planar environments to take volumes and hilly sites into account. * AXess 1.0 by Jennifer Brisbane at the City University of New York. A context menu tool for ArcGIS 9.x that calculates connectivity, control, mean depth, global integration, and local integration for all nodes in an axial line layer. Free download available at ESRI ArcScripts. * Webmap-At-Home by Nick Sheep Dalton OU. A Java implementation of the original Axman program with a number of extra features added. This is a platform neutral full application capable of reading DXF files and the original Axman binary format. Free download available at . * AxialGen by Bin Jiang and Xintao Liu at the University of Gävle, Sweden. It is a plugin to ArcGIS 9.2 that generates automatically the axial lines for a complex polygon with holes. * Layout-iQ Developed by Nelson Lee at Rapid Modeling. Used extensively in healthcare, manufacturing, banking, retail, and office space, Layout-iQ is a software that evaluates the frequency of flow in a workspace and measures the total travel distance that resources will travel to navigate through the workspace. The software integrates CAD drawings with a diagram of flow between points. The thickness and color of the flow lines indicate the intensity of flow in each line, so users can visually see high priority point to point relationships. As the user moves locations in the diagram, the software dynamically calculates the impact on travel distance and users can immediately see the impact of the change on operations. The software also allows for the creation of improved aisles and paths using the aisle effectiveness measurement and actual path diagramming. * Urban Network Analysis Toolbox for ArcGIS (free, open-source) Developed by the City Form Lab at SUTD and MIT. The UNA Toolbox can be used to compute five types of graph centrality measures on spatial networks: Reach; Gravity; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. The tools incorporate three important features that make them particularly suited for spatial analysis on urban street networks. First, they can account for both geometry and topology in the input networks, using either metric distance (e.g. Meters) or topological distance (e.g. Turns) as impedance factors in the analysis. Second, unlike previous software tools that operate with two network elements (nodes and edges), the UNA tools include a third network element – buildings – which are used as the spatial units of analysis for all measures. Two neighboring buildings on the same street segments can therefore obtain different accessibility results. And third, the UNA tools optionally allow buildings to be weighted according to their particular characteristics – more voluminous, more populated, or otherwise more important buildings can be specified to have a proportionately stronger effect on the analysis outcomes, yielding more accurate and reliable results to any of the specified measures. The toolbox is built for easy scaling – it is equally suited for small-scale, detailed network analysis of dense urban areas as it is for sparser large-scale regional networks. The toolbox requires ArcGIS 10 software with an ArcGIS Network Analyst Extension. * Urban Network Analysis Plugin for Rhinoceros3D (free for both academic and commercial use) Developed by the City Form Lab at SUTD and MIT. The Rhino UNA Toolbox can be used to compute five types of graph centrality measures on spatial networks: Reach; Gravity; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. The toolbox also include a series of other spatial analysis tools, such as Closest Facility, Alternative Routes finding, pedestrian flow modeling along shortest or redundant paths, facility patronage estimation, spatial distribution of origins weights along routes etc. The tool gives users full control to specify which origins and destinations to use in the analysis and allows the users to weight the analysis with specific attributes of each origin and destination. The UNA Rhino toolbox was developed in order to make spatial network analysis tools available to architects, designers and planners who do not have access to GIS and typically work on designs in Rhino. Having UNA metrics in Rhino, not only allows one to analyze how a specific spatial network performs, but to also incorporate the analysis into a fast and iterative design process, where networks can be designed, evaluated and redesigned in seamless cycles to rapidly improve the outcome.The UNA Rhino toolbox is significantly faster that its GIS counterpart, which has been available as a plugin for ArcGIS since 2012. Users also have an ability to rapidly create and edit networks from any Rhino curve objects, making network design and redesign simple and intuitive. The analytic options available to the user have expanded, giving you more precise control to analyze exactly what you need for every unique spatial network problem.The toolbox requires Rhinoceros version 5 software with the latest updates (SR 10 or later). Help documentation for the UNA Rhino plugin is also available from the City Form Lab website. * SSA Plugin by Burak Beyhan at the Mersin University, Turkey. Space Syntax Analysis (SSA) Plugin is operational on a series of Free and Open Source Software for GIS (FOSS4GIS) including OpenJUMP, gvSIG, OrbisGIS, QGIS, OpenEV, Thuban, MapWindow GIS, SAGA, and also R Project. SSA Plugin calculates the standard space syntax measures including connectivity, total depth, mean depth, global integration, local depth, local integration and control values for each feature involved in a spatial configuration, and intelligibility value for the whole of the configuration. In addition to these parameters, users are also allowed to export adjusted graph created by the plugin to an external file in a Social Network Analysis (SNA) file format for further analysis of the spatial configuration concerned in the respective software environment. * depthmapX Developed by the depthmapX development team, is open source multi-platform spatial network analyses software based on the original Depthmap.

The young right back became known for his attacking flair and soon signed a pre-contract with Manchester United, where he was expected to progress at a quick rate. Rincón stayed in São Paulo and signed a three- year contract in June 2003.

Rincón never joined Manchester United and later left for Internazionale (via Empoli). =Italy= In the summer of 2006, Rincon moved to Italian Serie A side Empoli, like Maxwell, Rincon officially became Internazionale player at the mid of season as Empoli borrow the non-EU registration quota. Rincón remained on loan for the rest of the 2006–07 season. He played two matches for Empoli in the Coppa Italia. In the 2007–08 season, he played in two UEFA Cup matches. In summer 2008, he left for A.C. Ancona on loan, followed the next year by a loan move to Piacenza. On the last day of the 2010 transfer window, Rincon joined Chievo in a co-ownership deal with Inter, but after only 6 months, he was loaned out to Serie B side, Grosseto. =France= On 18 August 2011, he signed a two-year contract with French Ligue 2 outfit Troyes AC.

An acoustic metric will describe the signal-carrying properties characteristic of a given particulate medium in acoustics, or in fluid dynamics. Other descriptive names such as sonic metric are also sometimes used, interchangeably.  A simple fluid example  For simplicity, we will assume that the underlying background geometry is Euclidean, and that this space is filled with an isotropic inviscid fluid at zero temperature (e.g. a superfluid). This fluid is described by a density field ρ and a velocity field \\\\vec{v}. The speed of sound at any given point depends upon the compressibility which in turn depends upon the density at that point. This can be specified by the \\"speed of sound field\\" c. Now, the combination of both isotropy and Galilean covariance tells us that the permissible velocities of the sound waves at a given point x, \\\\vec{u} has to satisfy :(\\\\vec{u}-\\\\vec{v}(x))^2=c(x)^2 This restriction can also arise if we imagine that sound is like \\"light\\" moving through a spacetime described by an effective metric tensor called the acoustic metric. The acoustic metric \\\\mathbf{g}=g_{00}dt \\\\otimes dt+2g_{0i}dx^i \\\\otimes dt+g_{ij} dx^i \\\\otimes dx^j \\"Light\\" moving with a velocity of \\\\vec{u} (NOT the 4-velocity) has to satisfy :g_{00}+2g_{0i}u^i+g_{ij}u^i u^j=0 If :g=\\\\alpha^2\\\\begin{pmatrix}-(c^2-v^2)&-\\\\vec{v}\\\\-\\\\vec{v}&\\\\mathbf{1}\\\\end{pmatrix} where α is some conformal factor which is yet to be determined (see Weyl rescaling), we get the desired velocity restriction. α may be some function of the density, for example. Acoustic horizons An acoustic metric can give rise to \\"acoustic horizons\\" (also known as \\"sonic horizons\\"), analogous to the event horizons in the spacetime metric of general relativity. However, unlike the spacetime metric, in which the invariant speed is the absolute upper limit on the propagation of all causal effects, the invariant speed in an acoustic metric is not the upper limit on propagation speeds. For example, the speed of sound is less than the speed of light. As a result, the horizons in acoustic metrics are not perfectly analogous to those associated with the spacetime metric. It is possible for certain physical effects to propagate back across an acoustic horizon. Such propagation is sometimes considered to be analogous to Hawking radiation, although the latter arises from quantum field effects in curved spacetime. Quantum gravity Since acoustic metrics share some statistical behaviours with the way that we expect a future theory of quantum gravity to behave (such as Hawking radiation), these metrics have sometimes been studied in the hope that they might shed light on the statistical mechanics of actual black holes. Some people have suggested that analog models are more than just an analogy and that the actual gravity that we observe is actually an analog theory. But in order for this to hold, since a generic analog model depends upon BOTH the acoustic metric AND the underlying background geometry, the low energy large wavelength limit of the theory has to decouple from the background geometry.

He is a member of the Heroic Warriors, characterized by his bulky, spring-legged, stumpy appearance and flat-topped metal helmet. Originally tagged by Mattel as the \\"heroic human battering ram\\", his special ability is propel himself forwards with his spring-like legs, to knock opponents or obstacles down with his super-hard helmet. Original line The Ram-Man figure was released as part of the line's second wave, and one of the first figures of the line to break away from the construction design of the standard figures. Instead, the figure has a hollow body, allowing his legs to slide up inside his torso and clip in place. A latch on the back of his boot releases him, causing him to leap up again. The original prototype for the figure gave Ram-Man an orange tunic and red legs. The final release had a red tunic and green legs, but his original prototype colour scheme was still used on back of box listings and in a number of appearances in the franchise's other media. Ram-Man's first appearance is in the early Mattel mini-comic \\"He- Man Meets Ram-Man\\". In this comic Ram-Man is portrayed as a loner who lives on a stretch of barren land. He will attack anyone who crosses his land, believing their intention is to fight him, and although his past is not delved into it is implied he had retreated to this stretch of land after being continuously victimized by others. The story began with He-Man crossing his land, and despite stating his peace, Ram-Man disbelieves him and attacks him. Left with no choice but to fight Ram-Man, He-Man fights back and quickly beats him. Humiliated by this defeat, Ram-Man swears to get revenge on He-Man, and his confusion is taken advantage of by Skeletor, who was spying on the fight. Skeletor tricks Ram-Man into believing He-Man is evil, and leads him to Castle Grayskull, where he forces Ram-Man into ramming the jaw bridge repeatedly to gain entry to the castle, where Ram-Man believes He-Man is. When The Sorceress witnesses Skeletor's attempt to break into Grayskull, she calls He-Man to her aid, who releases Ram-Man from Skeletor's clutches and drives away the villain. Realizing he had been tricked and that He-Man means him no harm, Ram- Man befriends He-Man and joins the Heroic Warriors. As with several early characters, Ram-Man's mini-comic appearances decreased as new characters were showcased. 1980s Filmation cartoon Although large and aggressive in his mini-comic appearance, the 1980s cartoon He-Man and the Masters of the Universe by Filmation depicts him as a small, dwarfish figure, which is actually closer in appearance to his action figure. In order to make the character more child-friendly for the sake of the show's intended audience, Ram-Man's aggressiveness is toned down for the series. He is portrayed generally as a comical character, slow and dim-witted with an almost childlike mentality, but also strong-hearted and easily likeable. He often appears alongside Stratos in early episodes, and later episodes flesh out his character more, particularly the season 2 episode \\"Not So Blind\\", which shows a degree of humanity in his mostly slapstick personality. Another notable moment for Ram-Man is the episode \\"House of Shokoti part 1\\", in which he gives a memorable moral at the end of the episode, telling kids not to hit things with their head like he does in case they hurt themselves. Also in this episode, Ram-Man irritates Shokoti by constantly mispronouncing her name, calling her \\"Shipoopi\\" among other things. This Ram-Man also often has other cartoonish features such as his legs actually uncoiling like springs on occasion and making \\"boing\\" sounds when he used his abilities. Unlike other early characters, such as Stratos and Evil Warriors such as Tri-Klops, who faded into the background as newer characters were introduced in the cartoon, Ram-Man continued to appear regularly in later episodes of the cartoon. 2002 series Ram-Man features in the modern revival of Masters of the Universe, and his portrayal in the contemporary series is something of a mixture between his Filmation portrayal and his original mini-comic portrayal. Here he is once again drawn as a large and bulky rather than a dwarfish character, and is actually larger than even He-Man in size. In episodes were he removes his helmet, he appears to have a metal plate on top of his head with a military flat-top hair cut. Although this series depicts him in a more macho fashion more in-keeping with the original concept of the character, his slow- wittedness and comic appeal is left intact. There is still a childlike dimension to his character, made most evident in the episode \\"Night of the Shadow Beasts\\", which reveals he is afraid of the dark. Perhaps his most significant episode of the modern-day series is \\"Siren's Song\\", in which he falls under a mesmerising spell by Evil-Lyn, which results in him coming under suspicion of being a traitor to the Masters. Unaware of the crime he has committed under a trance state, Ram-Man is shown as excitable and overly- defensive as the Masters try to identify the traitor in their ranks. One big difference from the Filmation series is that, in the 2002 series, Ram-Man doesn't have springy legs that make him bounce, so he just walks and runs like a normal person. Popular culture In 2011, BBC Online reported that performer Jamie Moakes was trying to create \\"a new commodity, one to replace gold, silver and copper\\", by buying as many Ram-Man figures as possible. Reception Ram-Man was voted No.9 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by Io9. Ram-Man was voted No.12 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by Topless Robot.

Two examples of computer processors that featured 26-bit memory addressing are certain second generation IBM System/370 mainframe computer models introduced in 1981 (and several subsequent models), which had 26-bit physical addresses but had only the same 24-bit virtual addresses as earlier models, and the first generations of ARM processors.  History  IBM System/370 = As data processing needs continued to grow, IBM and their customers faced challenges directly addressing larger memory sizes. In what ended up being a short-term \\"emergency\\" solution, a pair of IBM's second wave of System/370 models, the 3033 and 3081, introduced 26-bit real memory addressing, increasing the System/370's amount of physical memory that could be attached by a factor of 4 from the previous 24-bit limit of 16 MB. IBM referred to 26-bit addressing as \\"extended real addressing,\\" and some subsequent models also included 26-bit support. However, only 2 years later, IBM introduced 31-bit memory addressing, expanding both physical and virtual addresses to 31 bits, with its System/370-XA models, and even the popular 3081 was upgradeable to XA standard. Given 26-bit's brief history as the state-of- the-art in memory addressing available in IBM's model range, and given that virtual addresses were still limited to 24 bits, software exploitation of 26-bit mode was limited. The few customers that exploited 26-bit mode eventually adjusted their applications to support 31-bit addressing, and IBM dropped support for 26-bit mode after several years producing models supporting 24-bit, 26-bit, and 31-bit modes. The 26-bit mode is the only addressing mode that IBM removed from its line of mainframe computers descended from the System/360. All the other addressing modes, including now 64-bit mode, are supported in current model mainframes. = Early ARM processors = In the ARM processor architecture, 26-bit refers to the design used in the original ARM processors where the Program Counter (PC) and Processor Status Register (PSR) were combined into one 32-bit register (R15), the status flags filling the high 6 bits and the Program Counter taking up the lower 26 bits. In fact, because the program counter is always word-aligned the lowest two bits are always zero which allowed the designers to reuse these two bits to hold the processor's mode bits too. The four modes allowed were USR26, SVC26, IRQ26, FIQ26; contrast this with the 32 possible modes available when the program status was separated from the program counter in more recent ARM architectures. This design enabled more efficient program execution, as the Program Counter and status flags could be saved and restored with a single operation. This resulted in faster subroutine calls and interrupt response than traditional designs, which would have to do two register loads or saves when calling or returning from a subroutine. Despite having a 32-bit ALU and word-length, processors based on ARM architecture version 1 and 2 had only a 26-bit PC and address bus, and were consequently limited to 64 MiB of addressable memory. This was still a vast amount of memory at the time, but because of this limitation, architectures since have included various steps away from the original 26-bit design. The ARM architecture version 3 introduced a 32-bit PC and separate PSR, as well as a 32-bit address bus, allowing 4 GiB of memory to be addressed. The change in the PC/PSR layout caused incompatibility with code written for previous architectures, so the processor also included a 26-bit compatibility mode which used the old PC/PSR combination. The processor could still address 4 GB in this mode, but could not execute anything above address 0x3FFFFFC (64 MB). This mode was used by RISC OS running on the Acorn Risc PC to utilise the new processors while retaining compatibility with existing software. ARM architecture version 4 made the support of the 26-bit addressing modes optional, and ARM architecture version 5 onwards has removed them entirely.

Complex forms have broad applications in differential geometry. On complex manifolds, they are fundamental and serve as the basis for much of algebraic geometry, Kähler geometry, and Hodge theory. Over non-complex manifolds, they also play a role in the study of almost complex structures, the theory of spinors, and CR structures. Typically, complex forms are considered because of some desirable decomposition that the forms admit. On a complex manifold, for instance, any complex k-form can be decomposed uniquely into a sum of so-called (p,q)-forms: roughly, wedges of p differentials of the holomorphic coordinates with q differentials of their complex conjugates. The ensemble of (p,q)-forms becomes the primitive object of study, and determines a finer geometrical structure on the manifold than the k-forms. Even finer structures exist, for example, in cases where Hodge theory applies. Differential forms on a complex manifold Suppose that M is a complex manifold of complex dimension n. Then there is a local coordinate system consisting of n complex-valued functions z1,...,zn such that the coordinate transitions from one patch to another are holomorphic functions of these variables. The space of complex forms carries a rich structure, depending fundamentally on the fact that these transition functions are holomorphic, rather than just smooth. =One-forms= We begin with the case of one-forms. First decompose the complex coordinates into their real and imaginary parts: zj=xj+iyj for each j. Letting :dz^j=dx^j+idy^j,\\\\quad d\\\\bar{z}^j=dx^j-idy^j, one sees that any differential form with complex coefficients can be written uniquely as a sum :\\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\left(f_jdz^j+g_jd\\\\bar{z}^j\\\\right). Let Ω1,0 be the space of complex differential forms containing only dz's and Ω0,1 be the space of forms containing only d\\\\bar{z}'s. One can show, by the Cauchy–Riemann equations, that the spaces Ω1,0 and Ω0,1 are stable under holomorphic coordinate changes. In other words, if one makes a different choice wi of holomorphic coordinate system, then elements of Ω1,0 transform tensorially, as do elements of Ω0,1. Thus the spaces Ω0,1 and Ω1,0 determine complex vector bundles on the complex manifold. =Higher-degree forms= The wedge product of complex differential forms is defined in the same way as with real forms. Let p and q be a pair of non-negative integers ≤ n. The space Ωp,q of (p,q)-forms is defined by taking linear combinations of the wedge products of p elements from Ω1,0 and q elements from Ω0,1. Symbolically, :\\\\Omega^{p,q}=\\\\underbrace{\\\\Omega^{1,0}\\\\wedge\\\\dotsb\\\\wedge\\\\Omega^{1,0}}_{p \\\\text{ times}}\\\\wedge\\\\underbrace{\\\\Omega^{0,1}\\\\wedge\\\\dotsb\\\\wedge\\\\Omega^{0,1}}_{q \\\\text{ times}} where there are p factors of Ω1,0 and q factors of Ω0,1. Just as with the two spaces of 1-forms, these are stable under holomorphic changes of coordinates, and so determine vector bundles. If Ek is the space of all complex differential forms of total degree k, then each element of Ek can be expressed in a unique way as a linear combination of elements from among the spaces Ωp,q with p+q=k. More succinctly, there is a direct sum decomposition :E^k=\\\\Omega^{k,0}\\\\oplus\\\\Omega^{k-1,1}\\\\oplus\\\\dotsb\\\\oplus\\\\Omega^{1,k-1}\\\\oplus\\\\Omega^{0,k}=\\\\bigoplus_{p+q=k}\\\\Omega^{p,q}. Because this direct sum decomposition is stable under holomorphic coordinate changes, it also determines a vector bundle decomposition. In particular, for each k and each p and q with p+q=k, there is a canonical projection of vector bundles :\\\\pi^{p,q}:E^k\\\\rightarrow\\\\Omega^{p,q}. =The Dolbeault operators= The usual exterior derivative defines a mapping of sections d: \\\\Omega^{r} \\\\to \\\\Omega^{r+1} via : d(\\\\Omega^{p,q}) \\\\subseteq \\\\bigoplus_{r + s = p + q + 1} \\\\Omega^{r,s} The exterior derivative does not in itself reflect the more rigid complex structure of the manifold. Using d and the projections defined in the previous subsection, it is possible to define the Dolbeault operators: :\\\\partial=\\\\pi^{p+1,q}\\\\circ d:\\\\Omega^{p,q}\\\\rightarrow\\\\Omega^{p+1,q},\\\\quad \\\\bar{\\\\partial}=\\\\pi^{p,q+1}\\\\circ d:\\\\Omega^{p,q}\\\\rightarrow\\\\Omega^{p,q+1} To describe these operators in local coordinates, let :\\\\alpha=\\\\sum_{I=p,J=q}\\\\ f_{IJ}\\\\,dz^I\\\\wedge d\\\\bar{z}^J\\\\in\\\\Omega^{p,q} where I and J are multi-indices. Then :\\\\partial\\\\alpha=\\\\sum_{I,J}\\\\sum_\\\\ell \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{IJ}}{\\\\partial z^\\\\ell}\\\\,dz^\\\\ell\\\\wedge dz^I\\\\wedge d\\\\bar{z}^J :\\\\bar{\\\\partial}\\\\alpha=\\\\sum_{I,J}\\\\sum_\\\\ell \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{IJ}}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{z}^\\\\ell}d\\\\bar{z}^\\\\ell\\\\wedge dz^I\\\\wedge d\\\\bar{z}^J. The following properties are seen to hold: :d=\\\\partial+\\\\bar{\\\\partial} :\\\\partial^2=\\\\bar{\\\\partial}^2=\\\\partial\\\\bar{\\\\partial}+\\\\bar{\\\\partial}\\\\partial=0. These operators and their properties form the basis for Dolbeault cohomology and many aspects of Hodge theory. =Holomorphic forms= For each p, a holomorphic p-form is a holomorphic section of the bundle Ωp,0. In local coordinates, then, a holomorphic p-form can be written in the form :\\\\alpha=\\\\sum_{I=p}f_I\\\\,dz^I where the f_I are holomorphic functions. Equivalently, the (p,0)-form α is holomorphic if and only if :\\\\bar{\\\\partial}\\\\alpha=0. The sheaf of holomorphic p-forms is often written Ωp, although this can sometimes lead to confusion so many authors tend to adopt an alternative notation.

Arched caption reads \\"An Claiḋeaṁ Soluis\\" The Sword of Light (, Claidheamh Soluis (; ) is a trope object that appears in a number of Irish and Scottish Gaelic folktales. The \\"Quest for sword of light\\" formula is catalogued as motif H1337. The sword appears commonly as a quest object in the Irish folktale of a hero seeking \\"The One Story\\" (or the \\"Cause of the one story about women\\"), which culminates in the discovery of a \\"Tale of the Werewolf\\" (a man magically turned wolf by an unfaithful wife). However, the sword is uninvolved in the man-wolf portion, and only figures in the hero-adventure frame story. The sword of light, according to a different commentator, is a fixture of an Irish tale group describable as a quasi-bridal-quest. This characterization is inspired by the formula where the hero gains a beautiful wife (and riches) by gambling against a gruagach or wizard, but then suffers loses making him beholden to mount a hopeless-seeming quest. Like the actual \\"giant's daughter\\" bridal quest tales, the sword of light hero often gains the assistance of \\"helpful animals\\" help him complete his tasks or ordeals. The sword has been regarded as a legacy to the god-slaying weapons of Irish mythology by certain scholars, such as T. F. O'Rahilly, the analogues being the primeval Celtic deity's lightning-weapon, Lugh's sling that felled Balor, the hero Cúchulainn's supernatural spear Gae bulga and his shining sword Cruaidín Catutchenn. Forms The spelling as appears in published Irish text and scholastic commentary is Claidheamh Soluis alternatively (an) cloidheamh solais;, EIHM, p. 68; . but these are pre-reform spelling, and in modernized reformed spelling Claíomh Solais would be used. The name has also been transliterated into Hiberno-English as chloive solais. The sword may be rendered in English as the \\"Sword of Light\\", or \\"Shining Sword\\". Likewise, the Scottish Gaelic form is \\"glaive of light\\", or \\"White Glave of Light\\".  Overview  The folk tales featuring the sword of light may be bridal quests, and the hero's would-be bride often becomes the hero's helper. But more typically the story is a sort of quasi-bridal quest, where the hero wins a bride by wager, but then suffers a loss, becoming oath-bound (compelled by geis) to never come home until he has completed the quest for the sword (and other objectives). The opponent who tempts the hero with this gambling game is usually a gruagach (\\"wizard-champion\\" tr., p. 97, \\"wizard-champion\\", and endnote, p. 455 by Alfred Nutt, after P. W. Joyce.) or wizard/druid. and the sword's keeper is often a giant (', ) or hag (cailleach), or a sibling of the wizard. The sword-keeper oftentimes must be defeated (killed), which is not possible except by some secret means. Thus the hero or helper may resort to the sword of light as the only effective weapon against this enemy. But often the sword is not enough, and the supernatural enemy has to be attacked on a single vulnerable spot. The weak spot, moreover, may be an external soul (motif index E710) concealed somewhere in the world at large (inside animals, etc.); or, as in the case of \\"The Young King Of Easaidh Ruadh\\", this external soul is encased within a nested series of animals.\\"Separable soul, or external soul\\", Typically bound up with the quest for the sword of light is the quest for the \\"One Story\\" (' truth about women'), namely, the story of the faithless wife who transforms her husband into a wolf.: \\"the cause of the one story about women\\". The hero is typically compelled to perform (three) sets of tasks, aided by helpers, who may be the would-be bride, \\"helpful animals\\", or a supernatural being (\\"little green/red man\\").

The \\"Quest for sword of light\\" (H1337) motif is also listed in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk- Literature. =Grouping= One strand of the \\"sword of light\\" tale has been transmitted in French Canada as the tale of the \\"Sword of Wisdom\\", and assigned type 305A. However, the Irish cognate had not been catalogued as a tale type by Aarne-Thompson, though recognized in The Types of the Irish Folktale. One Story and Werewolf's Tale The quest for the sword of light is an added layer,: \\"the frame-story is complicated by a quest for the Sword of Light\\". attached to the core tale of the quest for \\"the one story\\", which forms a frame story to the Irish versions of the medieval werewolf tale, according to George Lyman Kittredge's 1903 study. \\"The one story\\" is actually shorthand, and Kittredge generally uses \\"the cause of the one story about women\\", as occurs in O'Foharta's version., and passim. Similar titles or sub- titles occur in Irish as well.The in-story, \\"Fios Fath an aon Sceil\\", The form \\"news of the death of Anshgayliacht\\" in \\"Morraha\\", is deemed to be a corruption. The werewolf tale, recounted by a man who had once been magically transformed into a wolf by an unfaithful wife, is analyzed by Kittredge for its compound structure, but the in-tale generally does not concern the Sword of Light., p. 211, n2, n3. It is pointed out that in the sword of light fails to occur in the Scottish version of the werewolf tale, replaced by the hero obtaining custody of the werewolf himself, by bartering his horse. Quasi- bridal quest Some tales fall into an actual bridal-quest pattern. In \\"The Thirteenth Son of the King of Erin\\", Sean Ruadh (actually the eldest prince) is assisted by the princess who is his would-be bride in slaying the urfeist (sea-serpent). And in the \\"Widow's Son\\", the hero promises marriage to the giant's daughter, who also becomes the hero's helper. However Josef Baudiš gave grouping to tale types which were similar to the bridal-quest type, but were distinguishably different: the hero wins a beautiful wife (and riches) as wager in a game played against a gruagach (wizard-champion) figure, but it is a trap, and when the hero suffers a loss, he is compelled to go on a quest, usually for the sword of light. =Helpful animals= Kittredge has recognized the presence of \\"helpful animals\\" assisting the hero in the tales, catalgoued in the range of Types B300–590, \\"Helpful Animals\\" in Thompson's Motif-Index. Kittedge recognizes the Skilful Companions motif in the werewolf in-story, but that portion does not much concern the sword, as aforestated. In O'Foharta's Irish text (O'F) the helpers are a hawk, otter, and a fox (\\"Hawk of the Grey Wood\\", the \\"Otter of the Endless Tempests\\", and the \\"Fox of the Pleasant Crag\\"). In Campbell's Scottish The Young King of Easaidh Ruadh (c text), the helpers are a dog, hawk, and an otter (\\"slim dog of the greenwood\\", \\"hoary hawk of the grey rock\\", and \\"brown otter of the river\\"). In McInnes's Scottish version (m text) there are not three, but four animals. It might be noted that Irish bridal quest of the \\"giant's daughter\\" type is recognized as an equivalent to folktale to the Six Go through the Whole World type (ATU 513A), and this type features \\"magical helpers\\" or \\"extraordinary helpers\\". =The secret about women= In the Irish folktale, the hero goes on quest for ' The Only Story' () which is thought to mean ' truth about women '. That meaning is illuminated in versions that provide a more fuller title, e. g., \\"The Shining Sword and the Knowledge of the Cause of the One Story about Women\\", This has been corrupted to \\"news of the death of Anshgayliacht\\" in the L (Larminie) version. is also a corruption of this. Kittredge considered the \\"secret about women\\" element to be an essential and original part of the Irish story, as seen in the stemma of texts given by him, even though the \\"woman\\" part of it has been lost in some variants, such as Kennedy's Fios Fath an aon Sceil (\\"perfect narrative of the unique story\\")Summary of I in: A more familiar Arthurian tale perhaps than Arthur and Gorlagon which embeds the quest of \\"What is it that women most desire?\\" is The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle. =External soul motif= The external soul motif in Sword of Light stories have been noted for example by Gerard Murphy. The tale \\"The Young King Of Easaidh Ruadh\\" was also given as a typical example of \\"External soul\\" motif (E 710) by folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs. It has been pointed out that the Easaidh Ruadh refers to a place name in Ireland, probably the Assaroe Falls in Ballyshannon, County Donegal. A similar Irish tale involving the \\"external soul\\" is the Donegal tale \\"Hung up Naked Man\\" (; Irish title: \\"Éamonn Ua Ciórrthais(?)\\" ed. E. C. Quiggin), studied by Roger Sherman Loomis.The Irish text is Edmund Crosby Quiggin, Dialect of Donegal (1906), 201 wikisource While Loomis does not explicitly state a connection to the sword of light, he remarks that there is parallel to the Irish giant Cú roí whom he describes a \\"solar host\\" or \\"solar divinity\\", and notes that Cú roí was \\"slain with his own sword\\", (as according to the narrative Aided Chon Roí in which Cú roí's wife Blaíthíne reveals the weakness). =Three attempts= In the specimen collected by Kennedy, the hero is assisted by the king who is his own father- in-law, who happens to be the brother of the sword owner, and the hero's antagonist, the Druid demanding the sword. The Sculloge's rides forth to the dwelling of the sword owner three times, his horse being hacked by the sword in the first two tries, but succeeding on the third. The three time's the charm element that occurs here is also present in the Morraha tale collected by Larminie. = As a mythological sword = The assertion has been made that Claidheamh Soluis is \\"a symbol of Ireland attributed in oral tradition to Cúchulainn\\" (James Mackillop), although none of the tales listed above name Cuchulainn as protagonist. T. F. O'Rahilly only went as far as to suggests that the \\"sword of light\\" in folk tales was a vestige of divine weapons and heroic weapons, such as Cúchulainn's shining sword Cruaidín Catutchenn,, EIHM, p. 68, \\"Cúchulainn possessed not only the spear of Bulga, but also a sword, known as in Cruaidín Catutchenn, which shone at night like a torch. In folk tales the lightning-sword has survived as \\"the sword of light\\" (an cloidheamh solais), possessed by a giant and won from him by a hero.\\" whose name means ‘the Hard-headed Steeling’. This sword (aka \\"Socht's sword\\") is said to have \\"shone at night like a candle\\" according to a version of Echtrae Cormaic (\\"Adventures of Cormac mac Airt\\").Stokes, Whitley, ed. tr., Scél na Fír Flatha, Echtra Chormaic i Tír Tairngiri ocus Cert Claidib Chormaic (\\"the Irish Ordeals, Cormac's Adventure in the Land of Promise, and the Decision as to Cormac's Sword\\"), in Irische Texte III, 1 (Leipzig 1891) pp. 183–229. See translation, § 59 (p. 218ff): \\"Socht had a wonderful sword..It shone at night like a candle.. the Hard-headed Steeling, Cúchulainn's sword\\". The Irish name of the sword, it can be confirmed, was \\"Cruadín Catutchend\\", as per endnote to the section on p. 227, or the Irish text on p. 199. T. F. O'Rahilly's schema, roughly speaking, the primeval divine weapon was a fiery and bright lightning weapon, most often conceived of as a throwing spear; in later traditions, the wielder would change from god to hero, and spear tended to be replaced by sword. From the heroic cycles, some prominent examples are Fergus Mac Roigh's sword Caladbolg and Mac Cecht's spear. But Caladbolg does not manifest as a blazing sword, and the latter which does emit fiery sparks is a spear, thus failing to fit the profile of a sword which shines. One example which does fit, is Cúchulainn's sword Cruaidín Catutchenn which was aforementioned.(EIHM) And the legacy of these mythological and heroic weapons (Lug's lighting- weapon, his \\"son\\" Cúchulainn's remarkable sword, etc. ) survive in the \\"sword of light\\" in folklore. = Connection to Arthuriana = A broad sweeping parallel has been made between the light or lightning weapons of Celtic tradition and King Arthur's Excalibur, described as brightly shining in several places of the Vulgate cycle Roman de Merlin. Similar passages obviously occur in Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, which uses this as a source.Book I, p. 19, from The Works of Sir Thomas Malory, ed. Vinaver, Eugène, 3rd ed. Field, Rev. P. J. C. (1990). 3 vol. Oxford: Oxford University Press. , , . (This is taken from the Winchester Manuscript). ;Wounding by one's own sword A more precise parallel which has been argued is that just as the sword of light in Irish and Scottish folktales contain a \\"(fatal) wounding by one's own sword\\" motif, the Arthurian cycle contains an episode where Arthur is imperiled by his own sword, Excalibur. In the Huth Merlin, Morgan le Fay plots to have Arthur killed with his own Excalibur, by stealing the sword for her lover Accalon, who unbeknownst fights his lord King Arthur with it.

Moritz Wahrmann, Wahrmann Mór(ic) (28 February 1832 in Budapest - 26 November 1892 in Budapest) was a Hungarian politician; grandson of Israel Wahrmann. He was educated at the Protestant gymnasium and the university of his native city, and entered his father's mercantile establishment in 1847, becoming its head after his father's death. Wahrmann was closely associated with the development of Hungarian commerce and industry, the consolidation of the Hungarian finances, the growth of the educational and philanthropic institutions of Budapest, and preeminently with the progress of its Jewish community. Aiming to nationalize Hungarian commerce and to render his country independent of Austria, both financially and economically, he established large industrial and commercial enterprises. In 1869 Wahrmann was elected to the Hungarian Parliament as the representative of the electoral district of the Leopoldstadt (at present the fifth district of Budapest), being the first Jew to be chosen a member of the Hungarian delegation, in which he energetically promoted the interests of Hungary. He was reelected six times, holding the office until his death. He spoke comparatively seldom, but was an active member of committees, in which his financial training frequently rendered him one of the most important figures. He was also president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Budapest, and of the Lloyd Company. Wahrmann was equally active in communal affairs, and was one of the foremost advocates of his coreligionists. He was a most zealous member of the Magyar Izraelita Egylet, and strove with tongue and pen for the emancipation of the Jews. In 1868 he was vice-president of the General Jewish Congress, and in this capacity headed a deputation to the king. As president of the community of Budapest he exercised a profound influence on its administration and institutions, and labored to establish unity of interest among the various political bodies. He also contributed generously from his ample means to scientific, educational, and philanthropic institutions. His brother, Alexander Wahrmann (born 1839; died at Budapest in 1899), contributed much, together with Max Wirth, the Viennese political economist, toward the economic elevation of Hungary. He was especially noteworthy as a philanthropist, bequeathing 200,000 crowns to the benevolent societies of the capital, and 600,000 crowns for the erection of a Jewish gymnasium.

Picken joined Manchester United as a junior and was a member of the club's reserve team that won the quadruple in 2005. He retired from football on 30 April 2014 after failing to recover from two serious knee injuries. CareerManchester United= Born in Droylsden, England, Picken started his football career at Manchester United as a junior after being spotted playing in a small six-a-side tournament in Radcliffe. At first, he rejected joining Manchester United, due to having been a boyhood Manchester City supporter, but his mother persuaded him to do so. Picken went on to spend ten years at the club's academy and was a member of the club's reserve team that won the quadruple in 2005. Shortly after, he signed his first professional contract with the club. After returning from a loan spell at Chesterfield, Picken was among four players to be released by the club at the end of the 2005–06 season. =Chesterfield= Picken played for Chesterfield on a loan basis from 18 August 2005 until the end of December. Two days later, on 20 August 2005, Picken made his Chesterfield debut, where he made his first start for the club and played 90 minutes, in a 4–1 loss against Oldham Athletic. Subsequently, his loan spell with Chesterfield was extended until the end of the season despite playing nine matches. After extending his loan spell at Chesterfield, Picken then established himself in the first team and scored his first Chesterfield goal on 1 April 2006, in a 3–1 loss against Nottingham Forest. He later finished the 2005–06 season, making thirty–two appearance and scoring once. On 25 May 2006, Picken later joined the club on a permanent basis, signing a two–year contract. His first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis came in the opening game of the season, where he made his first start, in a 3–0 win over Bournemouth. He began playing from a left–back position to right–back position, as the season progressed, and then scored his first Chesterfield goal on 17 February 2007, in a 3–0 win over Port Vale. Despite suspension and injury, Picken made 39 appearances and scored once in his first full season at Chesterfield. In the 2007–08 season saw Picken found himself competing over a right–back position with Jamie Lowry. However, during the season, Picken suffered an ankle injury and a hand injury that required operation. Despite the injuries, he made 37 appearances for Chesterfield in the 2007–08 season and was offered a new contract by the club. It was announced on 4 June 2008 that Picken had signed a contract with the club, keeping until 2010. However, in the 2008–09 season, Picken soon fell out favour by Manager Lee Richardson and was told by the manager to fight for the first team place. Picken was frozen out of the first team at the start of the season until being recalled to the first team against Gillingham on 6 December 2008. When the January transfer window opened, Picken was consequently loaned out to Notts County on a one-month deal. He made his Notts County debut two days on 10 January 2009, where he made his first start and playing 90 minutes, in a 2–1 win over Exeter City. Three weeks later on 31 January 2009, Picken played against his parent club, Chesterfield, having been given permission to play against them, and lost 1–0. Shortly after, Picken's loan spell with Notts County was extended until the end of the season. He established himself in the first team at Notts County and went on to make twenty–two appearance for the club. At the end of the season, the club and Picken himself were keen for him to sign for the club on a permanent basis. However, Picken didn't sign on a permanent basis, as the club signed Brendan Moloney on loan instead. However, the Spireites' manager was sacked at the end of the season, and new manager John Sheridan gave the whole squad a clean slate. Picken soon became the first choice right back at Saltergate again. However, Picken suffered injuries again throughout the 2009–10 season. Despite this, he went on to make twenty–one appearances for the club. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Picken was released by the club. =Bury= After leaving the club, Picken went on trial at Bury. After impressing at the trial, he signed for on a free transfer on 4 August 2010, signing a one–year contract. Picken made his Bury debut, making his first start and playing 90 minutes, in a 1–0 loss against Port Vale in the opening game of the season on 7 August 2010. Three weeks later on 28 August 2010, he then provided an assist for Ryan Lowe to score Bury's only goal in the game, in a 1–1 draw against Barnet. Though he became a first team regular at Bury, making thirty–eight appearances for the club, Picken suffered suspension and injuries, including a hamstring injury that kept him out for the rest of the season. Despite this, Picken achieved promotion from League 2 with Bury as runners up in the league in May 2011. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Picken's contract with Bury was extended for another year. The 2011–12 season saw Picken returning to the first team from injury and making his first appearance for the club since April, in a 1–1 draw against Huddersfield Town in the opening game of the season on 6 August 2011. He managed to regain his first team place and was awarded a contract, which would keep him until 2014. Picken continued to do so, as the season progressed until being dropped from the first team in mid-March, due to a mistake against Carlisle United that saw Bury lost 4–1. Despite this, Picken made thirty–seven appearances for the club in the 2011–12 season. In the 2012–13 season, Picken suffered a knee injury in a game against Preston North End in September 2012 and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season, with Bury suffering relegation in his absence. On 28 May 2013 it was announced that Picken would miss the entire 2013–14 season following further setbacks with his injury. Because of this, he was not allocated a squad number ahead of the 2013–14 season. After failing to recover from his injury, Picken announced his retirement from professional football in May 2014.

Future Governor of American Samoa Henry Francis Bryan served as her commander for some of her sailing days. Service history Assigned to the Asiatic Squadron, Monocacy remained there until 1903, a period of service so long that the light-draft gunboat was given the nickname \\"Jinricksha of the Navy\\". After patrol duty through 1867, Monocacy joined her squadron in representing the U.S. Government at the opening of the ports of Osaka and Hyōgo, Japan, 1 January 1868. In December, she surveyed the Inland Sea between Nagasaki and Osaka to locate appropriate sites for lighthouses, another step in the realization of American commercial trade with isolationist Japan. The gunboat spent most of 1869 and 1870 patrolling off Japan to help check license in the restless years following the Meiji Restoration in 1867. After repairs at Shanghai, Monocacy began charting the Yangtze River on 23 March 1871. By April she was underway for Nagasaki, Japan, to participate in a five-ship survey expedition to the Salee River, Korea, and, while there, attempt contact with representatives of the Kingdom of Korea. After Korean shore batteries attacked screw tug near Chemulpo, a landing party of 576 sailors and 110 marines stormed a series of forts along the Salee River on 10 June, losing three killed and seven wounded. The expedition retired in July. In September, the gunboat resumed her navigation of the Yangtze before returning to Shanghai 4 February 1872. For the last quarter of the 19th century, Monocacy cruised along the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China, docking in Japan through the winter months. On 7 October 1884, while at Fuzhou, China, Captain of the Afterguard William H. Belpitt rescued a Chinese man from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. From 23 October until 11 November 1899, the veteran ship carried the U.S. Minister to China as she visited the open ports of the Yangtze River. In 1900, Monocacy became involved in the repercussions of the Boxer Rebellion. On 14 June, she captured seven small craft off Tongku, China. The foreign persecutions ended with the capture of Peking, on 14 August, by the China Relief Expedition, and Monocacy docked at Taku Bar, China, where she remained through the razing of the Taku forts in accordance with the formal settlement signed in September 1901. On 22 June 1903 Monocacy was struck from the Navy list and sold to Hashimoto and Son, Nagasaki, Japan.

Origins Since Northern Ireland's creation in 1922, the Catholic minority had suffered from varying degrees of discrimination from the Protestant and Unionist majority.Whyte, John. \\"How Much Discrimination was there Under the Unionist Regime 1921–1968?\\", Contemporary Irish Studies, Gallagher and O'Connell (eds; 1983). Manchester: Manchester University Press. Many nationalist historians regard the ethos of Northern Ireland as unambiguously sectarian,Ruane & Todd.Foster, pp. 526-31.Coogan, pp. 24-25 however, academic and author Senia Paseta posits that discrimination was never as calculated as republicans maintained nor as fictional as unionists claimed.Senia Paseta (2003), Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction, pg. 107. Oxford Paperbacks. In fact, laws against religious discrimination were enshrined in what was Northern Ireland's constitution – the Government of Ireland Act 1920. No Government of Northern Ireland, even if they had wanted to, could create laws which overtly discriminated against any religious body of peoples. The most relevant text in the 1920 Act was 5(1): * Electoral representation. In order to ensure that the interests of minorities were protected and limit the electoral success of Sinn Féin, the Government of Ireland Act established proportional representation (P.R.) as the electoral system to be used in local government and the parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. It did, however, allow for the parliaments to change the electoral system three years after first meeting. The Government of Northern Ireland contemplated abandoning P.R. in 1924, but feared antagonizing the Labour-led British government, so shelved the idea. However, after the Unionist Party lost 8 seats in the 1925 Northern Ireland general election, First Past The Post was introduced in time for the 1929 election. Despite losing more than 4% of the vote share compared with 1925, the Unionist Party managed to pick up 4 seats. Proportional representation for local government elections was abolished by the Northern Ireland government in 1920 for Northern Ireland's local elections in 1924.Foster, p 529. :The property franchise (which granted votes in local elections only to those who owned property) weighted representation heavily in favour of the Protestant community, as did the plural business votes they enjoyed for parliamentary elections. The result was that many towns and cities with a Catholic majority, even a substantial one, were Unionist-controlled: examples included Derry City, Armagh, Dungannon, and Enniskillen. Electoral boundaries were carefully engineered: Belfast's representatives in Stormont went from 4 to 16 in 1921, but there was no increase in the nationalist representation, and Belfast continued to return one Nationalist Member of Parliament (MP). :In the 1965 Stormont elections the Ulster Unionist Party won 34 out of the 52 available seats, while in the 1966 elections to the Westminster parliament they won 11 of Northern Ireland's available 12 seats. The Stormont Assembly returned the Ulster Unionist Party to office continuously between Northern Ireland's founding in 1922 and the abolition of the Parliament in 1972.Bew, Gibbon and Patterson, et al. Northern Ireland 1921–2001: Political Forces and Social Classes. (2001) London, Serif. * Policing. Of the institutions of state, the police in particular were perceived by Catholics and nationalists as being in support of the Protestant and Unionist majority.Bew, Gibbon and Patterson, Northern Ireland: 1921/2001 Political Forces and Social Classes, p. 27 Representation of Catholics in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, formed in 1922, never exceeded 20% and by the 1960s had sunk to 12%.Morrison, John. \\"The Ulster Government and Internal Opposition\\", The Ulster Cover-Up (paperback). Lurgan, County Armagh: Ulster Society (Publications) Ltd. pp. 26, 39–40; . The reserve police force (the Ulster Special Constabulary) was composed upon its formation largely of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteers and led by the Ulster Volunteers' former commander, Wilfrid Spender and remained almost exclusively Protestant until its disbandment. * Employment. The 1971 census offered the first opportunity to assess the extent of any discrimination in employment, as it was the first census since 1911 that provided cross-tabulation by religion and occupation.Bell, Voice For All: General Overview, Institute for Conflict Research (2008). The census documented that Protestant male unemployment was 6.6% compared to 17.3% for Catholic males, while the equivalent rates for women were 3.6% and 7% respectively. Catholics were over-represented in unskilled jobs and Protestants in skilled employment. Catholics made up 31% of the economically active population but accounted for only 6% of mechanical engineers, 7% of 'company secretaries and registrars' and 'personnel managers', 8% of university teachers, 9% of local authority senior officers, 19% of medical practitioners, and 23% of lawyers. * Housing. Housing was inter-related with electoral representation, and therefore political power at local and Stormont levels. The general vote was confined to the occupier of a house and his wife. Occupiers' children over 21 and any servants or subtenants in a house were excluded from voting. So the allocation of a public authority house was not just the allocation of a scarce resource: it was the allocation of two votes. Therefore, whoever controlled the allocation of public authority housing effectively controlled the voting in that area.Coogan, p. 30, quoting SDLP MP Austin Currie. Since 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice had been collating and publicising in its journal The Plain Truth what it regarded as evidence of discrimination. Its precursor, the Homeless Citizens League, had been holding marches to press for fair allocation of social housing.Purdie, Chapter 3.CAIN website, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 25 February 2015. Both of these organisations has arisen at a time when the African-American civil rights organisation was headline news around the world.Purdie, p. 91 Both achieved success in bringing anti-Catholic discrimination to the attention of the media and, in the case of the Campaign for Social Justice, to politicians in Westminster.Purdie, p. 93. The idea of developing a non-partisan civil rights campaign into one with wider objectives as an alternative to military operations, which the IRA Army Council had formally ceased on 26 February 1962,The United Irishman, March 1962, p. 1; see also Patrick Bishop, Eamonn Mallie, The Provisional IRA, Corgi 1988, p. 45; was pursued by the Dublin Wolfe Tone Society, although redirecting the civil rights movement to assist in the achievement of republican objectives had been mooted previously by others (including C. Desmond Greaves, then a member of the Connolly Association) as \\"the way to undermine Ulster unionism\\".English, p. 86. The idea shared certain attributes with that of infiltrating Northern Ireland's trade unions as a means of furthering republican objectives, which had previously been tried and abandoned by the IRA in the 1930s.Coogan, p 56. The concept (set out in the August 1966 bulletin (Tuarisc) of the Wolfe Tone Societies) was to \\"demand more than may be demanded by the compromising elements that exist among the Catholic leadership. Seek to associate as wide a section of the community as possible with these demands, in particular the well-intentioned people in the Protestant population and the trade union movement.\\"Quoted in Purdie, p 128. In 1969, after the civil rights movement had been active for several years, the strategy was described in Ireland Today, published by the Republican Education Department, as requiring that: \\"the civil rights movement include all elements that are deprived, not just republicans, and that unity in action within the civil rights movement be developed towards unity of political objectives to be won, and that ultimately (but not necessarily immediately) the political objective agreed by the organised radical groups be seen within the framework of a movement towards the achievement of a 32-county democratic republic.\\"Purdie, p 129. At a meeting which took place in Maghera on 13–14 August 1966 at the home of Kevin Agnew (a Derry republican solicitor),Info re Kevin Agnew, books.google.com; accessed 27 February 2015. attended by the Wolfe Tone Societies of Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Derry, and County Tyrone, and the IRA's chief of staff, Cathal Goulding,Purdie, pp. 123–24, 132–33. it was proposed that an organisation be created with wider civil rights objectives as its stated aim. After these discussions it was decided to drop the Wolfe Tone Societies tag, and an ad hoc body was formed which organised a seminar on 8 November 1966 in Belfast. The main speakers were the president of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement, Kader Asmal, a South African-born lecturer in law at Trinity College Dublin, and Ciarán Mac an Áilí, a Derry-born Dublin solicitor who was a member of the International Commission of Jurists and president of the Irish Pacifist Association. It was agreed that another meeting should be called to launch a civil rights body and this took place in Belfast on 29 January 1967. Tony Smythe and James Shepherd from the National Council of Civil Liberties in London were present and there were more than 100 delegates from a variety of organisations, including Northern Ireland political parties.Purdie, p 133. A 13-member steering committee was tasked at the Belfast meeting with drafting NICRA's constitution. One member, Dolley, had taken part at the meeting at Agnew's house. No original member self-identified as a Unionist or can be described that way, but a few days after the committee was formed, Robin Cole, former Chairman of the Young Unionists at Queen's University, was co-opted onto the committee by unanimous decision.) The original committee consisted of:Coogan, p 57. Note that Tim Pat Coogan's list of members of what he describes as \\"the first committee\\" is inaccurate: he lists the membership as it was following the meeting held on 9 April 1967, which ratified the constitution. * 1. Chairman: Noel Harris, a trade unionist and member of the Draughtsmen and Allied Trades Association and the Communist Party. * 2. Vice-Chairman: Conn McCluskey (one of the founders of the Campaign for Social Justice).John Manley, \\"'Father' of civil rights movement dies\\", The Irish News, 17 December 2013 * 3. Secretary: Derek O'Brien Peters, of the Communist Party. * 4. Treasurer: Fred Heatley, of the Wolfe Tone Societies. * 5. Information Officer: Jack Bennett, a journalist with The Belfast Telegraph. * 6. Betty Sinclair, a communist member of the Belfast Trades Council. * 7. Liam McMillen, vice-chairman of the Republican Clubs (and Commanding Officer of the IRA Belfast Brigade). * 8. John Quinn, of the Ulster Liberal Party. * 9. Professor Michael Dolley, of Queen's University Belfast, a civil libertarianCoogan, p 57. and member of the National Democratic Party (Northern Ireland). * 10. Joe Sherry, of the Republican Labour Party. * 11. Jim Andrews, of the Ardoyne Tenants Association. * 12. Paddy Devlin, of the Northern Ireland Labour Party. * 13. Tony McGettigan, unaffiliated. NICRA held a meeting to ratify the constitution on 9 April 1967. It was on this date that NICRA officially came into existence.There were some changes as the steering committee became NICRA's executive council, with Ken Banks of the Ardoyne Tenants Association replacing Jim Andrews; Kevin Agnew, a republican solicitor, replacing McMillen; and Terence O'Brien (unaffiliated) replacing McGettigan. Betty Sinclair became chairman. Robin Cole, a liberal member of the Young Unionists and chairman of the Queen's University Belfast Conservative and Unionist Association, was later co-opted onto the executive council. NICRA's constitution, aims and philosophy NICRA, as it eventually emerged, differed from what had been outlined in Tuarisc and discussed at Agnew's home in Maghera. The form which NICRA took was determined by the coalition of forces which came together to create it, of which republicans were only one element.Purdie, p. 151. Civil rights were the banner to which republicans, nationalists, communists, socialists, liberals and the unaffiliated could rally. NICRA's executive council brought together such diverse groups as the republican Wolfe Tone Society and the Campaign for Social Justice, whose founders and leaders believed traditional nationalist politics were ineffective in serving the needs of the Catholic minority. The constitution of NICRA was based on that of the British National Council for Civil Liberties.Purdie, Chapter 4. NICRA's name was expressed in English only. The constitution emphasised the association's character as non-party and non- denominational, and as a body which would make representations on the broad issues of civil liberties and would also take up individual cases of discrimination and ill-treatment and stated NICRA's aims as \\"to assist in the maintenance of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, propaganda and assembly\\".CAIN website, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 3 March 2015. NICRA's aims were:Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. \\"We Shall Overcome ... The History of the Struggle for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland 1968–78\\", Belfast, Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, 1978, p. 20. * 1. To defend the basic freedoms of all citizens. * 2. To protect the rights of the individual. * 3. To highlight all possible abuses of power. * 4. To demand guarantees for freedom of speech, assembly and association. * 5. To inform the public of their lawful rights. It had six main demands: * 1. \\"One man, one vote\\" which would allow all people over the age of 18 to vote in local council elections and remove the multiple votes held by business owners – known as the \\"business vote\\". * 2. An end to gerrymandering electoral wards to produce an artificial unionist majority. * 3. Prevention of discrimination in the allocation of government jobs. * 4. Prevention of discrimination in the allocation of council housing. * 5. The removal of the Special Powers Act. * 6. The disbandment of the almost entirely Protestant Ulster Special Constabulary (B Specials). =Links with other civil rights associations= In conscious imitation of the philosophy of, and tactics used, by the American Civil Rights Movement, and modeled somewhat on the National Council for Civil Liberties, the new organisation held marches, pickets, sit-ins and protests to pressure the Government of Northern Ireland to grant these demands. The Northern Irish movement incorporated much of the African American movement's vernacular and protest songs from their transatlantic counterparts such as \\"We Shall Overcome\\" and \\"We Shall Not Be Moved\\" became common at NICRA protests.Andrew J. Wilson, Irish America and the Ulster Conflict 1968-1995 (Belfast: Blackstaff, 1995), 37. In 1968, Derry civil rights leader Finbar O'Doherty would refer to Northern Irish Catholics as Ulster's \\"white negros\\" in a speech that gained traction in the world's press.John Dumbrell, \\"The United States and the Northern Irish Conflict 1969-94: From Indifference to Intervention,\\" Irish Studies in International Affairs 6 (1995): 111. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.3318/irisstudinteaffa.2018.0107.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A192db0de9aa9792463a093c3a95ced2b This widespread attention, particularly in the United States, helped NICRA secure a much wider international and internal support than traditional nationalist protests had done.Ruane & Todd, pp. 126–27. NICRA's innovation (drawing on the approach adopted by the Campaign for Social Justice) was to rely on and seek to vindicate civil rights, i.e. rights adhering to all citizens of Northern Ireland as British citizens under the existing constitutional settlement, rather than base its demands on the nationalist goal of reunification in a republic comprising the whole island of Ireland. For many supporters of NICRA, that did not mean accepting the constitutional settlement or entail any obligation of loyalty to the UK: assertion of those rights was a device by which the condition of the Catholic minority could be improved. However, from the outset there were tensions within the association between those advocating militant and confrontational methods, in particular the socialist and republican elements of the movement, such as Eamonn McCann, Michael Farrell and Cyril Toman, and those who remained wedded to the pacifist American civil rights model. Toman later joined Provisional Sinn Féin.Profile, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 1 January 2016. Allegations against NICRA and ties with republicanism The Northern Ireland government accused NICRA of being a front for republican and communist ideologies.Jarman, Neil. Material conflicts: parades and visual displays in Northern Ireland. Berg Publishers, 1997, p 77; Unionists suspected that NICRA was a front for the IRA. The involvement of republicans, such as IRA chief of staff Cathal Goulding, and groups like the Irish National Foresters, the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Wolfe Tone Societies would only further fuel their suspicions. After the failure of the IRA's Border Campaign, republicans had been seeking peaceful ways of advancing their cause by joining Trade Unions and the Northern Ireland Labour Party, and then NICRA when it was formed in 1967. On 4 October 1968, a day before NICRA's Derry march, the IRA admitted that it was infiltrating the civil rights movement as well as trade unions. NICRA arose from a meeting of the republican Wolfe Tone Societies. The republican movement was influential in getting NICRA to participate in protest marches, however, due to the various different groups that made up NICRA, it could not control the organisation's direction. The radical views of individuals within NICRA were highlighted by a commission of inquiry set up by the British Government following the spread of civil unrest in 1969. The report by a Scottish judge, Lord Cameron stated, \\"certain at least of those who were prominent in the Association had objects far beyond the 'reformist' character of the majority of Civil Rights Association demands, and undoubtedly regarded the Association as a stalking-horse for achievement of other and more radical and in some cases revolutionary objects, in particular abolition of the border, unification of Ireland outside the United Kingdom and the setting up of an all-Ireland Workers' Socialist Republic.\\"Lord Cameron, Disturbances in Northern Ireland: Report of the Commission appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland (Belfast, 1969) Yet despite this, the aims of the NICRA executive, as set out in April 1969, maintained an aversion for an outright call for constitutional change in Northern Ireland and did not call for the end of partition.Colin McCluskey, Up off their Knees: A Commentary on the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland (Republic of Ireland: Conn McCluskey and associates, 1989), 105. Bob Purdie has maintained that the outright republicanism of NICRA was more an issue of perception than of purpose and that the \\"civil rights movement was perfectly sincere in its view of its marches as non-sectarian\\".Bob Purdie, Politics in the Streets: The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland (Belfast: Blackstaff, 1990), 244. https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie/purdie90_conclusion.pdf First civil rights march In an effort to highlight the issue of public housing being allocated preferentially to Protestants in County Tyrone, Austin Currie, at a meeting of NICRA in Maghera on 27 July 1968, proposed holding a protest march from Coalisland to Dungannon Market Square. There was opposition to the idea from some in NICRA's executive, in particular from the NICRA chair and veteran communist Betty Sinclair who felt that unionists would see the march simply as a nationalist demonstration. After extended discussion the proposal was agreed and a march organised for 24 August.Hanley & Millar 2009 p.102 A counter-protest was planned by Ian Paisley's Ulster Protestant Volunteers, who viewed that the proposed march through the unionist-dominated Market Square was provocative. Hoping to avoid a confrontation, the UUP MP for South Tyrone, John Taylor, tried to get Paisley to abandon the counter protest, and have the NICRA march rerouted. The call for a reroute was supported by the Unionist mayor of Dungannon district. Late on 23 August arrangements were made to halt the march near Quarry Lane at Thomas Street, Dungannon, and divert it to Anne Street. The Tyrone Brigade of the IRA sought permission from its Dublin headquarters to participate, resulting in a call for as many republicans to attend from Northern Ireland as possible. The NICRA march took place on 24 August 1968, attracting around 2,500 people and was followed by five nationalist marching bands from Coalisland to Dungannon, noted was the presence of republican Billy McMillen.Hanley & Millar 2009 pp.103–104. RUC officers prevented the march from entering Dungannon while 1,500 counter demonstrators jeered. Speeches were generally considered 'mild' with the exception of the address given by Gerry Fitt who said: The march is considered to have passed off peacefully, though there are accounts of minor stone throwings with several marchers trying to break through the police line only to be rebuffed by the RUC and restrained by the marshalls. The chairperson of NICRA Betty Sinclair managed to convince the marchers to restrain themselves and show that they were \\"peaceful people asking for our civil rights in an orderly manner\\". The crowds dispersed without incident. Footage of the march can be found of RTE archives. Derry march The Coalisland-Dungannon march was considered a \\"disappointing anti-climax\\" and some more radical marchers felt that the police barricade should have been broken and that future police barricades would be broken. The Derry Housing Action Committee requested that the next march be held in Derry and was supported by the Derry Labour Party, the Derry Labour Party Young Socialists, the Derry Housing Action Committee, the Derry City Republican Club, the James Connolly Society and NICRA. On 8 September, a notice of the \\"Derry march\\" was submitted, with the march taking place on 5 October 1968. The route proposed on behalf of the Civil Rights Association was one commonly followed by 'Protestant' and 'Loyalist' marches in Derry. It was to start from the Waterside Railway Station, east of the River Foyle, cross the river along Craigavon Bridge and proceed to the Diamond, the central point of the city. This route traversed certain Protestant district’, and ended within the city's walls, which have major significance in Orange tradition. Local Unionists objected to the route of the march through what was viewed Unionist-dominated territory, and were concerned that the Diamond War Memorial would not be respected. Unionists opposition hardened after Cathal Goulding, then IRA chief of staff, appeared on Ulster television on 27 September claiming that the IRA were actively supporting the civil rights campaign.Hanley & Millar 2009 p.104. On 1 October, the Apprentice Boys of Derry announced their intention to march the same route on the same day and time, although its governor said he knew nothing of a planned parade. William Craig, the Northern Ireland Home Affairs Minister, banned both the civil rights march and the Apprentice Boys' march on police advice in the hope of avoiding serious disorder. Craig said he was not against freedom of expression but that it should not be done in areas where it likely to cause provocation, especially as he saw NICRA as \\"a republican- nationalist organisation\\". With the march banned, and fearing that the presence of radicals may lead to violence, some members of NICRA's executive believed that they should withdraw their support for the march and unsuccessfully lobbied the Derry Housing Action Committee to call the march off. At a meeting of the South Derry IRA it was decided to push any of the politicians present on the day of the march into the police lines if marchers were blocked. The banned march started at the Waterside station, and attracted 400 protesters with local organisers duly insisting that MPs McAteer, Currie and Fitt should lead the march. Eamonn McCann (one of the organisers of the march) estimated that a further 200 watched from the pavements. Some of the more prominent participants such as John Hume took part only because of Craig's banning of the march. Others there included Republican Labour MP Gerry Fitt, who brought three British Labour Party MPs with him, and members of the media. The marchers decided to ignore the rerouting and were stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary before it had properly begun. After several marchers were hit by police batons, with Fitt being hospitalised, the marchers sat down and gave short speeches. This was followed by some retaliation from the marchers who hurdled stones and placards at the police, the police eventually moved in with batons chasing and hitting those who fell by the wayside. Some demonstrators had managed to filter into the Diamond in small groups, however this saw the arrival of a large crowd of angry Catholic youths who had not participated in the march but who then provoked the police. Having forced the youths back down to the Bogside with baton-charges, a stone-throwing confrontation took place between Catholics and police. Having pushed the police back to the Diamond, the fighting continued and the next day petrol bombs were thrown and shops looted.WE SHALL OVERCOME....The History of the Struggle for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland 1968–1978, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 25 February 2015. =Aftermath= The footage captured by RTÉ of the march and unprovoked police brutality on unarmed protestors including British MPs would change the course of Northern Ireland forever. In one go it brought the full spectre of sectarianism in Northern Ireland to the fore and started the chain of events that led to the bitter intercommunal violence that would degenerate into The Troubles. Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O'Neill made his \\"Ulster at the crossroads\\" speech on television on 9 December, appealing for calm. As a result of the announcement of various reforms, NICRA declared a halt to marches until 11 January 1969, while People's Democracy disagreed with this stance. Leading Derry Housing Action Committee member, Eamonn McCann, later admitted that, \\"our conscious if unspoken strategy was to provoke the police into over-reaction and thus spark off a mass reaction against the authorities\\".Eamonn McCann quote, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 1 January 2016. 1969 riots Events escalated until August 1969, when the annual Apprentice Boys of Derry march was attacked as it marched through the city's walls and past a perimeter with the nationalist Bogside. Initially some loyalist supporters had thrown pennies down from the walls onto Catholics in the Bogside. Catholics then threw nails and stones at loyalists leading to an intense confrontation starting. The RUC intervened, and a three-day riot ensued known as the Battle of the Bogside. Rioting quickly spread throughout nationalist areas in Northern Ireland, where at least seven were killed, and hundreds wounded. Thousands of Catholics were driven from their homes by loyalists. These events are often seen as the start of the Troubles. In a subsequent official inquiry, Lord Scarman concluded, \\"We are satisfied that the spread of the disturbances [in Derry in August 1969] owed much to a deliberate decision of some minority groups to relieve police pressure on the rioters in Londonderry. Amongst these groups must be included NICRA, whose executive decided to organise demonstrators in the Province so as to prevent reinforcement of the police in Londonderry.\\"\\"Violence and Civil Disturbances in Northern Ireland in 1969\\", Scarman Tribunal, April 1972. In December 1969 and January 1970, both Sinn Féin and the IRA split into \\"Official\\" and \\"Provisional\\" wings, with the \\"Official\\" wings retaining influence in NICRA. Internment and Bloody Sunday The British government introduced internment on 9 August 1971 at the request of the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, Brian Faulkner.English, p 139. The British Army, in co-operation with the RUC, interned 342 people. 116 of those interned were innocent of involvement with the IRA and were quickly released. The introduction of internment was not a closely guarded secret, with newspaper editorials appearing and discussion on television. The IRA went underground or fled across the border. As a result, fewer than 100 arrested were from the IRA. By this stage, support for NICRA began to wane, however NICRA continued to organise anti-internment marches. In Derry on 30 January 1972 NICRA took part in a mass anti-internment march which had also been banned.Bardon, p. 686. Fourteen unarmed demonstrators were shot and killed by British troops during the march, and it became known as Bloody Sunday.

Story escaped to Flanders in 1563, but seven years later he was lured aboard a boat in Antwerp and abducted to England, where he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, and subsequently executed at Tyburn on a charge of treason. Life He was born in 1504, the son of Nicholas and Joan Story of Salisbury. He became a Franciscan tertiary. Story was educated at Hinxsey Hall, University of Oxford, where he became lecturer on civil law in 1535, and two years later became principal of Broadgates Hall, afterwards Pembroke College.Wainewright, John. \\"Bl. John Story.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 28 May 2013 He received his D.C.L. in 1538, and the following year resigned his position at Broadgates and was admitted as an advocate at Doctors' Commons. He married Joan Watts. He appears to have temporarily abjured his Roman Catholic beliefs and took the Oath of Supremacy. In 1544, in recognition of legal services performed in Boulogne for the crown, King Henry VIII confirmed Story in the position of Regius Professor of civil law at Oxford. Having been chosen Member of Parliament for Salisbury in 1545 and Hindon in Wiltshire. Just after the accession of King Edward VI in 1547, Story gained notoriety by his opposition to the Act of Uniformity in 1548. For crying out \\"Woe unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child,\\" Story was imprisoned by the House of Commons, but he was soon released and went into exile with his family to Louvain, where he became a member of the University. After the accession of Queen Mary he returned to England in August 1553. His patent as Regius Professor was renewed but he resigned his interest in his position at Oxford, and was made chancellor of the dioceses of London and of Oxford and dean of arches. Queen Mary being now on the throne, Story was one of the officials in prosecuting heresy, and one of her proctors at the trial of Thomas Cranmer at Oxford in 1555. Under Queen Elizabeth, he was again returned to Parliament (as member for East Grinstead in 1553, Bramber in April 1554, Bath in November 1554, Ludgershall in 1555 and Downton in 1559). On 20 May 1560, he underwent a short imprisonment in the Fleet for \\"having obstinately refused attendance on public worship, and everywhere declaiming and railing against that religion we now profess.\\"Camm, Bede. \\"Blessed John story\\", Lives of the English Martyrs Declared Blessed by Pope Leo XIII, in 1886 and 1895: Martyrs under Queen Elizabeth, Burns and Oates, 1905, p. 46 In 1563, he was again arrested and committed to the Marshalsea, but managed to escape to Flanders, where he became a pensioner of King Philip II, and acted as the King's almoner for the Catholic exiles. Engaged by the Duke of Alba (Alva in Dutch), Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, to prevent the export of heretical books from the Netherlands to England, he was lured onto a trading boat at Antwerp in 1570 and conveyed to Yarmouthand thence to imprisonment in the Tower of London. According to Bede Camm, Story represented the old order, and was well known among the Catholic refugees. Brought home by fraud and violence and then executed, Camm sees this as meant to send a message to the exiles, demonstrating \\"how strong Elizabeth was to punish and how powerless Spain to protect\\".Camm, Bede. Lives of the English Martyrs, Intro p. xxii, Longmans, Green and Company, 1914 In spite of his claim that he was a Spanish subject, he was tried for high treason (for having supported the Northern Rebellion of 1569 and encouraging the Duke of Alba to invade) and was condemned to death on 2 May 1571. The spectacle of his trial moved St. Edmund Campion, who was present, to reconsider both his own position and his Catholic duty. He was executed at Tyburn by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 1 June 1571.

History The first railway workshops in Western Australia were located at FremantleHutchison, David (2004) The Railway Workshops in Fremantle pp 75–87 in Fremantle Studies Volume 3, and shifted to Midland in 1904.Editorial on the decision by Parliament to remove the railway workshops from Fremantle to Midland The West Australian, 6 Sept. 1895, p.4, The Midland Railway Workshops were involved with all WAGR rolling stock and engine construction and maintenance. Steam engines continued to operate on mainline service until 1971, and all major maintenance occurred at the workshops. Workforce Generations of workers at the workshops had considerable numbers of European migrants who arrived in Australia with limited English language, and there were significant groups of Italian migrants in the workforce. The workforce of the workshops had a rich history and, since closing, there have been projects to record oral history and collect information about the place and people involved. Closure In April 1993, the Richard Court Liberal State Government announced that the workshops would be eventually closed. A number of protests and rallies were held to save the workshops, but they were not successful. On 4 March 1994, the remaining workers assembled at the traditional workshops meeting area, the flagpole. Long-time employee and timekeeper, Kevin Mountain lowered the Australian flag for the last time, ending not only his career but 90 years of Western Australian railway history. Coal dam Midland Workshops coal dam Located at the far western end of the workshops site is a dam. Initially created as a storage dam for water supplies in the late 1890s, it was increased in size in 1947 for coal storage. A treatment plant built on the site in 1974 used the dam to discharge wastewater. Development of the Woodbridge Lakes housing estate near the site prompted environmental studies of the heavy metals and sludge within the dam. The dam has been retained for its heritage value as a water feature, with some of the area comprising public open space. Memorial to Fallen Soldiers Memorial to Fallen Soldiers At the courtyard entrance to the workshops is a Memorial to Fallen Soldiers. The memorial commemorates the 70 railway workers who enlisted from the workshops and died in World War I. It was unveiled in 1925. A further 25 men who lost their lives in World War II were later added to the memorial. The figure of Peace atop the memorial was the work of Pietro Porcelli. The memorial reads \\"In enduring commemoration of the loyalty devotion and sacrifice of workshop comrades who fell in the Great War 1914–1918. These our glorious dead. Erected by their fellow employees.\\" Changes Recent years saw use of the workshops for a very limited period of timenarrow gauge access to the workshops from the main railway line was re- instated in mid-2004, and effectively ceased in late 2007. The Midland Redevelopment Authority (MRA) appears to have removed the workshops from any significant working rail heritage status. Until late 2007 the Australian Railway Historical Society had performed restoration work and housed part of their collection in the workshops. South Spur Rail Services used to occupy several roads, in part due to their association with the Spirit of the West restaurant train that was stabled in the workshops; they have since moved to an area closer to Bellevue and the Roe Highway overpass. Transwa used the workshops for storage of the new Prospector and Avonlink railcars during their trials. Likewise, Transperth used the workshops for storage of the new B series railcars upon delivery from Queensland until bogie exchanges from standard gauge to narrow gauge could take place, at which time the cars were moved to either the Claisebrook or Nowergup depots. Midland Railway Workshops yard model Despite its disinterest in supporting working rail heritage to continue at the workshops, the MRA has produced an undated pamphlet that gives a brief overview of the workshops history, which is derived from various sources including the Midland Railway Workshops Site Conservation Policy of 1994 produced by Heritage and Conservation Professionals.The History and Heritage of the Midland Railway Workshops (unpaginated, undated, published by the Midland Redevelopment Authority The eastern end of the workshops site has already been developed into a bulky goods retail area and the Western Australian Police Operations Centre has incorporated the former Flanging Shop into their centre. The St John of God Midland Public and Private Hospitals also occupy a portion of the former workshops site. The section of the workshop area to the east of the main railway buildings has been demolished to make way for projects which the Midland Redevelopment Authority has earmarked for further development. The main buildings in the middle of the workshop area remain. Midland Railway Workshops from Greenmount Hill Heritage strategy In 2001 and 2004 the Heritage strategy for the Midland Central redevelopment area was produced by the Midland Redevelopment Authority.

It is a provider of speciality chemicals, advanced materials and technologies.http://www.omgi.com/ab-company-profile.html The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange prior to being privatized by Apollo Global Management in June 2015.  Overview of Operations  OM Group employs approximately 6,000 people and has locations in Canada, China, D.R. Congo, France, Finland, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.http://www.omgi.com/contact- offices.html OMG has six business units: * Advanced Organics * Advanced Materials * Electronic Chemicals * Compugraphics * Ultra Pure Chemicals * Battery Technologies Of these six units, its three main business platforms are: magnetic technologies, battery technologies and speciality chemicals. OM Group supplies more than 4,000 customers, serving more than 50 industries worldwide, including automotive systems, electronic devices, aerospace, industrial and renewable energy. History The roots of the company date back to the 1940s when the company’s predecessor Mooney Chemical Company was founded in 1946 in Cleveland by namesake James Mooney and his partner Carl A. Reusser. Forging strong ties with copper and nickel miners in Zaire and Zambia, Mooney quickly became key supplier of the metals, helping maintain some of the highest levels of productivity in the cobalt specialty-chemicals industry. In the mid-1990s, for example, OM Group's sales per employee were more than double the industry average, at $850,000 compared with less than $300,000. In the 1970s James Mooney’s seventh son, James P. Mooney joined the firm at the age of just 23, joining three of his brothers in the executive office. Despite a reluctance to incur debt and therefore infrequent acquisitions, the brothers expanded the firm’s product line through the purchases of Mobil Oil’s subsidiary in Pennsylvania, Chicago's Lauder Chemical, and Cleveland's Harshaw Chemical in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. By 1984, the company's 40 employees generated about $2 million in annual sales. After more than four decades of family ownership, numerous members of the Mooney family decided to sell their stakes in the business and in 1991, President James Mooney started to seek buyers. OM Group Inc was established in 1993 as a result of the merger between the American company Mooney Chemicals, the Finnish firm Kokkola Chemicals Oy, and France’s Vasset SA. Initially named Outokumpu Metals Group when the merger went ahead in 1991, after which the company operated as a subsidiary of the Finnish firm, Kokkola spun off its 96 percent share in the company in 1993, leading to the establishment of the OM Group. Mooney continued to own a 4% share. In the mid-nineties, the firm’s geographical reach was dramatically expanded as a result of the merger and foreign sales increased by more than 50 percent. In 1994, the company invested $19.7 million in a physical plant, increasing its capacity to produce specialty chemicals. In 1995, OM Group and Dainippon Ink & Chemicals created a Japan-based joint venture. OM hoped that its cooperative enterprise would capture 15 percent of the $470 million Japanese market for cobalt-nickel inorganic compounds by the turn of the century. Later in the year, OM entered the chemical recycling industry through the acquisition of Hecla Mining Co.'s Apex mining division in Utah. Recent news On 10 August 2007, OM Group Incorporated acquired the electronics business of Rockwood Holdings Inc.. The Rockwood Electronics businesses consist of printed circuit board (PCB) chemicals, ultra pure chemicals (UPC) and photomasks. EaglePicher Technologies was sold to OM Group Inc. in 2010. In October 2014, OM Group acquired Ener-Tek International, a designer, developer and manufacturer of high-performance lithium-ion and silver-zinc cells and batteries for niche applications in defence and aerospace markets, for a fee of $24 million. As a result of dwindling sales as a result of the slowdown in industrial activity in Europe in the preceding two years, in June 2015 OM Group agreed to be privatized by Apollo Global Management who made an offer of around $1.03 billion in cash. On November 23, 2015, the company announced its name change to Vectra and said it was moving its headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri. ST. LOUIS, Jan. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Vectra Co.

He was born in Manchester, and was entirely self- taught. He was elected an Associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1833 and Member in 1843; and an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1851. The works he first exhibited at the Academy were portraits, but from 1840 onwards he contributed figure pictures, scenes from Shakespeare, scripture and sentimental subjects, many of which were engraved. In 1850 he led the opposition within the Academy to the innovations of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, having already criticised their work in the previous year.Jorge L. Contreras, Frank Stone and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood When Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote a very critical review of Stone's work in return, Stone launched an outright assault on Pre-Raphaelitism, initiating the controversy that engulfed the movement. Leading Pre-Raphaelite William Holman Hunt later depicted a print of one of Stone's works in the background of his painting The Awakening Conscience. It has been suggested that this was intended as an insult, since the furniture of the room was supposed to represent the bad taste of the characters depicted.Tate Gallery, The Pre-Raphaelites, 1984. According to William Powell Frith, Stone was a loyal friend, but very argumentative, \\"No fair-weather friend was he, but true as steel when friendly countenance might be sorely needed. Still, I confess there were drawbacks to the enjoyment of Stone's society. It was enough for anyone to advance an opinion for Stone to differ from it.\\"Mass, J, The Victorian Art World in Photographs, p. 53 He was the father of the painter Marcus Stone who illustrated many works by Charles Dickens (the Stones were Dickens' neighbours for many years) and himself produced a frontispiece for an edition of Martin Chuzzlewit.

Barsimson had been sent out by the Jewish leaders of Amsterdam, Dutch Republic to determine the possibilities of an extensive Jewish immigration to New Amsterdam. With the fall of Dutch Brazil, it was imperative for Jews planning to leave Europe to find other new homes. He arrived at that port on the ship Pear Tree on August 22, 1654, having left the Netherlands on July 8. Barsimson was succeeded by a party of 23 Jews, who arrived at New Amsterdam in September, from Recife, Brazil, and established the first Jewish settlement in what would become the United States. Jewish rights In 1658, Barsimson succeeded in securing from the Dutch municipal court in New Amsterdam a ruling which is surprising even in the light of latter-day principles of religious liberty. He was summoned to court as defendant on a Saturday, but the court decided, in the terse language of the record that \\"though defendant is absent, yet no default is entered against him, as he was summoned on his Sabbath.\\" Three years earlier, Barsimson and another early Jewish settler, Asser Levy (died 1680), joined in a petition to the governor and council of New Netherland to be permitted to stand guard like the other burghers, or to be relieved from the special tax imposed upon their nation in lieu thereof by resolution of governor and council, but their request was curtly refused with the remark that they might go elsewhere if they liked. Instead of following the latter advice, Barsimson and other early American Jews succeeded before long in obtaining instructions to Governor Peter Stuyvesant from his superiors, the Dutch West India Company of Holland, condemning such unjustified and illiberal discriminations.

The district population was 20,046 according to the 2010 census. Song is situated by the banks of the Katibas River, a tributary of the Rajang River. It is an important stopover for river traffic going up the Rajang River. Etymology The district was originally named by the Kayan people as long which means river stream. After the Kayan people was defeated by the Iban people, the Ibans decided to rename the place after an Iban warrior named Song who led them to victory against the Kayans. Another version of the origin of the name Song came from the legend of the Melanau people. There was once a Melanau widow named Song who came from Nangka village, Sibu. She went to the present day Song river mouth for agriculture. Her relatives would frequently visit her. When they ask her which place she would like to go, she would said \\"to Rumah Song \\" (her own home). Thus the area is called Song since then. History Song Sarawak (Borneo) in 1960s The Kayan people were the first group of settlers inhabited the Song District. At that time, the Kayans were the nomadic people. At the same time, the Iban people migrated from the present day Kalimantan, Indonesia and settled near the banks of the Katibas River (located in the Song District) in order to find land for farming. However, conflict between the Kayan and the Iban people soon grew into a war and the Iban people won. Accepting defeat, the Kayan people then migrated to Belaga District. The Malays and the Chinese first arrived in Song District in the 1800s. They built wooden shophouses with nipah rooves along the river banks and opened floating shops on the river. Initially, the barter system was used, but when Song was acquired by the Kingdom of Sarawak, a monetary system was introduced. The first three Malays to arrive in Song were Mr Haji Tahir, Haji Omar, and Haji Dollah. In 1870, the Brooke government built a fort at Nanga Song (mouth of Song river). The fort also functioned as the first administrative centre for Song and was intended to inhibit Iban uprisings at Katibas river. The Iban people opposed the introduction of the assessment tax by the Brooke government. Such uprisings lasted until the 1900s. In 1873, Sibu Division was established. Kapit and Song sub-district were included in the division at that time. In 1937, there were 10 Malay houses in Song. The Malay traders at Song were known as Abang (meaning \\"nobleman\\"). In the 1820s, they traded with the Ibans in Song in exchange for jungle produce. One of the well-known traders was Haji Ahmed bin Haji Omar. The Malays would sell the jungle produce in Sibau town (present-day Sibu) for a profit. Ships like \\"Ang Bee\\" from Singapore and \\"Kampar\\" from the Malay Peninsula would anchor in Sibu to carry the jungle produce back to their respective destinations for sale. In exchange, these ships brought daily necessities such as salt, sugar, salted fish, plates, bowls, pottery and clothes to trade with the natives. Meanwhile, the Iban people worked as farmers, rubber tappers and jungle produce collectors. The Ibans then sold their products at the Song bazaar in exchange for daily necessities. During the Japanese occupation, both Allied and Japanese bombings destroyed many of the buildings in the village. Many residents fled Song due to the war. The town became chaotic during the war and its people endured harsh Japanese administration. During this time, the Chinese started to build the first primary school in Song. After the war, the British colonial government gave Sarawak dollars to residents of Song to rebuild their homes. In 1948, the fort at Nanga Song was moved to Nanga Katibas (mouth of Katibas river). Thus, the administrative centre at Song river was effectively moved to Katibas river. The Chinese also restarted their businesses in Song after the war. During the British colonial era, the Sarawak Natives Affairs Department was established in 1955. Michael Sardin became the first native officer. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Song sub-district office was the operational centre to repel Indonesian military crossings of the Sarawak-Kalimantan border. After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, William Linang became the first Sarawak Administrative Officer (SAO) in Song. On 2 April 1973, Kapit was upgraded to division. At the same time, Song sub-district was upgraded into a district. In 1977, the administrative centre of Song was moved from the fort at Katibas river to the town centre. Government Song District Office governs an area of 38,934 km2. Geography and climate Song is one of three districts located within Kapit Division. The other two districts are: Kapit District and Belaga District. Rajang River is the main river crossing the Song District. Other rivers that cross the district are: Katibas river, Song river, Iran river, Manap river, Lajan river and Lijau river. These rivers are the main transportation routes for Song residents. 90% of the Song district is covered with uneven highlands, Alt URL Demographics In 2010, Song District had a population of 20,046. The Iban people accounted for 80% of the district population, followed by Chinese, Melanau people, Malay and Bidayuh. EconomyTransport Song is only accessible by express boats along the Rajang River. There are hourly express boat services connecting Song, Sibu, Kanowit, Kapit and Belaga.It is approximately 2 hours journey from Sibu and an hour from Kapit.The express boats services are provided frequently at Song Wharf Terminal. However,a plan to build roads connecting Song to Kapit and Song to Kanowit was promised by the Federal Government and was announced by the Prime Minister of Malaysia during his visit to the town on 15 April 2011.

It is estimated that more than 7000 different cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea, and most groups have their own language. Because of this diversity, in which they take pride, many different styles of cultural expression have emerged; each group has created its own expressive forms in art, dance, weaponry, costumes, singing, music, architecture and much more. To unify the nation, the language Tok Pisin, once called Neo-Melanesian (or Pidgin English) has evolved as the lingua franca — the medium through which diverse language groups are able to communicate with one another in Parliament, in the news media, and elsewhere. People typically live in villages or dispersed hamlets which rely on the subsistence farming of yams and taro. The principal livestock in traditional Papua New Guinea is the oceanic pig (Sus papuensis). Traditional cultures Fire Dancers of the Baining Tribe. Bioma figures are wood-carved figures from Papua, New Guinea that have human forms but represent the spirit of animals, particularly those of wild pigs killed in organized hunts. Artifact collected in 1960 and is on a display in the corridor of Hotel Hilton Waikoloa Village, Hawaii, USA. On the Sepik River, there is a world-renowned tradition of wood carving. These carvers create forms of plants or animals, because they believe these are their ancestor beings and because they feel they are beautiful. They also create traditional skull portraits. Also well represented in the collections of museums around the world is the Malagan art tradition of New Ireland. Even though sea shells are no longer the currency of Papua New Guinea - sea shells were abolished as currency in 1933 - this heritage is still present in local customs. In certain parts of the country a groom must bring a bride price to the wedding ceremony. In some cases this is paid in golden-edged clam shells. In other areas, a dowry is payable rather than bride price. These payments may take the form of shell money, food, pigs, cash, or other goods. In some parts of the New Guinea highlands, people engage in colorful local rituals that are called \\"sing-sings\\". They paint themselves and dress up with feathers, pearls and animal skins to represent birds, trees or mountain spirits. Sometimes an important event, such as a legendary battle, would be enacted at such a musical festival. MusicTraditional music= Christian missionaries disapproved of Papuan folk music throughout the colonial period of the country's history. Even after independence, the outside world knew little of the diverse peoples' traditional music genres. The first commercial release to see an international audience didn't occur until 1991 (see 1991 in music), when Mickey Hart's Voices of the Rainforest was released. After 1872, foreigners introduced Christian hymns, including Gregorian chanting. Peroveta anedia, ute and taibubu, all forms of Polynesian music, were also introduced in this period. The Gold Rush brought an influx of Australian miners who brought with them the mouth organ. Traditional celebrations, which include song, dance, feasting and gift-giving, are called singsings. Vibrant and colorful costumes adorn the dancers, while a leader and a chorus sing a staggered approach to the same song, producing a fugue-like effect. 1993 saw television spreading across the country, and American popular music continued to affect Papuan music given the diffusion of radio since WWII. Since 1953, singsings have become competitive in nature, with contests occurring in Port Moresby, Mt. Hagen and Goroka. 1949 saw the first Papuan to achieve international fame, Blasius To Una, begin his career. =Popular music= Radio broadcasting of western popular music began by the late 1930s. String bands became very popular by the early 1950s, and soon dominated the pop landscape. In the late 1960s, rock bands like the Kopikats had appeared in cities, while string bands like the Paramana Strangers had become well known internationally. This was followed by the importation of bamboo bands, a style of music from the Solomon Islands using bamboo tubes played by hitting them with sandals. It first arrived in the area of Madang in the mid-1970s, and soon spread throughout the country. By the end of the '70s, a local recording industry had appeared and artists like Sanguma and, later, George Telek, began mixing native and Western styles like rock music and jazz. Literature Ulli Beier, a lecturer in English Literature at the University of Papua New Guinea since 1967 was crucial in encouraging young writers and getting their work published. From 1969 to 1974 he was the editor of Kovave, a journal of New Guinea literature. He also published Papua Pocket Poets, and Pidgin Pocket Plays. Kovave ceased publication in 1974 but was replaced by the journal New Guinea Writing although this concentrated on folk tales. Natachee was the first Papuan poet to appear in print. The first autobiography was Albert Maori Kiki's Kiki in 1974. The first novel was Crocodile (1970) by Vincent Eri. Visual arts A male spirit dance mask from Kabriman Village, Blackwater River Basin, East Sepik Province, 1960-1973. In the collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis There is a rich and diverse tradition of visual art. In particular, Papua New Guinea is world-famous for carved wooden sculpture: masks, canoes, story-boards. Many of the best collections of these are held in overseas museums. Those identified as being in the first wave of contemporary art in Papua New Guinea are: Mathias Kauage OBE (1944–2003), Timothy Akis, Jakupa Ako and Joe Nalo, all from the tough urban area of Port Moresby. Kauage won Australia's Blake Prize for Religious Art, four of his works are in the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art, and he had a solo show in 2005 at the Horniman Museum, \\"Kauage's Visions: Art from Papua New Guinea\\". Other noted Papua New Guinean visual artists include Larry Santana, Martin Morububuna and Heso Kiwi. Sport Sports are hugely popular in Papua New Guinea, and its citizens participate in and watch a wide variety. Popular sports include various codes of football (rugby league, rugby union, Association Football, and Australian rules football), cricket, volleyball, softball, netball, and basketball. Other Olympic sports are also gaining popularity, such as boxing and weightlifting. Rugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea (especially in the highlands), which also unofficially holds the title as the national sport.The annual Australian State of Origin series matches are the most watched sporting event of the year. The West New Britain rugby league player, Marcus Bai, is a national celebrity, after he played for the National Rugby League with Melbourne Storm (he also played in the Super League competition). A new national competition started in 2005 called the SP Cup. Australian rules football was once the most popular sport in PNG until the 1970s. It is gaining popularity with the introduction of players at the top level into the AFL, including Mal Michael (Brisbane Lions) and James Gwilt (St Kilda Football Club/Essendon Football Club). PNG has the largest number of Australian rules footballers outside of Australia, and has one of the fastest growing junior development programs. The \\"Mosquitos\\", currently captained by Navu Maha, are the national team and were runners up in the Australian Football International Cup, in both 2003 (to Ireland) and 2005 (to New Zealand). Cricket has been traditionally popular in Papua New Guinea, where the British had the most influence. In the Trobriand Islands, cricket has become fused with the local culture, and a game played with stones instead of a ball and unlimited fielders has developed. It was introduced in 1903, by Methodist missionaries, and has become a beloved sport there. See also * Eharo mask ReferencesFurther reading * James Patrick Sinclair. The Arts of Papua New Guinea.

Mint workers revolt  Felicissimus was a rationalis, the chief of the state treasury. One of the responsibilities of the rationalis was to administer the imperial mints. The workers of the mint in Rome had been engaged in adulterating the coinage and Felicissimus was held responsible and executed. An uprising of the mint workers followed; it is reported that 7,000 soldiers were killed during this revolt (Aurelius Victor xxxv 6; Historia Augusta, Aurelianus, xxxviii 2-4), although it would not be surprising if this were an exaggeration. It is possible that this uprising was somehow connected with the senatorial and equestrian classes, as Aurelian executed several senators. The fact that the mint of Rome was inactive for a short time before the monetary reform of 274 could be a consequence of this revolt, and the poor quality of the coinage at the beginning of Aurelian's reign supports the suggestion that the workers at the mint were adulterating the coinage.

Early life Norman Macleod was born in Kirk Street, Campbeltown, to the Rev. Dr. Norman Macleod and Agnes Maxwell; his paternal grandfather, a minister of the parish of Morvern in Argyllshire, bore the same name. His father, at that time minister of Campbeltown, was himself an exceptional man. His entire life was closely bound to the Highlanders of Scotland, catering to their spiritual and intellectual needs. He was the author of an extensive literature described by Professor Blackie as the \\"great work of classical Gaelic prose....written in a dialogue form, enriched by the dramatic grace of Plato and the shrewd humour of Lucian\\", and played a major role in the creation of an educational infrastructure for the Highlands and Islands. He was an untiring supporter of the interests of the Highlanders, and his name was respected throughout the North and West of Scotland. In 1827, Macleod became a student at the University of Glasgow; in 1831, he went to Edinburgh to study divinity under Dr Thomas Chalmers. On 18 March 1838, he became parish minister at Loudoun, Ayrshire. Career At this time the troubles in the Scottish Church were already gathering to a head. Macleod, although he had no love for lay patronage, and wished the Church to be free to do its proper work, clung firmly to the idea of a national Established Church, and therefore remained in the Establishment when the Disruption of 1843 took place. He was one of those who took a middle course in the non-intrusion controversy, holding that the fitness of those who were presented to parishes should be judged by the presbyteries, the principle of Lord Aberdeens Bill. On the secession of 1843 he was offered many different parishes, and having finally settled at Dalkeith, devoted himself to parish work and to questions affecting the Church as a whole. He was largely instrumental in the work of strengthening the Church. In 1847 he became one of the founders of the Evangelical Alliance, and from 1849 edited the Christian Instructor. In 1851 he was called to the Barony church, Glasgow, in which city the rest of his days were passed. There the more liberal theology rapidly made way among a people who judged it more by its fruits than its arguments, and MacLeod won many adherents by his practical schemes for the social reform of the people. He instituted temperance refreshment rooms, a Congregational penny savings bank, and held services specially for the poor. Despite his relatively liberal stance on some issues, he was one of many clergy who preached against Verdi's La Traviata. In a sermon just after its 1857 Scottish premiere, Macleod argued that 'no woman could hear it without a blush' In 1860 Macleod was appointed editor of the new monthly magazine Good Words, illustrated by Arthur Hughes, Francis Arthur Fraser (1846–1924), John Leighton, James Mahoney (1810–1879), Francis S. Walker, Townley Green and others. Under his control the magazine, which was mainly of a religious character, became widely popular. His own literary work, nearly all of which originally appeared in its pages — sermons, stories, travels, poems — was only a by-product of a busy life. By far his best work was the spontaneous and delightful Reminiscences of a Highland Parish (1867). While Good Words made his name known, and helped the cause he had so deeply at heart, his relations with the queen and the royal family strengthened yet further his position in the country. Never since Principal Carstairs had any Scottish clergyman been on such terms with his sovereign. He authored \\"Eastward, Travels in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria\\", a record of a journey made in 1864, published in 1866, with photographs by James Graham. An abbreviated reprint by his daughter Ann Campbell Macleod was published in 1887 under the title \\"Half Hours in the Holy Land, Travels in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, With Numerous Illustrations\\". In 1865, Macleod risked an encounter with Scottish Sabbatarian ideas. The presbytery of Glasgow issued a pastoral letter on the subject of Sunday trains and other infringements of the Christian Sabbath. Macleod protested against the grounds on which its strictures were based. For a time, owing partly to a misleading report of his statement, he became the man in all Scotland most profoundly distrusted. But four years later the Church accorded him the highest honor in her power by choosing him as moderator of her general assembly. Late life Statue To Reverend Dr Norman Macleod, Cathedral Square, Glasgow In 1867, along with Dr Archibald Watson, Macleod was sent to India, to inquire into the state of the missions. He undertook the journey in spite of failing health, and seems never to have recovered from its effects. He returned resolved to devote the rest of his days to rousing the Church to her duty in the sphere of foreign missions, but his health was now broken, and his old energy flagged. He is buried at Campsie. His Glasgow church was named after him, the Macleod Parish Church; and the Macleod Missionary Institute was erected by the Barony church in Glasgow. Queen Victoria gave two memorial windows to Crathie church as a testimony of her admiration for his work. Artistic recognition Macleod was painted by Tavernor Knott around 1850. The portrait is held by the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland but is rarely displayed. Family In August 1851, he married, Catherine Ann, daughter of William Mackintosh of Geddes, and sister of John Mackintosh. His daughter, Ann Campbell Macleod (d.1921), married in 1888 Sir James Wilson, and published two books based on her letters to friends and family while they lived in India. His grandson, George MacLeod was to also become Moderator of the Church of Scotland, having founded the Iona Community.

Fur brigades were convoys of canoes and boats used to transport supplies, trading goods and furs in the North American fur trade industry. Much of it consisted of native fur trappers, most of whom were Metis, and fur traders who travelled between their home trading posts and a larger Hudson's Bay Company or Northwest Company post in order to supply the inland post with goods and supply the coastal post with furs. Travel was usually done on the rivers by canoe or, in certain prairie situations, by horse. For example, they might travel to Hudson Bay or James Bay from their inland home territories. This pattern was most prevalent during the early 19th century. Canoes were eventually replaced by York boats because they were more economically and physically efficient.Johnson, D., & Lower Fort Garry Volunteer Association. (n.d.). Inland armada : The York boats of the Hudson's Bay Company. Selkirk, MB: Lower Fort Garry Volunteer Association. Canoe Paul Kane's Encampment shows a canoe brigade camp on the Winnipeg River in June 1848 being visited by a group of Saulteaux Fur brigades began with the need to transport furs trapped during the winter to markets where the furs could be exchanged for European trade goods. They evolved from small brigades of canoes from native villages travelling to meet fur traders at pre- selected meeting places to traders going out in canoes to meet the trappers in their home territory with forts or posts being established along the way. One common fur brigade was by canoe, conducted by voyageurs or others. Downstream loads to locations such as York Factory on the Hudson Bay or to Montreal on the St. Lawrence River consisted mainly of furs. Upstream loads from York Factory and Montreal consisted of trading goods and the ammunition, traps and various other supplies needed for the next winters trapping season. These brigades were usually an annual event. These canoe routes became part of a complex transportation system during the North American fur trade. Supplies, trading goods and furs were carried between the various forts and posts along the fur trade routes and the furs would be shipped every year to the world markets.

A York boat in use in 1910 In the 1790s York boats were created in response to the transportation problems that canoes posed.Foster, John E. and William John Eccles. \\"Fur Trade in Canada\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, 01 November 2019, Historica Canada. https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fur-trade. Accessed 16 November 2019. Canoes were fragile, had a limited capacity, and required large crews. York boats were the more economical option as they were durable, had a large capacity, and did not require much manpower. This allowed the Hudson's Bay Company to transport people and goods across Canada efficiently. Hudson's Bay Company administrator George Simpson kept some canoes for personal journeys, and occasionally loaned them for travel, but York boats otherwise became the dominant mode of transportation. York boats were made by searching forests for suitable wood, floating the wood back to posts on waterways, and then sawing wood into keels, planks, stems, and gunnels.Pilon, J., Birch, J., & Rowan, S. (2004). SAWPITS AND YORK BOATS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY: ARCHAEOLOGY IN FORT SIMPSON HERITAGE PARK, FORT SIMPSON, N.W.T., CANADA. Revista De Arqueología Americana, (23), 95-138. Trading posts had specific areas set aside for York boat building. York boats were similar in structure to Orkney Isles fishing boats, likely because many of the men employed by the Hudson's Bay Company were Orkneymen. These boats most often travelled in brigades, transporting supplies and trading goods. By the 1820s the Hudson's Bay Company had several York boat brigades travelling distinct routes. Permanent trading posts had been built at strategic sites along the main brigade routes and as soon as the waterways were free of ice the fur brigades would carry trade goods and food supplies to replenish the various trading posts along their route and pick up the accumulation of furs caught during the winter season. They also carried mail and passengers. The boat brigades were mostly crewed by Métis as were almost all the men employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in western Canada at the time. The York boats from Red River of the Portage La Loche brigades in 1862 were crewed by French Métis with a few Swampy Cree and Chippewa Christians. In 1862 Father Émile Petitot quoted William J. Christie then the chief factor of Fort Edmonton as saying in French; \\"I am myself a Métis.\\" \\"We are almost all Métis in the Company. Among the chief factors there is not a single Englishman, and maybe not ten Scots with pure blood.\\" (translation) The crews of some of these fur brigades had nicknames, some derived from their dietary habits. The Red River \\"tripmen\\" were called the Taureaux. A \\"Taureau\\" is a bag of pemmican weighing about 90 pounds. The Portage La Loche brigade's tripmen were called the Poissons-blancs (whitefish) and the Saskatchewan River brigade based in Fort Edmonton the Blaireaux (badgers). Les Cygnes (the swans) were from the Swan River district based in Fort Pelly, Les Rabasca (Athabascans) from the Athabasca district based in Fort Chipewyan and Les Gens de la Grande Riviere (men of the great river) from the Mackenzie River district based in Fort Simpson. The brigades were intensely rivalrous and would frequently stage fistfights between their \\"champions\\" to defend the brigade's honour. The challenger would strut about adorned with feathers in his cap bragging about his prowess (chantant le coq).

Prior to the widespread use of electric motors small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute power from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex. The central power source could be a water wheel, turbine, windmill, animal power or a steam engine. Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of belts, pulleys and gears known as millwork. Operation Variable speed belt drive for a lathe. The fixed pulley on the upper shaft is driven at constant speed by a belt from the power source. The loose pulley ('idler') allows the machine to be stopped in isolation – necessary for changing speed. The stepped pulleys (left) provide three drive speeds for the machine tool (not shown), depending on which pair of pulleys is connected by the belt. From turbine to line shaft at Suffolk Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts From line shaft to power looms at Boott Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts A typical line shaft would be suspended from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area. One pulley on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building. The other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts. In manufacturing where there were a large number of machines performing the same tasks, the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated. In other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements, the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes. Shafts were usually horizontal and overhead but occasionally were vertical and could be underground. Shafts were usually rigid steel, made up of several parts bolted together at flanges. The shafts were suspended by hangers with bearings at certain intervals of length. The distance depended on the weight of the shaft and the number of pulleys. The shafts had to be kept aligned or the stress would overheat the bearings and could break the shaft. The bearings were usually friction type and had to be kept lubricated. Pulley lubricator employees were required in order to ensure that the bearings did not freeze or malfunction. In the earliest applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating mostly from the 18th century. Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning to keep them in good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction. Pulleys were constructed of wood, iron, steel or a combination thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example, a 40\\" pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20\\" pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached (\\"fast\\") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely (\\"loose\\") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys could be used to give a variety of speed settings for the machine. Occasionally gears were used between shafts to change speed rather than belts and different sized pulleys, but this seems to have been relatively uncommon. History Early versions of line shafts date back into the 18th century, but they were in widespread use in the late 19th century with industrialization. Line shafts were widely used in manufacturing, woodworking shops, machine shops, saw mills and grist mills. In 1828 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Paul Moody substituted leather belting for metal gearing to transfer power from the main shaft running from a water wheel. This innovation quickly spread in the U.S. Flat belt drive systems became popular in the UK from the 1870s, with the firms of J & E Wood and W & J Galloway & Sons prominent in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. The use of flat belts was already common in the US but rare in Britain until this time. The advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, and it was a more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.Hills pp.208-210. Near the end of the 19th century some factories had a mile or more of line shafts in a single building. In order to provide power for small shops and light industry, specially constructed \\"power buildings\\" were constructed. Power buildings used a central steam engine and distributed power through line shafts to all the leased rooms. Power buildings continued to be built in the early days of electrification, still using line shafts but driven by an electric motor. As some factories grew too large and complex to be powered by a single steam engine, a system of \\"sub divided\\" power came into use. This was also important when a wide range of speed control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron. Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed. However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones. The Baldwin Locomotive Works 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to group drive with several large steam engines driving the line shafts. Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space. Printing presses in 1870 With factory electrification in the early 1900s, many line shafts began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive line shafting and millwork. After 1900 smaller industrial motors became available and most new installations used individual electric drives. Steam turbine powered line shafts were commonly used to drive paper machines for speed control reasons until economical methods for precision electric motor speed control became available in the 1980s; since then many have been replaced with sectional electric drives. (Article has photo of line shaft and turbine.) Economical variable speed control using electric motors was made possible by silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) to produce direct current and variable frequency drives using inverters to change DC back to AC at the frequency required for the desired speed. Most systems were out of service by the mid-20th century and relatively few remain in the 21st century, even fewer in their original location and configuration. Disadvantages and alternativesDisadvantages= Compared to individual electric motor or unit drive, line shafts have the following disadvantages: *Power loss with line shafts varied widely and was typically 25% and often much higher; however, using roller bearings and good quality lubrication could minimize losses. Roller and spherical bearings gained acceptance in the decade before electrification of factories began. *Continuous noise *Maintenance costs were higher. *The systems were more dangerous. *Down time due to mechanical problems was higher. *It was not as easy to change speed. *Factory layout was designed around access to the line shafts, not in the most efficient manner for the work flow. *The line shafts and millwork took up a lot of space; Baldwin Locomotive Works estimated 40% more than electric drive. *The shafts and belting were in the way of lighting, overhead cranes and ventilation ducts. *Alignment of the system was critical and problematic for long shafts that were subject to expansion and contraction, settling and vibration. *The belting shed dust and kept it continuously circulating in the air. *Oil dripped from the overhead shafting. Firms switching to electric power showed significantly less employee sick time, and, using the same equipment, showed significant increases in production. > “We can scarcely step into a shop or factory of any description without > encountering a mass of belts which seem at first to monopolize every nook in > the building and leave little or no room for anything else”. =Historical alternatives to line shafts= To overcome the distance and friction limitations of line shafts, wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than line shafts and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers. They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than line shafts, and had one-tenth the initial cost. To supply small scale power that was impractical for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed. Hydraulic power was used to operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe. The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in Bessemer steel production There were also some central stations providing pneumatic power in the late 19th century.

It is the personal monastery of the 14th Dalai Lama. Another name for this temple-complex is Namgyal Tantric College. This monastery's key role is to assist with rituals involving the Dalai Lama of Tibet. Its main tantric practices reportedly include those of Kalachakra, Yamantaka, Chakrasamvara, Guhyasamaja, and Vajrakilaya. Early years Founded in either 1564 or 1565 as Phende Lekshe Ling (on the foundations of the since defunct monastery called Phende Gon) by the 3rd Dalai Lama, Third Dalai Lama Gendun Gyatso, Namgyal Monastery was renamed in honour of the female long-life deity Namgyälma in 1571. Since the completion of construction on the Potala Palace (begun by the Fifth Dalai Lama), Namgyal was traditionally housed in the red section at the top of that building in Lhasa. Since 1959 Following the Tibetan uprising of 1959, Namgyal Monastery relocated to Dharamshala, India, where it continues, active, to this day. According to Namgyal's website, Namgyal (Dharamshala) has \\"nearly 200\\" monks (up from 55 in 1959), representing all four main Tibetan monastic lineages. In 1992, on the advice of the present Dalai Lama, Namgyal established an American branch in Ithaca, New York, including within it the Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies. On 8 February 1996, the monks of Namgyal Monastery's Institute of Buddhist Studies offered their first \\"Blessing of Cyberspace\\" as part of the \\"Twenty-four Hours in Cyberspace\\" event. In 1998, Namgyal incorporated a Tibetan monastery in Bodhgaya, India, called Gendhen Phelgyeling. That monastery is now known as Namgyal (Bodhgaya), and has 45 monks. Namgyal (Dharamsala) also manages a temple in Kushinagar (since 1967), and an elderly home in Simla (since 1992). Whether the People's Republic of China has maintained an institution with the same name inside Tibet is unclear.

Biography Born in Hungary, Zerffi was educated in Budapest. He became a journalist at the age of eighteen. He was the author of Wiener Lichtbilder und Schattenspiele, with twelve caricatures (Vienna, 1848); and as editor of the liberal Der Ungar (Reform) in 1848, he became conspicuous by his attacks upon the Germans and the imperial family. With Csernatoni, Stancsits, Zanetti, Steinitz, and others he set the tone for the revolutionists, and in 1848 he was Schweichel's captain and adjutant in the Honvéd army. He also acted for a time as Kossuth's private secretary. On the failure of the revolution he fled to Belgrade (1849) where he entered the service of the French consul. By this time, however, he had become a member of the Austrian secret service, reporting on Hungarian émigré activities (and even other groups of revolutionary exiles) for the Habsburg Ministry of the Interior until 1865. In 1850 he translated Kossuth's complete works into German for the Europäische Bibliothek der Neuen Belletristischen Litteratur (cccxxii., cccxlvii., cccxlix.), and two years later he visited Paris, going in 1853 to London, where he became a member of the Royal Medical College, and afterward secretary of the German National Association. He resigned this post under suspicion, however, although he remained in London. He published an English version of Goethe's Faust with critical and explanatory notes (1859). He became a citizen of Great Britain. In 1868 he was appointed a lecturer at the National Art Training School in South Kensington. Throughout his career Zerffi gave much attention to the subjects of decoration and history, and wrote many works treating these themes in a comprehensive manner. He asserted that history should be studied as a whole on philosophical principles. He published the popular Manual of the Historical Development of Art (1876), and later more general historical works (The Science of History, 1879; Studies in the Science of General History, 1887-9; and Evolution in History, Language and Science) which were modelled on Hegel, Gobineau and Taine. According to Joseph McCabe, he gave \\"agnostic and strongly worded\\" Rationalist lectures to the London Sunday Lecture Society: his published efforts in this direction included Natural Phenomena and their Influence on Different Religious Systems (1873); Dogma and Science (1876); and The Spontaneous Dissolution of Ancient Creeds (1876).

Early life  Vámbéry was born as Hermann Wamberger in Szent-György, Kingdom of Hungary (now Svätý Jur, Slovakia), into a poor Jewish family. According to Ernst Pawel, a biographer of Theodor Herzl, as well as Tom Reiss, a biographer of Kurban Said, Vámbéry's original last name was Wamberger rather than Bamberger. He was raised Jewish, but later became an atheist. Vámbéry was 1 year old when his father died and the family moved to Dunaszerdahely (now Dunajská Streda in Slovakia). He attended the local school until the age of 12 and showed a remarkable aptitude for learning languages. He was forced to walk with crutches because of a congenital disorder and eventually had to leave school due to difficult financial circumstances. He worked briefly as a tailor's assistant, but after becoming tutor to the son of the village innkeeper, he was enabled by his friends to enter the \\"Untergymnasium\\" of Szentgyörgy. By the age of sixteen, he had a good knowledge of Hungarian, Hebrew, Latin, French, and German. He was also rapidly acquiring English, the Scandinavian languages, Russian, Serbian, and naturally other Slavic languages. In 1846, he went to Pressburg (today Bratislava, Hungarian: Pozsony), where he remained three years. Later he studied at Vienna, Kecskemét, and Budapest.  Travels  Map of the travel of Ármin Vámbery in Central Asia Vámbéry was especially attracted by the literature and culture of the Ottoman Empire including Turkey. By the age of twenty, Vámbéry had learned enough Ottoman Turkish to enable him to go, through the assistance of Baron Joseph Eötvös, to Istanbul and establish himself as a private tutor of European languages. He became a tutor in the house of Huseyin Daim Pasha, and, under the influence of his friend and instructor, Ahmet Efendi, became a full Osmanli, serving as secretary to Fuat Pasha. About this time he was elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in recognition of his translations of Ottoman historians. After spending about a year in Constantinople, he published a German-Turkish dictionary in 1858. Later, he also published various other linguistic works. He also learned some twenty other Turkish languages and dialects. Returning to Budapest in 1861, he received a stipend of a thousand florins from the academy, and in the autumn of the same year, disguised as a Sunni dervish, and under the name of Reshit Efendi, he set out from Constantinople. His route lay from Trebizond on the Black Sea to Tehran in Persia, where he joined a band of pilgrims returning from Mecca, spending several months with them traveling across Central Iran (Tabriz, Zanjan, and Kazvin). He then went to Shiraz, through Ispahan, and in June, 1863, he reached Khorezm (Central Asia). Throughout this time, he succeeded in maintaining his disguise as \\"Reshit Efendi,\\" so that upon his arrival at the Khanate of Khiva he managed to keep up appearances during interviews with Khan Sayyid Muhammad. Together with his band of travelers, he then crossed Bokhara and arrived at Samarkand. Initially, he aroused the suspicions of the local ruler, who kept him in an audience for a full half-hour. Vámbéry managed to maintain his pretences, and left the audience laden with gifts. Upon leaving Samarkand, Vámbéry began making his way back to Constantinople, traveling by way of Herat. There he took leave of the band of dervishes and joined a caravan to Tehran, and from there, via Trebizond and Erzurum, to Constantinople, arriving there in March 1864. Portrait of Arminius Vámbéry, by Mihály Kovács, 1861. Ármin Vámbéry This was the first successful journey of its kind undertaken by a European; and since it was necessary to avoid suspicion, Vámbéry could not take even fragmentary notes, except by stealth. After a long and perilous journey he arrived back at Pest in May 1864. He went to London to arrange the English language publication of his book about the travels. \\"Travels in Central Asia\\" and its Hungarian counterpart \\"Közép-ázsiai utazás\\" were published in 1865. Thanks to his travels Vámbéry became an internationally renowned writer and celebrity. He became acquainted with members of British social elite. The Ambassador of Austria in London gave him a letter of recommendation to the Emperor, who received him in an audience and rewarded Vámbéry's international success by granting him professorship in the Royal University of Pest.Vámbéry Ármin: Küzdelmeim. 1905.http://mek.oszk.hu/03900/03975/03975.pdf Vámbéry became known also as a publicist, zealously defending British policy in the East as against that of the Russians. He was widely celebrated at his 70th birthday in March 1902, receiving greetings from academic institutions all over Europe. The British King Edward VII appointed him an Honorary Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, his house order, followed by a letter where Vámbéry was appreciated as \\"so good and constant a friend to England\\". In 2005 the National Archives at Kew, Surrey, made files accessible to the public, and it was revealed that Vámbéry had been employed by the British Foreign Office as an agent and spy whose task it was to combat Russian attempts at gaining ground in Central Asia and threatening the British position on the Indian sub- continent. He advocated the theory of close Turkic-Hungarian linguistic and ethnic relationship, and his publications on the subjectVÁMBÉRY Ármin: Magyar és török-tatár szóegyezések. In: Nyelvtudományi közlemények VIII. 109-189. o.1869. http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/008.pdfVÁMBÉRY Ármin: A magyarok eredete. 1882. http://real-eod.mtak.hu/1197/1/amagyarokeredet00vmgoog.pdfVÁMBÉRY Ármin: A magyarság keletkezése és gyarapodása. 1895. http://mek.oszk.hu/03000/03032/03032.pdfVÁMBÉRY Ármin: A magyarság bölcsőjénél. 1914. http://mek.oszk.hu/06900/06996/06996.pdf provoked a harsh scientific and public debate in Hungary, remembered as the \\"Ugric-Turk War\\". Vámbéry argued that the large number of similarities between Turkic languages and Hungarian pointed to a shared origin of these languages and peoples in Northern Asia. His strongest evidences were the large corpus of ancient Turkish words in Hungarian word-stock (300-400 for a minimum, and even more with good alternative Turkic etymologies),RÓNA-TAS, András and BERTA, Árpád: West Old Turkic. Turkic Loanwords in Hungarian. 2011. and the strong typological similarity of Hungarian and Turkic languages. In his opinion Hungarian is a contact language, more precisely a mixed language, and a fruit of the intermingling of early Hungarians with Turkic peoples; as a result of this merger, the Hungarian language got a unique, distinctly dual (Ugric AND Turkic) character. (The intriguing problem of Turkic-Hungarian language relationsSÁNDOR Klára: A magyar-török kétnyelvűség és ami mögötte van. http://web.unideb.hu/~tkis/sl/sk_tm.RÓNA-TAS András: Morphological embedding of Turkic verbal bases in Hungarian.

In: ROBBEETS, Martine Irma & BISANG, Walter eds.: Paradigm change: In the Transeurasian languages and beyond. 2014. p. 129-139 is far from settled even after centuries of research.) Vámbéry was not the first to suggest such mixed origin; the German linguist and Orientalist Wilhelm Schott (1802-1889) was a proponent of Finn-Turk-Hungarian kinship, and considered the Hungarians (and their language) a mixture of Turkic and Hyperborean / i.e. Saami, Samoyed etc. / elements.\\" Die Stammväter der Magyaren in Ungarn waren, wie die Geschichte leise andeutet und der Ur-Kern ihrer Sprache zu bestätigen scheint, ein Gemisch von Türken und Hyperboreern. Ihre häufigen Wanderungen hatten noch fernere Amalgamation mit Indo-Germanischen Völkern zu Folge, und so entwickelte sich der heutige Ungar, aus mancherlei Völker-Elementen eben so geläutert und männlich schön hervorgegangen, wie sein heutiger Nachbar und Ur- Verwandter, der Osmane. \\" SCHOTT, Wilhelm: Versuch über die Tatarischen Sprachen. 1836. p.7. Nonetheless, Vámbéry's theory was opposed by proponents of the Finno-Ugric theory of the origins of Hungarian, who gradually triumphed in Hungary but not in Turkey. In Turkey, Hungarian and Turkish are still considered as two branches of the same language family, the Ural–Altaic. Vámbéry was acquainted with Bram Stoker, during a stay in London, and Stoker claimed him as his consultant, and inspirator of main antagonist character Dracula and, of course, the book's title. The character of Professor Van Helsing in Stoker's novel, Dracula, is sometimes said to be based on Vámbéry, though Stoker was likely inspired by Sheridan Le Fanu's Dr. Hesselius.Top 10 Famous Mysterious Monsters In the novel (chapters 18 and 23) Van Helsing refers to his \\"friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University\\". His son, Rusztem Vambery, briefly served as Hungary's ambassador to the United States after World War II.

As of 2010, Kanowit's population is 28,985. It is built on the mouth of Kanowit River at the bank of Rajang River, approximately 174 kilometers from the coast of South China Sea. It takes 45 minutes to reach the town by land transport and an hour by boat from Sibu. The main ethnic groups are Iban, Chinese, Malay, and Melanau. The town takes its name from the Kanowit, a Melanau ethnic group called Rajang by the Ibans. (ISO 639-3: kxn). The language is still spoken by the Kanowit people living in the area. The village where Kanowit people live is known as Kampung Bedil, a short trip by boat up the Rajang River from Kanowit town. Etymology The name \\"Kanowit\\" is derived from the name of the earliest ethnic group settling along the Kanowit river. The ethnic group adopted similar culture as the Melanau ethnic group. Therefore, they are often called as the \\"Melanau of Kanowit\\". Their languages is classified as the languages related to the people from Oya, Mukah, and Matu District. They had their own social rankings: aristocrats, middle class, and slaves. Their houses were 40 foot tall, although such houses no longer exists today. They were well known of their basketry which were sold in the Kanowit Bazaar (market).Richard C, 2010. Pages 47, 48 History In 1846, Phlegethon ship commanded by Captain Rodney Mundy and James Brooke sail up the Rajang River to combat Dayak piracy that frequently threatened the borders of Sarawak (Kuching area). On 29 June, Rodney and James arrived at Kanowit and their first contact with the \\"Kanowit\\" people there was peaceful. In 1851, Fort Emma was built by the Brookes although Kanowit was still under the control of Bruneian empire. The fort was named after the sister of James Brooke, Emma Brooke. Emma Brooke was also the mother of the second Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Anthony Brooke.Richard C, 2010. Page 21, 46, 47 In 1853, James Brooke was able to take over Rajang River and its surrounding settlements from the Brunei Sultanate. Fort Emma offered protection against Dayak piracy along the Rajang river. Therefore, Hokkien Chinese from Singapore and Fujian province of China came to settle in Kanowit during the 1870s, while Sibu was still a small Malay village at that time. Chinese traders from Singapore brought clothes, jars, salt, and other daily necessities in exchange for rattan, hides of wild cattle, camphor, rhinoceros horns, and monkeys gall stones. The Cantonese people later arrived in the 1880s. They were involved in timber exports.Richard C, 2010. Page 53 The Foochow people arrived here from Sibu in 1910.Richard C, 2010.

The church was demolished in 1967 to pave the way for new modern building construction.Richard C, 2010. Page 125, 126 Later a mission hospital and a primary school was built.

In 1951, as the Korean war broke out, the Kanowit bazaar was overflowing with rubber sheets due to rise in rubber prices. However, on 8 November 1951, the bazaar was burnt to the ground due to a large fire.Richard C, 2010. Page 129 Construction of the shophouses were restarted from 1952 to 1953. However, several owners were unable to pay the mortgages owed to Chartered Bank in Sibu due to low collapsing rubber prices.Richard C, 2010.

Page 155 Geography and climate Confluence between the Rajang and the Kanowit river. Kanowit is located at miles from the sea, near the Rajang River. Although the Rajang river is flowing from east to west in its general course of direction, the river is flowing from south to north in Kanowit, with the Kanowit river entering Rajang from south to north direction. The part of Rajang river near Kanowit is wide. The town of Kanowit is located in the north-south direction.Richard C, 2010. Page 5 The area around Kanowit contains mostly tertiary stage of Paleozoic rocks such as sandstones, greywicks, siltstone, shales, and slate. During the Peneplanation and Jerudong cycles, the erosions of the hills in the central Rajang basin has reduced their elevations to 200 to 300 feet, when compared to 3,000 to 5,000 feet mountains located near the Sarawak-Kalimantan border. The river banks at Kanowit are below sea level; therefore, Kanowit is subject to frequent flooding during periods of monsoon seasons.Richard C, 2010. Page 8,9 There are three types of soils in the Kanowit area: acid yellow soils found in the mountainous areas, podsols derived from sandy material at the moderately high terrains, and alluvial deposits at the flood plain areas.Richard C, 2010.

Page 40 It increased by 13% to 1,720 in August 1970, where 72.7% of them were Chinese and 18.1% were the Malays. Among the Chinese, Hokkien accounted for 48.8% of the population, followed by Cantonese (21.4%), and Foochow (20.1%).Richard C, 2010. Page 28 The Iban people made up 6.5% of the population in the Kanowit bazaar. Outside the Kanowit bazaar, the Iban people were the majority. Some Malay families may raise or adopt children from other races. Therefore, names such as \\"Abdul Chen\\" and \\"Aminah Lim\\" may appear.Richard C, 2010. Page 60, 61 All the ethnic groups in the Kanowit Bazaar only started arriving in the last 200 years. The \\"Kanowit\\" ethnic group, where the town is named after them, is known to be the earliest inhabitants along the Kanowit river. Few of the \\"Kanowit\\" people still staying in Kampung Bedil today.Richard C, 2010. Page 45 The Kampung Bedil has about 40 houses with a population of 200 in the year 2015. =Languages= In the 1970s, there were seven widely spoken languages in Kanowit: English, Malay, Iban, Mandarin, Hokkien, Foochow and Cantonese. About 30% of the population at that time speak English. 90% of the population in Kanowit can speak Iban, including 70 to 80% of the Chinese. Meanwhile, 18% of the Kanowit people spoke Malay.Richard C, 2010. Page 42,43 Hokkien was the most widely spoken Chinese dialect in Kanowit during the 1970s. At that time, 48.8% of the Chinese spoke Hokkien, 40 to 50% of the Chinese spoke Foochow, and 90% of the Chinese spoke Mandarin. Most of the Kanowit population was able to converse in more than one languages.Richard C, 2010. Page 44 =Religions= In the 1970s, 21% of the Kanowit bazaar population was Christians while 19% of the population was muslims. Meanwhile, 60% of the population was devoted to other religions.Richard C, 2010. Page 173 Economy Kanowit acts as a middleman of trade between the town of Sibu and people from the interior of the Rajang River. Kanowit exports rural agricultural producta to the outside world. At the same time, manufactured goods from the outside world are imported for daily use by the Kanowit residents.Richard C, 2010. Page xi Among the items available for trade in the Kanowit bazaar are: hill rice, vegetables, chicken, pigs, fish, and fresh- water shrimp. Rubber and pepper are also cultivated in Kanowit.Richard C, 2010. Page 15 Kanowit also produces rubber and black pepper.Richard C, 2010. Pages 72 to 76 Before 1970s, Kanowit acted as a transshipment centre for timbers coming from the Rajang upriver. After the freeze of new timber licenses in the 1970s, the effect of timber on the local economy has been reducing.Richard C, 2010. Page 14 Majority of the businesses in Kanowit were retail grocery busiesses. Other business were: tailors,Richard C, 2010. Page 97 coffeshops,Richard C, 2010.

Culture and leisure Stalls during the Kanowit festival in 2018. =Attractions and recreational spots= The town center consists of three streets of 1930s vintage Chinese shophouses, near the waterfront. A few new shophouses have been built. Kanowit have a dry and wet market, offering local vegetables, meats and handicrafts. The market opens everyday from 7am till 12 noon. The biggest supermarket is Hock Tong Seng. During periods of celebration, the local karaoke can often be heard from far away with the pounding basslines of trashy 80's hits in English, Malay and Chinese. The best sight seeing can be had by walking along the riverside from town or up the Telecom Hill or Bukit Memaluh Hill.

While still a student he attracted much attention by his papers on political economy in the scientific journals of Hungary, and he also edited the Vasút. He became widely known as a pleader in 1890, when he successfully defended the editor of the Zasztava, the leader of the radical wing of the Serbians in Hungary, in a trial for political murder. As a mark of gratitude, the people of Neusatz, being Serbian sympathizers, elected Visontai in 1892 to the Hungarian Parliament as a supporter of Kossuth; and since 1899 he represented his native town, Gyöngyös, in Parliament. He was an eminent authority on criminal law and a member of the board of examiners for admission to the bar; and he prepared a large portion of the preliminary drafts for the criminal code.

He was educated at the gymnasium of his native town, and studied philosophy, literature, and languages at Budapest. In his early youth he was a poet, and in the 1870s his lyrical productions were accepted by the best literary periodicals, while two volumes of his verses were published at Budapest in 1880 under the titles A Bánat Dalaiból and Traviata, Dalok Egy Tévedt Nőhöz. Since 1877 he devoted himself to journalism, advocating liberal views. He was for some time editor of the Budapester Tagblatt, and contributed leaders and stories to the Pester Lloyd. In 1894 he became editor-in-chief of the Pesti Napló, and in 1896 he founded the Budapesti Napló. Vészi was president of the journalistic club of Budapest, and vice-president of the picture salon and of the club of amateur musicians in that city. He was also master of the masonic lodge \\"Reform.\\" In 1899 he was elected to the Hungarian Parliament from the district of Szászsebes (Sebeş); and in 1901, from the third district of the capital. He took an active interest in all Jewish affairs. The most enduring feat of his career, however, was his discovery of new talent. He brought the poet Endre Ady to Budapest and secured both a livelihood and the possibility of publication for him; it was to Vészi’s daughter, Margit — later the wife of Ferenc Molnár — that Ady wrote the poem cycle Margitta élni aka (Margitta Wants to Live; 1912); Vészi’s other daughter was married to the writer Lajos Bíró.

Small scale artisan soap makers find \\"melt and pour\\" production useful when trying out new product lines. The process differs from the cold process or hot process in utilising a pre-manufactured solid soap base which has already undergone saponification, so the soap maker does not need to handle caustic alkali, i.e. lye. Method A commercially acquired \\"melt and pour\\" soap base is melted in a pan or commercial melting vessel, using direct heat, or in a water jacket melting pot, (large double boiler or \\"bain marie\\"), and re- solidifies as it cools. Domestically, a microwave oven can be used for melting small quantities of the base. Additions can be added at the still-hot liquid stage, such as fragrance, fragrant essential oils, moisturizing agents, colorants, or exfoliating agents, e.g. poppy seeds, coffee grounds or pumice, along with coloured micas, metallic glitter, honey and flower heads. The liquified concoction can be poured into individual molds, tray molds, or blocks. Molds are made of metal or, more commonly, from reinforced silicone rubber, allowing artisans to make their own molds using a two-part mold kit. Upon cooling, the soap can be removed from the molds as individual soaps, or as blocks for slicing into bars. Layers of different colors, or transparent layers, can be built up, or pre-cast embeddable soap shapes, called embeds, can be set into the soap during moulding to produce novel patterns. Melt and pour bases can be transparent or opaque, and are sometimes enriched with products like goat's milk or shea butter to add value. The small-scale process lends itself to bespoke manufacture; a single soap bar can be individually manufactured if desired. Other considerations Some soapmakers prefer \\"melt and pour\\" because the process is simple and safe, allowing the soapmaker to concentrate more on the aesthetic aspects of soap making. Because it avoids the need to handle lye, a hazardous and very caustic chemical, it is a hobby even children can enjoy under adult supervision. Unlike cold-processed soap, which requires a period of \\"curing\\" to allow saponification to complete and excess water to evaporate, the \\"melt and pour\\" process is completed once the base has cooled and hardened. The meltable base is usually naturally rich in glycerine, a by-product of saponification which has humectant and emollient properties, whereas commercial soap bars have often had this component removed. As with the rebatching method, it can be considered a misnomer to refer to the melt and pour process as soap making. The process has much in common with candle making using meltable wax which, using a similar process, can be scented, dyed and shaped on a small or large scale of production. Other processes used by soapers are cold process, hot process and rebatching.

Publication history Secret Origins was first published as a one-shot in 1961 and contained only reprinted material. The title became an ongoing reprint series in February-March 1973 which ran for seven issues and ended in October–November 1974. The title was used on various compilations of origin stories, including Limited Collectors' Edition #C-39: Secret Origins Super-Villains (October–November 1975) and #C-45: More Secret Origins Super- Villains (June–July 1976) as well as DC Special Series #10 (1978) and #19 (Fall 1979). Its most well-known incarnation was a 50-issue series that ran from April 1986 to August 1990, plus three Annuals and one Special. Typically, an issue would clarify the Post-Crisis origins of a number of characters, usually two as most of the issues were double-sized, i.e. 48 pages. Roy Thomas was the initial writer/editorial consultant on the series; later issues were overseen by Mark Waid. Two more specials followed in 1998 and 1999. and In 2004, it returned to the all-reprint format with a Weird Secret Origins special featuring Doctor Fate, the Spectre, Animal Man, the Enchantress, Metamorpho, Congorilla, El Diablo, and the Bizarro World. A new monthly incarnation focusing on characters in The New 52, launched in April 2014 with a June 2014 cover date. The first issue featured the origins of Superman, Supergirl and the Dick Grayson version of Robin. Archive requires scrolldown This series was cancelled as of issue #11 (May 2015) on sale in March 2015. Characters featured in the 1986–1990 series * #1 (April 1986): The Golden Age Superman; this was intended as a tribute to the original version of the character, as the latter-day version of Superman was being concurrently introduced by John Byrne in the Man Of Steel miniseries; art by Golden Age Superman artist Wayne Boring and Jerry Ordway. * #2 (May 1986): The Blue Beetle, both the Dan Garrett and Ted Kord versions; art by Gil Kane. * #3 (June 1986): Captain Marvel credited by the Shazam! title; a retelling of the story from WHIZ Comics #2, albeit updated to modern day. Much of this was changed in the Legends crossover, Thomas himself would retcon this some months later in SHAZAM! The New Beginning, and all of which was changed again by Jerry Ordway in his graphic novel The Power of Shazam!. * #4 (July 1986): Firestorm (Ronnie Raymond). * #5 (August 1986): the original Crimson Avenger; art by Gene Colan. * #6 (September 1986): Halo of the Outsiders; the Golden Age Batman.

This was a Legends tie-in that related four possible origins for the character; one by Mike Barr and Jim Aparo was a variation on the Wandering Jew myth, while another by Alan Moore and Joe Orlando postulated that the Stranger was a fallen angel. * #11 (February 1987): the Golden Age Hawkman; Power Girl. Both stories presented have since been retconned, with Power Girl's backstory having been redefined by Geoff Johns in the pages of JSA Classified, which served as part of the buildup to Infinite Crisis. * #12 (March 1987): The Challengers of the Unknown; Fury. * #13 (April 1987): Nightwing (art by Erik Larsen); Johnny Thunder and his Thunderbolt; the Whip. * #14 (May 1987): Suicide Squad.

A full-length story, and Roy Thomas' last contribution to the series, excluding the Grim Ghost story in #42. * #32 (November 1988): The Justice League of America. In a full-length story by Keith Giffen and Peter David, the Justice League is formed by Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), the Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman, the Martian Manhunter and the Black Canary.

This consisted of a prose retelling of Dick Grayson's first encounter with Batman by Dennis O'Neil and George Pérez; the first meeting of the Golden and Silver Age Flashes story by Grant Morrison; how Johnny Thunder (the western hero) came to be; the definitive history of the Black Canary; and the stories behind the Dolphin and the Space Museum. =Annuals and Specials= * Annual #1 (1987): the Doom Patrol art by John Byrne; Captain Comet. * Annual #2 (1988): The second and third Flashes (Barry Allen and Wally West). * Annual #3 (1989): the Teen Titans. This was an anniversary tribute with contributions from George Pérez, Tom Grummett, Irv Novick, Dave Cockrum, Kevin Maguire and Colleen Doran.

Additionally, there was a belated Secret Origins 80-Page Giant issued in 1998 (), that focused on the members of Young Justice. Collected edition Some issues of the second series were collected in a trade paperback along with other material and some original work in 1989 called Secret Origins, but the official title, as stated in the book's indicia, is given as Secret Origins of The World's Greatest Super-Heroes ().

Vázsonyi was born at Sümeg. He was educated at Budapest, where his remarkable eloquence made him the leader of all student movements during his university career. After he had completed his studies, the most vital social questions found in him an earnest investigator. He aroused a national sentiment against dueling, his success being proved by the numerous anti-dueling clubs in Hungary. Later, he began a social and journalistic agitation in behalf of the official recognition of the Jewish religion, and kept the matter before the public until the law granting recognition was sanctioned in 1895. In 1894, Vázsonyi founded the first democratic club in Budapest, and became a common councilor. In 1900, he established the political weekly \\"Új Század\\" (\\"The New Century\\") for the dissemination of democratic ideas throughout the country. At the same time, he organized democratic clubs in all the large Hungarian cities. In 1901, Vázsonyi was elected deputy for the sixth district of the capital, on a democratic platform, of which he was the only public representative in the Hungarian Parliament as of 1906. At the election of January 26, 1905, he defeated Hieronymi, minister of commerce, as a candidate for the deputy-ship from his district. Vasvonyi died June 1, 1926, from injuries suffered in an assault by Franz Molnar and the notorious anti-Semite Laszlo Vannay, described as \\"Ford's protege\\".

It was written in French, and has always been considered as a French nationalist journal by the non-francized Bretons. The term is also used for the broader movement associated with the journal's political position. Founded in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I, Breiz Atao would exist throughout the inter-war years. It was highly influenced by the Irish War of Independence, which began in 1916 and whose aftermath ran into the 1920s. Early on it adopted an official pan-Celtic policy, and a strong pan-Latin use of the French language. In its later years it became associated with a Nordicist blood and soil ideology with aspects in common with Nazism. It ceased publication in 1940, but was revived for an individual issue that appeared in 1944. HistoryCreation= The journal was first published in January 1919. Initially the editorial group focussed mostly on cultural aspects of Brittany, but very soon the journal evolved into the official forum of the Breton French-speaking autonomist movement. Its founders were Camille Le Mercier d'Erm, Job Loyant, Morvan Marchal and Job de Roincé. It was founded by the Groupe Régionaliste Breton, presided by Job Breiz, collaborating with Korentin Kerlann). They were soon joined by young French speaking intellectuals Yann Bricler, Olier Mordrel and François Debauvais, who soon took up important roles within the group. Breiz Atao organised a congress (in French) in September 1927 in Rosporden at which the Breton Autonomist Party (Parti Autonomiste Breton, or PAB) was founded. At its first meeting Maurice Duhamel was charged with maintaining links with wider French speaking political movements in France, in particular the French left wing, and became chief-editor of Breiz Atao. He gave the PAB a leftist and federalistic stance. However during the April 11, 1931 congress, the PAB fractured into different factions. The factionalism led to the abandonment of the journal Breiz Atao, which was briefly replaced by the journal \\"War Sao\\", run by the nationalist faction in Trégor, Goëlo and Cornouaille, who were preaching (in French) full Breton independence. =Drift towards fascism= On December 27, 1931, in Landerneau, the first congress of the new Parti National Breton took place. Breiz Atao reappeared as the mouthpiece of the militants led by Olier Mordrel and François Debauvais. In March 1933, Breiz Atao published a draft political programme, drawn up by Mordrel. In this program, Mordrel created a proposed constitution for an independent Breton state, to which the French state should concede some of its resources, including overseas colonies, art, libraries, industrial equipment etc. Its borders would be determined \\"by way of a plebiscite\\". He also suggested the exclusion of foreigners from citizenship, and of all persons of mixed race; people from a Nordic background would be given preference. The new state should ensure \\"control of youth's education, designed to make men physically and morally healthy\\". In July 1940, at a Pontivy congress, Debeauvis and Mordrel decided on editing a new journal, L'Heure Bretonne (The Breton Hour). This journal succeeded Breiz Atao. However Célestin Lainé, head of Bezen Perrot, an SS-affiliated militia, printed a one-off special issue in 1944, containing the recently deceased Debeauvais's statement of support for Lainé's activities.

It demanded more radical reforms of the government of Northern Ireland than the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association it came from. Foundation It was founded on 9 October 1968 at a meeting held in the Queen's University Belfast debating hall. A catalyst for its foundation had been the attack on a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) march in Derry on 5 October by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The group consisted mainly of students who were involved with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association or left wing groups such as the Labour Clubs and Young Socialist Alliance. At the meeting the group decided on five aims: * One man, one vote * Repeal of the Special Powers Act * An end to gerrymandering of electoral boundaries * Freedom of speech and assembly * Fair allocation of jobs and housing It was initially led by a committee of ten members which consisted of Queen's University students Malcolm Miles, Fergus Woods, Anne McBurnley, Ian Godall, Bernadette Devlin, Joe Martin, Eddie McCamely, Michael O'Kane and Patricia Drinan, as well as Kevin Boyle, a law lecturer at QUB. Other prominent members included Cyril Toman, Eamon McCann and Michael Farrell. The name of the group was selected by accident, according to Bernadette Devlin. After marches in Belfast, in imitation of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Selma to Montgomery marches, about 40 People's Democracy members held a four-day march between Belfast and Derry starting on 1 January 1969. The march was repeatedly attacked by loyalists along its route, including an incident at Burntollet bridge on 4 January where the marchers were attacked by about 200 unionists, including off-duty special constables, armed with iron bars, bottles and stones, while the RUC stood by and watched.The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan (), page 626 PD became increasingly radicalised as a result of these events. They also attacked the censorship laws in the Republic -- earning a rebuke from Ruairi Quinn and Basil Miller, then leaders of Students for Democratic Action, a revolutionary socialist student organisation, for letting British imperialism off the hook. In later years, members of the PD either quit politics altogether or became independent left-wing activists (such as Devlin and Farrell). Development In 1971, PD became a founder of the Socialist Labour Alliance. In the mid-1970s, the experience of the Ulster Workers' Council strike led to PD predicting a loyalist takeover in Northern Ireland, but it later came round to the view that this perspective was incorrect, giving loyalism a degree of autonomy from imperialism which it did not possess.John McAnulty A People Undefeated The minority which clung to the old perspective left to form the Left Revolutionary Group, becoming the Red Republican Party in 1976, which was moribund by 1978.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations During the 1970s, PD evolved towards Trotskyist positions and, by merging with the Dublin-based Movement for a Socialist Republic, was recognised by the reunified Fourth International as its Irish section. PD was especially active around the issues of internment and prisoners' rights. Following the formation of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee in 1979 to build support for the Republican prisoners then on the \\"blanket protest\\" in support of political status and the subsequent death of Bobby Sands and nine of his comrades during the H-Block hunger strikes, a number of members of the organisation, led by Vincent Doherty - then a member of the Political Committee and a former party general election candidate - argued that PD should join Sinn Féin, which had moved openly to the left in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1981, two members of People's Democracy were elected to Belfast City Council. John McAnulty and Fergus O'Hare were elected in a joint campaign with the IRSP. Fergus O'Hare won the council seat of Gerry Fitt, a sitting Westminster MP. O'Hare had been a founding member of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee and had previously been chairperson of the Political Hostages Release Committee which spearheaded the campaign against internment in the early 1970s. He subsequently went on to found the first Irish-language secondary school in Northern Ireland Meánscoil Feirste. When Sinn Féin ended its boycott of elections and gained mass support among the republican community, PD entered a political crisis. From 1982 on, a number of activists left them and joined Sinn Féin. At a PD national conference in 1986, a group including Anne Speed proposed the dissolution of the group and that the members all join SF as individuals. This position was defeated by 19 votes to five. A few weeks later the minority of five resigned from PD followed by their supporters and joined Sinn Féin. The remaining members who continued to oppose this view maintained PD as a small propaganda group. In the early 1990s the remaining members of PD initiated the Irish Committee for a Marxist Programme as an attempt to regroup socialists and left wing republicans. This project ended in 1996, when PD dissolved and reconstituted itself as Socialist Democracy, adopting the program put forward by the ICMP.

Based on the design of a medieval drinking vessel, the trophy was first awarded in 1923 to the winners of the (delayed) 1921 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final. The original 1920s trophy was retired in the 1990s, with a new identical trophy awarded annually since 1992. The original trophy is on permanent display in the GAA Museum at Croke Park in Dublin. The GAA organises the series of games, which are played during the summer months. The All- Ireland Hurling Final was traditionally played on the first or second Sunday in September at Croke Park in Dublin. In 2018, the GAA rescheduled its calendar and since then the fixture has been played in August. Old trophy The original Liam MacCarthy Cup commemorates the memory of Liam MacCarthy. Born in London to Irish parents in 1853, he was prominently involved in the establishment of a GAA county board in London in the 1890s.Department of Arts Sport and Tourism (Ireland) Speech by Minister at the official opening of the Liam MacCarthy Exhibition In 1922, a trophy in his honour was presented to the Central Council of the GAA, and replaced the Great Southern Cup as the All-Ireland trophy. The Liam MacCarthy Cup's design is based on a medieval drinking vessel called a mether. It was first presented in 1923 - to the Limerick team which defeated Dublin in the 1921 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final (owing to the political situation in Ireland at the time, the 1921 final was not actually played until March 1923. Hence, though not first presented until 1923, the 1921 All-Ireland hurling champions are noted as first recipients of the Liam MacCarthy Cup.) Cork won the old trophy on the most occasions. They also were the only team to win it on four consecutive occasions, achieving the feat during the 1940s (1941, 1942, 1943, 1944). Jack Lynch, who went on to become his nation's Head of Government, played in all four of these finals and captained the team in the first of them. In addition, Cork twice won the old trophy on three consecutive occasions, in the 1950s (1952, 1953, 1954) and in the 1970s (1976, 1977, 1978). They also won it on two consecutive occasions in the late-1920s (1928, 1929). Tipperary won the old trophy on three consecutive occasions (1949, 1950, 1951), as well as twice on two consecutive occasions in the 1960s (1961, 1962 & 1964, 1965). Kilkenny thrice won the old trophy on two consecutive occasions in the early-1930s (1932, 1933), mid-1970s (1974, 1975) and early-1980s (1982, 1983). Wexford (1955, 1956) and Galway (1987, 1988) each claimed the old trophy on consecutive occasions. 1992 brought the retirement of the original Liam MacCarthy Cup. It is permanently on display in the GAA Museum at Croke Park. New trophy The GAA commissioned a replica from silversmith James M. Kelly. The silver for the new cup was donated by Johnson Matthey Ireland at the behest of Kieran D. Eustace Managing Director, a native of Newtowncashel Co. Longford . Tipperary were the last team to claim the original. In 1992, an exact replica was produced and has been awarded on an annual basis since then. Kilkenny were the first team to win the \\"new\\" MacCarthy Cup. Kilkenny are also the team to have won the new trophy on the most occasions and the only team to have won it four consecutive times (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009). They had previously won it on consecutive occasions (2002, 2003). Cork are the only other team to have won the new trophy on consecutive occasions (2004, 2005). All-Ireland winners are permitted to keep the trophy for a period of one year until the following year's All-Ireland final. All-Ireland-winning captains receive a model replica of the Liam MacCarthy Cup. The trophy is currently held by Tipperary, who overcame Kilkenny in the final held on 18 August 2019, to win the Liam McCarthy Cup. In 2010, the GAA asked the same silversmith to produce another replica of the trophy (the third Liam MacCarthy Cup), although this was to be used only for marketing purposes. Eligible teams The Liam MacCarthy Cup is the trophy awarded to the victors in Tier 1 of the All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Twelve teams are eligible for this trophy; the five from the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship and the five from the Munster Senior Hurling Championship, as well as two teams invited from the Tier 2 Joe McDonagh Cup (the winner of the Joe McDonagh Cup in turn replaces Tier 1's bottom team via a system of promotion and relegation).

Entitled Switch, this follow-up album featured Stips' playing throughout. In 1976, Stips appeared as a full-fledged band member on To the Hilt. This album would prove to be his last full effort with the group. Stips also took part in the group's successful American tour in 1976, but left afterwards to form Stars & Stips which released Nevergreens in 1976, and the group Sweet d'Buster with fellow intermittent Golden Earring bandmember, saxophonist Bertus Borgers. Stips has guested on several Golden Earring efforts since. In 1979, Stips left Sweet d'Buster and formed Transister, which released one album: Zig Zag. In 1981, Robert Jan Stips released his first solo LP (U.P.). The same year, Stips became the keyboard player for The Nits, with whom he had previously worked as a producer. During his years with The Nits he also produced albums for Cloud Nine and Vitesse. He was the main composer of The Nits' orchestral work, Hjuvi - A Rhapsody in Time. In 1982 Stips appeared on Golden Earring's Cut release. It featured the group's worldwide hit \\"Twilight Zone\\". Stips also plays on the group's 1986 release The Hole. Robert Jan Stips left Nits in 1996 at the end of their Greatest Hits tour, and launched the group STIPS, with which he brought out the album Egotrip. STIPS released two albums in collaboration with Freek de Jonge, Gemeen Goed (1997) and Rapsodia (1998). In 1999, Robert Jan Stips released two solo albums : Greyhound and Rembrandt 2000 (at the occasion of a great exhibition Rembrandt in The Hague). He also appeared on Golden Earring's \\"Last Blast of the Century.\\" A two disc live career retrospective. In 2003, he rejoined Nits for their thirtieth anniversary tour. He played on the subsequent albums and has continued to tour with the group.

History In 1906 the government extended the railway from Goomalling to the developing Dowerin Agricultural Area and decided to develop a townsite at the terminus. The Aboriginal name of the site chosen was \\"Wuguni\\", but \\"Dowerin\\", also an Aboriginal name, was already in local use for the place, and was the name gazetted in 1907. The name is derived from nearby Lake Dowerin, first recorded on maps around 1879. One source suggests dowerin is the Aboriginal word for the twenty-eight parrot (dow-arn), and another suggests it means \\"place of the throwing stick\\" (dower). In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. Field Day Dowerin is home to the Dowerin GWN7 Machinery Field Days, currently a two-day annual event (held in the last week of August) showcasing agricultural and associated equipment, as well as providing information and services to people from rural areas. The Field Days attracts on average in excess of 600 exhibitors as well as over 15,000 local and national visitors each day. The event was first held as the Dowerin Machinery Field Day on 3 September 1965, and was the result of meetings by the Dowerin Progress Association the previous year which looked at ideas to prevent the town of Dowerin from becoming a ghost town. Some twenty exhibitors and two thousand visitors attended the first field day, with funds raised from the first event going towards funding the construction of a dam and a grassed tennis court. The event continues to be run and managed by the local community, with three full-time staff and 400 volunteers involved in the event's running each year. Since 1992, regional television broadcaster Golden West Network (GWN) has been the event's naming rights sponsor. Theo's run Between 1927 and 1939, the town hosted one of the major racetracks in the state. The Second World War brought an end to the racing and when it started again afterwards, racers moved to a new track on the former Caversham Airfield near Perth. Later, they moved from Caversham to Wanneroo, which today is known as Barbagallo Raceway. In May 2007, a vintage car motoring event was run to commemorate the town's history and its association with motor racing in Western Australia. Known as Theo's run, the event is named after a local who raced on the Dowerin track in its heyday in the 1930s and is expected to become an annual event. The 2007 event included a vintage car run from Perth with Jaguar and Riley cars participating. Facilities Dowerin District High School caters for students up to the level of Year 10. Past this, students wishing to further their education must attend Northam Senior High School, a 40-minute drive away. The school boasts a performing arts centre, and a library with a seminar area. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

They are variously located by ancient authors. According to Herodotus (v. 9), they dwelt beyond the Danube, and their frontiers extended almost as far as the Eneti on the Adriatic. Their horses (or rather, ponies) were small and flat-nosed with shaggy long hair, five fingers in length. They were not strong enough to bear men on their backs, but when yoked to chariots, they were among the swiftest known, which is the reason why the people of that country preferred that mode of transportation. The people themselves wore a Medic costume, and, according to their own account, were colonists from Media, a claim regarded as doubtful by Herodotus. In Apollonius Rhodius (iv. 320) they inhabit the shores of the Euxine, not far from the mouth of the Danube, while Strabo (xi. p. 520), also speaking of their ponies, and attributing to them Persian customs, places them near the Caspian. They could indeed have been a part of the Iranian expansion, together with the Scythians and Sarmatians migrating west into the Ukraine in the early Iron Age context of the \\"Thraco-Cimmerian\\" migrations. RW Macan (on Herod. v. 9) suggested that the \\"Medic\\" connection may be due to a confusion with the Thracian Maedi. In this case the Sigynnae would be a Thracian rather than an Iranian tribe. According to Herodotus, the Ligyes who lived above Massilia called traders \\"Sigynnae\\". According to J. L. Myres, the Sigynnae of Herodotus were \\"a people widely spread in the Danubic basin in the 5th century BC,\\" and connected with the iron-working culture of Hallstatt, which produced a narrow-bladed throwing spear, the sigynna spear (see notice of \\"Anthropological Essays\\" in Classical Review, November 1908). 19th-century historian George Rawlinson speculated that \\"the Sigynnae retained a better recollection than other European tribes of their migrations westward and Aryan origin\\", apparently using the term \\"Aryan\\" with a meaning somewhere between Indo-Iranian and Indo-European.

William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. (October 23, 1810 – May 18, 1848) was one of the earliest biracial-black U.S. citizens in California and one of the founders of the city that became San Francisco. A highly successful, enterprising businessman, he was a West Indian immigrant of African Cuban, possibly Carib, Danish and Jewish ancestry. Leidesdorff became a United States citizen in New Orleans in 1834. He migrated to Alta California in 1841, then under Mexican rule, settling in Yerba Buena (now San Francisco), a village of about 30 Mexican and European families. He became a Mexican citizen in 1844 and received a land grant from the Mexican government, 8 Spanish leagues, or south of the American River, known as Rancho Rio de los Americanos. He served as US Vice Consul to Mexico at the Port of San Francisco beginning in 1845. Leidesdorff was President of the San Francisco school board and also elected as City Treasurer. Shortly before Leidesdorff's death, vast amounts of gold were officially reported on his Rancho Rio De los Americanos. By the time his estate was auctioned off in 1856, it was worth more than $1,445,000, not including vast quantities of gold mined upon his land. International Leidesdorff Bicentennial Celebrations featured the \\"Golden Legacy of William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr.\\" On October 22, 2011 on his native isle of Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, a special event was to highlight the season of celebrations.  Early life  Born in Christiansted in Saint Croix when the Virgin Islands were under Danish rule (Danish West Indies), William Leidesdorff, Jr. was the oldest son of four children of Danish sugar plantation manager Wilhelm Alexander Leidesdorff (who used Alexander Leidesdorff as his name) and his common-law wife Anna Marie Sparks, reportedly of African and Spanish descent. Wilhelm Leidesdorff Sr. was reportedly of Jewish descent from the community of Altona, Hamburg. It was part of the Danish Schleswig-Holstein, then across the river from but now part of today's port of Hamburg, Germany. He migrated to North America and later the Caribbean to further his career as a merchant. Leidesdorff and Anna Marie lived in New Orleans under Spanish rule before the Louisiana Purchase, and he worked as a sugar factor.John N. Ingham, Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, p. 787, Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn., 1983 Leidesdorff, Jr.'s mother Anna Marie Sparks, was described in one account as a Carib Indian woman; she was believed also to have had African and European ancestry. Her race was noted in a census report. Many people observed that what were called \\"Carib\\" people had skin of various hues that likely reflected mixed ancestry, ranging from dark brown to lighter shades of brown, resulting in a Virgin Islands Creole, to which she may have belonged.Sue Bailey Thurman, 1952, Pioneers of Negro Origin in California, San Francisco: Acme Pub. Co. Other sources said the mother Marie Anne Spark (as she was also known) was a mixed- race woman of African and Spanish heritage, thought to have been born in Cuba. In census records, Marie Anne Spark was classified as a free Carib Indian, but few Carib survived into the late 18th century, according to Gary Palgon's biography of Leidesdorff.Gary Palgon, William Alexander Leidesdorff: First Black Millionaire, American Consul and California Pioneer, Lulu.com, 2005 Other sources document tens of thousands of Caribs, most of mixed heritage, living in the Windwards and Trinidad at the time of Leidesdorff's birth. Together the accounts describe Spark as a light-skinned woman of mixed-race ancestry, yet classified as black by the 1850s California Court System, where blacks were restricted from testifying in court.\\"William Alexander Leidesdorff, 1810-1848\\", BlackPast.org, accessed 1 Dec 2009 According to Sue Bailey Thurman, \\"With the name of William Alexander Leidesdorff, we begin the documentary history of pioneers of Negro origin in California.\\" Sue Bailey Thurman, \\"William Alexander Leidesdorff\\", Pioneers of Negro Origin in California, San Francisco: Acme Pub. Co., 1952, excerpt at Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco, accessed 22 Nov 2009 Today, William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. is recognized as the \\"African Founding Father of California\\", as noted by the California State Legislature. 2011 is the United Nations International Year for People of African Descent. As an infant, William Leidesdorff, Jr. was baptized as a Lutheran, as all the Leidesdorff children were, the adopted faith which his father and many other people of Jewish ancestry in Europe assumed to avoid conflict. In 1837 Leidesdorff, Sr. officially \\"adopted\\" all four of his own children from Anne Marie Sparks to give them legal standing by Danish Law.  Career  Afterward, he migrated to New Orleans, where he operated as a master of shipping vessels after he was naturalized as a United States citizen. He held posts with firms associated with his father or perhaps his mentors. Ship manifest documents show Leidesdorff's working as Ship Captain and/or Master, 1834–1840, out of the Port of New Orleans. William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. was thought the last black ship captain in Louisiana after strict enforcement of the Negro Seamen Acts began at the Port of New Orleans. Leidesdorff traveled to New York to become the Master of the schooner Julia Ann that sailed from New York to Yerba Buena (later San Francisco) in Alta California, then part of Mexico, in 1841. His route was via Panama, St. Croix, Brazil, Chile, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Sitka (Alaska), and on to California following the Pacific Ocean currents during the \\"Age of Sail\\".  In San Francisco  William Alexander Leidesdorff memorial in San Francisco, CA On arriving at Yerba Buena, Leidesdorff, Jr. began to re-build his businesses. The village cove then only had thirty European-Mexican families, so it did not take long for the ambitious man to make an impact. He launched the first steamboat to operate on San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River; it was long and purchased in Alaska.He built the City Hotel, the first hotel in San Francisco, and the first commercial shipping warehouse, the latter on what became Leidesdorff Street off the Embarcadero. In 1844 Leidesdorff obtained a vast land grant through favor from the Mexican government for on the south bank of the American River, near today's Californian City of Sacramento.He named the property Rancho Rio de los Americanos.During this period, Mexico encouraged leading Americans to settle in its territory by granting large land grants; in exchange the government required Americans to convert to Catholicism, the state religion; learn to speak Spanish; and accept Mexican citizenship.\\"Revival of Expansionism in the United States\\", Establishing Borders: The Expansion of the United States, 1846–48, Smithsonian Institution, accessed 28 Nov 2009 He went on to establish extensive commercial relations throughout Hawaii, Alaska and Mexican California. During the eight years of his residence, Leidesdorff served as one of six aldermen or town councilors of the Ayuntamiento. After the United States took over California following the Mexican–American War, he was one of three members on the first San Francisco school board, which organized the first public school in the city; later he was elected City Treasurer.His house was one of the largest, and he donated land for the first public school. In 1845, during the President James Polk administration, Leidesdorff accepted the request from United States Consul Thomas O. Larkin to serve as the US Vice Consul to Mexico at the Port of San Francisco, a measure of his political standing in region. Larkin was the first and last U.S. consul appointed to serve in California.Before the American flag was raised over San Francisco (July 1846), Leidesdorff had the U.S. Declaration of Independence read for the first time in California on the veranda at his home in celebration of Independence Day. Leidesdorff, Jr. achieved a high reputation for integrity and enterprise; he is said to have been \\"liberal, hospitable, cordial, confiding even to a fault.\\"\\"William Leidesdorf\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906, accessed 1 Dec 2009Leidesdorff became one of the wealthiest man in California. The value of his property near Sacramento began to rise dramatically just before his death, when gold was discovered along the American River just above his Leidesdorff Ranch, in the Gold Mining District of California. In March 1848, the California Star reported the total non-Native population of San Francisco as only 812: 575 males, 177 females and 60 children. In May 1848, the vast majority of men departed for the American River gold fields in hopes of striking it rich. Other towns were nearly emptied in the frenzy of the Gold Rush.\\"San Francisco Gold Rush Chronology: 1846-1849\\", The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco, accessed 1 Dec 2009  Marriage and Death  Leidesdorff never married. According to the explorer John C. Fremont, he lived with a Russian woman while maintaining diplomatic relationships with the Russian community in Sitka, Alaska. William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. died of typhoid fever on May 18, 1848. Other accounts noted the cause as pneumonia, typhus or murder. On the day of his burial, the town was in mourning, flags were at half-mast, business was suspended, and the schools were closed. His remains were interred near the front entrance of Mission Dolores on the same day, May 18, 1848.

Leidesdorff estate and controversy  The California pioneer died intestate, with no living relatives in California or the United States. In 1848 his estate was assumed devalued and in debt. The public discovery of gold in the American River valley and upon his extensive land holdings increased the actual value of his estate dramatically. His waterfront property in today's financial district of San Francisco would be valuable today. A complete inventory of his estate has yet to be quantified. The court appointed temporary administrators of his estate because there were no probate laws in California at that time. By 1854, when the California State Legislature considered escheat to take control of the property, Leidesdorff's estate was worth well over one million dollars and multiple of millions of dollars in gold was mined off his land. When the Leidesdorff-Folsom partitioned estate was auctioned off in 1856, the property brought more than $1,445,000. Settlement of the estate was complicated by the actions of Joseph Folsom. As Customs Collector and Harbor Master for San Francisco in 1848, he had become familiar with Leidesdorff's business dealings with the U.S. Army. In 1849, Folsom took leave from the U.S. Army and located Leidesdorff's mother and some of his siblings in the West Indies. Folsom signed a note to purchase from Anna Spark title to her son's estate for $75,000, title which included all of Leidesdorff's real estate holdings in San Francisco as well as the Rancho Rio de los Americanos near Sacramento. He paid her a deposit, with the promise of two more installment payments.Joseph Libbey Folsom, Folsom History MuseumJacob Chapman, A Genealogy of the Folsom Family: John Folsom and His Descendants, 1615–1682, Concord, NH: 1882 By the time Folsom returned to San Francisco, land prices were rising. The government challenged his purchase of Leidesdorff's title, as Anna Spark legally had no claim to it. A California State government \\"claim was brought because under old Mexican law that foreigners could not inherit property. The dispute was brought to the courts, where legal entanglements over the conflicts of Mexican, American and Danish laws kept it for over ten years.\\" The uncertainty of new probate laws, combined with the fact that William Leidesdorff, though he had held federal offices, held dual Mexican and U.S. citizenship, further complicated the property issues. Leidesdorff's St. Croix relatives, mother and siblings, challenged title through Danish officials because of Folsom's false evaluation of the estate. Both the US and Mexican national governments had interest in the large estate. The high value and reach of the Leidesdorff estate made Folsom's \\"purchase\\" extremely controversial. In 1854, Governor Bigler, recommended the escheat of the estate, then worth a million and a half, to the state legislature, and suggested that proceedings be commenced for its recovery from Folsom.Journal of the Senate of California, 1854 The courts refused to admit the title of the West Indian mixed-race relatives because there may have been \\"other heirs, who had never conveyed away their rights in the estate\\", from Europe.Sweasy, Early Days and Men of California These \\"other heirs\\" from Leidesdorff's father's family lived in Europe at Altona and Copenhagen, and in the Caribbean Islands. Ultimately the following happened: (1) The claims of Leidesdorff's West Indian relatives were thrown out of court; their evidence of relationship was rejected. As they were not American citizens, they were not considered to have standing. (2) No recognized Danish family or individual of the name of Leidesdorff appeared to claim the estate of William Leidesdorff of San Francisco. Other Danish members of the family lived on St. Croix for some time after the American's death. (3) The statute of limitations covered and protected every title obtained from Joseph L. Folsom and others who later acquired possession.

Biography  Portrait of L. Löw Löw was born to the only Jewish family in the village Černá Hora, Moravia, then part of the Austria. His Jewish name, as appears in all his rabbinical correspondence, was Judah Leib. On his father's side, he was descended from the Maharal of Prague, and on his mother's from Menachem Mendel Krochmal.Simon Federbusch. Ḥokhmat Yiśraʼel be-Maʻarav Eropah (Volume 3). M. Nyuman (1958).

He received his preliminary education at the yeshivot of Třebíč, Kolín, Lipník nad Bečvou and Eisenstadt (1824 – 35), and then studied philology, pedagogics, and Christian theology at the Lyceum of Bratislava and at the universities of Pest and Vienna (1835 – 41). After having been a teacher at Prostějov, he succeeded to the rabbinate of Nagykanizsa (10 September 1841). Löw early in his career acquired a knowledge of Hungarian, and was the first to introduce it into the synagogue service, his first sermon in that language being printed in 1845. In 1844 he began his literary activity on behalf of the emancipation of the Hungarian Jews, taking the lead in that struggle until its object was attained (1867). The periodical Ben Chananja, edited by him from 1858 to 1867, was an especially influential factor in this movement. In 1846 Löw had been called to Pápa, where he encountered many difficulties. After the revolution he was denounced by his enemies, and was arrested, but was pardoned by General Julius Jacob von Haynau on 14 December 1849 and liberated after two months' imprisonment. In consequence of this persecution he accepted a call to Szeged, where he was installed on 10 December 1850. He refused subsequent calls to Lviv, Brno, and Bucharest, as well as to the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums at Berlin. He died at Szeged, Austria-Hungary.  Influence on Hungarian Reform  Löw brought his thorough knowledge of history, theology, and esthetics to bear upon the reform of the ritual in agreement with modern views. He was the foremost preacher of Hungary, especially in the vernacular, and was invited to participate in nearly all the patriotic celebrations and synagogal dedications. His Hungarian sermons (1870) formed the first Jewish collection of the kind issued in that language. Löw combined the careful, logical arrangement of the Christian sermon with a clever analysis of complicated haggadic sentences. His studies, beginning with the history of the Halakhah, subsequently included the entire Jewish archeology of post-Talmudic time. He endeavored to determine the development of Jewish life and law as it appears in the halakhic literature, and to disprove, in the interest of Judaism, the view that Judaism remained stationary in its manners and customs down to the beginning of the German Reformation. His most important archaeological studies and responsa were written for the purpose of proving the development of various institutions and of showing the influence, in many cases, of foreign customs. Löw was a leading authority both from a scientific point of view and in questions of practical theology. The absolute (1850 – 66) as well as the constitutional government (1867) of Austria and especially that of Hungary were guided by the replies he gave to their questions in matters referring to the organization of the Jewish ritual and schools. Jewish education throughout Hungary owed much to him. Down to his death he was the leader of the progressive Hungarian Jews, especially after the General Congress — which was convened against his advice and in which he did not take part — had resulted in a schism among the Jews of Hungary instead of the union that had been anticipated.  Works  Aside from his works on the Halakhah, Löw left only one other larger work, Ha-Mafteaḥ (1855), a history (in German) of exegesis among the Jews:Praktische Einleitung in die heilige Schrift und Geschichte der Schriftauslegung: ein Lehrbuch für die reifere Jugend, ein Handbuch für Gebildete; 1. Theil, Allgemeine Einleitung and Geschichte der Schriftauslegung. Gross-Kanischa : J. Markbreiter (At head of title: ha-Mafteaḥ. No more published. this remained authoritative into the twentieth century. After the emancipation, when he gave up the editorship of Ben Chananja, he devoted himself to larger archeological monographs, of which the following were published: Die Graphischen Requisiten (1870 – 71) and Die Lebensalter in der jüdischen Literatur (1875). Fragments of a third volume, Der Synagogale Ritus, were published posthumously (1884).

Life  Hillel Lichtenstein was born at Veča in 1814. After studying at the yeshiva of the Chassam Sofer, he married in 1837 the daughter of a well-to-do resident of Galanta, where he remained until 1850, when he was elected rabbi of Margarethen (Szent Margit). In 1854 he was elected rabbi of Klausenburg, but the opposition of the district rabbi, Avrohom Friedman, made it impossible for him to enter upon the duties of the office; finally he was expelled from Klausenburg by the authorities. Having lived for some time at Nagyvárad, he was recalled to Margarethen, where he remained until about 1865, when he was called to Szikszó. Thence he went, in 1867, to Kolomyia, where he remained until his death. He was a prominent leader of Ultra-Orthodoxy in Hungary: he not only resisted the slightest deviation from the traditional ritual, as the removal of the bimah from the center of the synagogue, but also vigorously denounced the adoption of non- Jewish social manners and dress and the acquisition of secular education. He directed his criticism not only at the reformers, but also at the moderate Orthodox Azriel Hildesheimer. He bitterly opposed the Hungarian Jewish congress of 1868-69 and the establishment of the Neolog rabbinical seminary in Budapest. In 1865 he called a rabbinical convention at Michalovce, which banned reforming synagogues. His religious practise was unusually strict even among Hungarian Orthodox rabbis, even going so far as to keep a she-donkey in order to be able to fulfill the law of Petter Chamor. He kept a sheep also in order to be able to give the first fleece to a Kohen (Deuteronomy 18:4), from whom subsequently he bought it back to make tzitzit from it. Rabbi Lichtenstein was an ardent admirer of Hasidic Judaism, and made pilgrimages to the famous Rebbe of Sanz, the Divrei Chaim. He offered his own intercession through prayer to people in distress, but declined any gifts. He died on 18 May 1891 in Kolomyia, Galicia (now Ukraine).  Views  Lichtenstein was a powerful preacher and a popular writer, and the resistance to modern tendencies among the Jews of northern Hungary is largely due to his influence. He inveighed against the use of other than traditional Jewish names; he denounced not only secular education, but even the playing of musical instruments and innocent social games, like chess and checkers; and he condemned those who relied on reason, for the ideal Jew should live up to the principle of Psalm 73:22, \\"I was as a beast before thee\\".\\"'Et la-'Asot,\\" p. 118a, Lemberg, 1881 He was a decided opponent also of all agitation for the political emancipation of the Jews, saying that it is the duty of the Jews to suffer the tribulations of the Exile until God finds them ripe for Messianic redemption.

Telcs attracted particular attention in 1900 by being awarded, for his monument in honor of Empress Elizabeth of Austria, first prize among many competitors. In 1905 he was commissioned to work on a statue of the poet Vörösmarty to be erected in Budapest, and another of Kossuth in Kecskemét, having been awarded both these commissions as a result of competition. In World War II Budapest 1944 Telcs was ordered to wear the Jewish badge (Judenstern). Raoul Wallenberg helped to prevent his deportation into a Nazi extermination camp.

Biography He was born in Pressburg, Austria-Hungary (present day Bratislava, Slovakia). He studied at the Pressburg Yeshiva, and studied Oriental philology and history at the University of Berlin (PhD 1895). In 1896, he was called to Hohenems, Austria as chief rabbi of Tyrol and Vorarlberg; and from 1904 to 1907 he was rabbi of Meran (Tyrol). From 1907 until his death, he served as rabbi of the Jewish community of Göppingen in Württemberg, Germany. His history of the Jews of Göppingen and nearby Jebenhausen is notable as a thorough documentation of a Jewish community from its beginnings. In World War I, he served as a Feldrabbiner (Jewish chaplain) in the German army, primarily on the Eastern front. He looked after German and Austrian Jewish soldiers and took care of Jewish prisoners of war in POW camps like Doeberitz and Sedan. Aron Tänzer's father was a rabbi and his mother worked as a seamstress for the Pressburg Jewish community. At the age of 21, Aron Tänzer enrolled at the University of Berlin. He studied philosophy, German and Semitic philology. Aron Tänzer received his doctorate in 1895 and in October 1896 he successfully applied for the vacant rabbinical position in Hohenems, Austria. The Hohenems rabbinate also supervised nearby Jewish communities in Vorarlberg and, from 1878 to 1914, also formally the Jews living in Tyrol. Tänzer applied his extensive training in history to numerous scientific publications as well as the field of adult education. For example, he often gave lectures on literature and history for the Hohenems Education Club. In 1905 he published the history of the Jews in Hohenems, which is still considered the standard work today. His mindset and religious beliefs were shaped by liberal ideas and cultural openness. From 1905 to 1907 Tänzer was a rabbi of the Jewish community of Meran [1] and from September 1, 1907, became a rabbi at the Göppingen synagogue. He held this position, in which he was responsible for the Jebenhausen district rabbinate, until his death in 1937. Right at the beginning of the First World War, Tänzer volunteered to work as a field rabbi. He served on the Eastern Front for three years. Tänzer looked after the soldiers, helped in the hospital and set up people's kitchens for the needy population. Tänzer was awarded several medals for his work in the field. Tänzer laid the foundation for a public library, later the city library in Göppingen, since 1909. Since 1921 he was an honorary member of the Göppingen veterans and military association \\"Kampfgemeinschaft\\". The Rabbiner- Tänzer-Haus (Freihofstrasse 46), the former rabbinate building, in Göppingen was dedicated to the Taenzer family.

The railway to Southern Cross was constructed through the area in 1894–95, and Tammin was one of the original stations when the line opened in 1895.

An appeal was raised on the basis of Fiji's constitution outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. On Friday 26 August 2005, his conviction, and that of Dhirendra Nadan, the other man involved, was overturned on constitutional grounds. Anti-sodomy laws were found to be incompatible with the country’s 1997 Constitutional Bill of Rights. The debate over what is and isn’t culturally acceptable was at the heart of the constitutional arguments which were presented during the McCoskar High Court case (Nadan & McCoskar v State also cited as DPP v Nadan and McCoskar) and raised questions about the values enshrined in the country’s Bill of Rights. The Constitution of Fiji was adopted in 1997 with a mandate to break the racially divisive legacy of the Fiji coups of 1987. Section 43, concerned the respect of traditional Fijian cultural values, in particular traditional titles, obligations, customs and ceremonies. It was designed to protect the specific interests of the indigenous Fijian communities. While the Methodist church in particular has always argued that homosexuality offends it on a cultural level, and it is not culturally appropriate for Fiji, the High Court disagreed with those arguments. The case is being seen as a victory for gay rights, in a country whose colonial legacy is dominated by strict Methodist values. (Most ethnic Fijians generally regard themselves as Christians, with approximately 65 per cent belonging to the Methodist faith.) Quite unusually among common law countries, section 43 of the Fijian Constitution requires that the Fiji Bill of Rights be interpreted in light of “public international law” and so it was necessary for Judge Winter to call on this body of international standards in deciding the case. The judgment calls very heavily on international standards and the way in which courts in other parts of the world have dealt with these issues. The Fiji Human Rights Commission submitted that sections 175 (a) and (c) and 177 of the Fiji Penal Code had become invalid immediately after the 1997 Constitution came into effect. In its submission, the Commission also stated that sections 175 (a) and (c) and 177 of the Penal Code were contrary to Section 38 (2) of the Constitution as it unfairly discriminated on the ground of sexual orientation. All human rights cases on this point internationally, including in South Africa, have come to similar conclusions. The Commission also submitted that this was really a case of prosecution for the wrong offence and that the relevant authorities should have considered charging McCoskar and Nandan for trafficking in pornography under section 188 of the Penal Code. The Fiji Human Rights Commission stated in relation to this case: > Trafficking in obscene publications is part of a larger picture of > trafficking in persons. This involves the illegal trade in human beings and > a modern form of slavery. Many victims of human trafficking are subjected to > force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced > labour. Trafficking in persons is a gross violation of human rights. It > violates the universal human right to life, liberty, and freedom from > slavery in all its forms. McCoskar in mitigation in the Magistrates Court had accepted that the photographs he took were intended for sale on the internet. Fiji has ratified the Agreement for the Suppression of the Circulation of Obscene Publications. As such, the Fijian Government is obliged to play its role in helping curb the rising problem of trafficking in pornography and sexual exploitation of vulnerable groups of people, especially those who are poor. McCoskar told the Melbourne newspaper The Age: \\"I would have liked the Australian Government to have taken more interest in my case\\". The Australian government offered the usual consular assistance, but did not condemn the sentence. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had both condemned the conviction.

The town serves as a stop on the Prospector and MerredinLink rural train services. It is also located on the Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail. History 250px Early settlers from 1890 to 1910 from Ireland settled in the area of Kellerberrin and Wittem. Their family name was English. A road was named after this family. The railway line from Northam to Southern Cross was constructed through here in 1893–94, and this section opened for traffic in 1895. Kellerberrin was one of the original stations when the line opened. By 1898 there was a demand for small blocks of land in the area, and the government surveyed a number of lots the same year. The area was gazetted as Kellerberrin townsite in 1901, and the government soon made more land available for settlers. In 1898 the Agricultural Hall was officially opened. It was built with granite walling and brick dressing with a jarrah and iron roof. The building is located on the north side of the railway line, adjoining the post office. The hall is now used as a folk museum. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. Etymology The name Kellerberrin is Aboriginal, and is derived from the name of a nearby hill. The hill was first recorded as \\"Killaburing Hill\\" by an explorer in 1861, but in 1864 the explorer Charles Hunt recorded it as Kellerberrin Hill. One source claims that Kellerberrin is the name for the fierce ants that are found in the area, while another gives it as meaning \\"camping place near where rainbow birds are found\\" – kalla means camping place or place of, and berrin berrin is the rainbow bird. Climate Kellerberrin has a semi-arid climate with hot dry summers and slightly wet winters.

Palekh Russian lacquer art on papier-mâché first appeared in 1923 in the village of Palekh, located in the Palekhsky District (Ivanovo Oblast), and is based on a long local history of icon painting. This handicraft and style of miniature painting bore different names throughout its development, such as the Palekh Artel of Ancient Painting (since 1924), Palekh Artists’ Association (since 1932), and Artistic Production Workshops of the Artistic Fund of the USSR (since 1953). The technology of making a semi-finished product was borrowed from the lacquer handicraft masters of Fedoskino (see Fedoskino miniature). The Palekh miniatures usually represent characters from real life, literary works, fairy tales, bylinas, and songs. They are painted with local bright paints over the black background and are known for their delicate and smooth design, abundance of golden shading, and accurate silhouettes of flattened figures, which often cover the surface of the lids and sides of the articles completely. Poetic magic of the Palekh characters, decorativeness of landscapes and architecture, and elongated proportions of the figures go back to the icon-painting traditions. The miniatures are usually set off with a complicated pattern made with gold dissolved in aqua regia. Palekh is the most renowned of four such famous villages, the others being Kholuy, Mstyora, and Fedoskino, each producing similar, but clearly distinct artistic style. The art of miniature painting is still alive today. Nowadays there are workshops of the Artistic Fund of Russia, as well as small private studios and independent artists in Palekh. Palekh miniature artists are trained at the Palekh Art College founded in 1935. Works by Palekh masters are kept in numerous museums of Russia and abroad. The State Palekh Art Museum in Palekh boasts the biggest miniature painting collection, comprising over two thousand works.

The survey was carried out the following year, and in 1925 the area was gazetted as the townsite of Parker Road. Name In 1926 the local member of Parliament advised the name of the townsite was causing confusion because it was too similar to Parker Range, a nearby goldmining area, and was also the name of a road in Southern Cross. He suggested the alternative name of Moorine, after Moorine Rock. This name was too similar to Moora, but was accepted with the full name Moorine Rock.

He sings in a variety of languages, including French, German, English, Italian, Swiss German, and Romanche, sometimes using different languages in the same song. Eicher's success started in German-speaking countries in the 1980s when, as part of the band Grauzone, he had a hit single, \\"Eisbär\\". With hit songs such as \\"Combien de Temps\\" and \\"Oh Ironie\\", his popularity spread across Europe with albums, tours, and chart success in France and Switzerland. Life Stephan Eicher was born in the rural municipality of Münchenbuchsee not far from Bern. Eicher was educated at the Ecole D'Humanité, an international boarding school in Switzerland, and musically trained at the academy of art in Zürich, where he learned how to use the computer for composing music. He released his first single \\"Eisbär\\", together with his brother Martin, on the album Grauzone in 1980. He became interested in French songs by Jacques Dutronc, Georges Brassens, and Serge Gainsbourg, and these influences led to the album Les Chansons Bleues. This album is also inspired by the American singers he listened to during his youth, such as Patti Smith, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan. His two subsequent albums began to establish his reputation. The album, I Tell This Night, and the single \\"Two People in a Room\\" were released in 1985. It peaked on the Swiss charts at number ten and stayed twelve weeks. Two years later, the album Silence reached number three and was in the Swiss Top 10 for fourteen weeks. Both albums were created by Stephan Eicher almost single-handedly. 1989's \\"My Place\\" went in a different direction. The French lyrics were written by his friend, author Philippe Djian. His largest commercial success came in 1991 with the album Engelberg, which spent five weeks at number one in Switzerland and 46 weeks on the charts in total. The song \\"Dejeuner En Paix\\" was also number two in France. It is the beginning of a collaboration with Manu Katché and Pino Palladino which lasted until the release of 1000 vies in 1996. His subsequent albums regularly reached the top five on the Swiss album charts. Following a world tour, which included concerts in Africa, he produced his first live album in 1994 (Non ci badar, guarda e passa). Since 1989, his song lyrics have been written by Djian. In 2001, Eicher released his first greatest hits compilation album entitled Hotel*s. For many years, the hotel Hess on the Swiss Engelberg was his second home. Martin Hess, the hotelier couple's son, became his close friend and producer. At the hotel, the albums Engelberg and Louanges developed. Eicher selected the title Hotel*s as homage to this grand hotel, which was torn down in the same year. For the title selection for the album, he let the fans co-ordinate with the official homepage. Cover versions of his songs Singer Sian Charia recorded a cover version of Eicher's \\"Pas d'ami\\" (translated into Khmer) in Phnom Penh in 1995. German progressive metal band Vanden Plas covered \\"Des Hauts, des Bas\\" on their AcCult EP in 1996. His song \\"Combien de Temps\\" has been remixed by Flood. Experimental electronic music group Cabaret Voltaire recorded a cover version of Eicher's \\"No Escape.\\" Originally written by [The Seeds (band)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seeds] The metalband Stahlhammer released a cover version of \\"Eisbär\\" on their album Eisenherz.

He was also the margrave of Antwerp from 1005 (or 1008) and count of Verdun. Gothelo was the youngest son of Godfrey I, Count of Verdun, and Matilda Billung, daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony. On his father's death, he received the march of Antwerp and became a vassal of his brother, Godfrey II, who became duke of Lower Lorraine in 1012. He succeeded his brother in 1023 with the support of the Emperor Henry II, but was opposed until Conrad II forced the rebels to submit in 1025. When the House of Bar, which ruled in Upper Lorraine, became extinct in 1033, with the death of his cousin Frederick III, Conrad made him duke of both duchies, so that he could assist in the defence of the territory against Odo II, count of Blois, Meaux, Chartres, and Troyes (the later Champagne). In the battle at Bar on 15 November 1037, Gothelo dealt a decisive blow to Odo, who was trying to create an independent state between France and Germany. Odo died in the battle. Gothelo died on 19 April 1044 and was buried in the Abbey Church of Bilzen. His son Godfrey succeeded in Upper Lorraine, but the Emperor Henry III refused to give him the duchy of Lower Lorraine as well. When Godfrey showed disagreement with the imperial decision, Henry III threatened to pass the duchy to Godfrey's incompetent brother Gothelo. This caused a long rebellion in Lotharingia between the allies of Godfrey (the counts of Flanders and Leuven) and imperial forces (1044–1056).

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The first Arabian Knight had the normal abilities of a healthy, athletic human. He was a good hand-to-hand combatant and was an exceptional swordsman, particularly in the use of the scimitar. He possesses three magical weapons: a magic carpet, a golden scimitar emitting beams of magical force, and a mind-controlled belt/sash. Indeed, all three items respond, exclusively, to his mental commands. He discovered his weapons, which had belonged to a 13th-century ancestor, in an underground tomb in the Egyptian desert. The magic carpet and sash are formed from a material that is virtually indestructible, resisting fire, and even bullets. The carpet permitted him to travel, flying, at high speeds and altitudes, while the belt/sash magically elongates to approximately in length (almost 10 times its typical length), and can serve as a weapon (whip), or as a climbing rope, or to capture and restrain his foes. The golden scimitar, in addition to firing destructive blasts, will \\"backfire\\" against any other person who may attempt to wield it. The next Arabian Knight revealed that the magic carpet used by the first Arabian Knight was unraveled and made into an indestructible uniform that responds to his thoughts. He still uses the magic scimitar and wears the red magic sash around his waist. The uniform serves as body armor that protects him from harm and allows him to fly. Reception Comic Book Resources placed the original Arabian Knight as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget. Other characters named Arabian Knight An unrelated character named Arabian Knight appeared in Black Panther (2005) #15 (June 2006). He was depicted as a Muslim warrior who won the right to use the magical scimitar, carpet, and armor due to trial by combat.

The top cards of the reserve fans and the top cards of the columns in the tableau are available for play onto the foundations or on the tableau. The foundations are built up by suit and ranking is continuous as Aces are placed over Kings. The cards on the tableau are built down in alternating colors. Ranking is also continuous in the tableau as Kings can be placed over Aces. One card can be moved at a time, but sequences can also be moved as one unit. No cards can be built on the reserve. Spaces that occur on the tableau are filled with any top card in the reserve. If the entire reserve is exhausted however, it is not replenished; spaces that occur after this point have to be filled with cards from the waste pile or, if a wastepile has not been made yet, the stock. The stock is dealt one card at a time to the wastepile, the top card of which is available for play. There is one redeal allowed. To prepare for the redeal, the remaining cards in the wastepile are collected and turned face down to become the new stock. The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations.

She first appeared in Villains United #1 (July 2005), and was created by Gail Simone and Dale Eaglesham. She is the daughter of Vandal Savage and a member of the Secret Six.  Publication history  Scandal first appeared as a shrewd businesswoman in Villains United #1 (July 2005) where she was created by author Gail Simone and artist Dale Eaglesham. Within this run her character was developed and revealed by the author to be as deadly a character as any of the others in Secret Six, where she unveiled her trademark \\"lamentation blades\\" and battle outfit. In Villains United #6, the character was officially confirmed to be among the few lesbian supervillains in the DC Universe. The character subsequently appeared in the Secret Six miniseries later in 2006, as written by Gail Simone which would embellish upon the relationship between the character and her father Vandal Savage. In Simone's final run on Birds of Prey as part of the \\"Whitewater\\" story arc, she saw a crossover between the titular Birds of Prey and the Secret Six. When Tony Bedard assumed control of Birds of Prey, the characters of Knockout and Scandal continued to appear in issue #109 which followed from the conclusion of \\"Whitewater\\". Tying into the upcoming Salvation Run miniseries, the character would appear again immediately following Birds of Prey #109, in Checkmate #18 as part of an emerging build up towards Salvation Run.  Fictional character biography  Scandal Savage is the daughter of immortal Vandal Savage and an unknown Brazilian woman, who apparently raised the child in her home country, though trained in combat by her father from childhood on. In an attempt to destroy an alternate Lex Luthor's plans, the real Lex Luthor, under the alias Mockingbird, blackmailed Scandal and five other villains into antagonizing the Secret Society of Super Villains. Despite being severely outnumbered, Scandal and the rest of the Secret Six were able to thwart the Society on a number of occasions. Eventually Luthor granted the Six their freedom, telling them the safeguards placed against their rebellion were lies. While working with the Six was originally all about saving her mother, Scandal eventually grew to care about her teammates, and is actually in an intimate lesbian relationship with one of the other members. During Villains United, Scandal positioned her lover Knockout as a mole in the Society. During one of the attacks by the Society, Knockout revealed her true allegiances by saving Scandal during a fight with Talia al Ghul.Villains United #6 (December 2005) Knockout then became an official member of the Six. While the two were vacationing in Bangkok, Knockout was almost killed when she was shot with a Thanagarian sniper rifle by Pistolera. The shot implanted a bomb in her skin and when Scandal refused to leave her side, Knockout threw herself from the blast range telling her they would meet again in the afterlife. After the bomb went off, Scandal scrambled through the garbage to find Knockout miraculously still alive. Scandal vowed revenge on Pistolera for hurting Knockout, and soon would have it. The Secret Six managed to capture Pistolera and Scandal took pleasure torturing the hired gun. Ultimately, Scandal could not kill the person who almost took her beloved from her, so her teammate, Deadshot, stepped in and did the deed for her.Secret Six vol. 2 #2 (August 2006) Knockout recovered from her injuries soon after. It has recently been revealed that Vandal Savage was responsible for the attacks on Knockout and the rest of the Six, as a warning of what will happen if Scandal doesn't bear an heir for him. However, Scandal \\"killed\\" her father and escaped with the rest of the Six (minus the Mad Hatter). Following this, the Secret Six were hired for mercenary work by a Russian mobster to protect a Rocket Red suit that was revealed to be occupied by the presumed-dead super-hero Ice.Birds of Prey #105 (April 2007) During the battle against the Birds of Prey for the suit and Ice, Spy Smasher made Deadshot accidentally shoot Scandal in the back.Birds of Prey #106 (May 2007) She appeared to be fine, but was too weak to continue the fight. Following Knockout's murder by an unknown assailant,Birds of Prey #109 (October 2007) a drunk and distraught Scandal is kidnapped by Bronze Tiger and Rick Flag on the orders of Amanda Waller. King Faraday offers her a place in a revived Suicide Squad, but she refuses and promises to kill him. Faraday then orders her to be shipped off to an unknown location (see Salvation Run).Checkmate #18 (November 2007) She was briefly seen attacking Bolt for groping her. She was also shown to at some point have gotten another tattoo underneath her left eye. In the new Secret Six series (September 2008), Scandal was shown to still be drunk and depressed over the death of Knockout. Catman and Deadshot tried to cheer her up by having a naive stripper dressed like Knockout jump out of a cake for her, with one guest calling the sad display \\"morally indefensible\\". Scandal declined the stripper's advances, and managed to pull herself together for the Six's new mission.Secret Six vol. 3 #1 (November 2008) During that time, the Six's new member, Bane developed a father-like affection towards Scandal, much to her discomfort. Following the mission's success, Scandal encountered the stripper she had rejected at a supermarket and learns her name is Liana Kerzner. Despite trying to turn her down again the stripper talks her into a double-date.Secret Six vol. 3 #7 (May 2009) After resurrecting Knockout with Neron's \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" card, Scandal proposes a polygamous marriage between all three women, which both her lovers accept. The Secret Six are ultimately defeated and captured by an army of superheroes, with most of the team's fates (including Scandal's) left unrevealed due to the September 2011 reboot.Secret Six vol. 3 #36 (October 2011) During the next Secret Six series set in the New 52, both Scandal and Knockout are shown to be perfectly healthy and living in freedom instead of prison, and are still happily together with Liana. The three make plans to have a child together, and Scandal has even chosen the man she wants to be the donor.Secret Six (vol. 4)  Powers and abilities  The full extent of Scandal's powers has yet to be revealed, although it would appear that, owing to her father's immortality, she is incredibly resilient to harm. She claims to be \\"damned hard to kill\\" at the least.Villains United #5 (November 2005) In Birds of Prey #107, she took a bullet from DeadshotBirds of Prey vol. 1 #107 (August 2007) and was capable of regrowing her damaged organs,Birds of Prey vol. 1 #108 (September 2007) talking to and carrying Knockout several minutes later with no apparent ill effects. In Checkmate #18, it is speculated that she may be immortal like her father. She also took several rounds from a machine gun to the chest and legs and still considered herself combat ready (threatening to kill her assailants). She and other people have made comments that imply that her life had been or will be longer than average. She has proven herself to be a vicious fighter, capable of holding her own against the likes of Fatality,Villains United #3 (September 2005) Hawkgirl, and Talia al Ghul. In combat, she often employs a set of retractable, wrist-mounted blades,—the Laminas Pesar or \\"Lamentation Blades\\", which Scandal claims have been in the family for a long time. The blades have two settings. One is a pair of long, awl-like blades designed for stabbing. The other is three knife-like blades designed for slashing. She was also seen riding a motorcycle and seemed to be capable of combat while still riding this (though this was never seen). In other mediaTelevision= * The character is alluded in Young Justice: Invasion. In the episode \\"True Colors\\", Vandal mentions that he fathered children as an immortal. Young Justice: Outsiders introduces the daughters Cassandra Savage (voiced by Zehra Fazal) and Olympia Savage (voiced by Jenifer Lewis). * Legends of Tomorrow features a character named Cassandra Savage, portrayed by Jessica Sipos based on Scandal Savage. She is the daughter of Vandal Savage in the year 2166. Initially one of her father's key lieutenants, Cassandra turns on her father after the Legends reveal the extent of his evil, which includes the release of a virus that killed her mother. Vandal mentions having fathered dozens of children in his 4000-year life and watched them die from old age. =Film= Scandal Savage makes her animated debut in Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay, voiced by Dania Ramirez. She first appears alongside Knockout assaulting Professor Pyg's lair and kidnapping him for \\"a patient in need of medical attention\\". She is then shown in her apartment with Knockout and the hostage Pyg before they are attacked by the Suicide Squad. During the fight, she is defeated by Bronze Tiger and held hostage by Copperhead. Just as her father arrives, she resumes the fight until Knockout is mortally shot by Savage's men, causing her to vengefully attack them with full rage. She also pleads for her father to help Knockout, but only to watch in horror as Savage further wounds Knockout with a gunshot before she is demanded to get Professor Pyg on board his ship. She is then seen one last time phoning Deadshot, to whom she passes the coordinates to her father's location. She then sat beside Knockout, who is alive and was placed in critical condition in the hospital, where she grieved for her lover.

The mountain houses the grotto or cave of Hira' (), which holds tremendous significance for Muslims throughout the world, as the Islamic Nabī (Prophet) Muhammad is said to have spent a great deal of time in this cave meditating, and it is widely believed that it was here that he received his first revelation, which consisted of the first five ayats of Surah Al-Alaq from the angel Jibra'il (as is pronounced in certain Quran recitation schools and some Arab tribes; also known as Gabriel). It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Makkah. The mountain itself is barely tall; nonetheless one to two hours are needed to make the strenuous hike to the cave. There are 1750 steps to the top which, even for a fit individual, can take anywhere between half an hour and one-and-a-half hours. Etymology Since this is where Muhammad is said to have had his first revelation and received the first verses of the Quran, the mountain was given the title Jabal an-Nūr (\\"Mountain of the Light\\" or \\"Mountain of the Enlightenment\\"). This experience is sometimes identified with the beginning of revelation; hence the present name. The date of the first revelation is said to be during the night on August 10, 610 A.D. Or, monday the 21st of Ramadan, making Muhammad 40 lunar years, 6 months and 12 days of age, i.e. 39 Gregorian years, 3 months and 22 days. Appearance One physical feature that differentiates Jabal al- Nour from other mountains and hills is its unusual summit, which makes it look as if two mountains are on top of each other. The top of this mountain in the mountainous desert is one of the loneliest of places. However, the cave within, which faces the direction of the Kaaba, is even more isolated. While standing in the courtyard back then, people could only look over the surrounding rocks. Nowadays, people can see the surrounding rocks as well as buildings that are hundreds of meters below and hundreds of meters to many kilometers away. Hira is both without water or vegetation other than a few thorns. Hira is higher than Thabīr (), and is crowned by a steep and slippery peak, which Muhammad with some companions once climbed.Weir, T. H.. \\"Ḥirāʾ.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936). Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R. Hartmann. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. Augustana College. 07 October 2013 Cave of Hira The entrance to the Cave of Hira in the mountain Taking 1750 walking steps to reach, the cave itself is about in length and in width. The cave is situated at a height of . During the season of Ḥajj ('Pilgrimage'), an estimated five thousand visitors climb to the cave daily to see the place where Muhammad is believed to have received the first revelation of the Quran on the Night of Power by the angel Jibreel. The majority of Muslims do not consider visiting the cave as an integral part of the Hajj. Nonetheless many visit it for reasons of personal pleasure and spirituality, and though some consider it a place of worship, this view conflicts with Salafist interpretations of Islamic ritual. While the cave plays an important role in As-Sīrah an-Nabawiyyah (The Prophetic Biography), it is not considered as holy as other sites in Mecca, such as Al-Haram Mosque, and so under most interpretations of Islam, the same reward is received for praying here as any other place in Mecca. Before Muhammad's first revelation, he was said to have pleasant dreams. Among these dreams were signs that his Prophethood was starting to appear, and signs that the stones in Mecca would greet him with the Salaam. These dreams lasted for six months. An increasing need for solitude led Mohammed to seek seclusion and meditation in the rocky hills which surrounded Mecca. There he would retreat to the cave for one month, each year, engaging in taḥannuth (). He would take provisions along with him during this retreat, and would feed the poor that would come to him. Then before returning home to his family for more provisions he would circumambulate the Kaaba seven times, or however many times Allah willed; then he would go home.

Kan ar Bobl (Breton for Song of the people) is a Breton music competition created in 1973, that takes place in Lorient as part of the Festival Interceltique de Lorient. It was the brainchild of Polig Montjarret. Presentation At the time of the festival's inauguration, Celtic music was quite popular, with Alan Stivell, Dan Ar Braz, Glenmor and Gilles Servat being big names in the field. Quickly, its success had put pressure on the organisers to hold local heats all over Brittany before the final (1975). This formula is still in use today, and offers the advantage that only the best musicians can play at the final. Since 1993, the festivities have been held in Pontivy (Morbihan), and in 1997 it was passed into the hands of its eponym. Since 1990, a \\"Grand Prix of Kan ar Bobl\\" is given to the winners of different competitions. In 2005, the Kanit ta bugale trophy was set up, in honour of Polig Montjarret, who died in 2003. The Kan ar Bobl festival marks an important date in the Breton cultural diary as it boasts a meet-up of hundreds of musicians and singers in the region who play an active part in the conservation of Brittany's rich musical heritage. Many bands have been formed after meeting there, including Storvan, Denez Prigent, Yann-Fañch Kemener and Ar Re Yaouank. The competition The Kan ar Bobl's aim is to conserve and transmit musical patrimony throughout different areas of Brittany, but also to inspire new original forms. The heats take place in different areas of Brittany, and the participants must perform in front of judges. The musicians may compete in more than category, and may even perform in different locations if needs be. The chosen artists take part in the final, held in Pontivy where they must perform again.

As an anthropologist, she has argued for the open adoption and acknowledgement of the subjective nature of research and participant-observers. She is a recipient of the Belpré Medal. Life and work Behar was born in Havana, Cuba in 1956 to a Jewish-Cuban family of Sephardic Turkish, and Ashkenazi Polish and Russian ancestry. She was four when her family immigrated to the US following Fidel Castro's gaining power in the revolution of 1959. More than 94% of Cuban Jews left the country at that time,\\"Cuba\\", Jewish Virtual Library together with many others of the middle and upper classes. Behar attended local schools and studied as an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, receiving her B.A. in 1977. She studied cultural anthropology at Princeton University, earning her doctorate in 1983. She travels regularly to Cuba and Mexico to study aspects of culture, as well as to investigate her family's roots in Jewish Cuba. She has specialized in studying the lives of women in developing societies. Behar is a professor at the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Her literary work is featured in the Michigan State University's Michigan Writers Series. A writer of anthropology, essays, poetry and fiction, Behar focuses on issues related to women and feminism. = Lucky Broken Girl = Lucky Broken Girl (2017) is multicultural coming-of-age novel for young adults, based on the author's childhood in the 1960s. Ruthie Mizrahi and her family recently emigrated from Castro's Cuba to New York City. Just when she's finally beginning to gain confidence in her mastery of English –and enjoying her reign as her neighborhood's hopscotch queen – a horrific car accident leaves her in a body cast and confined to her bed for a long recovery. As Ruthie's world shrinks because of her inability to move, her powers of observation and her heart grow larger and she comes to understand how fragile life is, how vulnerable we all are as human beings, and how friends, neighbors, and the power of the arts can sweeten even the worst of times. Writing for Cuba Counterpoints, Julie Schwietert Collazo writes, \\"Behar, without fail, always seems to be writing with the goal of honoring her own history, experiences, and feelings, without ever denying or excluding those of others, and in Lucky Broken Girl the achievement of this goal is evident on every page.\\" = Traveling Heavy = Traveling Heavy (2013) is a memoir about her Cuban- American family, descended from both Askenazi and Sephardic Jews in Cuba, as well as the strangers who ease her journey in life. Her probings about her complicated Jewish Cuban ancestry and family's immigration to America explore issues about identity and belonging.: Ruth Behar, Traveling Heavy, Kirkus Reviews Kirkus Reviews described her book as \\"A heartfelt witness to the changing political and emotional landscape of the Cuban-American experience.\\" Behar studies the revitalization of Cuban Jewish life as an anthropologist, but her personal journey back to the island she left as a little girl is the heart of this \\"memoir I snuck in, between journeys.\\"Review: Ruth Behar, Traveling Heavy'\\", Boston Globe, 7 May 2013 = An Island Called Home = An Island Called Home (2007) was written in Behar's quest for a better understanding of Jewish Cuba and particularly her family's roots. She noted, \\"I knew the stories of the Jews in Cuba, but it was all about looking at them as a community\\". Traveling the island, Behar becomes the confidante to a host of Jewish strangers, building connections for further anthropological research. Conducting one-on-one interviews, combined with black-and-white photography, she builds readers an image of the diasporic thread connecting Cuban Jews to one another. Beginning with Jewish immigrants of the 1920s, who fled unrest in Turkey, Russia and Poland, she moves on to stories of later immigrants, Polish and German Jews who fled to Cuba in the 1930s and 1940s in order to escape persecution and the concentration camps of the Nazis. In Cuba immigrants opened mom-and-pop shops, peddled, and gradually adopted Spanish while still speaking Yiddish, settling into Latino life in La Habana Vieja. In the early part of the century, many Jewish immigrants worked in the Cuban garment industry. More than 94% left during and after the 1959 revolution. As her family was among those who left Cuba, Behar intertwines her personal thoughts and feelings with her professional, analytical observations of the current society. = The Vulnerable Observer = The Vulnerable Observer recounts Behar's passage to integrating subjective aspects into her anthropological studies. Suffering her grandfather's death while on a field trip to Spain to study funeral practices, she decided the ethnographer could never be fully detached, and needed to become a \\"vulnerable observer\\". She argues that the ethnographic fieldworker should identify and work though, his or her own emotional involvement with the subject under study. She strongly critiques conventional ideas of objectivity.M. L. DeVault, \\"Book Review: Behar/'The Vulnerable Observer',\\" Contemporary Sociology, 1998 She suggested that the ideal of a \\"scientific,\\" distanced, impersonal mode of presenting materials was incomplete. Other anthropologists, including Claude Levi- Strauss, Georges Devereux, and Clifford Geertz, had also suggested that the researcher had to claim being part of the process more openly. Behar's six personal essays in The Vulnerable Observer are examples of her subjective approach. Behar's grandparents emigrated to Cuba from Russia, Poland and Turkey during the 1920s. In 1962 they fled Cuba to escape Castro's communism. At the age of nine, Behar suffered a broken leg from the crash of her family's car. She was immobilized for a year. The experience and recovery period led her to the recognition that \\"the body is a homeland\\" of stored memory and pain. = Translated Woman = In 1985, Behar was working in Mexico when she befriended an Indian witch working as a street peddler. Townspeople said the witch, Esperanza Hernandez, had used black magic to blind her ex-husband after he regularly beat her and then left her for his mistress. Behar's portrayal of Esperanza's story in Translated Woman suggests she alienated her own mother, inspiring Behar to portray Esperanza as a feminist heroine. Esperanza claims she found redemption in a spiritualist cult constructed around Pancho Villa. She blamed pent-up rage about her husband and life as the reason for the deaths in infancy of the first six of her 12 children. Esperanza's rage led her to beat up her husband's lover, throw her son out of the house, beat a daughter for refusing to support her, and disown another son for having an affair with an uncle's ex-mistress because she considered it to be incestuous. Behar reflects on her own life and begins to think that her Latina-gringa conflicts result from a feeling of loss after having tried to model herself according to the American Dream, thus losing some sense of her Cuban Jewish family's past in that island nation.B. Sanchez, \\"Book Review: 'Translated Woman',\\" Hispanic Magazine, 1993 Esperanza's odyssey examines physical borders, margins and separations. Translated Woman contributes to the feminist argument that studying women in anthropology has been undervalued due to traditional academic prejudices that view women-centered analysis as too personally biased.E.

He was the Speaker of the Ontario Legislature from 1981 to 1985. Background Turner was born and educated in Peterborough, Ontario. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force as a Pilot Officer from 1942 to 1945, and later worked as a business manager. He was an alderman for Peterborough, Ontario City Council from 1969 to 1971, and also served on the city health board. On March 31, 2014, Jeff Leal, Peterborough MPP and Minister of Rural Affairs announced that 55 km of Highway 115 from Peterborough to the 401 MacDonald-Cartier Freeway was dedicated as the John M. Turner Memorial Highway in honour of Turner's service to his country, province and community. Turner was a member of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, and a member of the Peterborough Rotary Club. Politics In 1971, Turner was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party incumbent Walter Pitman by 590 votes in the Peterborough constituency. He served as a backbench supporter of Bill Davis's government for the next four years, and lost to NDP candidate Gillian Sandeman by 505 votes in the 1975 election. Turner defeated Sandeman by 2,648 votes in the 1977 election. He defeated Liberal Party candidate Peter Adams by 6,699 votes in the 1981 election. He was appointed as Speaker of the Legislature on April 21, 1981. The Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a tenuous minority government under Frank Miller's leadership in the 1985 provincial election. Turner was re-elected in Peterborough, but was replaced as Speaker by Liberal Hugh Edighoffer when the Tories lost control of the legislature after the election. Turner served as an opposition member for the next two years, and did not seek re-election in 1987.

He was a member of New York colonial assembly from 1726 until 1727. Early life and family Robert Livingston was born on the afternoon of July 24, 1688 at his father's Albany, New York townhouse, at \\"Elm Tree Corner\\", the intersection of State and Pearl Streets and one of early Albany's principal crossroads.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Elm Tree Corner\\", New York State Museum He was the fifth child, and third son, of Alida (née Schuyler) Van Rensselaer Livingston and Robert Livingston the Elder, who was downriver in New York engaged in business with Governor Dongan at the time of Robert's birth. Among his eight siblings were elder brother Philip Livingston and younger brother Gilbert Livingston. His maternal grandfather was Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628–1683) and his paternal grandfather was Reverend John Livingston, a Church of Scotland minister who died in exile in 1673. His mother, Alida, had previously been married to Nicholas van Rensselaer, but after his death, she married Robert Livingston in 1679. Alida taught her children to read and write both English and Dutch. At the invitation of his brother William, Robert the Elder sent his eleven-year-old son, Robert, to Scotland to be educated at the Latin school in Leith. Later he studied at the High School in Edinburgh. He went to London for the completion of his education and studied law there at the Temple. Upon reaching the age of twenty-five, he returned to America and opened a law office in Albany. He abandoned the profession in 1713 to move to New York and begin a mercantile career. However, he returned to Livingston Manor to help with the management thereof.Naramore, Bruce. \\"That 'Witty Boy': Robert Livingston, the Builder of Clermont\\", Clermont State Historic Site Clermont Hudson view from Clermont Manor Following the death of his father, the first Lord of Livingston Manor, in 1728, most of the manor was inherited by the eldest surviving son Philip, but 13,000 acres (53 km²) south of the Roeliff Jansen Kill was willed to Robert. Known as the \\"Lower Manor\\", Robert named his estate \\"Ancram\\", after the parish where his grandfather, Rev. John Livingston had served. It was also the same name his brother Philip had given to the ironworks at Livingston Manor. Around 1730, Robert built a large stone and brick Georgian house, and sometime after 1740 renamed the estate \\"Clare Mount\\" (\\"clear mountain\\"), a reference to the view of the Catskills that rise across the river from the front door of the house. At that time Robert was heavily involved in land speculation in the Catskill Mountains land, and would eventually own nearly 500,000 acres.\\"The Clermont Estate\\", Town of Clermont After the house was burned by the British in 1777, the family adopted the name Clermont.\\"A Brief History of Clermont\\", Friends of Clermont The house was rebuilt by his daughter-in-law, Margaret Beekman Livingston, wife of Judge Livingston, and is today a state park and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Personal life In 1717, he married Margaret Howarden (1693-1758), at the Reformed Dutch Church in New York. His mother, Alida, did not attend. Margaret was the daughter of a wealthy English merchant in New York and granddaughter of Captain Bethlow, a Huguenot after whom Bedloe's Island is named. Bedloe's Island, in New York harbor is now known as Liberty Island and the site of the Statue of Liberty. Their only child was: *Robert R. Livingston (1718–1775), who married Margaret Beekman, daughter of Henry Beekman and Janet Livingston. Margaret died in December 1758 and was interred in a burial vault constructed 200 yards north of the Livingston family home at Clermont. Livingston died on June 27, 1775 at the age of 87 and was buried with his wife in the family vault. Upon his death, the \\"Lower Manor\\" became the property of his only child, Robert R. Livingston, or Judge Livingston as he was known in Provincial New York. =Descendants= His grandson, Edward Livingston (1764–1836) described Robert of Clermont at eighty-four as: \\"... a gentleman... tall and somewhat bent, but not emaciated by age which had marked, but not disfigured, a face once remarkable for its regular beauty of features, and still beaming with the benevolence and intelligence that had always illuminated it. He marked the epoch at which he retired from the world by preserving its costume: the flowing wool powered wig, the bright brown coat, with large cuffs and square shirts, the cut velvet waistcoast, with ample flaps and the breeches scarcely covering the knee, the silk stocking, rolled over them with embroidered clocks, and shining square-toed shoes, fastened near the ankle and small embossed gold buckles. These were retained in his service, not to affect a singularity, but because he thought it ridiculous at his time of life to follow the quick succession of fashion.\\" He always rose at five and read until breakfast. The year before his death, he took up the study of German and spoke it fluently. \\"The patriarch of Clermont was in many ways the spoiled younger son of the self-made man. A failure in the law, in business, and in the eyes of his own parents, he nonetheless entered his final years with the satisfaction that he had not only maintained the estate passed on to him by his father, but had increased it 40-fold through his speculation in Catskill Mountain lands.\\" ReferencesSee also *Livingston family Category:1688 births Category:1775 deaths Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American people of Scottish descent Robert (1688-1775) Category:Members of the New York Provincial Assembly Category:Speakers of the New York General Assembly Category:Members of the New York General Assembly Category:People of colonial New York Category:Schuyler family ","title":"Robert Livingston (1688–1775)"},{"id":"2498552","text":"Yalkaparidontia is an order of extinct Australian marsupials, first described in 1988 and known only from the Oligo-Miocene deposits of Riversleigh, northwestern Queensland, Australia.Archer M; Hand, Suzanne J. & Godthelp H. [1991] 2000. Australia's lost world: Riversleigh, World Heritage Site. Reed, Sydney. p94 \\"Thingodonta: off the scale of the unexpected\\". A single genus, Yalkaparidon (from an aboriginal word for boomerang, alluding to the boomerang shape of its molars when seen in occlusal view, and the Greek word for tooth) and two species, Y. coheni and Y. jonesi, have so far been described. Numerous isolated teeth and jaw bones of Yalkaparidon are known, but only a single skull (of Y. coheni) has so far been recovered. These specimens of Yalkaparidon exhibit a melange of characters: the molars are zalambdodont (a distinctive tooth type also found in the marsupial mole Notoryctes, the living placental 'insectivores' Solenodon, tenrecs and golden moles, as well as a number of fossil groups); the incisors are very large and hypselodont (open- rooted and hence ever-growing, similar to those of rodents); the basicranial region of the only known skull is very primitive, somewhat similar to those of plesiomorphic bandicoots. The zalambdodont molars appear to link it to notoryctid marsupial moles, but detailed study of the teeth of these two groups suggests that they have evolved independently, and Yalkaparidon is anatomically otherwise very different from the marsupial moles. The incisors resemble those of diprotodontians, but no other features convincingly support this relationship, and the convergent evolution of such incisors in South American 'pseudodiprotodont' groups (such as caenolestids and polydolopimorphians) suggests that Yalkaparidon and diprotodontians may have evolved similar incisors independently. Basicranial similarities to bandicoots most likely represent shared plesiomorphic characters, and hence are not indicative of a close relationship. For these reasons, Yalkaparidon is currently placed in its own family, Yalkaparidontidae, and order, Yalkaparidontia; this placement would make this the only order of Australian marsupials known to have gone extinct. However, Frederick Szalay suggested in his 1994 book 'Evolutionary History of the Marsupials and an Analysis of Osteological Characters' that Yalkaparidon is indeed a diprotodontian (as evinced by its incisors), albeit one that retains a highly primitive basicranium. The exact function of its unusual dentition remains obscure, and suggestions that it may have fed on worms (based on the similarities of its molars to those of worm-eating tenrecs), caterpillars or eggs are tenuous. However, its source of food presumably had a hard outer covering (necessitating use of the large incisors) but relatively soft interior, as zalambdodont molars cannot crush food items. The possibility that it was a \\"mammalian woodpecker\\" similar to the aye-aye and striped possum has been raised. Future insights into the evolutionary relationships, functional morphology and lifestyle of Yalkaparidon must await more detailed study. It remains one of the most enigmatic members of Australia's unique mammalian fauna. A detailed study on its morphology, including newly referred astralgus material published in 2014 found that it was likely a crown group marsupial, and probably an australidelphian, but its unusual morphology made its precise placement uncertain.

Aligaz had four sons: Dejazmach Birru, Dejazmach Gobeze, Dejazmach Faris, and Dejazmach Gojjee.

In Weld Blundell's translation of Tekle Giyorgis' Royal Chronicles, Azaj Dagale and Kantiba Ayadar were given credit for bringing Hezqeyas down from Wehni. H. Weld Blundell, The Royal chronicle of Abyssinia, 1769-1840 (Cambridge: University Press, 1922), pp. 392f Despite lacking any effective base of support, Tekle Giyorgis remained a thorn in Aligaz's side for the following years, even releasing his kindred from the Imperial prison at Wehni in 1789.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 399, 405 Aligaz eventually gets control of Tekle Giyorgis when, after two years of living as a shifta, the Emperor came to Aligaz seeking his support but instead was imprisoned at Emakina.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, p. 412 Tekle Giyorgis, however, was not Aligaz's only problem. For much of the first year of Hezqeyas' rule Aligaz could not directly intervene to support this emperor because he had his hands full consolidating his own position amongst the Yejju, which included the opposition from members of his own family such as Dejazmach Alula, the Fitawrari Sadiq, and the Jantirar Yasufe.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, p. 393 Crummey records a tradition that Aligaz had wronged his sister Kafay, an injury which might help to explain the apparent conflict between Aligaz and his nephews Gugsa and Alula, for whom he generally appears to be their primary patron.Donald Crummey, \\"Family and Property amongst the Amhara Nobility\\", Journal of African History, special issue: The History of the Family in Africa, 24 (1983), p. 218 Further once Tekle Giyorgis was safely out of the picture, his puppet Emperor Hezqeyas met with Abuna Yosab and Ichege Wolde Iyasus where all agreed that they would \\"not submit to the Galla\\" -- a clear reference to either Aligaz or his family; the Royal Chronicle records that later that year a battle was fought near Gondar where the Emperor and the two leaders of the Ethiopian church were defeated. \\"And on the coming of the Galla all that was what was done.\\"Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 421f Then, in an attempt to overthrow Aligaz, Haile Wand Bewossen freed Tekle Giyorgis in 1793, after the Emperor had been confined for two years and eight months.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, p. 424 Tekle Giyorgis then marched against his rival Emperor, Hezqeyas, who was dwelling at Gondar; Hezqeyas left Gondar and sought the help of Dejazmach Haile Eshte, and they were joined by Aligaz. A series of battles followed that year, which led to Heqzeyas fleeing alone to Dengel Ber.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 427f These defeats also led to Ras Aligaz's fall from leadership of the Yejju. When Hezqeyas returns to Gondar in late 1793 at the head of an army, his supporters include Dejazmach Gugsa, the nephew of Aligaz. After fourteen years as Enderase, Ras Aligaz Gwangul died in 1803 due to an illness. His period of rule was punctuated by significant civil wars and as a result, he did not exercise complete authority continuously throughout his years as Enderase. Ras Asrat and Ras Wolde Gabriel scored decisive victories against him, and at one point, had pushed him out of Begemeder which they ruled for some time.

The uncorrupted form, \\"Bienyup\\" received mention in surveyor Robert Austin's account of an expedition through the area in 1848.Coy, N.J.; The Serpentine: a history of the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale, Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale, 1984; pp.17,181 In 1920, the name of the township was changed to Byford. 260x260px History Little has been documented of the Aboriginal occupation of the Byford area, but material traces of the district's original inhabitants have been found in numerous locations. The foothills were on the periphery of Thomas Peel's 1834 land grant and during the 1840s European settlers took up small land holdings in the area.A journal entry by the Reverend J.R.Wollaston dated 1853 reports favourably on the quality of Wongong Farm, noting that land of this quality \\"prevails for many miles along the range, and I am surprised it has not been more sought out and located.

Apart from these title holders, J.W.Davey is shown as owning 160 acres on the north side of Cardoup Brook and S.Jones as owning 50 acres immediately north of this, bounded to the north by Beenyup Brook. Mead was an enterprising farmer with numerous landholdings in the foothills between the Serpentine River and the Wongong Brook,Carter, J & B; Settlement to City: A history of the Armadale district and its people; City of Armadale, 2011, pp. 341-344. and at East Rockingham.Taggart, N; Rockingham Looks Back: A History of the Rockingham District 1829-1982; Rockingham District Historical Society (Inc.), 1984, p. 49. The district had an entirely rural population until the early part of the 20th century. Brickmaking contributed much to the development of Byford. Shale at Cardup had already come to the attention of colonists by the 1850s, but it was not until around the turn of the 20th century that a commercial brickmaking venture commenced at Cardup. In 1903, John Millard (a former manager of the Bunning Bros brickworks in East Perth) established The Cardup Steam Pressed Brick Company. Two years later, he entered into partnership with Atkins and Law, a rising giant in Western Australia's commercial world. With an injection of capital from Atkins and Law, the brickworks grew to become one of the state's leading producers of pressed shale brick.Moore, B.; From the ground up: Bristile, Whittakers and Metro Brick in Western Australian history, University of Western Australia Press, 1987; pp.42-47 A second major brickworks was set up at Beenup, north of Cardup, in 1913. This industry was a state government initiative aimed at reducing the cost of worker housing. Like the brickworks operating at Cardup and Armadale, this one exploited the shale deposits of the escarpment to produce high quality pressed brick and used the railway to transport the finished product to customers. The State Brickworks at Byford closed down in 1964, due in part to its operations being eclipsed by a new brickworks in Armadale.Coy, 1984; pp.181, 183 The Cardup brickworks closed in 2012,The West Australian, 28 March 2012 but much of the infrastructure is still extant. Shortly after the brickworks had been established at Beenup, local land owner Mr C C Blythe (of Blythewood Park Estate) initiated the planning of another townsite on the eastern side of the rail line - a convenient distance from the brickworks and highway. The new townsite, which is now the most established part of Byford, has a distinctive square plan in which are centred two concentric circles, long diagonal roads, and short perpendicular roads. Blythe gave the new settlement a hall. A new name for the township was chosen by residents in 1919 and gazetted the following year.Popham, D.; First stage south: a history of the Armadale-Kelmscott district, Western Australia; p.109. Anglican and Presbyterian churches and a state school were among the first community buildings erected in Byford. The original 1906 township was located south-west of the intersection of Soldiers Road and Mead StreetState Records Office plan: Cons 5698 Item 0306 but it appears that little if any housing was built in that area until much later in the 20th century.Popham, 1980; p. 109. An aerial photograph of Byford taken 10 June 1949 shows the 1906 townsite undeveloped (and still cloaked in native vegetation) except the recreation reserve which had a race track However, the 1906 townsite included an allocation of land for recreation which is still used for that purpose today. Construction of the South Western Railway reached the district in 1892. Some time later a stop bearing the name Beenup was established in the vicinity of the present day township. In 1957 a station was established on the line between Abernethy Road and Mead Street.Coy, 1984; p.190 After a long period of disuse, this station was demolished around 1990. The current Byford station is located just south of this. It is served by Transwa's twice daily Australind service from Perth to Bunbury.Australind Timetable Transwa Employment provided by the State Brickworks, the Cardup Brickworks, and the munition works (i.e. the Royal Australian Navy Armament Depot) that were established between Nettleton Road and the Cardup Brook in 1942The West Australian, 4 October 1945; p.9; see also webpage: http://users.tpg.com.au/borclaud/ranad/about_byford.html were significant factors contributing to growth of the township of Byford. It was also a service town for a number of mill communities in the hills to the east and south-east, as well as a thriving rural community. In 1977, the local government responsibilities for Byford were transferred from the Shire of Armadale-Kelmscott (now the City of Armadale) to the Shire of Serpentine- Jarrahdale.Carter, 2011, pp. 341-344. Recently, Byford has become an extension of the Perth metropolitan area, connected to the Kwinana Freeway by Thomas Road, and has experienced a substantial rise in population. Historically, Byford's rural land supported sheep, beef and dairy cattle, orchards, and a vineyard (Sunrays, owned by the Vlasich family),Government Gazette of Western Australia, 12 January 1962, p 132: Notice indicating the dissolution of the family business as at 30 June 1960. but in recent decades there has been an increase in hobby farms geared to equine pursuits, and more recently housing estates with generous lot sizes. The new subdivision \\"Byford on the Scarp\\" was constructed on the long time disused Navy Armament Depot. The depot was closed in 1981 and its functions relocated to Garden Island. After standing empty and neglected for many years, the storage bunkers and other depot buildings were progressively demolished, this work being complete in 2000. Traces of the rail infrastructure that once served the depot and brickworks still are visible today. Today, Byford is a town with most of the amenities and conveniences that one comes to expect in Australia, including halls, two state schools, clubs, sporting oval, trotting complex, a range of shops and businesses, a flour mill, and farms in the surrounding rural areas. A Free Reformed Church was opened on the corner of Soldiers Road and Mead Street in 1987, and a private school was later built alongside this church.

The Jewish community in Cologne has the longest history in Germany, being first mentioned in 321. Expelled in 1424, the Jews did not return to Cologne until 1798. In 1815 the community numbered 150, growing to 8000 in 1895, and 18,281 by 1933, the largest in Germany after Berlin. The foundation stone of the Neo-Romanesque style building, designed by Cologne architects Schreiterer & Below, was laid on October 23, 1895, and the inauguration took place on March 22, 1899. Like all the other synagogues on the city it was attacked and set alight on the night of November 9, 1938, known as Kristallnacht, the nationwide attacks on Jewish businesses and synagogues. It was further damaged during World War Two, with the front portion was completely destroyed leaving only the burnt out tower and central section. Returned to the surviving Jewish community in 1945, in the late 1950s they decided to completely rebuild, as it was the only one not completely destroyed. The reconstruction was under the direction of the architect Helmut Goldschmidt, with minor changes on the outside and a simplified interior (with new leadlight windows by Lammers & Warzager), and was reopened on September 20, 1959. On Christmas Eve of that year, the Synagogue was smeared with anti-Jewish slogans by members of the far-right German Reich Party. West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who had been mayor of Cologne from 1917 until removed by the Nazi government in 1933, made the desecration the subject in his New Year's speech. Since then it has been center of Jewish community of Cologne, and consists of a community center, a small display of items associated with Cologne Jewry, and a kosher restaurant. The interior of the reconstructed synagogue has a vast blue dome. On August 19, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI visited Roonstrasse Synagogue.

According to Abir, he founded the town of Debre Tabor, which became the capital of his dynasty.Mordechai Abir, Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769–1855), (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 30 However, from the accounts in the Royal chronicle Ali is never mentioned as dwelling at Debre Tabor, instead he is more closely tied to Filakit Gereger (called Garagara in the Royal chronicle).Herbert Weld Blundell, The Royal chronicle of Abyssinia, 1769–1840 (Cambridge: University Press, 1922), pp. 357–374, passim  Life  One of the first steps in the advancement of Ali's career came in August 1781 when the Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I summoned him to his court and made him Balambaras.Balambaras originally meant \\"Gentleman of the Wardrobe\\", but by this point had become the title of the commissioned officer of a battalion or regimental-sized unit. Two years later, while still a Balambaras he took part in the Emperor's abortive march on Shewa, which failed to cross the Checheho River.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 269, 292 Ten months later, Ali joined Ras Haile Yosadiq and together conspired to depose the emperor, defeating him at Afarwanat, after which Tekle Giyorgis fled into exile at Amba Sel. Subsequently, the two nobles brought Iyasu Atsequ down from Wehni and made him Emperor 18 February 1784; in return, Ali was promoted to Dejazmach.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 341f Ali took several steps to consolidate his position and prepare his way to the next rank of power, Ras Betowedded. One was to offer his niece Anqualit to the influential Dejazmach Hailu Eshte of Begemder. This alliance led to conflict between Ali and his former ally Ras Haile Yosadiq, and to Ali's decision to recall the Emperor Tekle Haymanot from exile in 1786 and restored him to power; in response, Ras Haile Yosadiq prudently provided a refuge to the deposed Emperor Iyasu in Gojjam.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 349, 357, 359 Another one was the systematic capture of the ambas of Balambaras Ramkha, which ended with the Balambaras' death in the sack of his base at Limon.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 361f Shortly after this, Ali was released from the excommunication that had been placed on him, and kept the feast of St. Gabriel the Archangel.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, p. 365 A third step, which was not unique to Ali but taken by many of the warlords of the time, was to dissolve or reorganize the existing military units and create new ones, and granting them lands to support the soldiers.

Ras Ali defeated this opponents; Dejazmach Wolde Gabriel was killed in battle and the pretender Baeda Maryam was captured. Only Ras Haile Yosadiq managed to escape the battle back to his territories in Gojjam.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 387–390 Ras Ali died from an illness at Filakit Gereger, which the writer of the Royal chronicle claims was caused by his heavy drinking, and was buried at Lalibela.Weld Blundell, Royal chronicle, pp. 391f  Notes  Category:1788 deaths Category:18th-century Ethiopian people Category:Warlords of the Zemene Mesafint Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Ali I of Yejju"},{"id":"2498585","text":"Philip Wallace Hiden (April 5, 1872 – October 25, 1936) was a businessman and mayor of Newport News, Virginia. Hiden, whose earlier ancestors from Watford, England used the spelling Hyden, was born in Orange, Virginia. He married Martha (née Woodroof) Hiden (1888–1959). Philip W. Hiden owned the Hiden Storage and Forwarding Company and was a local land baron, owning most of the land in and around Nutmeg Quarter in Warwick County, Virginia. He served as the mayor of the independent city of Newport News from 1920 to 1924. He was the first mayor to serve under a new City Council-City Manager form of government, as opposed to being directly elected. Hiden was also an organizer and director of the James River Bridge Corporation, a privately owned company which funded and built the new James River Bridge and two other toll bridges along U.S. Route 17 between Newport News and Portsmouth which opened in 1928. In combination with the separately owned Norfolk and Portsmouth Bridge, later renamed the Jordan Bridge for founding South Norfolk businessman Carl Jordan, they formed a land and bridge route for automobiles as an alternative to several ferry systems.

History In 1835 Stephen Henty and Thomas Peel were the first Europeans to visit the area, being guided through the reaches of the Harvey River by local Aboriginal people. Cookernup's name derives from an Aboriginal name meaning \\"the place of the swamp hen\\" (cooki). The first settler, Joseph Logue, came to the area in 1852 with his extended family in search of good farming land, acquiring a 9,000 ha grant which he called Kookernup. He later settled on the north bank of a nearby brook, now called Logue Brook. The area was important in the milling and transport of local timber, with a railway reserve being constructed for timber stacking. In the early 1890s, Cookernup had a much greater population than Harvey, and had a school and telegraph office several years earlier. The population of the town was 59 (35 males and 24 females) in 1898. Present day Cookernup is a small agricultural town with services offered from nearby Harvey, and there have been applications for subdivision in the area. However, a 5 km buffer zone around the Alcoa Wagerup alumina refinery was doubled by the Health Department following the approval of a $1.5 billion expansion to the refinery. In August 2008, Alcoa had bought over 40 local properties. As of 2015, Alcoa's purchases made little to no impact to Cookernup, with the majority of properties being purchased in nearby Yarloop. Cookernup has experienced steady growth in recent years, with several houses being built a year. Cookernup has a fire brigade, town hall, general store, large exercise area and playground. Nearby Logue Brook Dam (6 km to the east), set in jarrah forests on the western boundary of the Murray State Forests, has a number of camping, accommodation and recreational facilities, and offers bushwalking, horse-riding, waterskiing, canoeing and ropes courses. Warawarrup (5 km to the south) is a small village and home to the Harvey Trotting Track. It was originally planned as a growth area, but the growth failed to eventuate.

It is a Protestant church affiliated with the United Church of Canada. It is located at 463 Saint Catherine Street West between Saint Alexandre and City Councillors Streets (McGill metro station), in the borough of Ville-Marie. It was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996. The Gothic Revival church was designed by Montreal architect Alexander Francis Dunlop. It is noteworthy for its false apse housing church offices and for its Casavant Frères organ. History When it was built in June 1889, it was the largest Methodist church in Canada, with 2,000 seats; it was nicknamed the \\"Cathedral Church of Methodism.\\" It now belongs to the United Church of Canada, into which the Canadian Methodists merged in 1925. Its congregation founded the first YMCA in North America on November 25, 1851 (before the present church building was built) and led an active campaign for women's suffrage early in the 20th century. A World War I memorial window (1924) by Charles William Kelsey depicting a trench scene at St. James United Church (Montreal) was dedicated to 32 members who were killed overseas and 267 others who served in the Great War. The side lights represent the cardinal virtues, Justice, Prudence, Temperance and Fortitude. In 1927, to cover upkeep costs, the church permitted a commercial building to be built in front of its Sainte Catherine Street façade. The building, adjoining the church's structure, concealed the church for over 78 years, the church itself being announced by a large neon sign. In 2005, as part of an $8-million restoration effort sponsored by the city of Montreal and the Quebec government, a portion of the commercial buildings were demolished, once again revealing the facade of the church as well as a new public square designed by Quebec architect Claude Cormier..

Harvey Town is known for its dairy industry and oranges.https://www.australiassouthwest.com/destination/harvey History Harvey's name is derived from the nearby Harvey River, named by Governor James Stirling in 1829, soon after the river's discovery by explorers Alexander Collie and Lieutenant William Preston RN. Although not positively known, the river is most likely named after Rear Admiral John Harvey. In 1817–18, Harvey was Commander in Chief of the West Indies Station - Stirling served under him while in charge of HMS Brazen, and Harvey recommended him for promotion. Stirling named a number of Western Australian features after his former navy colleagues. According to James Battye, Stirling selected known as Wellington Location 50A and established the Harvey River Settlement. The only improvement he made to the land, as far as is known, was the erection of a hunting lodge near the present town of Harvey, known as \\"The Hut\\", featuring a shingled roof, jarrah walls and hexagonal paving blocks. In the 1880s, this hut became the childhood home of children's author May Gibbs. Stirling called the area around the town of Harvey \\"Korijekup\\", using the Noongar name meaning \\"place of the red-tailed black cockatoo\\". Uduc Road, Harvey, at dusk The area was settled slowly over the remainder of the 1800s. During the 1860s, Australind, originally the site of a failed grandiose settlement scheme, was the centre of the Harvey District community. In 1863, a road was gazetted from Pinjarra to Brunswick Junction, which was built by convicts between 1864 and 1876 - it was called the \\"foothills route\\" and later became the South Western Highway. Harvey was developed as a private town in the 1890s by a group of investors following the opening of a railway station there in 1893. However, Cookernup, little more than a railway stop today, had a greater population, and had a telegraph office and school years before Harvey. The population of the town was 93 (66 males and 27 females) in 1898. In 1926 the Harvey Road Board sought the declaration of a townsite, but this did not occur until 1938. In February 2006, EG Green & Sons, the owner of the Harvey Beef brand since 1919 and responsible for about 90% of Western Australia's beef exports, went into administration. In April, however, the brand was rescued by a new consortium who acquired EG Green & Sons and recreated it as Harvey Industries. In 2010, Harvey gained national attention when 19-year-old Jessica Moloney became a finalist in the popular Fox8 show Australia's Next Top Model. She came in fourth place in Cycle 6 of the series. Harvey Internment Camp Shrine Present day South Western Highway leaving Harvey The town is the seat of the Shire of Harvey and is the centre of the Western Australian dairy industry. It contains a hospital, agricultural college, vocational college and the headquarters of Harvey Fresh, Harvey Beef and Harvey Cheese.

On 7 January 2016 the residents of the town were urged to evacuate immediately by Western Australia's Department of Fire and Emergency Services due to an approaching bushfire. Patients at the Harvey District Hospital were evacuated to nearby hospitals along with residents from local nursing homes. On the evening of 8 January, after catastrophic losses in nearby Yarloop, the fire was threatening the town. Harvey was evacuated late on the afternoon of 9 January, but conditions eased the following day and the alert level was downgraded.

Plasmin is an important factor in fibrinolysis, the breakdown of fibrin polymers formed during blood clotting. There are two main plasminogen activators: urokinase (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Tissue plasminogen activators are used to treat medical conditions related to blood clotting including embolic or thrombotic stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism. Plasminogen activators are inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, and protein C inhibitor.  Function  Produced mainly in the liver, plasminogen is the inactive zymogen form of plasmin, and circulates in plasma in a closed conformation that cannot be activated. Binding clots or cell surface causes its conformation to change, allowing it to be activated by plasminogen activators. Plasminogen activators do so by cleaving the R561/V562 peptide bond, producing the active protein plasmin, which catalyzes the degradation of fibrin polymers that make up the structure of blood clots. 3-dimensional structure of tPA 3-dimensional structure of uPA  Inhibition  The main inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase is plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is a serine protease, synthesized by endothelial cells, that specifically inhibits tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA). Tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase are the activators of plasminogen and results in the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis). PAI-1 levels has also been studied in patients and how they influence certain diseases. Elevated serum levels of PAI-1 have been found in obese individuals. Elevated levels of PAI-1 also seem to increase the risk of atherothrombotic events and may also promote vascular disease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) is also a serine protease that inactivates tPA and uPA. PAI-2 is produced by the placenta and only found in high quantities in the blood during pregnancy.  Factors  Factor XIa and XIIa are two main factors involved in the plasminogen activator. Factor XI (FXI) is a serine protase produced by the liver and circulates in its inactive form. Deficiency in factor XI is known to cause hemophilia C. Factor XIIa is another plasma protein that is involved in the activation of zymogen factor is activated into factor XIa. This activation is important to the coagulation cascade.  Applications  Due to its contribution to fibrinolysis, tissue plasminogen activator is used medically to treat blood clot-related disorders including thrombotic or embolic stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism. It is manufactured using recombinant techniques and is sold as alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. Alteplase was the first of these versions to go on the market, and has the same exact structure as tPA. Reteplase and tenecteplase both received FDA approval after alteplase, and have nonidentical structures to tPA. These recombinant forms of tPA have been shown to have a longer half-life in the blood and a greater resistance to inhibition, resulting in an increased capacity to treat thrombolytic diseases. Urokinase is similarly used in the medical field, specifically for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.  Plasminogen Activator Role in Breast Cancer  Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 not only functions as an inhibitor, but other roles of PAI-1 could suggest it could contribute to cancer. The other roles of PAI-1 include, cell de-adhesion, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell signaling. These roles could suggest that PAI-1 expression in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor cell progression. Urokinase cleaves the zymogen plasminogen into serine protease plasmin. The elevated levels of uPA is an indicator of cancer which could be found in the carcinoma of the breast. Plasmin can activate matrix metalloproteases (MMP's) in the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMP activation contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis by degradation of ECM components.

In June 1995, the company sold its remaining stake in Sonat Offshore division to stockholders.Sonat to Sell Stake in Offshore Drilling Unit, New York Times, June 22, 1995 On November 23, 1997, Sonat expanded its Exploration and Production division by acquiring Zilkha Energy for $1.3 billion.Sonat Announces Acquisition of Zilkha Energy, PR Newswire, November 23, 1997 Merger with El Paso In March 1999, Sonat announced it was merging with El Paso Corporation in a $6 billion deal in an effort for El Paso to maintain competition in the natural gas markets. At the time of the merger, Sonat was a Fortune 500 company. The E&P; unit, Sonat Exploration Company, was blended into El Paso's organization, and the gas transmission unit, Southern Natural Gas Company, is still headquartered in the Birmingham area. Sonat divisions Sonat, Inc.'s corporate headquarters and several of its divisions were located in Birmingham, Alabama, in the AmSouth-Sonat Tower. Sonat also had offices in Houston, Oklahoma City, Washington D.C., New York City, and London. By 1999, the company's divisions consisted of natural gas distribution, natural gas marketing, and exploration and production. =Southern Natural Gas Company= Southern Natural Gas Company, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, was Sonat's natural gas transmission division. The division owned the Sea Robin Pipeline and 50% of Florida Gas Transmission. Sonat sold the Sea Robin Pipeline in 1999 as a requirement to complete its merger with El Paso. After being acquired by El Paso in 1999, Southern Natural continued to operate as a separate division and kept its corporate headquarters in the AmSouth-Sonat Tower until 2007, when it relocated to the Colonial Brookwood Center located in a suburb of Birmingham.Sonat Moves its HQ to Colonial Brookwood, Birmingham Business Journal, March 28, 2008 Publicly owned El Paso Pipeline Partners, which is majority owned by El Paso Corp., owns 60% of the company, with El Paso Corp. owning the remaining 40%. =Sonat Marketing= Sonat Marketing was headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, and was primarily engaged in the marketing of natural gas.

It was headquartered in Houston, Texas. United States.\\"Corporate.\\" El Paso Corp. Retrieved on May 5, 2009. Prior to the takeover by Kinder Morgan, the company owned North America's largest natural gas pipeline system which traveled from border-to- border and coast-to-coast. The pipeline system included Colorado Interstate Gas; El Paso Natural Gas; Southern Natural Gas; Tennessee Gas Pipeline; Cheyenne Plains Pipeline; Mojave Pipeline; Elba Express Pipeline; Young Gas Storage; Wyoming Interstate Company; and Ruby Pipeline. The El Paso Corporation also owned fifty percent of Great Lakes Transmission and Florida Gas Transmission and employed 6,000 people. Florida Gas is part of Southern Natural Gas. In 1999 the company doubled in size when it merged with Birmingham, Alabama based natural gas giant Sonat. It went on to acquire Coastal Corporation in 2001. The company's major offices were located in Houston, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The company's CEO at the time of sale to Kinder Morgan was Douglas L. Foshee. History The company was founded in 1928 by Houston attorney Paul Kayser, who identified the city of El Paso, Texas as a good market for natural gas transported by pipeline from Jal, New Mexico. El Paso owned and operated one of the largest natural gas transmission systems in North America. Its more than 17,000 miles of pipeline connected major gas supply regions throughout the American West and Mexico in the early 1990s and supplied about seven percent of U.S. natural gas demand. In 1992, El Paso was spun off from Burlington Resources., which had operated the company as a subsidiary since 1983. Paul Kayser, a young Houston attorney, founded El Paso Natural Gas in 1928. In 1929, Kayser obtained a franchise from the El Paso City Council to sell natural gas to the city. He proposed construction of a 200-mile pipeline that linked El Paso with natural gas wells located near the city of Jal, New Mexico. After obtaining financing for the ambitious project, he immediately began hiring work crews and securing equipment and supplies. Pipeline construction methods at the time were crude in comparison to techniques developed during the mid-1900s. The lines were built by hand and the men who worked on the lines had to be extremely tough. Difficulties related to building Kayser's pipeline were amplified by the fact that his pipes would cross some of the most difficult terrain in the southwestern United States. The pipeline had to cross 200 miles of rivers, mountains, and deserts and it had to be built to withstand all types of natural disasters. Although the work was tedious and time-consuming, Kayser's crews pioneered new methods of welding, ditching, and crossing unique terrain. The line was finished and put into service in 1930. Unfortunately for Kayser and his fledgling start-up, the Great Depression began shortly after the building of the pipeline. El Paso generated profits of $283,000 during the pipeline's first year of operation but the Depression-era economy threatened to quash the venture. Fortunately, the city of El Paso continued to buy Kayser's gas. The company was able to pay its debts and to expand its pipeline system during the early 1930s. The company built new lines extending to the copper mining areas of southern Arizona and northern Mexico and in 1934 extended service to Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. During the late 1930s, El Paso enjoyed steady growth. It built new pipeline systems extending throughout the oil- and gas-rich Permian Basin in south Texas and extended lines north and west to accommodate growing regional demand. By the late 1930s, the company was generating revenue of about $5 million annually and was beginning to post strong profit gains. Expansion slowed during World War II as the nation's labor and resources were steered toward the war effort. Following the war, El Paso benefitted from strong demand for natural gas in the growing southwestern United States. As the postwar economy and population boomed, cities throughout the region demanded energy sources to fuel growth and development. El Paso experienced explosive growth in the late 1940s. Gains during that period were due in part to the completion of a 700-mile pipeline reaching from El Paso's Permian Basin operations to California. El Paso began supplying gas through a 26-inch pipeline and also began construction of new, larger pipelines aimed at the burgeoning California market. As a result of those efforts, El Paso's assets rose from about $23.5 million in 1945 to $285 million in 1950. Meanwhile, sales increased from $9 million to $41 million and net income climbed to a record $9 million in 1950. During the early 1950s, El Paso continued to post steady gains as demand for its natural gas increased. It built or purchased pipes reaching as far north as Ignacio, a small town in southern Colorado, and continued its westward expansion, bolstering its feeder pipes going to California and increasing sales throughout Arizona and New Mexico. By 1955, El Paso captured nearly $30 million in profits annually from about $180 million in sales. By the early 1960s, those figures had risen to more than $40 million and $400 million, respectively. El Paso's big gains during the late 1950s were partially attributed to its 1957 acquisition of part of the operations of Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corporation. The acquisition gave El Paso a presence in several western and northwestern states, with pipelines reaching as far as Washington and connecting to other companies' networks in Canada. In addition to geographic expansion, El Paso began to diversify during the 1950s into related oil and chemical businesses. It created El Paso Products Company as a subsidiary to manufacture chemicals from natural gas derivatives. Despite forays into other industries, El Paso remained focused on buying, transporting, and selling natural gas. After 35 years, El Paso's founder left his chief executive duties during the early 1960s. The company's president, Howard Boyd, replaced Kayser. Kayser had transformed his company from a tiny start-up supplier with 200 miles of pipeline to a $500 million corporation with 20,000 miles of pipe delivering gas throughout the western United States. Throughout his reign, he remained committed to the pragmatic development of natural resources and sound business practices. \\"There is nothing more vital to our economy than the orderly, wise, and free use of our precious natural resources developed under practical, intelligent conservation policies,\\" Kayser stated in 1954. El Paso continued to grow at a rapid pace during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Although natural gas industry profits were generally cyclical, El Paso's overall sales and earnings grew during the period. By the early 1970s, El Paso operated one of the nation's largest pipeline systems. It stretched from northern Mexico to the northeast tip of Washington, with extensions throughout the Southwest and reaching into Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon. Although federal regulators kept El Paso from operating its own pipes in specified regions, its lines connected with those of other operators to give El Paso access to markets in California, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nevada. Partly in an effort to minimize its exposure to cyclical gas markets, El Paso diversified during the late 1960s and 1970s. By 1974, non-gas operations contributed about one-third of El Paso's annual $1.3 billion in revenues. The company's largest non-gas division was its petrochemical business, which manufactured a variety of chemicals used in the growing synthetics industry. El Paso also became heavily involved in the fiber and textile industries, particularly nylon, rayon, and other synthetics. Other of El Paso's subsidiaries were involved with mining, gas and oil exploration, insurance, copper wire, and real estate development. One of El Paso's most intriguing and promising ventures during the 1970s was a venture into liquefied natural gas. In 1969, El Paso reached what it termed a \\"historic agreement\\" with Sonatrach, an Algerian national oil and gas company. Under the arrangement, the Algerian company would deliver a billion cubic feet of natural gas in liquid form daily to El Paso Natural Gas. El Paso would then distribute the low-cost gas through its pipeline network. The ambitious project required the construction of a nine-ship fleet of special tankers to be owned and operated by El Paso, as well as the construction of storage terminals on the East Coast and in Algeria. El Paso moved 230 employees to Algeria for the project. Liquified gas deliveries commenced in 1978 and made a significant contribution to El Paso's bottom line. Although El Paso's liquified gas venture represented an important success during the 1970s, its non-gas-related operations were generally less fruitful. El Paso jettisoned some of those operations and posted losses from major activities like chemical and fiber manufacturing. To make matters worse, El Paso was harmed by a Supreme Court decision in 1974. For several years, federal regulators had been trying to renege on their decision in the late 1950s to allow El Paso to acquire its northern operations. El Paso fought their efforts, but was defeated. In 1974, El Paso was forced to divest the holdings, effectively terminating its natural gas operations north of New Mexico and Arizona. Despite some setbacks, El Paso managed to sustain long-term growth during the 1970s. Sales dipped following the 1974 divestiture but surged back up to $1.15 billion in 1975, rising to more than $2 billion in 1978. Earnings, however, fluctuated around $50 million to $60 million annually. El Paso's huge revenue gains during the late 1970s reflected turbulence in energy markets. El Paso benefitted from the Natural Gas Policy Act which was passed in 1978. That act basically allowed El Paso to begin competing with other Texas companies for the purchase of natural gas reserves. El Paso greatly increased its reserves after the act was passed, building up a sizable reserve base near its Permian Basin pipeline operations as well as in other regions of the country. It simultaneously boosted its output capacity to meet the expected surge in demand during the 1980s. As a result of strong natural gas markets and El Paso's increased output capacity, sales topped $2 billion in 1978, rose past $3 billion in 1980, and then increased to nearly $4 billion in 1981. In 1981, El Paso reported record earnings of $147 million. Unfortunately, El Paso's profit gains were short-lived. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, industry competitors had hustled to boost natural gas output capacity with expectations of strong demand. But a weak economy and a newfound emphasis on energy conservation slowed market growth. Supply outstripped demand in 1982 and natural gas prices dropped. Furthermore, El Paso's chemical businesses suffered major setbacks in 1982. Although El Paso's sales rose to $4.3 billion in 1982, its net income dropped to $53 million. The El Paso Company, as it became known in the 1970s, ceased to exist as an independent corporation in 1983. The company was purchased by Burlington Northern Inc. and became a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. Burlington was a $9 billion conglomerate active in mineral development, timber and forest products, and rail carrier systems. Although El Paso was experiencing some problems at the time, Burlington viewed the company as an excellent complement to its existing mineral development operations. The acquisition seemed like a good move, particularly in light of new federal legislation scheduled to take effect during the mid-1980s. The legislation had effectively deregulated certain aspects of the natural gas industry. Prior to the mid-1980s, El Paso, in accordance with the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, was in the business of purchasing gas from other producers, transporting the gas, and then selling it to local distribution companies. Its business began to change in 1984. Federal legislation passed in 1984 had a tumultuous effect on prices, transportation, and contractual relationships between customers and suppliers. The net effect was that natural gas industries and markets became more competitive. As a result, El Paso shifted from merchant to distributor during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Rather than owning the natural gas it transported, it simply provided transportation services for a fee charged to the owners and/or buyers. In the 1980s and early 1990s, El Paso prospered under Burlington's management. Over the next few years, Burlington spun off or sold several of El Paso's nonperforming divisions and streamlined the company's natural gas operations. In the early 1990s, Burlington changed its business strategy. After shunning the natural gas exploration and production business for several years, it decided to shift its focus to take advantage of a projected upturn in natural gas prices. During the early 1990s, Burlington sold most of its subsidiaries and reinvested the proceeds into natural gas reserves. Burlington completed the spin-off of El Paso Natural Gas Company on June 30, 1992. William A. Wise was selected to act as president and chief executive of the again-independent El Paso. The 45-year-old Wise had been with El Paso since 1970, working as an attorney and then serving in various management positions. Wise was credited with helping the company make a transition to transport services during the late 1980s and with helping to make El Paso a low-cost industry leader. When El Paso regained its independence, its pipeline consisted of a 20,000 mile network connecting three oil producing regions in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico to buyers primarily in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Sales during 1993, its first full year of operation, topped $900 million, about $90 million of which was net income. El Paso was in a relatively strong position in its industry going into the mid-1990s. It was the largest supplier of natural gas to the state of California and had successfully changed from merchant to transporter in compliance with new (1992) federal regulations. But it was also facing obstacles. Most notably, the California gas market was becoming glutted, dampening profits in El Paso's most important region. Nevertheless, investors were enthusiastic about El Paso's chances, as evidenced by a doubling of the company's stock price between 1992 and early 1994. El Paso was pinning its long-term hopes on the rapidly expanding Mexican market, to which it had unsurpassed access. It was also engaged in an ambitious effort to vastly increase its access to the northern California natural gas market. = Coastal acquisition, legal troubles, and proxy fight = In 2001, El Paso bought Oscar Wyatt's Coastal Corporation, a diversified energy company. It owned oil refineries, gas stations, and marketed oil, natural gas, and electricity. In October 2011, Kinder Morgan acquired El Paso Corp. in a $21.1 billion deal. CriticismTax avoidance= In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized El Paso for spending $2.94 million on lobbying and not paying income taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $41 million in income tax rebates, despite making a profit of $4.1 billion and increasing executive pay by 47%. =Price fixing= On 27 September 2002, the shares of the El Paso Corporation plunged after an administrative law judge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled that the company helped illegally drive energy prices to record highs in California between 2000 and 2001 by manipulating gas supplies. El Paso gas trader Todd Geiger was prosecuted by the FERC for falsely making up 48 gas trades. El Paso is now out of the energy trading business.

Publication history The Brotherhood of Evil first appeared in Doom Patrol v.1 #86 (March 1964) and were created by Arnold Drake and Bruno Premiani. Fictional team historyOrigins= The Brotherhood of Evil was founded by the enigmatic villain the Brain. In the beginning, the group's motivation was world domination. It has recently been revealed that Brain's true purpose for the Brotherhood was to destroy Niles Caulder and his \\"colleagues\\". Caulder murdered Brain so he could turn the scientist into Robotman without Brain's consent, but his plans were foiled by the Brain's creation, the super-intelligent gorilla Monsieur Mallah. Brain swore revenge against Caulder and his \\"pets\\", the Doom Patrol, who like Brain were often victims of experimentation in order to create an army of super-heroes through the ruining of innocent lives (several members were experiments of the Nazi war criminal known as General Zahl). The original line-up consisted of the Brain, his chief henchman Monsieur Mallah, and their first recruit, the shapeshifter Madame Rouge. They fought the Doom Patrol on a regular basis and were later briefly joined by fellow Doom Patrol villains General Immortus and the alien Garguax. The group also was aided by the clumsy henchman Mr. Morden, who often operated robotic devices for the Brain including a robot called Rog (which was originally built by Niles Caulder). The group's constant failure to defeat the Doom Patrol combined with the growing romantic attraction between Madame Rouge and Patrol leader Niles Caulder, led to Madame Rouge breaking free of the mental conditioning the Brain used to forcibly recruit her. Rouge quit the Brotherhood to join the Doom Patrol but the Brain quickly recaptured Madame Rouge and rebrainwashed her to make her evil personality dominant. The result backfired horribly on the Brain, as Madame Rouge turned against her evil teammates and launched a missile to destroy the Brain and Mallah. Now aided by escaped Nazi war criminal Captain Zahl, Madame Rouge captured the members of the Doom Patrol and forced them to choose the horrible death of dying in a nuclear explosion in order to save a small Maine fishing village. The Doom Patrol reluctantly chose death and were apparently killed in the explosion. = Return = Madame Rouge and Zahl (now calling himself \\"General\\" Zahl) stayed in hiding for many years, gathering an army of minions for their next big plan, the invasion and conquest of the country of Zandia. Meanwhile, the Doom Patrol had reformed with Robotman as the only surviving original member. Along with Doom Patrol hanger-on Steve Dayton (AKA Mento), the two avoided going after Madame Rouge for the murders of Doom Patrol as they did not want to involve young Doom Patrol member Beast Boy in their vendetta. However, when Beast Boy (now calling himself \\"Changeling\\") joined the \\"New Teen Titans\\", the two adult Doom Patrol members went after Rouge. Both were defeated: Mento was tortured until he mentally broke down while Robotman was left deactivated and hung as a warning to trespassers outside their headquarters. The New Teen Titans went looking for Robotman and Mento when Beast Boy had not heard back from them, which ultimately led to conflict with Rouge and Zahl. Surprisingly though, the heroes were aided by the Brain and Mallah and their new version of the Brotherhood of Evil. Brain and Mallah had predicted Rouge's betrayal and went into hiding, leaving decoys that Rouge ultimately destroyed. Rouge and Zahl both died while fighting Beast Boy and Robotman respectively. The Brain's new Brotherhood left the Titans, knowing that they would soon come into conflict. The Brain and the new Brotherhood of Evil came into conflict with Brother Blood, whose life-restoring blood pits Brain sought to use to prolong his own life. To deal with Brother Blood's inhuman powers, the group repeatedly attacked the Titans in order to kidnap Raven and force her to aid them in defeating Brother Blood. They ultimately succeeded in kidnapping Raven with the Brain's influence and the fear manipulating power of Phobia, briefly turning Raven to the Brotherhood's side. Unfortunately, in doing so, Raven's demonic father Trigon was able to gain control over Raven's body and nearly killed both the Titans and the Brotherhood, if not for the intervention of Donna Troy (who had been teleported outside the battlefield by Warp at the start of the fight). The Brotherhood resurfaced again in Zandia, months later as the New Teen Titans were in a bitter battle to rescue Raven and team leader Nightwing (who was mind-controlled by Brother Blood while working undercover as Dick Grayson) from Brother Blood's cult. During the battle, Brain and Mallah finally got access to the blood pits of Brother Blood while the Brotherhood captured Jericho and tied him to a lightning rod to force a final showdown with the Titans, which they lost. Meanwhile, a cave-in trapped Mallah and Brain underground, separating them from their team. Meanwhile, Mr. Morden, now transformed into Mr. Nobody, attempted to reform the Brotherhood in Paris, but eventually decided (having gone basically insane) that the name and focus of the group be changed to reflect the fact that \\"the universe is a drooling idiot with no fashion sense\\" - the Brotherhood of Dada was born. The Brotherhood of Dada would fight the Doom Patrol on two separate occasions before being permanently defeated. Meanwhile, Brain and Mallah made their way to America, without the help of the Brotherhood of Evil. The two broke into the lair of the latest incarnation of Doom Patrol, in order to steal one of Robotman's spare bodies for the Brain. Now with a body, Brain declared his undying love for Mallah just as the spare body exploded (the robot body had gained sentience, a fact the two were unaware of, and had vowed to destroy itself rather than have a human brain inserted into it again). The rest of the Brotherhood meanwhile rechristened themselves the \\"Society of Sin\\" and recruited a new female member named Trinity. This incarnation of the Brotherhood would only exist for one battle with the Titans before the group returned to their existing name and dropped Trinity from its roster. In New Titans #97-99, Brain and Mallah apparently returned to the Brotherhood with a shocking new member: Rita Farr, the sole member of the original Doom Patrol who had not came back to life at the time. The return was bittersweet though, as Brain was suffering from severe mental deterioration and Mallah proclaimed that only Mento's new Mento helmet could save the Brain. The group forced Changeling to steal the helmet for them in exchange for Brain helping restore Cyborg's mental capacities (Cyborg had become a brain dead automaton at this point in time). Changeling stole the helmet but quickly changed his mind about giving it to Brain, leading to \\"Rita Farr\\" to make her presence known and attack her son from behind while \\"Mallah\\" distracted Changeling with energy blast powers that the ape never possessed beforehand. This caused the Brotherhood to realize that the three were not who they claimed to be, leading to Warp escaping and bringing the Titans in to save Changeling and his teammates from the fake Elasti-Girl, Brain, and Mallah. Several weeks later, the three imposters attacked the Titans again and this time, they brought in an army of Titan villains with them, including a doppelganger of Plasma. This time the identities of the villains were revealed: they were energy beings who served a sentient alien computer called Technis which needed to assimilate Cyborg in order to survive. =Brotherhood lives again= The Brotherhood of Evil were not seen during the second half of the 1990s and would not return until 2005, in JSA Classified #1-3. Brain and Mallah themselves were magically resurrected a year prior to this during a Flash tie-in for Identity Crisis, having been revealed to be in jail for quite some time. The two were interrogated by the fifth incarnation of the Teen Titans for the location of Plasmus and Warp, as those two were suspects in the murder of Sue Dibny. It has been implied that the two were resurrected as a result of the same reality altering wave that erased the Doom Patrol from the timeline, resulting in the team only recently being formed by Caulder. With Madame Rouge's daughter Gemini now a member, the group reunited with Phobia, Mallah, and Brain and joined the Secret Society of Super Villains, under the command of inner circle member Deathstroke. Deathstroke had the group acquire the mass murdering chemical monster Chemo for the Society and in Infinite Crisis #4, dropped the monster onto the city of Blüdhaven. Murdering several million people, the Brotherhood became the most wanted villains in the DC Universe for their act of mass murder. Furthermore, Warp was recruited by the villainous Doctor Psycho to free the murderous Doomsday for the Society as part of the group's final endgame against Earth's heroes. After the one-year gap, between the end of Infinite Crisis and Teen Titans #34 (the first issue of Teen Titans after the \\"One Year Gap\\") the Brotherhood has gained members \\"Elephant Man\\" and \\"Goldilocks\\" while losing Phobia, who opted to stay a freelance villain but still kept ties with the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood then returned to their independent roots and launched a massive crime wave independent of the remains of the Secret Society of Super-Villains. Their goals included cloning a new body for the Brain as well as creating unstable clones of existing super- heroes to sell to third world dictatorships in Africa, putting the team in conflict with the Teen Titans, Doom Patrol, and the Outsiders. The Brain, Monsieur Mallah, General Immortus, Phobia, Plasmus and Warp were later seen in the Salvation Run mini-series. In Salvation Run #4, the Brain and Mallah are killed by Gorilla Grodd. In the final issue, General Immortus is killed during a battle with Parademons but turned up alive in \\"Final Crisis Aftermath: Run.\\" Plasmus and Warp are used by Lex Luthor as a power source for a teleportation device, and are seemingly killed when it self-destructs. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Brotherhood of Evil is featured as its members Phobia, Plasmus, and Warp are competing against La Dama's agents to obtain the scarab. It ends up in the possession of Jaime Reyes who becomes Blue Beetle.Blue Beetle Vol. 8 #1 Blue Beetle manages to fight off both villain groups.Blue Beetle Vol. 8 #2 To ensure that Phobia, Plasmus, and Warp succeed in reclaiming the scarab, a robotic gorilla called Silverback is sent to meet up with them. Silverback warns the three villains that if they fail again, he will be the one who will \\"clean up the mess.\\"Blue Beetle Vol. 8 #3 Membership frameThe Brotherhood of Evil at its original Doom Patrol series peak: Madame Rouge, General Immortus, Garguax, The Brain and Monsieur Mallah. Here is a list of the Brotherhood of Evil members: =Brotherhood of Evil= * The Brain * Monsieur Mallah * Madame Rouge * Garguax * General Immortus =Second Brotherhood of Evil/Society of Sin= * The Brain * Monsieur Mallah * Phobia * Houngan * Plasmus * Warp * Trinity * Elasti-Girl - Revealed to be an impostor in New Titans #103 =Third Brotherhood of Evil= * The Brain * Monsieur Mallah * Gemini - Revealed in Batgirl #61 * Houngan * Phobia - No longer a member as of Teen Titans v.3 #34 * Plasmus * Warp * Elephant Man - Revealed in Teen Titans v.3 #35 * Goldilocks - Revealed in Teen Titans v.3 #35 =Fourth Brotherhood of Evil= * Phobia * Plasmus * Silverback * Warp In other mediaTelevision= Teen Titans. * In the Teen Titans animated series, the Brotherhood of Evil are the main antagonists of the final season. Its members consist of Brain, Monsieur Mallah, Madame Rouge and General Immortus (Garguax didn't appear). They were supported by various android soldiers. Like they were in the comics, this Brotherhood of Evil are a villainous organization out to take over the world. In the television series, the Brotherhood is a Third Reich-like army with arm band sporting soldiers and flags. They make their first appearance in a flashback, during which they attempt to unleash a black hole generator on the Doom Patrol. Years later, they would re-emerge, having captured the Doom Patrol, upon which they were rescued by the Teen Titans. After attempting to take them on alone a 2nd time, the Doom Patrol again defeated the Brotherhood with the Titans' help and destroyed their second black hole generator. In retaliation, the Brotherhood assembled nearly every Titans' villain with the intention of wiping out the \\"new generation of Heroes\\". The villain allies of the Brotherhood (from left to right in the picture) are Billy Numerous and his clones, Doctor Light, Mammoth, Gizmo, Jinx, Psimon, Cinderblock, Red X (who went solo again after \\"Revved Up\\"), Adonis, Trident, Puppet King, Johnny Rancid, Mumbo, Professor Chang, Plasmus, Kyd Wykkyd (H.I.V.E. student), Angel (H.I.V.E. student), Warp, Phobia, Punk Rocket, Killer Moth, Kardiak, XL Terrestrial (H.I.V.E. student), Katarou, Atlas, André LeBlanc, Control Freak, Wintergreen (Slade's butler), The I.N.S.T.I.G.A.T.O.R.

With their villain allies, the Brotherhood of Evil promptly started with the capture of Hot Spot and Wildebeest at the hands of Madame Rouge, escalating the vendetta into a global war that rages throughout the majority of the fifth season. In \\"Calling All Titans\\", the Brotherhood of Evil send their villainous allies to battle and capture the Teen Titans and their allies. As of the final battle, the Brotherhood of Evil and most of their villain allies are frozen in the freeze trap that they used on the captive Teen Titan members, Doctor Light went solo, Jinx defected to the Teen Titans' side as she was seen in Kid Flash's company, Kitten, Newfu, Bob (or the other ones of their species) and the Witch weren't seen in the final battle, Malchior and Punk Rocket were sent to another dimension, Mother Mae-Eye teleported away nearing the end of the final battle, and Cheshire left the battle sometime near the end. * The Brotherhood of Evil is featured in the Doom Patrol television series. Mr. Nobody, the show's main antagonist, is said to be a member in the episode \\"Puppet Patrol\\". In \\"Penultimate Patrol\\", a flashback to the 1940s has Morden telling his girlfriend Milly that he was fired from the Brotherhood of Evil by The Brain and replaced with an intelligent, French gorilla. =Miscellaneous= The Brotherhood of Evil appeared in Teen Titans Go! where their appearance in the comics takes place after \\"Titans Together\\" where they have gotten out of their freeze trap. In issue #48, there is an alternate version of the Brotherhood of Evil called the Brotherhood of Justice. It consists of Doctor Light, Mammoth, Madame Rouge, and Psimon (sporting a cybernetic faceguard resembling that of Brainiac).

It is mostly based on luck. Rules First, a row of eight cards are dealt; this is the \\"Heads\\" row. Then 8 piles of 11 cards are dealt; this is reserve. Below them is another row of eight cards, the \\"Tails\\" row. The object of the game is to free one Ace and one King of each suit and build each of them by suit; the Aces are built up to Kings while the Kings are built down to Aces. Only the cards on the Heads and Tails rows are available to play on the foundations or on either the Heads or Tails row; the eight piles are used only to fill gaps. The cards on the Heads or Tails rows can be built either up or down by suit; building can change direction, but Aces cannot be built onto Kings and vice versa. When a gap occurs on either the Heads or the Tails row, it is filled by the top card of the reserve pile immediately below or above it (depending on which row the gap is). But when a gap occurs above or below an empty pile, two different rule sets say the gap is filled with: *The top card of the pile to the immediate left of the empty pile (Solsuite, BVS Solitaire Collection) *The top card of any other pile.

Early work Born in Glasgow, Leitch's early work was on designing tea factories in Deltota in the former Kandyan Kingdom of Ceylon, as well as factories in his home city and in Lanarkshire, the sole surviving example of which being the category A listed Sentinel Works at Jessie Street, Polmadie, just south of Glasgow city centre. In 1896 he became a member of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, and later of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He moved into stadium design when he was commissioned to build Ibrox Park, the new home ground of his boyhood heroes Rangers, in 1899. Stadium design Leitch's stadiums were initially considered functional rather than aesthetically elegant, and were clearly influenced by his early work on industrial buildings. Typically, his stands had two tiers, with criss-crossed steel balustrades at the front of the upper tier, and were covered by a series of pitched roofs, built so that their ends faced onto the playing field; the central roof span would be distinctly larger, and would incorporate a distinctive pediment. His first project in England was the design and building of the John Street Stand at Bramall Lane, which provided 3,000 seats and terracing for 6,000 and was dominated by a large mock-Tudor press box. The double-decker 1926 Bullens Road Stand at Goodison Park home of Everton FC The Johnny Haynes stand at Craven Cottage, home of Fulham Football Club The concrete Midland Road stand for Bradford City Football Club nearing completion in 1908\\"Reinforced Concrete Football Stand at Bradford\\", Concrete and Constructional Engineering, Vol. V., No. 1, January 1910, pp. 16-22. Ibrox, home of Rangers Football Club Leitch's reputation as an architect was damaged as a result of the Ibrox disaster of 1902, when 25 people were killed when a bank of wooden terracing collapsed due to substandard pine being used in the terraces. Leitch, in attendance at the disaster, convinced Rangers to hire him to build the replacement stand. Leitch patented a new form of strengthening terraces for the Ibrox rebuild. Over the next four decades he became Britain's foremost football architect. In total he was commissioned to design part or all of more than 20 stadiums in the UK and Ireland between 1899 and 1939, including: * Anfield, Liverpool * Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, London * Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough * Bramall Lane, Sheffield * Cardiff Arms Park, Cardiff * Craven Cottage, Fulham, London * Dalymount Park, Dublin, Ireland * Deepdale, Preston * The Old Den, New Cross, London * Dens Park, Dundee * The Dell, Southampton * Ewood Park, Blackburn * The Double Decker stand (The Kop), Filbert Street, Leicester * Fratton Park, Portsmouth * Goodison Park, Liverpool * Hampden Park, Glasgow * Home Park, Plymouth * Hyde Road Football Stadium, Manchester (General ground improvements 1911-1914 and was planning a complete rebuild of the ground to accommodate 100,000 but war broke out, bringing a halt to those plans)Athletic News, 9 June 1913. * Ibrox Park, Glasgow * Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield * Lansdowne Road, Dublin, Ireland * Leeds Road, Huddersfield * Molineux, Wolverhampton * Old Trafford, Trafford, Greater Manchester * Park Avenue, Bradford * Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen * Roker Park, Sunderland * Rugby Park, Kilmarnock * Saltergate, Chesterfield * Selhurst Park, South Norwood, London * Somerset Park, Ayr * Stamford Bridge, Fulham, London * Starks Park, Kirkcaldy * Twickenham Stadium, Twickenham, London * Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh * Valley Parade, Bradford (Midland Road stand and other extensions) * Villa Park, Birmingham * West Ham Stadium, Custom House, Newham, London * White Hart Lane, Tottenham, London * Windsor Park, Belfast, Ireland Many of his works have since been demolished for redevelopment, especially in wake of the Taylor Report and the move to all-seater stadiums. For instance, the Trinity Road Stand at Villa Park, considered his masterpiece, was demolished in 2000. The main stand and pavilion at Craven Cottage, the facade of the main stand at Ibrox (although the stand itself has been remodelled) and the Bullens Road and Gwladys Street stands at Goodison Park survive; they are now listed buildings, as was the Leitch-designed main stand at Heart of Midlothian's Tynecastle Park; however, in 2016 permission was granted for that structure to be demolished and replaced.

He was the son of Alula of Yejju (sometime governor of Damot and then of Gojjam) and Menen Liben Amede (later Empress of Ethiopia through her marriage to Emperor Yohannes III) and nephew of Gugsa of Yejju. Appointment as ruler In July 1831, after the death of his cousin, Ras Dori, Ali was appointed Ruler of Begemder and Imperial Regent at the age of 12 in a meeting of the chief nobles of the Yejju Oromo at the dynastic capital of Debre Tabor. As Ali was a minor, a council of regents was appointed from these nobles. However, his mother, Menen, soon came to control this council and exerted much influence over political decisions for the next decade. Ras Ali was officially a Christian but his contemporaries doubted the sincerity of his faith and suspected that he was a secret Muslim. Some modern scholars consider him as indifferent to religion as he was to the problems of ruling his portion of Ethiopia, although Trimingham observes that he attempted to revive the cult of Ahmad Gragn by requiring pilgrimages to his tomb.J. Spencer Trimingham, Islam in Ethiopia (Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), p. 111 In any case, the morale of the Ethiopian Church reached its lowest point in the 1840s and 1850s. For much his reign Ras Ali was constantly at war, either putting down rebellions in his core territories, or defending his territory from rival lords. In one of these continual campaigns, Ras Ali II plundered the imperial capital, Gondar, in 1838.Abir, Era of the Princes, p. 111f Ras Ali made Sahle Dengel Emperor in 1832, but the clergy of Azazo disapproved of the new Emperor's religious beliefs, and convinced Ras Ali to remove him. Sahle Dengel was sent to Zengaj, and Ras Ali recalled Gebre Krestos from Mitraha, an island in Lake Tana, and restored him as Emperor. However, Gebre Krestos died after three months, and Sahle Dengel met with Ras Ali in the village of Tsagur where he convinced Ras Ali to restore him to the throne once again (October, 1832). Marriage Ras Ali married Hirut, the daughter of Dejazmach Wube Haile Maryam, warlord of Semien and of Tigray; when he placed her in the church of Mahdere Maryam for her safety before the Battle of Debre Tabor (6 February 1842), his opponents violated the refuge of the church and kidnapped her. Their only daughter Tewabech was married 1848 to Kassa Hailu of Qwara, who in 1854 proclaimed himself a Negus. They had no surviving issue. End of reign Although his reign was punctuated by recurrent rebellions, Ali managed to keep all of the major lords subject to his rule until the final years. Shiferaw Bekele asserts that \\"it is to his credit\\" that there were only two major wars while he was Ras Bewodded: the Battle of Debre Tabor in 1842, and Kassa Hailu's successful offensive in 1852/1853.Shiferaw Bekele, \\"Reflections on the Power Elite of the Wärä Seh Mäsfenate (1786-1853)\\" Annales d'Éthiopie 15 (1990), p. 161 Future events were foreshadowed in October, 1846, when Kassa Hailu defeated detachments of Empress Menen's army at two separate battles in Dembiya; at the time, Ras Ali was away in Gojjam attempting to subdue the province's warlord, Birru Goshu, and unable to assist his mother. Kassa defeated the army of Empress Menen the following year on 18 June at Iloha, and took both Menen and her husband the former Emperor Yohannes III captive, forcing Ras Ali to negotiate their release. After three months, in return for making Kassa dejazmach over Dembiya, north of Lake Tana, the Empress and her powerless husband were released.Rubenson, King of Kings, pp. 37f Dejazmach Kassa later reconciled himself to Ras Ali in 1849, and Kassa remained loyal to Ali for the next three years. However, the relationship between the two eventually deteriorated. Following a series of stunning victories by Kassa, Ali II was decisively defeated by his son-in-law Dejazmach Kassa (who later assumed the throne name of Tewodros II) in the Battle of Ayshal on 29 June 1853, and he lost both the regentship and his territories. At first, Ali fled to safety at a local church, then a few days later fled to the territories of his kinsmen in Wollo province, where he disappeared to history.Rubenson, King of Kings, p. 52.

SR 150 south of the outer Ojai city limits is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. This route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. History California Route 150 Sign The route was opened in 1897. Before the construction of US 101, it was part of the main highway between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Originally, State Route 150 followed the alignment of State Route 192 through the Santa Barbara foothills and climbed up San Marcos Pass via the present-day route of State Route 154 before heading west on State Route 246, passing through Santa Ynez, Solvang, and Buellton and ending in Lompoc at State Route 1 (Cabrillo Highway). The only current remnants of that routing are at the mileage signs for westbound State Route 150, which have the control city as Santa Barbara west of Santa Paula, even though SR 150 currently ends east of the city.

The theory draws primarily from the works of Anselm of Canterbury, specifically his Cur Deus Homo (\\"Why was God a man?\\"). It has been traditionally taught in the Roman Catholic tradition of Western Christianity. Theologically and historically, the word \\"satisfaction\\" does not mean gratification as in common usage, but rather \\"to make restitution\\": making an offering the value of which redeems the injury or insult which was inflicted on the offended party. Since one of God's characteristics is justice, affronts to that justice must be atoned for. It is thus connected with the legal concept of balancing out an injustice. Anselm regarded his satisfaction view of the atonement as a distinct improvement over the older ransom theory of atonement, which he saw as inadequate, due to its notion of a debt being owed to the devil. Anselm's theory was a precursor to the innovations of later theologians like John Calvin, who introduced the idea of Christ suffering the Father's just punishment as a vicarious substitute.  Development of the theory  The classic Anselmian formulation of the satisfaction view should be distinguished from penal substitution. Both are forms of satisfaction theory in that they speak of how Christ's death was satisfactory, but penal substitution and Anselmian satisfaction offer different understandings of how Christ's death was satisfactory. Anselm speaks of human sin as defrauding God of the honour he is due. Christ's death, the ultimate act of obedience, brings God great honour. As it was beyond the call of duty for Christ, it is more honour than he was obliged to give. Christ's surplus can therefore repay our deficit. Hence Christ's death is substitutionary; he pays the honour to the Father instead of us paying. Penal substitution differs in that it sees Christ's death not as repaying God for lost honour but rather paying the penalty of death that had always been the moral consequence for sin (e.g., ; ). The key difference here is that for Anselm, satisfaction is an alternative to punishment, \\"it is necessary either that the honor taken away be repaid, or else that punishment follow.\\"Necesse est ergo, ut aut ablatus honor solvatur aut poena sequatur, Cur Deus Homo Bk 1 Ch 13 (Latin text) By Christ satisfying our debt of honor to God, we avoid punishment. In Calvinist Penal Substitution, it is the punishment which satisfies the demands of justice. Another distinction must be made between penal substitution (Christ punished instead of us) and substitutionary atonement (Christ suffers for us). Both affirm the substitutionary and vicarious nature of the atonement, but penal substitution offers a specific explanation as to what the suffering is for: punishment. Augustine teaches substitutionary atonement. However, the specific interpretation differed as to what this suffering for sinners meant. The early Church Fathers, including Athanasius and Augustine, taught that through Christ's suffering in humanity's place, he overcame and liberated us from death and the devil. Thus while the idea of substitutionary atonement is present in nearly all atonement theories, the specific idea of satisfaction and penal substitution are later developments in the Latin church. = St. Anselm links the atonement and the incarnation = St. Anselm of Canterbury St. Anselm of Canterbury first articulated the satisfaction view in his Cur Deus Homo?, as a modification to the ransom theory that was postulated at the time in the West.Cur Deus Homo, or Why Did God Become Man? The then-current ransom theory of the atonement held that Jesus' death paid a ransom to Satan, allowing God to rescue those under Satan's bondage.Cur Deus Homo, I.vii For Anselm, this solution was inadequate. Why should the Son of God have to become a human to pay a ransom? Why should God owe anything at all to Satan? Instead, Anselm suggested that we owe God a debt of honor: \\"This is the debt which man and angel owe to God, and no one who pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins. This is justice, or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or upright in heart, that is, in will; and this is the sole and complete debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us.\\"Cur Deus Homo, I.xi Having failed to render to God this debt, it is not enough to restore the justice originally owed, but the offense to God's honor must be satisfied, too. \\"Moreover, so long as he does not restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; and it will not suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away.\\"Cur Deus Homo, Ibid. This debt creates an imbalance in the moral universe; God cannot simply ignore it according to Anselm.Cur Deus Homo, I.xii The only way to satisfy the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of justice owed to God and satisfy the injury to divine honor.Cur Deus Homo, II.vi In light of this view, the \\"ransom\\" that Jesus mentions in the Gospels would be a sacrifice and a debt paid only to God the Father. Anselm did not speak directly to the later Calvinist concern for the scope of the satisfaction for sins, whether it was paid for all mankind universally or only for limited individuals, but indirectly his language suggests the former.Cur Deus Homo, II.xiv Thomas Aquinas later specifically attributes a universal scope to this atonement theory in keeping with previous Catholic dogma, as do Lutherans at the time of the Reformation. = St. Thomas Aquinas = St. Thomas Aquinas St. Thomas Aquinas considers the atonement in the Summa Theologiae into what is now the standard Catholic understanding of atonement. For Aquinas, the main obstacle to human salvation lies in sinful human nature, which damns human beings unless it is repaired or restored by the atonement. In his section on man, he considers whether punishment is good and appropriate. He concludes that #punishment is a morally good response to sin: it is a kind of medicine for sin, and aims at the restoration of friendship between the wrongdoer and the one wronged.ST IIIa.85.3 and IIIa.86.2. #\\"Christ bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our sins,\\" and #Atonement is possible by metaphysical union, \\"The head and members are as one mystic person; and therefore Christ's satisfaction belongs to all the faithful as being His members. Also, in so far as any two men are one in charity, the one can atone for the other as shall be shown later\\" The offender joins himself metaphysically to Christ via Baptism to the one Christ undergoing punishment. In his section on the Incarnation, Aquinas argues that Christ's death satisfies the penalty owed by sin,(TP, Q. 50.1) and that it was Christ's Passion specifically that was needed to pay the debt of man's sin.TP, 46 and 47 For Aquinas, the Passion of Jesus provided the merit needed to pay for sin: \\"Consequently Christ by His Passion merited salvation, not only for Himself, but likewise for all His members,\\"TP 48 and that the atonement consisted in Christ's giving to God more \\"than was required to compensate for the offense of the whole human race.\\" So, Aquinas believes that the atonement is God's solution to two problems. Christ's passion and death, insofar as they serve to make satisfaction, are the solution to the problem of past sin; and, insofar as Christ merits grace by his passion and death, they are the solution to the problem of future sin.See, e.g., CT 226–230 and CT 227. In this way, Aquinas articulated the formal beginning of the idea of a superabundance of merit, which became the basis for the Catholic concept of the Treasury of Merit (see Indulgence). Aquinas also articulated the ideas of salvation that are now standard within the Catholic Church: that justifying grace is provided through the sacraments; that the condign merit of our actions is matched by Christ's merit from the Treasury of Merit; and that sins can be classified as mortal or venial. For Aquinas, one is saved by drawing on Christ's merit, which is provided through the sacraments of the church. This sounds like penal substitution, but Aquinas is careful to say that he does not mean this to be taken in legal terms: What he means by \\"satisfactory punishment,\\" as opposed to punishment that is \\"penal,\\" is essentially the Catholic idea of penance. Aquinas refers to the practice saying, \\"A satisfactory punishment is imposed upon penitents\\" and defines this idea of \\"Satisfactory Punishment\\" (penance) as a compensation of self-inflicted pain in equal measure to the pleasure derived from the sin. \\"Punishment may equal the pleasure contained in a sin committed.\\" Aquinas sees penance as having two functions. First to pay a debt, and second \\"to serve as a remedy for the avoidance of sin\\". In this later case he says that \\"as a remedy against future sin, the satisfaction of one does not profit another, for the flesh of one man is not tamed by another's fast\\" and again \\"one man is not freed from guilt by another's contrition.\\" According to Aquinas \\"Christ bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our sins.\\" The penance Christ did has its effect in paying the \\"debt of punishment\\" incurred by our sin. This is a concept similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a critical difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says that in addition to our due of obedience we can make up for our debt through acts of penance \\"man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction\\". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that our problem is not our personal sin, but original sin. \\"Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man.\\" Thus Christ, as the \\"second Adam,\\" does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does he do that? By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God's love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (). = Calvin attributes atonement to individuals = John Calvin John Calvin was one of the first systematic theologians of the Reformation. As such, he wanted to solve the problem of Christ's atonement in a way that he saw as just to the Scriptures and Church Fathers, rejecting the need for condign merit.Institutes, III.iv.27, III.xiv and xv His solution was that Christ's death on the cross paid not a general penalty for humanity's sins, but a specific penalty for the sins of individual people. That is, when Jesus died on the cross, his death paid the penalty at that time for the sins of all those who are saved.II.xii.3–5 One obviously necessary feature of this idea is that Christ's atonement is limited in its effect only to those whom God has chosen to be saved, since the debt for sins was paid at a particular point in time (at the crucifixion). For Calvin, this also required drawing on Augustine's earlier theory of predestination.III.xvii Additionally, in rejecting the idea of penance, Calvin shifted from Aquinas' idea that satisfaction was penance (which focused on satisfaction as a change in humanity), to the idea of satisfying God's wrath. This ideological shift places the focus on a change in God, who is propitiated through Christ's death. The Calvinist understanding of the atonement and satisfaction is penal substitution: Christ is a substitute taking our punishment and thus satisfying the demands of justice and appeasing God's wrath so that God can justly show grace. John Stott has stressed that this must be understood not as the Son placating the Father, but rather in Trinitarian terms of the Godhead initiating and carrying out the atonement, motivated by a desire to save humanity. Thus the key distinction of penal substitution is the idea that restitution is made through punishment. Hence, for Calvin, one is saved by becoming united to Christ through faith.III.i–ii At the point of becoming united with Christ through faith, one receives all the benefits of the atonement. However, because Christ paid for sins when he died, it is not possible for those for whom he died to fail to receive the benefits: the saved are predestined to believe. = Further developments = Hugo Grotius Anselm's theory was vague enough that Thomas Aquinas' modifications have completely overshadowed it. Aquinas' theory is still official dogma within the Catholic Church, and it was affirmed at the Council of Trent. Calvin's development was affirmed at the Synod of Dort and is a part of the doctrinal positions of most Reformed denominations. The Governmental view of the atonement of Hugo Grotius is, historically, a modification of Calvin's view, although it represents in some ways a return to the general nature of Anselm's theory. According to Grotius, Christ's death is an acceptable substitute for punishment, satisfying the demands of God's moral government. In this view, in contrast to Calvin, Christ does not specifically bear the penalty for humanity's sins; nor does he pay for individual sins. Instead, his suffering demonstrates God's displeasure with sin and what sin deserves at the hands of a just Governor of the universe, enabling God to extend forgiveness while maintaining divine order. The Governmental view is the basis for the salvation theories of Protestant denominations who stress freedom of the will as in Arminianism. Other theories on the nature of Christ's atonement such as the Moral Influence view can also be seen as opposed to the Substitutionary view.

In 1989, at age 14 and with the San Diego team, he won the Campaña del Desierto Cup, and a year later the Renault Cup Open with La Martina, gaining a 6-goal handicap. Professional career1990 to 1994= Cambiaso traveled abroad regularly, winning 24 tournaments in Argentina, England and the US, while playing for teams like La Martina, Ellerstina/Ellerston White and others. In 1994 he won the \\"Triple Corona\\" (Argentine Open, Hurlingham Open, Tortugas Cup) with Ellerstina, and his handicap rating was raised to 10-goals, the youngest player to attain this. =1995 to 1999= He won 31 tournaments with teams like La Martina, Ellerstina/Ellerston White, White Birch and Outback. His awards included the Olimpia de Plata award as the most important Argentine polo player of 1997, and the best player at the final of the Abierto Argentino 1997, with a record 67 goals in the 1998 Abierto Argentino. =2000 to 2004= In this period Cambiaso took home 33 trophies. He left Ellerstina, and became successful with his own team, La Dolfina, which he co-founded with Bartolomé Castagnola, and won the Campeonato Argentino Abierto de Polo (Argentine Open) in 2002. In England he started playing for the Dubai team, and won the Cartier Queen's Cup three times and the Gold Cup twice, among other tournaments. =2005 to 2008= Cambiaso's La Dolfina team continued to dominate, winning the Argentine Open in 2005, 2006 and 2007. They defeated Ellerstina by 20–19 in 2005, the highest score in an Argentine Open final match. He continued playing successfully for Dubai in England, but also became captain for team Crab Orchard in the US, winning the US Open and the USPA Gold Cup. 2008 was a less successful year, not winning one match in the English polo season, nor any of the prestigious Argentine tournaments. La Dolfina made it to the finals of the Argentine Open, but was beaten by Ellerstina 12-13 after a golden goal by Gonzalo Pieres in an extra time. =Current= Today, he was considered the best player in the world and the most successful player in the Argentine Open, competing 15 times and winning 7, and played in the final another 2 times. He scored 535 goals in the Argentine Open alone, breaking the record held by Bautista Heguy with 531 goals.Tournaments He played also for the Argentine national team since 2002 when he won the Copa Quilmes. Horses Of his horses, the most notable were Lili, Ilusión, Sospechosa, La Osa, and his favourite Colibrí. His most recognized horses included Mambo, Bruma and Dolfina Cuartetera. For the 2015 U.S. Open, his best horses were the mare Romana and the stallion Boeing, known as the \\"American Pharoah\\" of the polo world. =Cloning= At age 25 Cambiaso decided to create his own breeding business from scratch, as well as the polo team La Dolfina. Today he has nearly 1000 horses on his extensive farms. One of his best polo ponies was a world-famous stallion, . The horse was seriously injured during the final of the 2006 Argentine Open, and suffered further setbacks in treatment of the broken bone in his near foreleg. The injury occurred in the extra chukka, and the horse was taken off in the horse ambulance, forcing Cura's early retirement from the field. After amputation a prosthesis was fitted, but due to complications Aiken Cura had to be euthanized in January 2007, but not before live skin cells were harvested at Cambiaso's request in the event cloning became possible. Cambiaso pioneered the horse cloning business. He was approached by polo enthusiast Texan Alan Meeker of . Meeker teamed up with Cambiaso, and in 2010 produced that first clone. Together with biologist Dr. Adrian Mutto and Argentine tycoon Ernesto Gutiérrez he proceeded to clone his favorite 17-year-old mare Cuartetera, multiple times, clones of which he rode to win the 2017 Argentine Open. A clone of his horse Cuartetera was bought for $800,000 at an auction, making it the most expensive horse sale in polo history.https://www.economist.com/news/business/21569054-how-technology-could- transform-ancient-sport-cloney-ponies The business of polo: Cloney ponies This horse was kept by contract within the partnership.

Kuala Kubu Bharu (Chinese: 新古毛, alternately known as Kuala Kubu Baru, Kuala Kubu Bahru or Kuala Kubu Baharu; abbreviated to KKB), is the district capital of Hulu Selangor District, Selangor, Malaysia. It was built after the town of Kuala Kubu was found to be unfit to continue as a town due to its severe flood problem, particularly when it was completely destroyed in a flood disaster in 1883 (bharu is a Malay word meaning new). Kuala Kubu Bharu is located on the foothill of the famous Titiwangsa Mountain Range and well known as one of the vital water catchment area for the state of Selangor. Kuala Kubu Bharu is arguably the first garden township in Asia, planned by the first government town planner of British Federated Malay States (FMS), Charles Crompton Reade in 1925. History Kuala Kubu Baru, or KKB as it is fondly known, is often thought of by travelers as a sleepy town in Selangor, but a deeper look into its origins reveals a history that is both enriching and charming. It is located approximately 70 km from the capital city of Kuala Lumpur through Route 1 and is the main gateway for people heading to one of Malaysia's favourite hill stations, Fraser's Hill, which is a 45-minute drive away from KKB. KKB before its establishment in 1925, started off as the town of Kuala Kubu. Well known as a mining town in the 18th century, originally located between two tributaries of the Selangor River. In its heyday, it was the second biggest town in Selangor. It also served as a fort for Raja Mahadi and Syed Mashor when they fought against Tengku Kudin's army during the Selangor Civil War from 1867 to 1874. A fortress (kubu in the Malay language) was constructed in the area before the British colonial powers took over the town. During the later part of the 19th century, Kuala Kubu was placed under administration of the Administrative Resident Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham, followed by JP Rodger and Edward Maxwell. At that time, Kuala Kubu was a gateway to the state of Pahang through what is today Route 55. However, tragedy struck in 1883 when a heavy downpour caused the Kuala Kubu dam to burst open and flood the town, affecting its tin mining activities and killing 33 people, including the then District's Magistrate and Tax Collector Officer, Cecil Ranking. Thirty-eight homes were also destroyed. Ranking had supposedly shot a white crocodile which was regarded as the river guardian despite being told not to do so. According to local beliefs, his act had caused the calamity to occur and all that was left of him was his hand. Ranking's hand was interred in a grave at the Kuala Kubu Planter's Club House (now demolished and replaced with Masjid Ar- Rahimiah). Since then, the old town has been known as Ampang Pechah (Broken Dam), and locals termed the flooding as the Kuala Kubu Tragedy. After the incident, the British Federated Malay States (FMS) government established a new town, calling it Kuala Kubu Bharu (“bharu” meaning new in the Malay language) in an area located on the north of the old town of Kuala Kubu. Kuala Kubu Bharu formally became the administrative centre of Hulu Selangor district in 1931. Another tragedy struck in 1951 when Sir Henry Gurney, the then British High Commissioner to Malaya, was assassinated by communist insurgents who ambushed his Rolls Royce along the Jalan Kuala Kubu Baru–Fraser's Hill road. The Hulu Selangor District Council was established on 1 January 1975 to administer the district of Hulu Selangor which included Kuala Kubu Bharu and the surrounding towns of Batang Kali and Serendah. On 15 January 1994, the Administrative Office of Hulu Selangor District Council moved to its present site at Jalan Bukit Kerajaan, replacing the former location in the former Old Market in Kuala Kubu Bharu town. = The Kuala Kubu Town Tragedy (1883) = Disaster strikes  Previously, there was a town called Kuala Kubu nearby. In February 1883 the Kuala Kubu town was destroyed by a great flood caused by a broken dam near the town. Many of civilians were drowned and lost their home. 33 people were killed, including the Magistrate and Tax Collector of Hulu Selangor during the British Malaya era, Cecil Ranking. However, the old town was severely flooded and most of the old town's facilities were damaged beyond repair. A Buddhist temple and a mosque (now known as Masjid Al- Hidayah Ampang Pechah) survived the flood. The old town has since been known as Ampang Pechah, or Broken Dam in the Malay language. The tragedy was probably known as Tragedi Kuala Kubu by local civilians.  The Aftermath  After the tragedy, the British Federated Malay States (FMS) government decided to build a new town near the remains of Kuala Kubu. The new town was named Kuala Kubu Bharu, with Bharu meaning \\"new\\" in the Malay language. The planning of this new site was undertaken by Charles Crompton Reade, the government town planner of the FMS in 1925 along the garden city ideas: with compact town centre encircled by a parkbelt; entrance to the centre were approached by two access designed in an angular fashion to provide visually attractive vista to the town upon approaching the centre. This new town growth was hastened after 1931 after another major flood at the old town site. Reade's planning ideas of KKB along garden city lines has now been slowly recognized as the first garden city in the country. Given this status much conservation work needs to be undertaken to retain as much as possible its original layout, ideas and history. Ampang Pechah Ampang Pechah is the original site of the Kuala Kubu located south from Kuala Kubu Bharu new town. A Buddhist temple, Guan Yin Ge Temple (觀音阁), Cecil Ranking's gravestone and Masjid Al-Hidayah Ampang Pechah are the only remaining proof of Kuala Kubu existence and its tragedy in the past.  Famous attractions  KKB has retained most of its charm with its traditional and quaint shophouses, a 1930s clock tower and an old fire station. A Buddhist temple (Guan Yin Ge Temple or 觀音阁) that survived the flood was refurbished in the 1980s, and is also another attraction, while Cecil Ranking's grave, presently within the compound of MRSM Kuala Kubu Bharu, might be a stop for those interested in KKB's history. Cecil Ranking's grave also acts as a monument, commemorating the 1883's flood disaster. Colonial shophouses still make up most of KKB's architectural landscape, spanning from the 1920s to the 1980s, which makes it ideal for pleasant walking tours. Its grid-iron street layout are made up of sundry shops, eateries, traditional barber and even a former cinema, converted into an entertainment centre. Visitors can also enjoy the cool weather as KKB is surrounded by lush trees and tropical jungle. Cyclist enthusiasts can be seen especially during the weekend wondering the KKB environment and finally taking a break/rest at the mamak corner shop in the town. Typical tourist attractions that can be explored in KKB include an art gallery and the old railway station. There are a few budget hotels, a golf course, bus terminal and KTM Komuter train station but not much else exists in terms of infrastructure and facilities. The town is hardly what you call hectic, but there is a fair amount of activity that goes on. Locals go about their daily routine and there are plenty of restaurants to sample local Malaysian food. One place to enjoy home-styled Hainanese cooking in a traditional shophouse is Sun Sun Seng Nam. The old Malaya style restaurant still maintains its old fixtures and signages, and customers can choose to sit in the traditional wooden booths to enjoy famous Hainanese dishes. Another spot to please the hungry traveller is Teng Wun bakery, famous for its kaya puffs and cupcakes KKB has been a choice retreat for the renowned Malaysian writer, Rehman Rashid, who completed his celebrated book, 'A Malaysian Journey'; he also devoted KKB in its Epilogue (August 31, 1992). KKB too, is also referred to in a song by the celebrated Malaysian singer, Sudirman Arshad, JOGET KENANGAN MANIS, where he suggested Kalau Pergi Kuala Kubu Tulis Nama Atas Batu. (translate: If you go to/visit Kuala Kubu write your name on the rock/stone). Some of the famous attractions in KKB, among others are:- *Buddhist Temple of the old town known as Guan Yin Ge Temple (觀音阁), which survived the 1883 flood but was forced to be abandoned during Malayan Emergency period, was eventually rediscovered and refurbished in 1980s by local Buddhist community and Penang Kek Lok Si Temple.

Nickerson was the only Democrat to be elected county executive in Nassau County until 2001. Later, as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, he presided over a challenge to the Pentagon's \\"Don’t ask, don’t tell\\" policy on homosexuality and the notorious Abner Louima police brutality case in New York. Nickerson was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on August 16, 1977, to a seat vacated by Orrin Judd. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 20, 1977, and received commission on October 21, 1977. Assumed senior status on January 1, 1994. Nickerson's service was terminated on January 1, 2002, due to death.  Early life and education  Nickerson was a descendant both of the Nickerson family of Cape Cod and of President John Quincy Adams. His mother, né Ruth Constance Comstock (July 11, 1891 – August 15, 1988), was from Orange, New Jersey. She gave birth to three sons: Schuyler, Eugene and Adams. His father, Hoffman Nickerson (December 6, 1888 – March 24, 1965), was an Army officer, state legislator, and historian who wrote The turning point of the Revolution; or, Burgoyne in America concerning the Saratoga campaign. Born in Orange, New Jersey, Nickerson grew up in New York City, New York and Mill Neck on Long Island.Hutto, Richard Jay, June Hall McCash (2005). The Jekyll Island Club Members, at 116. Macon, GA: Indigo Custom Publishing. At St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, he was quarterback of the football team and captain of the hockey team. But shortly before he entered Harvard College in 1937, Nickerson was stricken by polio, seemingly ending what had started out to be a promising athletic career. For two years, he was forced to wear his right arm in a brace held out from his body. While at Harvard, Nickerson showed unusual perseverance by teaching himself to play squash with his left hand. Ultimately he was named the squash team's captain and its ranking player. Harvard's athletic director, William Bingham, wrote to another Harvard graduate, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, about the courage of this young squash player. President Roosevelt answered Bingham's letter saying \\"What we need are more Nickersons.\\" Bingham sent a copy of the President's letter to Eugene's father, Hoffman Nickerson. The letter was kept in a box for years until Eugene's wife, Marie-Louise, took it out to read to their daughters. He graduated from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1943, he graduated from Columbia Law School with a Bachelor of Laws, where he was an editor of the Columbia Law Review. Following graduation, he clerked for Judge Augustus Noble Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and then for Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone of the United States Supreme Court from October 1944 to April 1946.  Professional career and government service  He worked for Wall Street law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hope, Hadley & McCloy, then Hale, Stimson, Russell & Nickerson. From 1970 until his appointment to the bench in October 1977, Nickerson was a name partner and litigator with the firm Nickerson, Kramer, Lowenstein, Nessen, Kamin & Soll, now known as Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel.Eugene Nickerson, Ex-Nassau Politician And Judge in Louima Trials, Dies at 83 New York Times. 3 January 2002.

Entering politics, he became the first Democrat to win a countywide seat in Nassau County, New York since 1912, when regular Republicans and the Progressive (Bull Moose) Party split the Republican vote. In his three three-year terms as county executive, Nickerson took a more liberal approach than his Republican predecessors, often working to expand social services for the needy in what was then one of the nation's fastest-growing counties. He was an early advocate of environmental protection, expanded Nassau County's park system, recruited college graduates for the police force, and favored progressive zoning regulations to open up housing opportunities to minorities and the poor. He later described his years in the post as reorienting \\"government to concern itself with human beings and their problems.\\" Pressed by Robert F. Kennedy, who recognized Nickerson's political talents, he ran for the United States Senate in 1968 but lost in the Democratic primary. Nickerson was occasionally seen as an unusual member of the Democratic Party. Referring to the man who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, Nickerson once explained, \\"Adlai Stevenson turned me into a Democrat. I was active in his first campaign, and I stayed active. He brought in other people like myself who had intense interests about government, of ideals and principles.\\"  Federal judicial service  Nickerson was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on August 16, 1977, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York vacated by Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 20, 1977, and received his commission on October 21, 1977. He assumed senior status on January 1, 1994. His service was terminated on January 1, 2002, due to his death.  Failed nomination to the Second Circuit  On August 26, 1980, President Jimmy Carter nominated Nickerson to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to replace Judge Murray Gurfein, who had died in 1979.Nominations Submitted to the Senate Week Ending August 29, 1980.

It is one of stock car racing's most storied venues, and is often referred to as the \\"World's Most Famous Short Track\\" and the \\"Birthplace of the NASCAR Stars\\". The track first opened in 1951 as a dirt track. Gwyn Staley won the first race at the speedway and later became the first track champion. Drivers such as Junior Johnson, Ned Jarrett, and Ralph Earnhardt also became track champions in the 1950s, with Earnhardt winning five of them. In 1953, NASCAR's Grand National Series (later the NASCAR Cup Series) visited the track for the first time. Tim Flock won the first race at the speedway, which became a regular part of the Grand National schedule. After winning his track championship in 1952, Junior Johnson became the most successful Grand National driver at Hickory, winning there seven times. The track has been re-configured three times in its history. The track became a 0.4-mile (644 meters) dirt track in 1955, which was paved for the first time during the 1967 season. In 1970, the Hickory track was shortened to a length of 0.363 miles (584 meters). Hickory was dropped from the Grand National schedule after the 1971 season when R. J. Reynolds began sponsoring the newly christened NASCAR Winston Cup Series and dropped all races under 250 miles (402 kilometers) from the schedule. It remained in use as a popular NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Series venue. When the series was reformed as the Budweiser Late Model Series (later the Busch Grand National Series and currently the Xfinity Series) in 1982, Hickory played a prominent part of its first season, hosting six of the series' 28 races. Drivers Jack Ingram and Tommy Houston, two former track champions, each won eight times at the track in the Busch Series. As more tracks began hosting Busch Series races, Hickory's involvement was progressively reduced to two races a year by 1987, and then just the Easter weekend by 1995. By 1998, the Busch Grand National Series began adding more races at Winston Cup Series tracks, and Hickory was dropped from the schedule after 17 years. Hickory is still used as a venue for NASCAR's club racing division, the Whelen All-American Series, Pro All Stars Series South Super Late Models and the CARS Tour featuring late model and super late model touring series cars.

Specifically, a supermatrix is a 2×2 block matrix with entries in a superalgebra (or superring). The most important examples are those with entries in a commutative superalgebra (such as a Grassmann algebra) or an ordinary field (thought of as a purely even commutative superalgebra). Supermatrices arise in the study of super linear algebra where they appear as the coordinate representations of a linear transformations between finite- dimensional super vector spaces or free supermodules. They have important applications in the field of supersymmetry. Definitions and notation Let R be a fixed superalgebra (assumed to be unital and associative). Often one requires R be supercommutative as well (for essentially the same reasons as in the ungraded case). Let p, q, r, and s be nonnegative integers. A supermatrix of dimension (rs)×(pq) is a matrix with entries in R that is partitioned into a 2×2 block structure :X = \\\\begin{bmatrix}X_{00} & X_{01}  X_{10} & X_{11}\\\\end{bmatrix} with r+s total rows and p+q total columns (so that the submatrix X00 has dimensions r×p and X11 has dimensions s×q). An ordinary (ungraded) matrix can be thought of as a supermatrix for which q and s are both zero. A square supermatrix is one for which (rs) = (pq). This means that not only is the unpartitioned matrix X square, but the diagonal blocks X00 and X11 are as well. An even supermatrix is one for which diagonal blocks (X00 and X11) consist solely of even elements of R (i.e. homogeneous elements of parity 0) and the off-diagonal blocks (X01 and X10) consist solely of odd elements of R. :\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\mathrm{even} & \\\\mathrm{odd}  \\\\mathrm{odd}& \\\\mathrm{even} \\\\end{bmatrix} An odd supermatrix is one for the reverse holds: the diagonal blocks are odd and the off-diagonal blocks are even. :\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\mathrm{odd} & \\\\mathrm{even}  \\\\mathrm{even}& \\\\mathrm{odd} \\\\end{bmatrix} If the scalars R are purely even there are no nonzero odd elements, so the even supermatices are the block diagonal ones and the odd supermatrices are the off-diagonal ones. A supermatrix is homogeneous if it is either even or odd. The parity, X, of a nonzero homogeneous supermatrix X is 0 or 1 according to whether it is even or odd. Every supermatrix can be written uniquely as the sum of an even supermatrix and an odd one. Algebraic structure Supermatrices of compatible dimensions can be added or multiplied just as for ordinary matrices. These operations are exactly the same as the ordinary ones with the restriction that they are defined only when the blocks have compatible dimensions. One can also multiply supermatrices by elements of R (on the left or right), however, this operation differs from the ungraded case due to the presence of odd elements in R. Let Mrs×pq(R) denote the set of all supermatrices over R with dimension (rs)×(pq). This set forms a supermodule over R under supermatrix addition and scalar multiplication. In particular, if R is a superalgebra over a field K then Mrs×pq(R) forms a super vector space over K. Let Mpq(R) denote the set of all square supermatices over R with dimension (pq)×(pq). This set forms a superring under supermatrix addition and multiplication. Furthermore, if R is a commutative superalgebra, then supermatrix multiplication is a bilinear operation, so that Mpq(R) forms a superalgebra over R. =Addition= Two supermatrices of dimension (rs)×(pq) can be added just as in the ungraded case to obtain a supermatrix of the same dimension. The addition can be performed blockwise since the blocks have compatible sizes. It is easy to see that the sum of two even supermatrices is even and the sum of two odd supermatrices is odd. =Multiplication= One can multiply a supermatrix with dimensions (rs)×(pq) by a supermatrix with dimensions (pq)×(kl) as in the ungraded case to obtain a matrix of dimension (rs)×(kl). The multiplication can be performed at the block level in the obvious manner: :\\\\begin{bmatrix}X_{00} & X_{01}  X_{10} & X_{11}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix}Y_{00} & Y_{01}  Y_{10} & Y_{11}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}X_{00}Y_{00} + X_{01}Y_{10} & X_{00}Y_{01} + X_{01}Y_{11}  X_{10}Y_{00} + X_{11}Y_{10} & X_{10}Y_{01} + X_{11}Y_{11}\\\\end{bmatrix}. Note that the blocks of the product supermatrix Z = XY are given by :Z_{ij} = X_{i0}Y_{0j} + X_{i1}Y_{1j}.\\\\, If X and Y are homogeneous with parities X and Y then XY is homogeneous with parity X + Y. That is, the product of two even or two odd supermatrices is even while the product of an even and odd supermatrix is odd. =Scalar multiplication= Scalar multiplication for supermatrices is different than the ungraded case due to the presence of odd elements in R. Let X be a supermatrix. Left scalar multiplication by α ∈ R is defined by :\\\\alpha\\\\cdot X = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha\\\\,X_{00} & \\\\alpha\\\\,X_{01} \\\\hat\\\\alpha\\\\,X_{10} & \\\\hat\\\\alpha\\\\,X_{11} \\\\end{bmatrix} where the internal scalar multiplications are the ordinary ungraded ones and \\\\hat\\\\alpha denotes the grade involution in R. This is given on homogeneous elements by :\\\\hat\\\\alpha = (-1)^{\\\\alpha}\\\\alpha. Right scalar multiplication by α is defined analogously: :X\\\\cdot\\\\alpha = \\\\begin{bmatrix} X_{00}\\\\,\\\\alpha & X_{01}\\\\,\\\\hat\\\\alpha  X_{10}\\\\,\\\\alpha & X_{11}\\\\,\\\\hat\\\\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix}. If α is even then \\\\hat\\\\alpha = \\\\alpha and both of these operations are the same as the ungraded versions. If α and X are homogeneous then α*X and X*α are both homogeneous with parity α + X. Furthermore, if R is supercommutative then one has :\\\\alpha\\\\cdot X = (-1)^{\\\\alphaX}X\\\\cdot\\\\alpha. As linear transformations Ordinary matrices can be thought of as the coordinate representations of linear maps between vector spaces (or free modules). Likewise, supermatrices can be thought of as the coordinate representations of linear maps between super vector spaces (or free supermodules). There is an important difference in the graded case, however. A homomorphism from one super vector space to another is, by definition, one that preserves the grading (i.e. maps even elements to even elements and odd elements to odd elements). The coordinate representation of such a transformation is always an even supermatrix. Odd supermatrices correspond to linear transformations that reverse the grading. General supermatrices represent an arbitrary ungraded linear transformation. Such transformations are still important in the graded case, although less so than the graded (even) transformations. A supermodule M over a superalgebra R is free if it has a free homogeneous basis. If such a basis consists of p even elements and q odd elements, then M is said to have rank pq. If R is supercommutative, the rank is independent of the choice of basis, just as in the ungraded case. Let Rpq be the space of column supervectors--supermatrices of dimension (pq)×(10). This is naturally a right R-supermodule, called the right coordinate space. A supermatrix T of dimension (rs)×(pq) can then be thought of as a right R-linear map :T:R^{pq}\\\\to R^{rs}\\\\, where the action of T on Rpq is just supermatrix multiplication (this action is not generally left R-linear which is why we think of Rpq as a right supermodule). Let M be free right R-supermodule of rank pq and let N be a free right R-supermodule of rank rs. Let (ei) be a free basis for M and let (fk) be a free basis for N. Such a choice of bases is equivalent to a choice of isomorphisms from M to Rpq and from N to Rrs. Any (ungraded) linear map :T : M\\\\to N\\\\, can be written as a (rs)×(pq) supermatrix relative to the chosen bases. The components of the associated supermatrix are determined by the formula :T(e_i) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{r+s}f_k\\\\,{T^k}_i. The block decomposition of a supermatrix T corresponds to the decomposition of M and N into even and odd submodules: :M = M_0\\\\oplus M_1\\\\qquad N = N_0\\\\oplus N_1. Operations Many operations on ordinary matrices can be generalized to supermatrices, although the generalizations are not always obvious or straightforward. =Supertranspose= The supertranspose of a supermatrix is the Z2-graded analog of the transpose. Let :X = \\\\begin{bmatrix}A & B  C & D\\\\end{bmatrix} be a homogeneous (rs)×(pq) supermatrix. The supertranspose of X is the (pq)×(rs) supermatrix :X^{st} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}A^t & (-1)^{X}C^t  -(-1)^{X}B^t & D^t\\\\end{bmatrix} where At denotes the ordinary transpose of A. This can be extended to arbitrary supermatrices by linearity. Unlike the ordinary transpose, the supertranspose is not generally an involution, but rather has order 4. Applying the supertranspose twice to a supermatrix X gives :(X^{st})^{st} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}A & -B  -C & D\\\\end{bmatrix}. If R is supercommutative, the supertranspose satisfies the identity :(XY)^{st} = (-1)^{XY}Y^{st}X^{st}.\\\\, =Parity transpose= The parity transpose of a supermatrix is a new operation without an ungraded analog. Let :X = \\\\begin{bmatrix}A & B  C & D\\\\end{bmatrix} be a (rs)×(pq) supermatrix. The parity transpose of X is the (sr)×(qp) supermatrix :X^\\\\pi = \\\\begin{bmatrix}D & C  B & A\\\\end{bmatrix}. That is, the (i,j) block of the transposed matrix is the (1−i,1−j) block of the original matrix. The parity transpose operation obeys the identities *(X+Y)^\\\\pi = X^\\\\pi + Y^\\\\pi\\\\, *(XY)^\\\\pi = X^\\\\pi Y^\\\\pi\\\\, *(\\\\alpha\\\\cdot X)^\\\\pi = \\\\hat\\\\alpha\\\\cdot X^\\\\pi *(X\\\\cdot\\\\alpha)^\\\\pi = X^\\\\pi\\\\cdot\\\\hat\\\\alpha as well as *\\\\pi^2 = id\\\\, *\\\\pi\\\\circ st \\\\circ \\\\pi = (st)^4 where st denotes the supertranspose operation. =Supertrace= The supertrace of a square supermatrix is the Z2-graded analog of the trace. It is defined on homogeneous supermatrices by the formula :\\\\mathrm{str}(X) = \\\\mathrm{tr}(X_{00}) - (-1)^{X}\\\\mathrm{tr}(X_{11})\\\\, where tr denotes the ordinary trace. If R is supercommutative, the supertrace satisfies the identity :\\\\mathrm{str}(XY) = (-1)^{XY}\\\\mathrm{str}(YX)\\\\, for homogeneous supermatrices X and Y. =Berezinian= The Berezinian (or superdeterminant) of a square supermatrix is the Z2-graded analog of the determinant. The Berezinian is only well-defined on even, invertible supermatrices over a commutative superalgebra R. In this case it is given by the formula :\\\\mathrm{Ber}(X) = \\\\det(X_{00} - X_{01}X_{11}^{-1}X_{10})\\\\det(X_{11})^{-1}. where det denotes the ordinary determinant (of square matrices with entries in the commutative algebra R0). The Berezinian satisfies similar properties to the ordinary determinant. In particular, it is multiplicative and invariant under the supertranspose. It is related to the supertrace by the formula :\\\\mathrm{Ber}(e^X) = e^{\\\\mathrm{str(X)}}.\\\\, References * * Category:Matrices Category:Super linear algebra ","title":"Supermatrix"},{"id":"2498860","text":"A Constantly Computed Impact Point (CCIP) related to the Continually Computed Release Point (CCRP) is a calculation provided by a weapon's sighting system.

This system is normally used in aircraft, other large vehicles, or large static weapons, but it is in principle possible for such a system to be miniaturized for a man-portable firearm. CCIP calculation is sometimes combined with an autorelease system so that an aircraft can lock a low-drag bomb onto a target from a safe distance, then release it while in a high-G climb (the target would not be visible over the aircraft's nose), without the need to overfly the target.

Career Born to a wealthy German Jewish family, he attended Harvard College, where he graduated in 1931 with a degree in biochemistry. He attended Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the Harvard Law Review. Riesman clerked for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis between 1935 and 1936. He also taught at what is now the University at Buffalo Law School and at the University of Chicago. He worked for Sperry Gyroscope company during the war. After a fellowship at Yale to write The Lonely Crowd, he returned to Chicago. In 1958, he became a university professor at Harvard. Intellectually he was influenced most by Erich Fromm, as well as Carl Friedrich, Hannah Arendt, Leo Löwenthal, Robert K. Merton, Paul Lazarsfeld, Paul Goodman, Martha Wolfenstein, and Nathan Leites. He read widely in Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud.Horowitz, pp. 1005–1010 The Lonely Crowd Horowitz says The Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character, in 1950 > quickly became the nation’s most influential and widely read mid-century > work of social and cultural criticism.

Riesman argued that the character of post-World War II American society impels individuals to \\"other-directedness,\\" the preeminent example being modern suburbia, where individuals seek their neighbors' approval and fear being outcast from their community. That lifestyle has a coercive effect, which compels people to abandon \\"inner-direction\\" of their lives, and it induces them to take on the goals, ideology, likes, and dislikes of their community. This creates a tightly grouped crowd of people that is yet incapable of fulfilling each other's desire for sexual pleasure. The book is considered a landmark study of American character.Todd Gitlin, \\"David Riesman, Thoughtful Pragmatist\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education, 2002-05-24 accessed 2006-11-29 Riesman was a major public intellectual as well as a sociologist and represented an early example of what sociologists now call \\"public sociology\\".\\"Neil McLaughlin, Critical Theory Meets America (2001). American higher education In addition to his many other publications, Riesman was also a noted commentator on American higher education, publishing, with his seminal work, The Academic Revolution, which was co-written with Christopher Jencks. In it, Riesman sums up his position by stating, \\"If this book has any single message it is that the academic profession increasingly determines the character of undergraduate education in America.\\" Riesman highlights the effects of the \\"logic of the research university,\\" which focuses upon strict disciplinary research. That both sets the goals of the research university and produces its future professors. Riesman noted that the logic isolated any patterns of resistance that might challenge the university's primary purpose as disciplinary research, dashing their chances of success.

Jupp also played eight Test matches for England, and was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1928.  Biography  Born 27 March 1891 in Burgess Hill, Sussex, England, Jupp started his career in 1909 with Sussex, before moving to Northamptonshire in 1921 to take up the secretaryship of the club. This provided Jupp with an income and allowed him to retain his status as an \\"amateur\\" cricket player (he was paid to be club secretary, not to play cricket). After he qualified to play for Northamptonshire by residence, he assisted that county, and by 1927 was, in Wisden's opinion, the best all-round amateur in first-class cricket at the time. Jupp played regularly for Sussex after his first year with them, making such steady improvement that in 1914, with a highest innings of 217 not out, against Worcestershire at Worcester, he finished third in the batting figures, and had an average of over 36. In that season he scored over 1,500 runs and, with fifty-one wickets, headed the bowling. By this time it was obvious Sussex had discovered one of the most promising all-round players in the country. On the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Engineers in December 1914, and served in France, Salonika and Palestine where he transferred as a cadet to the Royal Air Force. Demobilised in July 1919, he played for Sussex as an amateur in the remaining matches of that season, and very quickly showed that over four years absence from cricket had not impaired his powers. In 1921 he scored nearly 2,000 runs, heading the county batting with an average of over 47, and took 93 wickets for rather less than 23 runs apiece, At the end of the summer of 1920 he received an invitation to be a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team in Australia, but was unable to accept. Two years afterwards, however, he went to South Africa under the captaincy of Frank Mann, but did not reproduce his English form. He enjoys the distinction of having, on five occasions, achieved the double feat of scoring 1,000 runs, and taking 100 wickets in a season of first-class cricket. In 1921 he played for England against Australia at Trent Bridge and Headingley. He went on to play four Tests against South Africa in 1922/3 and two Tests against the West Indies in 1928. As a batsman Jupp struck the happy medium between enterprise and caution. He watched the ball so well that when occasion demanded he could play a rigidly defensive game, while on a fast wicket there were few cricketers of his day better worth watching. He possessed a wide variety of strokes, and could drive or cut with equal power and facility. His footwork, too, was so good that on a treacherous pitch he was a particularly valuable batsman. Before the First World War, and for a time afterwards he bowled medium pace rather on the quick side, but later took a shorter run, and became a slow to slow-medium bowler. Few bowlers of the 1920s spun the ball as much as he did and, with a wicket to help him, he could make it turn to a pronounced degree. One of the secrets of his success as a bowler was his cleverness in adapting himself to the changing conditions of a pitch. He was also rated as a brilliant fieldsman at cover point. In 1927 Jupp became captain of Northamptonshire, a post he held until 1931. He continued as a player for the county until 1939. Jupp achieved the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season ten times, and along with Freddie Brown is one of the only two cricketers to have achieved that feat for two different teams. Ironically, his best season as a bowler was the one after the one for which he was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year – in 1928 he took 166 wickets at 20.15. He continued playing first-class cricket for Northamptonshire until 1938, but did not play at all in 1934 or 1935. This is because of the fact – unmentioned by Wisden at the time – that he had been convicted of manslaughter after his car had been in collision with a motorcycle, killing the latter's pillion passenger. Jupp was sentenced to nine months in prison, and was released in June 1935 after serving half his sentence, but did not play cricket again until the following year. Jupp collapsed and died in the garden at his home in Spratton on 9 July 1960. He was 69.

Howard had planned a career as a barrister, having been called to the Bar (Inner Temple) in 1956. Meanwhile, he was fulfilling his National service obligations in the army, during which he saw active service in the Royal Fusiliers during the Suez War. He wrote (initially unsigned)Michael Leapman \\"Anthony Howard: Journalist, broadcaster and writer, respected as one of the most astute political analysts of his generation\\", The Independent, 21 December 2010 articles for the New Statesman about his reluctant involvement in the conflict, an action for which he was almost court-martialled. First posts in journalism Despite this early experience as a freelance contributor, he \\"stumbled\\" into his career as a journalist in 1958, beginning on Reynolds News as a political correspondent. Howard moved to the Manchester Guardian in 1959. The following year he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship to study in the United States, though he remained on the Guardian’s staff. Howard was political correspondent of the New Statesman from 1961 until 1964. An admirer of Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell during this period, he was a strong advocate of the democratic process: In January 1965 Howard joined The Sunday Times as its Whitehall correspondent reporting on the activities of senior civil servants.John Simpson Unreliable Sources: How the 20th Century was Reported, London: Macmillan, 2010, p.437 He saw his Whitehall brief as being in advance of the journalistic practices of that time.Media: My Greatest Mistake: Anthony Howard, The Independent, 3 July 2003. Retrieved 20 December 2010. Cabinet Ministers were instructed by Prime Minister Harold Wilson's private secretary not to co-operate with Howard. Civil servants received similar instructions. Phillip Knightley reported a conversation with Howard in 2003 in which Howard had said Wilson \\"understood I was only trying to do my job but he had a job to do, too, and his was more important than mine. He made it very plain that all conventional sources of information would remain shut until I was willing to return to the cosy but essentially sham game of being a political correspondent.\\"Phillip Knightley \\"Of secrets and spies\\", The Independent on Sunday, 17 August 2003 Wilson is thought by journalist John Simpson to have had a preference for secrecy and to have been fearful that such a practice would give his enemies and rivals a potential outlet. Howard, however, was soon invited to become The Observer’s chief Washington correspondent, serving in the role from 1966 to 1969, later contributing a political column (1971–72). During his period in America he made regular contributions to The World at One on Radio 4. \\"It got to where I was almost the World at One Washington correspondent\\", he once remarked.Quoted in Simon Elmes And Now on Radio 4, 2007, London: Random House, p.161 He was, though, absent from his post when President Johnson announced he would not seek re-election in the Presidential election of 1968, which did not help relations with David Astor, Observer editor at the time. Editorial roles As editor of the New Statesman (1972–78), succeeding Richard Crossman, whose deputy he had been (1970–72), he appointed Robin Cook as the magazine's parliamentary adviser in 1974,Anthony Howard \\"Natural-born writer: Robin Cook: a tribute\\", New Statesman, 15 August 2005 (Cook also contributed articles), James Fenton, Christopher Hitchens and Martin Amis as literary editor in 1977. Future New Statesman editor Peter Wilby, for whom Howard was a mentor, was a staff member during this period. Under Howard's editorship the magazine published a rare non-British contributor: Gabriel García Márquez in March 1974, on the overthrow of Salvador Allende's elected government in Chile the previous September. Perhaps out of a sense of balance, he featured a series of critiques of the British Left, by the magazine's former editor Paul Johnson, a drinking companion and friend of Howard's, whose political rightward drift was well advanced by then. He also employed Auberon Waugh as a columnist. Howard was unable to halt the magazine's fall in circulation, however.Julian Barnes \\"'Under the briskness, he was a softie'\\", The Observer, 26 December 2012 He then edited The Listener for two years (1979–81). Howard was deputy editor of The Observer (1981–88), where one of his journalist protégés was the journalist and (later) novelist Robert Harris, whom he appointed as the newspaper's political correspondent.Robert Harris \\"Anthony Howard: 'A wonderful combination of paradoxes'\\", Channel 4 News, 7 January 2011 His professional relationship with the editor, Donald Trelford, ultimately broke down over allegations that Trelford had allowed the newspaper's proprietor Tiny Rowland to interfere in editorial content. After leaving The Observer, following an ill-fated editorial coup against Trelford, he was a reporter on Newsnight and Panorama (1989–92), having previously presented Channel Four's Face the Press (1982–85). According to Charter88 founder Anthony Barnett he opposed that organisation's petition, and helped run the official committee dedicated to commemorating the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution in 1988.Anthony Barnett \\"Anthony Howard: Amanuensis to the old regime\\", Our Kingdom (Open Democracy website), 19 December 2010 Later career His last editorial positions before turning freelance were at The Times as Obituaries editor (1993–99), and chief political book reviewer (1990–2004), though he contributed opinion columns to the newspaper until September 2005, when his regular column was discontinued.

It is composed of civilian (GS-1811), active duty, reserve enlisted, and warrant officer special agents. Mission The mission of the Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) is to conduct professional criminal investigations, engage in law enforcement information and intelligence collection, provide protective services, and establish and maintain law enforcement liaison directed at preserving the integrity of the Coast Guard, protecting the welfare of Coast Guard personnel, and supporting Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maritime law enforcement and counter-terrorism missions worldwide. Authority The Coast Guard Investigative Service is a federal law enforcement agency whose law enforcement authority is derived from . This authority provides for Coast Guard special agents to conduct investigations of actual, alleged or suspected criminal activity; carry firearms; execute and serve warrants; and make arrests for all crimes under the jurisdiction of the United States. The criminal investigative function of the Coast Guard Investigative Service is similar to that of a major crimes unit at a large metropolitan police department, investigating crimes such as those \\"internal\\" to the Coast Guard, including fraud, larceny, homicide and rape, as well as \\"external\\" investigations of maritime-related crimes ranging from migrant and drug smuggling, homicide, rape, false distress calls, and violations of the environmental laws. The Coast Guard Investigative Service is a centralized directorship managed by a professional criminal investigator who reports directly to the Coast Guard's Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard. It is located outside the Coast Guard's operational chain of command.

Although moderately common in all of the reasonably fertile parts of Australia (the east coast, the south-east, and the south-west corner) it is seldom seen closely enough to enable identification. Three subspecies are recognised. The wet tropics spotted pardalote (subspecies militaris) is found in northeastern Queensland, while the distinctive subspecies, the yellow-rumped pardalote (subspecies xanthopyge), is found in drier inland regions of southern Australia, particularly in semi-arid Mallee woodlands. Taxonomy The spotted pardalote was described by English naturalist George Shaw and drawn by Frederick Polydore Nodder in the 1792 work The Naturalist's Miscellany: Or, Coloured Figures Of Natural Objects; Drawn and Described Immediately From Nature. Calling it Pipra punctata, or speckled manakin, Shaw conceded that nothing had been reported of its habits in New Holland (Australia). Early settlers of New South Wales knew it as the Diamond Bird, on account of the spots on its plumage, and John Gould called it the spotted diamond-bird. Other early names include diamond sparrow, bank diamond and diamond dyke, the last two relating to its nest burrows in riverbanks. Indigenous people from lowlands and Perth districts of southern Western Australia knew it as widopwidop and bilyabit, though the terms were also used for the striated pardalote. Headache bird is a colloquial name given it because of the repetitive \\"sleep-may-be\\" call uttered in the breeding season. The species was placed in the new genus Pardalotus by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816, who also coined the word \\"pardalote\\". Within the genus, its closest relative is the forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus) based on size and plumage similarities. Three subspecies are recognised. The nominate subspecies (P. punctatus punctatus) is found from southeastern Queensland through eastern New South Wales, eastern and southern Victoria and into southeastern South Australia, as well as southwestern Western Australia. It is also found across eastern and northwestern Tasmania. The yellow-rumped pardalote (P. punctatus xanthopyge) was considered for many years to be a separate species native to dryer inland southern Australia. It was described in 1867 amid some controversy. Amateur ornithologist Edward Pierson Ramsay, then 24 years old, recorded that a specimen at the Australian Museum that had been collected by John Leadbeater near the Murray River differed in its plumage from the typical spotted pardalote. The director of the museum, Gerard Krefft, lent the specimen to Ramsay to describe, which he did as Pardalotus chrysoprymnus in a manuscript on 10 December 1866. Krefft advised him that Leadbeater was pushing for the species to be named after him, hence the paper was read but not published in London at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London on 28 February 1867. Meanwhile, Professor Frederick McCoy of the National Museum of Natural History and Geology in Melbourne also published a description of the species from a specimen collected near Swan Hill, in The Australasian newspaper on 29 December 1866, which was formally described on 1 March 1867. McCoy named it Pardalotus xanthopygus, or yellow-backed diamondbird. Ramsay suspected that discussion of his description prompted McCoy to publish his own description, however McCoy countered that they had been aware it was a separate species for some time. In any case, McCoy's description stood and Ramsay's was consigned to synonymy. In a 1983 paper, Lester Short and colleagues noted the similarity or plumage and calls between the two taxa and occurrence of hybrid specimens from Victoria where the two forms overlapped. John Woinarski found that around Bendigo (where both taxa occur), more pairs appeared to contain members of both forms than not. Western Australian ornithologist Julian Ford felt evidence of hybridization in Western Australia was lacking and also wondered whether land clearing and habitat alteration had promoted hybridization in southeastern Australia. In their 1999 Directory of Australian Birds, Richard Schodde and Ian Mason relegated the yellow-rumped pardalote to subspecies status on account of the intermediate characteristics of subspecies militaris and the widespread hybridization in southeastern Australia. They felt Ford's evidence for lack of interbreeding in Western and South Australia was not strong, but conceded fieldwork in Western Australia was needed. The Wet Tropics spotted pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus militaris) is found in coastal central-northern Queensland. It has features in common with both other subspecies. Description The reddish rump of the nominate subspecies is clearly visible (Strangways, Victoria). Weighing around , the spotted pardalote is long. The adult male of the nominate subspecies has grey-brown upperparts with numerous paler buff spots, a black crown, wings and tail all with white spots, white eyebrows and reddish rump. The underparts are pale-buff-cinnamon, darkening to a more ochre at the breast, with a demarcated yellow throat and vent. The female is duller overall. The yellow-rumped subspecies is larger overall with a relatively smaller bill. The adult male has finer, white, spots on its back, a bright yellow rump, and a cream breast. The adult female has finer spots than the adult female of the nominate subspecies. The Wet Tropics subspecies is smaller with a relatively larger bill. The adult male has a reddish rump and pale- to cinnamon buff underparts. Distribution and habitat George Caley reported that it was not common around Sydney even in early settlement days. Spotted pardalote numbers appear to be declining, especially in urban areas, but the species in not considered endangered at this time. Nesting Spotted pardalotes breed between August or September to December or January—generally earlier in the year in northern parts of their range and later in southern areas. The nest is an underground horizontal oval chamber lined with shredded bark, linked by a tunnel long to a hole in the side of a riverbank or slope in a shaded location. The chamber is generally higher than the entrance tunnel, presumably to avoid flooding. Birds have used carpet rolls and garage roll-a-doors to nest in on occasion. Pairs breed once a year, producing a clutch of 3 to 4 round shiny white eggs long by wide. The eggs are incubated for 19 days until they hatch, with nestlings spending another 21 days in the nest. Pairs make soft, whistling wheet-wheet calls to one another throughout the day, which carry for quite a distance. One of the difficulties in locating a pardalote is that the contact call is in fact two calls: an initial call and an almost instant response, and thus can come from two different directions.

They are found in numerous cultures around the world, including the people of the American Southwest, the ancestral Pueblo, the ancient Fremont and Mogollon cultures, the Cherokee, the Inuit, the people of the Plateau, and archaic residents of Wyoming (Smith 2003) in North America; Archaic residents of the Lake Titicaca Basin (Craig 2005) in South America; Anglo-Saxons in Europe; and the Jōmon people in Japan. Anglo-Saxon pit-houses may have actually represented buildings for other functions than just dwellings. Usually, all that remains of the ancient pit-house is a dug-out hollow in the ground and any postholes used to support the roof. In the nineteenth century, it was believed that most prehistoric peoples lived in pit-houses, although it has since been proved that many of the features thought of as houses were in fact food prehistoric storage pits or served another purpose. Mammoth bone dwellings Mammoth bone dwelling The oldest pit dwellings were discovered in Mezhyrich, Central Ukraine. Dating back 15,000 years to the Upper Paleolithic age, the houses were made of mammoth bones. The base is circular or oval in shape, in diameter, with limb bones used for walls and lighter, flat bones used for the roof. Presumably, animal hide was stretched around the exterior for insulation. Each dwelling had a hearth. Groups of houses were arranged around a base camp layout, occupied by families or relatives for weeks or months.Hoffecker, John A Prehistory of the North: Human Settlement of the Higher Latitudes Rutgers, 2005, url= Early medieval Europe thumb A reconstruction Pit-houses were built in many parts of northern Europe between the 5th and 12th centuries AD. In Germany they are known as Grubenhäuser, and in the United Kingdom, they are also known as grubhuts, grubhouses or sunken featured buildings. Archaeological evidence indicates they were built in a shallow sub-rectangular pit and vary in depth (often relating to the preservation of the site). Some may measure 0.25m by around 2m by 1.5m, whilst examples from excavations from the 1950s onwards at West Stow in the United Kingdom are 3.7m-4.44m long x 2.72m-3.5m wide x 0.58m-0.97m deep. Within this pit were placed two (but sometimes 0, 4, or 6) substantial wooden posts in postholes at either end of the long axis. Some archaeologists have suggested that a suspended wooden floor lay over the pit and that the cavity beneath was used for storage or to control dampness, although others have disputed this, suggesting that grubenhäuser did not have suspended floors at all. A gabled roof supported by the timber posts covered the hut, which likely had no windows and had a single entrance at one end. Excavations at West Stow (UK) in the 1970s found preserved evidence of charred planks, suggestive of suspended floors. Hearths were also found, which sat partially over the edge of the sunken pits and appeared to have collapsed downwards when the structure supporting their overhanging sections (possibly a suspended floor) was removed.West 2001, West Stow Revisited, St Edmundsbury Borough Council Grubenhäuser are often understood to have been domestic dwellings. However, their use may have varied, especially on a regional basis. In Western Europe their small size and the fact that they can be found near other buildings and associated finds of loom weights has led to theories that they had a specialised purpose such as for weaving sheds. In the Slavonic regions of Eastern Europe, Grubenhäuser are larger and often have a fireplace. In most settlements there have been no features of buildings at ground level. There are reconstructions of pit-houses in several open-air museums, e.g. in the Hitzacker Archaeological Centre, the Kalkriese Museum and Park, the Oerlinghausen Archaeological Open Air Museum, and the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave.  In North America  Throughout the inland Pacific Northwest, indigenous people were nomadic during the summer and gathered resources at different spots according to the season and tradition, but over wintered in permanent semi-subterranean pit houses at lower elevations. The winter was often the only time families saw others- even if they were from the same village and tribe- and congregated in any numbers before the arrival of trading posts. Often these houses were located along on major rivers and tributaries like the Columbia and Fraser; were typically round and fairly small, and were covered in layers of tule mats to keep out the weather and keep in the heat. There was a smoke hole in the center, and the interior, though warm in winter, was exceptionally smoky.Lithic design and Technoloigical Organization in Housepit 1 of the S7istken Site, Middle Fraser Canyon, British Columbia By Matthew Mattes A reconstruction of a pit-house at the Step House ruins in Mesa Verde National Park, United States, shows the pit dug below grade, four supporting posts, roof structure as a layers of wood and mud, and the entry through the roof. These are pit-house replicas in the Pueblo Grande Ruins in Phoenix, Arizona. They represent what the Hohokam pit- houses looked like 1000 years ago. In the northwestern Great Plains and the Plateau region located nearby, climate changes and extreme temperature and weather conditions made it difficult to live year-round. Hot summers led to the building of simple tent-like structures that were portable and could be packed up to move. For cold winter months, pit-houses provided the warm, protected shelter necessary for survival.  Cross-cultural patterning  Gluringen, Valais, Switzerland. Traces in the ground would appear as a \\"pit- house\\". A cross-cultural middle range model of pit-house architecture using the Ethnographic Atlas found that 82 of the 862 societies in the sample occupy pit structures as either their primary or secondary dwellings.(Gilman 1987:540) All but six of the 82 societies live above 32° north latitude, and four of the six cases in this sample that are below 32° north latitude are from \\"high mountain\\" regions in east Africa, Paraguay, and eastern Brazil.(Gonzalez 1953) The last example is from the YamiKano and Segawa (1956) who occupied a small island south of Formosa. Three conditions were always present among groups in the sample: 1) non-tropical climate during the season of pit structure habitation; 2) minimally a biseasonal settlement pattern; 3) reliance on stored food during the period of pit structure occupation. These conditions may be related to other factors of society and the presence of any or all of these three elements in society does not pre-condition occupation of pit structures. Nonetheless, these three conditions were present in all cases of pit structure occupation present in the Ethnographic Atlas. Other cultural patterns were common, but not universal across the sample. These commonalities include: cold season of occupation, low population estimates, and simple political and economic systems. The ethnographic sample is based almost entirely on case studies from societies located in northern latitudes. The period of pit structure occupation is generally during the cold season, probably due to their thermal efficiency. Dug into the ground, pit structures take advantage to the insulating properties of soil, as well as having a low profile, protecting them from exposure to wind-induced heat loss.Gilman (1987:542) Since less heat is lost by transmission than is in above ground structures, less energy is required to maintain stable temperatures inside the structure.Farwell (1981) Out of the 82 ethnographic cases in the Ethnographic Atlas, 50 societies had population estimates. Of these, 64% had fewer than 100 people per settlement.Gilman (1987:544) In only 6% of cases were there more than 400 persons per settlement. The cases with the highest population densities were the Arikara and Hidatsa of the North American Great Plains and the Konso of Ethiopia. Gilman attributes high population densities among the Arikara to the availability of buffalo. Pit structure occupations are generally associated with simple political and economic systems. For 86% of the sample, class stratification or social distinctions based on non- hereditary wealth were reported as absent.Gilman (1987:547) However, some pit- dwelling societies are characterized by chiefdom level complexity. In terms of economic organization, 77% of the societies who occupy pit structures had a hunting and gathering economy.Gilman (1987:545) This is a large fraction of the sample, but is not considered a universally consistent feature like biseasonal settlement and a reliance on stored foods during pit structure occupation. During the part of the year when people are not living in pit structures, activities should be focused on acquiring foods to store. Based on the sample from the Ethnographic Atlas, this may be through either hunting and gathering or agricultural activity. Many different prehistoric groups used pit houses. Although generally associated with the American southwest cultures, such as Fremont, Pueblo, Anasazi, Hohokam, and Mogollon, pit houses were used by a wide variety of people in a wide variety of places over the past 12,000 years. Large pit house formations have been excavated in British Columbia, Canada, such as at Keatley Creek Archaeological Site. Excavation procedure First, all loose dirt is scraped off the pit-house surface, using trowels. A construction number (C_) and a feature number (A_) are assigned, and bird's-eye view photos are taken of the surface of the pit-house. A ~30 cm wide section of the pit-house is cordoned off using string and nails in an east–west orientation, as is typical. This profile wall is left intact for the bulk of the excavation so a team can clearly see the separate layers of the pit-house as they dig deeper. Trowels are then used to excavate on either side of the profile wall. While some finds turn up directly through digging, others are found once the removed soil is sieved. A scaled diagram (either 1:10 cm, 1:20 cm, or 1:50 cm) of the pit-house is drawn afterwards to document the location of important finds. Once the floor layer is reached, aerial pictures are taken once again. The profile wall is then excavated to reveal the full pit-house floor. Along the way, all important finds are bagged and assigned artifact (X_) numbers.  Current usage  While many standard definitions of pit-houses tend to render them as 'primitive' or 'pre-modern' structures, they remain examples – along with rammed earth and straw-bale building – of elegant and sustainable architecture and design technologies that work with the existing ecological and environmental features of a given space or site. In Canada, pit houses are emblematic of local indigenous knowledge and practices which build with - as opposed to against - the land. One current and symbolic example is the pit-house recently erected at the Unis’tot’en Camp, an autonomous community located on the proposed North Gateway Pipeline route across the traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en people (central British Columbia). Built by members of the band along with activists and allies who live in solidarity in the camp, the house is an expression of sustainable building alternatives.

It is mainly in charge of the civilian protection, but also for affairs relating to the citizenship, elections, referendums, popular petitions and the alternative civilian service. All of the country's (state and federal) law enforcement agencies are part of the ministry. The Ministry of the Interior is often unofficially considered as the perhaps second most powerful federal ministry, ranking after the Ministry of Finance. Together with the Defense Ministry it controls the great majority of Austria's armed organizations. Its head and chief executive authority is the Minister of the Interior (Bundesminister), currently Karl Nehammer. Right under the Minister is the General secretary (Generalsekretär), currently Peter Goldgruber, who serves as the agency's head of operations and second-highest-ranking official. The State secretary, currently Karoline Edtstadler (ÖVP), could be seen as an overseeing authority (with no direct executive power) for the coalition party that hasn't obtained the minister post. The ministry is one of the few, that has a cabinet chief (Kabinettchef), he serves as chief of staff to the minister. The Ministry was originally created as \\"Imperial and Royal Ministry of the Interior\\", serving as the empire-wide interior ministry for Austria-Hungary. It was succeeded by the \\"state office of the Interior\\" (Staatsamt des Innern) of the First Republic in 1918, and later renamed into \\"Federal Ministry of the Interior\\". After the dissolution of Nazi Germany in 1945 the Ministry was reestablished into its current form. The Palais Modena is the ministry's central headquarters, it is located in the center of Austria's federal capital Vienna. History Until 1848 internal affairs of the country was under the responsibility of the Austro-Bohemian Court Chancellery which was established by Empress Maria Theresia.Mario Muigg (2009) The Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior in the 20th century SIAK Journal (3) Retrieved 20 October 2013 In 1848 the ministry was established with the name of the Ministry of the Interior. Between 1918 and 1920 it was called State Office of the Interior. Then it was merged with the ministry of education and was renamed as State Office and Federal Ministry of the Interior and of Education. The body was integrated into the federal government in 1923. Following World War II it was renamed into its current title, Federal Ministry of the Interior. Responsibilities The federal agency on cabinet-level is charged with the matters of public security, citizenship and civil status including legal names, elections, referendums and popular petitions as well as emergency management and the alternative civilian service. As superior of the Directorate General for Public Security, the Minister for the Interior is in charge of the Federal Police, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism, the EKO Cobra tactical unit as well as of the Federal Criminal Police Office. Beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Chancellery, the Ministry is also responsible for the matters of the Austrian states and municipalities, foundations and sovereign wealth funds.

Members include the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the American Council on Alcohol Problems, the Temperance League of Kentucky, the General Board of Global Ministries and the Illinois Church Action on Alcohol and Addiction Problems, among others. Over 120 organizations now participate in the Coalition for the Prevention of Alcohol Problems.  Agenda  The group advocates raising taxes on beer, wine, and liquor, limiting alcohol advertising on television and radio, and opposes alcohol advertising that may target youths. There are several issues which the Coalition has identified as priorities. These include: # Restrictions on alcohol advertising, including: #* Placement of rotating health and safety messages in all alcohol advertisements. #* Equal time for health and safety messages in the broadcast medium. #* Elimination of ads that promote the association of drinking and risky activities. #* Reform of alcohol ads that associate drinking with sexual and social success. #* Restrictions on the promotional activities of alcohol companies on college campuses. #* Restrictions on alcohol advertisements that target youth. This would include: restrictions on sponsorship of youth- oriented events such as rock concerts and sporting events; and an alcohol-free viewing period in the broadcast viewing and listening media. #* Disallowance of tax deductions for alcohol advertising. # Improvements in alcoholic beverage labeling, including strengthening and expanding the current mandated warning label and providing additional consumer on alcoholic beverage containers, such as ingredients, alcohol content, calories, information about standard units of service, and a toll-free telephone number for consumer questions about alcohol. # Increase in federal alcohol excise taxes and equalization of the tax rate on all beverage alcohol types. # Stronger regulation of alcoholic beverage industry practices by federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Trade Commission. # Expanded research on alcohol advertising, labeling and tax issues through the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public and private agencies. # Promotion within the legislative and executive branches of government of a better understanding of alcohol as America's costliest and most widespread drug problem. # Stronger demand-reduction policies related to alcohol, and proposals to expand public alcoholism treatment and prevention initiatives.

He has been on their public advisory board since it was created in 2008.The NHIOP Congratulates Board Member Mark Halperin on his New Best-Selling Book, Saint Anselm College website; accessed January 10, 2018. In March 2007, Halperin became a political analyst for ABC News and was replaced as political director by David Chalian. In May 2007, Halperin was hired as a political analyst and editor at large for Time magazine. In June 2010, he was hired as senior political analyst at MSNBC. In 2011, Time released an iPad app called \\"Mark Halperin 2012\\" that contains material from Halperin's \\"The Page\\" as well as video, photos, breaking news, and Halperin's take on the news. Halperin and co-author John Heilemann wrote the 2010 Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime. Subsequently the book was made into the HBO movie Game Change, which premiered on March 10, 2012. Halperin had a cameo role in the movie as a reporter. Halperin and Heilemann followed in 2012 with a book about that election titled Double Down: Game Change 2012. =Criticism= On June 30, 2011, Halperin was suspended from his duties at MSNBC for \\"slurring\\" President Barack Obama on the program Morning Joe, saying the President came off as \\"kind of a dick\\" during the previous day's press conference. His suspension was lifted a month later. In December 2011, Halperin was listed as #1 in the Salon website's 2011 Hack List, his reporting described as \\"shallow and predictable\\" as well as \\"both fixated solely on the horse race and also uniquely bad at analyzing the horse race.\\" The Washington Posts Dana Milbank called Halperin's analysis in the 2016 United States presidential campaign \\"soulless\\" and \\"amoral,\\" and cited a number of instances where Halperin praised Republican nominee Donald Trump. Alex Shephard, writing in The New Republic, criticized his coverage for being overly focused on the horse race and for shallow analysis. Conversely, Benjamin Wallace-Wells of The New Yorker writes that Halperin's The Circus is \\"both an argument for horse-race journalism and a way to see its inner workings, and so to track Heilemann and Halperin in their long traipse across the American interior is to see the media discovering its own vulnerabilities, just as Trump was exploiting them.\\" In November 2016, Brian Williams said Halperin had \\"gone out of his way\\" to give Trump favorable coverage. =Sexual harassment allegations= On October 26, 2017, CNN reported that five women had come forward and accused Halperin of sexual harassment. One woman told the network she was assaulted after visiting Halperin in the early 2000s. \\"I went up to have a soda and talk and he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs,\\" the woman said. \\"I just froze. I didn't know what to do.\\" Another woman told CNN that Halperin once pressed his penis on her shoulder during the 2004 campaign cycle. \\"I was obviously completely shocked,\\" she said. \\"Given I was so young and new, I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news.\\" A third woman, a former ABC News employee, told CNN she was on the road with Halperin when he propositioned her. \\"I excused myself to go to the bathroom and he was standing there when I opened the door, propositioning [me] to go into the other bathroom to do something,\\" she said. \\"It freaked me out. I came out of the ladies' room and he was just standing there. Like almost blocking the door.\\" Halperin apologized for pursuing \\"relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,\\" but denied pressing his genitals against a woman and grabbing another woman's breast. He added that he would temporarily leave his daily work to \\"properly deal with this situation.\\" Later that day, NBC News released a statement saying that in light of the allegations, Halperin would not return as a senior political analyst \\"until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\\" HBO announced it would no longer go forward with a planned miniseries about the presidential election that was based in part on Halperin's then-upcoming book on the 2016 election. The premium cable channel said in a statement, “HBO has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions.” Penguin Press also canceled the latest installment of the Game Change series Halperin was co-authoring with John Heilemann, which HBO had already canceled plans to adapt. A day after their first story, CNN ran a second story revealing that the number of women accusing Halperin of misconduct had grown to \\"at least a dozen.\\" In a lengthy statement published in response to the CNN report, Halperin denied some of the new allegations, including that he masturbated in front of anyone or physically assaulted anyone. He apologized to the women he \\"mistreated\\" and said that he recognized he had a problem near the end of his tenure at ABC, received weekly counseling sessions, and ended the behavior; however, a later report from The Daily Beast included an allegation of harassment from 2011. On October 30, 2017, both NBC and MSNBC terminated Halperin's contract with the network. On January 3, 2018, Showtime replaced Halperin with CBS News anchor Alex Wagner. =Comeback attempts= According to a May 3, 2019 report in The Daily Beast, Halperin worked on repairing his reputation during the first quarter of 2019 with a goal of returning as a pundit on television and radio. According to the article, Halperin enlisted the help of Michael Smerconish, Mika Brzezinski, and Joe Scarborough on a under the radar, yet calculated, professional rehabilitation campaign. Since the beginning of 2019, Halperin resumed posting on Twitter, and in mid-April launched a new political blog titled \\"Mark Halperin’s Wide World of News\\". Around the same time, Halperin appeared on Sirius XM with Smerconish, where he said he has been working with the Fortune Society, a New York City-based nonprofit organization that provides essential support to the formerly incarcerated. On August 18, 2019, publisher Regan Arts announced that Halperin had signed a new book deal. The book, entitled How to Beat Trump: America’s Top Political Strategists on What It Will Take, was published in early-November 2019. Contributors to the book include David Axelrod, Donna Brazile, and James Carville. After news broke about the upcoming book, there was widespread criticism and outrage, with Gretchen Carlson calling the deal \\"a slap in the face to all women.\\" Rebecca Katz, a political strategist said on Twitter, \\"you can beat Trump without supporting the career rehabilitation of Mark Halperin.\\" CNN political commentator Karen Finney called Halperin \\"a predator\\" and denounced the book publisher Regan Arts. According to a September 9, 2019 report in The Daily Beast, Halperin allegedly exchanged vague threats on a call with MSNBC president Phil Griffin after being refused a possible collaboration with the Morning Joe team earlier in 2019. In 2020, Halperin began appearing on Newsmax TV as a contributor, and is the host of their weekly Sunday show, \\"Mark Halperin's Focus Group.\\"  Personal life  Halperin resides in New York City with his girlfriend, Karen Avrich, co-author of Sasha and Emma.

Description A small, energetic passerine about long, the forty-spot is similar to the much commoner spotted pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus), but has a dull greenish-brown back and head, compared to the more colourful plumage of the former, with which it shares its range, and there is no brow line. The rump is olive, the under-tail dull yellow. The chest is white with light yellow tints. The wings are black with white tips, appearing as many (closer to 60 than 40) discrete dots when the wings are folded. There is no seasonal variation in plumage; juveniles are slightly less colourful than the adults. Distribution Now found reliably only in a few isolated colonies on south-eastern Tasmania, most notably on Maria Island and Bruny Island. It is occasionally reported from the suburbs of Hobart. Sedentary or locally nomadic over its restricted range, it is declining in numbers and listed as endangered. It is most successful on Maria Island, which is managed as a refuge. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for forty-spotted pardalote conservation are Bruny Island, Central Flinders Island, Maria Island and South-east Tasmania. Habitat Relatively dry eucalypt forests with high concentration of the white gum, where it forages almost exclusively. Behaviour Forty-spots form pairs and are territorial during the breeding season, but may form small flocks during the winter. They are insect hunters and forage methodically for small insects in the canopy. They nest in tree hollows and occasionally in ground burrows.

History  In 1994, the Department of Defense introduced the Total Dental Access Program (TDA) for the Army. The goals of TDA were to increase soldier's access to care and reduce associated costs. At the time, they used what was called the plain-old-telephone-system (POTS). In the early nineteen nineties, videoconferencing, e-mail, fax, and telephone calls were used but more recently, video conferencing and high-quality image transfer have become easily accessible. These, and the considerable improvements in digital camera technology, have provided radical new opportunities. Nearly a third of all Americans don't visit a dentist regularly enough, according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. There are many reasons for this, most notably affordability, access and fear. Several teledental startup companies operate in the United States, including Dentulu, NexHealth, The Teledentists , and Virtudent. Direct-to-consumer orthodontics companies like SmileDirectClub also utilize teledentistry, but have drawn criticism regarding proper supervision of care.  Methods and Modalities  Live Video (Synchronous): Live two-way video between a patient and provider using audiovisual telecommunications technology. Live video is often used to triage patients to the appropriate level of care or for specialty consultations. Store-and- forward (Asynchronous): Transmission of recorded health information (for example, radiographs or digital impressions taken by an appropriately licensed provider) through a secure electronic communications system to a practitioner, who uses the information to evaluate or diagnose the patient's condition outside at a later time. Remote Patient Monitoring: Health data collection from an individual in one location (usually outside of a conventional clinical setting), which is transmitted to a provider in a different location for use in care and related support. mHealth: Health promotion and education via mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets.  Benefits  Teledentistry can provide easier, cheaper and less intimidating way to connect with dentistry. Teledentistry can also be used to assist general dentists with speciality work and improve services to underserved populations such as in rural or less developed areas.

Whereas the modern French spelling for \\"island\\" is île, the municipality uses the old French spelling of Isle. Its population centres include La Baleine in the north-east, (Saint-Louis- de-)l'Isle-aux-Coudres in the south, and Saint-Bernard-sur-Mer in the north- west facing Baie-Saint-Paul. A free ferry service connects Saint-Bernard-sur- Mer to Saint-Joseph-de-la-Rive on the north shore of the gulf. Formerly, porpoise fishing was practised on a broad basis, supplemented by some boat construction. Today tourism is the main industry, and the place is known for its historical sites, tourist accommodations, and craftspeople. On the beach near the ferry dock, there is a shipyard that is home to craftsmen who work according to ancestral techniques. The island is also a popular destination for cyclists. It was the setting for the classic 1963 National Film Board of Canada documentary Pour la suite du monde. Geography The island is about long and averages in width. It is thought to have been formed from material lifted up by the impact of the meteor which formed the Charlevoix region. Local streams include the Rouge River and Mare Creek. History Étienne de Lessart of Ste. Anne-de-Beaupré was granted title as the first Seigneur of l'Isle-aux-Coudres by Governor Buade de Frontenac on March 4, 1677. Due to a failure to develop the property to increase its value he was forced to sell the seigneurie on October 19, 1687 to the Séminaire de Québec who began to establish a monastery on the site. On October 29, 1687, Governor Denonville and Intendant Champigny granted the island as a seignory to the Seminary of Quebec, an act that was ratified on March 1, 1688. In 1728, the first concessions of land were granted to settlers, and by 1741, the Parish of Saint-Louis-de-France was formed, soon after renamed to Saint-Louis-de-l'Isle- aux-Coudres. Named after Louis IX of France, it probably was also a tribute to Louis Chaumont (or Chaumonot) de La Jaunière (ca. 1700-1776), priest of Baie- Saint-Paul from 1736 to 1767. In 1845, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Louis- de-l'Isle-aux-Coudres was formed. In 1847, it was abolished, but reestablished in 1855, and would remain the only municipality covering the entire island for the next 80 years. The community of Saint-Bernard-sur-Mer, first known as Pointe-des-Roches until 1936, only really developed from 1902 onward. The Parish of Saint-Bernard, named in honour of Bernard of Clairvaux (ca. 1090-1153), was officially founded in 1934 when it separated from the Parish of Saint-Louis, and was incorporated as the Municipality of Saint-Bernard- de-l'Île-aux-Coudres in 1936. In 1951, the Municipality of La Baleine was incorporated, when it separated from Saint-Louis-de-l'Isle-aux-Coudres. It was named after an incident that had occurred in the late 18th century when the islanders found a carcass of a dead whale (in French: baleine) that had stranded on the island's flats. At this point, the island was divided into three municipal entities. On January 5, 1994, the Municipality of Saint- Bernard-de-l'Île-aux-Coudres and the Parish Municipality of Saint-Louis- de-l'Isle-aux-Coudres were merged and formed the Municipality of L'Île-aux- Coudres (new spelling). On August 23, 2000, this municipality and the Municipality of La Baleine were merged again to form the new Municipality of L'Isle-aux-Coudres (old spelling).

Most of these weapons however remained prototypes, which either never reached the combat theater, or if they did, were too late or in too insignificant numbers to have a military effect.Willy Ley, \\"V-2: Rocket Cargo Ship\\" Astounding Science Fiction, May 1945, repr. Famous Science-Fiction Stories: Adventures in Time and Space, (ed. J. Francis McComas, Raymond J. Healy, [1946], 1957), p. 359. The V-weapons, which were developed earlier and saw considerable deployment, especially against London and Antwerp, trace back to the same pool of highly inventive armament concepts. Therefore, they are also included here. As the war situation worsened for Germany from 1942, claims about the development of revolutionary new weapons which could turn the tide became an increasingly prominent part of the propaganda directed at Germans by their government. In reality, the advanced weapons under development generally required lengthy periods of design work and testing, and there was no realistic prospect of the German military being able to field them before the end of the war. When some advanced designs, such as the Panther tank and Type XXI submarine, were rushed into production their performance proved disappointing to the German military and leadership due to inadequate pre-production testing or poorly planned construction processes. Historian Michael J. Neufeld has noted that \\"the net result of all these weapons, deployed or otherwise, was that the Reich wasted a lot of money and technical expertise (and killed a lot of forced and slave laborers) in developing and producing exotic devices that yielded little or no tactical and strategic advantage\\". However, a few weapons proved to be successful and have had a large influence in post war designs. In the German language the term Wunderwaffe generally refers to a universal solution which solves all problems related to a particular issue, mostly used ironically for its illusionary nature.

It was directed by Jean-Pierre Melville and stars Alain Delon, Andre Bourvil, Gian Maria Volonté, François Périer and Yves Montand. It is known for its climactic heist sequence which is about half an hour in length and has almost no dialogue. The film's title means \\"The Red Circle\\" and refers to the film's epigraph which translates as Melville made up the quote, just as he did with the epigraph in Le Samouraï. Plot In Marseille, a prisoner named Corey is released early for good behaviour. Shortly before he leaves, a prison warden tips him off about a prestigious jewellery shop that he could rob in Paris. Corey goes to the house of Rico, a former associate who has let him down and with whom his former girlfriend now lives, and forcefully removes money and a handgun from Rico's safe. Then he goes to a billiard hall, where two of Rico's men find him. After killing one, knocking the other out and taking his gun, Corey buys a large (American) car and, hiding both handguns in the boot, starts for Paris. On the way up, listening to jazz and news on the radio, he encounters a police roadblock. The same morning another prisoner, Vogel, who was being taken on a train from Marseille to Paris for interrogation by the well-respected Commissaire Mattei, manages to escape in open country. Mattei chases him, misses him, orders roadblocks to be set and supervises the manhunt. Meanwhile, Corey, who has understood what this huge police activity is about, stops at a roadside grill in the epicentre of the manhunt, leaving his car boot unlocked. Vogel crosses a stream to send dogs off his scent, reaches the roadside grill and hides in the boot of Corey's car. Corey, who has seen him and had been waiting for this, drives off into an open field and tells Vogel to get out, that he is safe. After a tense confrontation where Vogel waves one of Corey's guns, he realizes that Corey has just been released from prison that morning and is trying to save him. The two drive off with Vogel back in the boot. Shortly after, a car with two of Rico's men catches up and forces Corey off the road. The pair take him into the woods, take his money and are about to kill him when Vogel, emerging from the boot with the guns, shoots both dead. Corey takes Vogel to his empty flat in Paris where they start to plan the robbery. For this they need a marksman, to disable the security system by a single rifle shot, and a fence to buy the goods. At the same time, Mattei is trying to locate the murderer of Rico's men and to recapture Vogel. To do this, he puts pressure on Santi, a night club owner who knows most of the underworld, but who refuses to talk. Corey recruits Jansen, an alcoholic ex-policeman and a crack shot, together with a fence. One long night, Corey, with Vogel and the support of Jansen successfully rob the jewellery shop. However, his fence refuses to take the goods, having been warned off by a revengeful Rico, who had been told inadvertantly by the prison warden from the beginning that Corey was on the job. Overcoming their disappointment, Jansen and Vogel suggest that Corey asks Santi to recommend a new fence. Mattei blackmails Santi to obtain information about the meeting planned that evening at his night-club where Corey is supposed to meet the fence. Mattei posing as the fence asks Corey to bring the goods to a country house. Corey does so, taking Jansen as backup and leaving Vogel at his apartment, who has been given the rose Corey had received from a waitress at Santi's. After Corey arrives at the country house and starts showing the jewels to Mattei, Vogel appears from nowhere [presumably] acting on his suspicion that Corey was not safe with this new fence, and tells Corey to run with the loot. After a brief, tense confrontation with Mattei, Vogel follows Corey. Jansen alerted by the gunshots in the mansion's park now filled with police, arrives to stop the pursuants. One after the other, the three men are shot dead by Mattei's officers, who recover the jewels.

It has a deliberate pace as Melville sets up the story of three chance acquaintances who plan and carry out the sacking of an elegant, supposedly impregnable jewelry store...Understatement is the method of the film, from Melville's pared-down screenplay to the performances by the three trenchcoated principals, even to the muted photography by Henri Decaë, which is in color but has the chilly effect of black and white. Peter Bradshaw, in a 2003 review of a 102-minute reissue, called the film a \\"treat\\" and noted \\"Melville blends the Chandleresque world of his own devising with gritty French reality.

The company was founded in 1992 in Burgas and is headquartered there. Skat is also the name for one of the channels which Skat television operates from the Bulgarian capital city Sofia. History Skat as a cable TV company operates mostly in the Burgas Province and has created cable networks in many populated places near the Black Sea coast. The company, like the other cable TV operators in Burgas, provides analogue television, digital television, Internet access and telephone services. Skat's headquarters are located in Burgas, and a regional TV channel called \\"Skat +\\" is broadcast from there to many places in the province. The main Skat channel was also broadcast from Burgas, until the early 2000s (decade), when it was relocated to Sofia. Controversies In 2005 Skat television became a center of controversy caused by the company's hosting of programs and shows supporting Bulgarian nationalist political party Attack. Attack openly associates with such organizations as the National Front in France. Complaints from the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and the political party Euroroma, stating that various Skat TV shows were focused on racial intolerance and racism, caused the Council for Electronic Media (CEM) to announce investigations into the programs broadcast on the Skat cable television channel in July – August 2005. In November 2009 Skat withdrew its support for Attack. On 17 May 2011 Skat created its own nationalist party called National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria. In 2012, Jehovah's Witnesses filed a complaint with the Commission for Protection against Discrimination stating that SKAT TV had systematically slandered the Witnesses and incited violence and hatred against them.http://www.osce.org/pc/233841?download=true The Commission unanimously decided in favour of the Witnesses in January 2016.

A gleaning specialist, they forage primarily in eucalypt trees . The Latin word rubricatus means red- ochred which is descriptive of their orange-red eyebrow . Other common names include red-browed diamondbird, bellbird, cape red-browed, pale red-browed, fawn-eyed, fawn-eyebrowed and pallid or red-lored pardalote .  Taxonomy Red-browed pardalotes belong to the order Passeriformes and family Pardalotidae of which four species are recognised: red-browed pardalote Pardalotus rubricatus, spotted pardalote Pardalotus punctatus, forty-spotted pardalote Pardalotus quadragintus and striated pardalote Pardalotus striatus. Historically, the family Pardalotidae included pardalotes and acanthizid warblers; gerygones, scrubwrens and thornbills . However, recent phylogenetic and morphological studies , indicate that pardalotes are more closely related to honeyeaters than acanthizid warblers, which resulted in the separation of this group into two families, Pardalotidae and Acanthizidae . The pardalote, acanthizid warbler, honeyeater and bristlebird family, form a monophyletic group . Subspecies Matthews described the subspecies Pardalotus yorki in 1913 . Their range begins at the base of the Gulf of Carpentaria and extends north along the Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland . Difference in morphology and plumage distinguish this subspecies from the nominate race . Description Adult red–browed pardalotes are a large pardalote with an average length of 105 mm and wingspan of 60–66 mm. Males weigh approximately 10.9g and females weigh 10.8 g. The average length of the male tarsus is 18.3 mm and female tarsus is 18.5 mm . The subspecies yorki are smaller in size, 100–120 mm long and weigh less at 9.3 g. The average length of the male tarsus is 17.4 mm and female tarsus is 17.3 mm , . Their wingspan is 58–62 mm in length . The red–browed pardalote does not exhibit plumage that changes seasonally and is not sexually dichromatic . The nominate race rubricatus have a pale iris, a black crown with distinctive white spots and a yellow to buff supercilium. They have a red to orange-red brow and a yellow breast patch with yellow wing panels , . Juvenile birds are generally paler in comparison to adults . They have a darker iris that is olive to pale olive, a duller crown with less obvious patterning and a dull orange-yellow brow . The sub-species yorki are generally more brightly coloured than the nominate race . They have an iris that is straw-brown or yellow, a black crown with fine spots; fine dark scalloping across their mantel and hind neck. They have a bright yellow breast patch, yellow rump and an orange wing panel , . Plumage of the juvenile yorki subspecies has not been described . The call of the red-browed pardalote is a distinctive five or six note song, with the first note longer and lower pitched than the remaining notes which increase in pitch and speed , . Males call periodically between feeding to announce their territory from a sheltered perch within the trees canopy . It has been described as sounding similar to the call of a rosella species .  Distribution and Habitat The Red-browed pardalote is a widely distributed species ranging from north and central Australia, south and south central Western Australia, northeast South Australia ( Lake Eyre Basin) to south west New South Wales. They may also be found throughout the Great Sandy, Gibson and Great Victoria Desert . They live in a wide range of habitats including woodlands, shrublands, tropical, arid and semi-arid regions of Australia . Eucalypt woodlands, which border watercourses such as riparian river red gum, coolibah woodlands and tall eucalypt shrublands such as mallee, are the preferred habitats , , , . In the desert sand-ridge country of Western Australia, red-browed pardalotes forage in the upper story of bloodwoods and marble gums dispersed amongst sand dunes . They have also been recorded in bloodwood-banksia, low–acacia and eucalypt–paperbark woodlands, mulga, acacia shrublands, spinifex plains and grasslands , , , . Red-browed pardalotes may also inhabit sand dunes, rocky outcrops, valleys and floodplains . Behaviour Foraging and Diet = Red-browed pardalotes are sedentary and hold foraging territories throughout the year . They are usually seen singly, in pairs or small groups of up to five or six birds . They are arboreal and spend most of their time foraging in the foliage of eucalypt trees . Their 'scoop-shaped' bill is used to glean insects and lerps (exudates of psyllids) from the leaf surface , . Lerps are a major food source for pardalotes providing sugar and carbohydrates . They also consume arthropods, beetles (Coleoptera species), gum leaf beetle (Paropsis species), flies, mosquitoes, flowerflies, leafhoppers, shield bugs, psyllids, bees, ants, wasps and vegetable matter . = Breeding = The red-browed pardalote breeds between July and December and after rainfall in arid zones . Pairs are monogamous and maintain breeding territories , . Both the male and female excavate a tunnel 6–122 cm long and a nesting chamber 10–12.7 cm deep, 6.3–10 cm wide and 14.0 cm high. This can be found in a range of locations, including sandy banks, gullies, cuttings, sand dunes, sand cliffs or piles of sand and soil . Red-browed pardalotes may also excavate the burrows of kangaroo rats (Potoroidae), hopping mice (Notomys) and bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) . They occasionally nest in tree hollows, spouts or hollow branches , . A bird was once recorded nesting halfway down an iron pipe that was set upright in the ground . Nests may be constructed of strips of bark, horsehair and are lined with fine grass or bark and shaped into a rounded cup within the excavated chamber , . A clutch of up to four white, oval, semi-glossy eggs measuring 19mm x 15 mm are laid . The incubation period is unknown, however both sexes incubate the eggs. Chicks are altricial and are fed by both adults . Conservation status The Red-browed Pardalote has been categorised on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as “Least Concern” by Birdlife International in 2012. Although the population size has not been quantified, this species is considered stable and is commonly found throughout its range .

About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats. About five species are well known as pests. The cockroaches are an ancient group, dating back at least as far as the Carboniferous period, some 320 million years ago. Those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches. Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living Neopteran insects. They are common and hardy insects, and can tolerate a wide range of environments from Arctic cold to tropical heat. Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species, and, contrary to popular belief, extinct cockroach relatives (Blattoptera) and 'roachoids' such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species. Some species, such as the gregarious German cockroach, have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity. They are popularly depicted as dirty pests, though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world. Taxonomy and evolution A 40- to 50-million-year-old cockroach in Baltic amber (Eocene) Cockroaches are members of the order Blattodea, which includes the termites, a group of insects once thought to be separate from cockroaches. Currently, 4,600 species and over 460 genera are described worldwide. The name \\"cockroach\\" comes from the Spanish word for cockroach, cucaracha, transformed by 1620s English folk etymology into \\"cock\\" and \\"roach\\". The scientific name derives from the Latin blatta, \\"an insect that shuns the light\\", which in classical Latin was applied not only to cockroaches, but also to mantids. Historically, the name Blattaria was used largely interchangeably with the name Blattodea, but whilst the former name was used to refer to 'true' cockroaches exclusively, the latter also includes the termites. The current catalogue of world cockroach species uses the name Blattodea for the group. Another name, Blattoptera, is also sometimes used to refer to extinct cockroach relatives. The earliest cockroach-like fossils (\\"blattopterans\\" or \\"roachids\\") are from the Carboniferous period 320 million years ago, as are fossil roachoid nymphs. Since the 19th century, scientists believed that cockroaches were an ancient group of insects that had a Devonian origin, according to one hypothesis. Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in that they had long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern cockroaches. As the body, hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently, the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appeared in the early Cretaceous. A recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated at least in the Jurassic. Common Mesozoic stem-group cockroaches include the Blattulidae and Mesoblattinidae. The evolutionary relationships of the Blattodea (cockroaches and termites) shown in the cladogram are based on Eggleton, Beccaloni and Inward (2007). The cockroach families Anaplectidae, Lamproblattidae, and Tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily Blattoidea. The cockroach families Corydiidae and Ectobiidae were previously known as the Polyphagidae and Blattellidae. Termites were previously regarded as a separate order Isoptera to cockroaches. However, recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from 'true' cockroaches, and many authors now place them as an \\"epifamily\\" of Blattodea. This evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in 1934 that termites are closely related to the wood-eating cockroaches (genus Cryptocercus). This hypothesis was originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in termites regarded as living fossils and wood- eating cockroaches. Additional evidence emerged when F. A. McKittrick (1965) noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cockroach nymphs. The similarities among these cockroaches and termites have led some scientists to reclassify termites as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea. Other scientists have taken a more conservative approach, proposing to retain the termites as the Termitoidae, an epifamily within the order. Such a measure preserves the classification of termites at family level and below. Description Domino cockroach Therea petiveriana, normally found in India Most species of cockroach are about the size of a thumbnail, but several species are bigger. The world's heaviest cockroach is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach Macropanesthia rhinoceros, which can reach in length and weigh more than . Comparable in size is the Central American giant cockroach Blaberus giganteus. The longest cockroach species is Megaloblatta longipennis, which can reach in length and across. A Central and South American species, Megaloblatta blaberoides, has the largest wingspan of up to . Head of Periplaneta americana Cockroaches are generalized insects, with few special adaptations, and may be among the most primitive living Neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors. The body is divided into a thorax of three segments and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings are attached to the second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins. The three pairs of legs are sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each. They are attached to each of the three thoracic segments. The front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs. The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of the insect's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs. The abdomen has ten segments, each with a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the external genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermatheca for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca are laid. Distribution and habitat Cockroaches are abundant throughout the world and live in a wide range of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely low temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests. Cockroaches occupy a wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in cavities under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they may be one of the main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed. Behavior A cockroach soon after ecdysis Cockroaches are social insects; a large number of species are either gregarious or inclined to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have been studied in only a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions. Daily rhythms may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood. In 2005, the role of one of these proteins, pigment dispersing factor (PDF), was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythms of the cockroach. Pest species adapt readily to a variety of environments, but prefer warm conditions found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. An exception to this is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly lit surfaces and pale colors. =Collective decision-making= Gregarious cockroaches display collective decision-making when choosing food sources. When a sufficient number of individuals (a \\"quorum\\") exploits a food source, this signals to newcomer cockroaches that they should stay there longer rather than leave for elsewhere. Other mathematical models have been developed to explain aggregation dynamics and conspecific recognition. Cooperation and competition are balanced in cockroach group decision-making behavior. Cockroaches appear to use just two pieces of information to decide where to go, namely how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that seem real to the roaches to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually lit place. =Social behavior= When reared in isolation, German cockroaches show behavior that is different from behavior when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches were less likely to leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals had not had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae. Individual American cockroaches appear to have consistently different \\"personalities\\" regarding how they seek shelter. In addition, group personality is not simply the sum of individual choices, but reflects conformity and collective decision-making. The gregarious German and American cockroaches have elaborate social structure, chemical signalling, and \\"social herd\\" characteristics. Lihoreau and his fellow researchers stated: There is evidence that a few species of group-living roaches in the genera Melyroidea and Aclavoidea may exhibit a reproductive division of labor, which, if confirmed, would make these the only genuinely eusocial lineage known among roaches, in contrast to the subsocial members of the genus Cryptocercus.Jan Hinkelman, Peter Vršanský1, Thierry Garcia, Adrian Tejedor, Paul Bertner, Anton Sorokin, Geoffrey R. Gallice, Ivana Koubová, Štefan Nagy, Ľubomír Vidlička1 (2020) Neotropical Melyroidea group cockroaches reveal various degrees of (eu)sociality. The Science of Nature 107:39 doi:10.1007/s00114-020-01694-x =Sounds= Some species make a hissing noise while other cockroaches make a chirping noise. The Madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles on the fourth abdominal segment. Several different hisses are produced, including disturbance sounds, produced by adults and larger nymphs; and aggressive, courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males. Henschoutedenia epilamproides has a stridulatory organ between its thorax and abdomen, but the purpose of the sound produced is unclear. Several Australian species practice acoustic and vibration behavior as an aspect of courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, in the presence of a potential mate, some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's tropics. BiologyDigestive tract= Cockroaches are generally omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds on a great variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor in their gut symbiotic protozoans and bacteria which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of microorganisms. The similarity of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus to those in termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach. It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts, or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re-examined. =Tracheae and breathing= Like other insects, cockroaches breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place. While cockroaches do not have lungs as do vertebrates, and can continue to respire if their heads are removed, in some very large species, the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air in and out of the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing. =Reproduction= Cockroaches use pheromones to attract mates, and the males practice courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males. Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of her life. The female usually attaches the egg case to a substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or carries it about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous. Cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis, meaning that the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may take a few months to over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.

Some species are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, have survived twelve hours at in laboratory experiments. Experiments on decapitated specimens of several species of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained, including shock avoidance and escape behavior, although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation, and popular claims of the longevity of headless cockroaches do not appear to be based on published research. The severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours, or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients. It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will \\"inherit the earth\\" if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps six to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the fruit fly. The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable to the effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, although lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful. Relationship with humans Cockroaches in research: Periplaneta americana in an electrophysiology experiment =In research and education= Because of their ease of rearing and resilience, cockroaches have been used as insect models in the laboratory, particularly in the fields of neurobiology, reproductive physiology and social behavior. The cockroach is a convenient insect to study as it is large and simple to raise in a laboratory environment. This makes it suitable both for research and for school and undergraduate biology studies. It can be used in experiments on topics such as learning, sexual pheromones, spatial orientation, aggression, activity rhythms and the biological clock, and behavioral ecology. Research conducted in 2014 suggests that humans fear cockroaches the most, even more than mosquitoes, due to an evolutionary aversion. =As pests= The Blattodea include some thirty species of cockroaches associated with humans; these species are atypical of the thousands of species in the order. They feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor. They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces, particularly in environments such as hospitals. Cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans. One of the proteins that trigger allergic reactions is tropomyosin. These allergens are also linked with asthma. About 60% of asthma patients in Chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergens. Studies similar to this have been done globally and all the results are similar. Some species of cockroach can live for up to a month without food, so just because no cockroaches are visible in a home does not mean that they are not there. Approximately 20–48% of homes with no visible sign of cockroaches have detectable cockroach allergens in dust. On rare occasion cockroaches can crawl into human ears, causing pain and hearing loss. They may be removed with forceps, possibly after first drowning with olive oil. Control Many remedies have been tried in the search for control of the major pest species of cockroaches, which are resilient and fast-breeding. Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been suggested, without evidence for their effectiveness. Garden herbs including bay, catnip, mint, cucumber, and garlic have been proposed as repellents. Poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder is effective on adults. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective. In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.Li J. and Ho S.H. Pandan leaves (Pandanus amaryllifolius Roxb.) As A Natural Cockroach Repellent. Proceedings of the 9th National Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (13 September 2003). Some parasites and predators are effective for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, causing temporary paralysis and allowing the wasp to deliver an incapacitating sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg (rarely two) is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach. Another wasp considered to be a promising candidate for biological control is the ensign wasp Evania appendigaster, which attacks cockroach oothecae to lay a single egg inside. Ongoing research is still developing technologies allowing for mass-rearing these wasps for application releases. Widow spiders commonly prey on cockroacheshttps://www.orkin.com/other/spiders/black-widows/eatBlack widow spider though their venomous bite introduces its own problems for humans and pets. Cockroaches can be trapped in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that cockroaches can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar can be used to drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach. A study conducted by scientists at Purdue University concluded that the most common cockroaches in the US, Australia and Europe were able to develop a “cross resistance” to multiple types of pesticide. This contradicted previous understanding that the animals can develop resistance against one pesticide at a time. The scientists suggested that cockroaches will no longer be easily controlled using a diverse spectrum of chemical pesticides and that a mix of other means, such as traps and better sanitation, will need to be employed. = As food = Although considered disgusting in Western culture, cockroaches are eaten in many places around the world.Marion Copeland [2004]. Cockroach (Pages 86 to 88). Published by Reaktion BooksRonald L. Taylor, Barbara J. Carter [1976]. Entertaining with Insects: Or, The Original Guide to Insect Cookery. Published by Woodbridge Press Publishing Company. Whereas household pest cockroaches may carry bacteria and viruses, cockroaches bred under laboratory conditions can be used to prepare nutritious food.David George Gordon [1998]. The Eat-a-bug Cookbook (Page 78). Published by Ten Speed Press. In Mexico and Thailand, the heads and legs are removed, and the remainder may be boiled, sautéed, grilled, dried or diced. In China, cockroaches have become popular as medicine and cockroach farming is rising with over 100 farms. The cockroaches are fried twice in a wok of hot oil, which makes them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese.Malcolm Moore [2013]. How to eat a cockroach: a Telegraph guide. Published by Washington Post.[2015]. How cockroaches could save lives. Published by BBC News. Fried cockroaches are ground and sold as pills for stomach, heart and liver diseases.David McKenzie [2014]. Eating cockroaches in China: Healing and delicious?. Published by CNN. A cockroach recipe from Formosa (Taiwan) specifies salting and frying cockroaches after removing the head and entrails.Richard Schweid [2015]. The Cockroach Papers: A Compendium of History and Lore (Page 69). Published by University of Chicago Press. =In traditional and homeopathic medicine= In China, cockroaches are raised in large quantities for medicinal purposes. Two species of cockroach were used in homeopathic medicine in the 19th century. =Conservation= While a small minority of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam, is considered extinct in the wild. Cultural depictions Madagascar hissing cockroaches kept as pets Cockroaches were known and considered repellent but medicinally useful in Classical times. An insect named in Greek \\"σίλφη\\" (silphe) has been identified with the cockroach, though the scientific name Silpha refers to a genus of carrion beetles. It is mentioned by Aristotle, saying that it sheds its skin; it is described as foul-smelling in Aristophanes' play Peace; Euenus called it a pest of book collections, being \\"page-eating, destructive, black-bodied\\" in his Analect. Virgil named the cockroach \\"Lucifuga\\" (\\"one that avoids light\\"). Pliny the Elder recorded the use of \\"Blatta\\" in various medicines; he describes the insect as disgusting, and as seeking out dark corners to avoid the light. Dioscorides recorded the use of the \\"Silphe\\", ground up with oil, as a remedy for earache. Lafcadio Hearn (1850–1904) asserted that \\"For tetanus cockroach tea is given. I do not know how many cockroaches go to make up the cup; but I find that faith in this remedy is strong among many of the American population of New Orleans. A poultice of boiled cockroaches is placed over the wound.\\" He adds that cockroaches are eaten, fried with garlic, for indigestion. Several cockroach species, such as Blaptica dubia, are raised as food for insectivorous pets. A few cockroach species are raised as pets, most commonly the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa. Whilst the hissing cockroaches may be the most commonly kept species, there are many species that are kept by cockroach enthusiasts; there is even a specialist society: the Blattodea Culture Group (BCG), which was a thriving organisation for about 15 years although now appears to be dormant. The BCG provided a source of literature for people interested in rearing cockroaches which was otherwise limited to either scientific papers, or general insect books, or books covering a variety of exotic pets; in the absence of an inclusive book one member published Introduction to Rearing Cockroaches which still appears to be the only book dedicated to rearing cockroaches.Bragg, P.E. (1997) An Introduction to Rearing Cockroaches. P.E. Bragg, Ilkeston. Cockroaches have been used for space tests. A cockroach given the name Nadezhda was sent into space by Russian scientists as part of a Foton-M mission, during which she mated, and later became the first terrestrial animal to produce offspring that had been conceived in space. Because of their long association with humans, cockroaches are frequently referred to in popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and found their way to the bakeries, after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks. Donald Harington's satirical novel The Cockroaches of Stay More (Harcourt, 1989) imagines a community of \\"roosterroaches\\" in a mythical Ozark town where the insects are named after their human counterparts. Madonna has famously quoted, \\"I am a survivor. I am like a cockroach, you just can't get rid of me.\\" An urban legend maintains that cockroaches are immortal.

Until 2006, Alcohol Justice focused strictly on alcohol harms and environmental prevention strategies. These strategies included reducing the hours during which time alcohol can be sold, increasing the size of warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers, requiring warnings on all alcohol advertisements, restricting the content and placement of alcohol ads, and prohibiting alcohol sponsorship of athletic events. History Alcohol Justice was established in 1987 as one of three major projects funded by the Leonard and Beryl H. Buck Trust at the same time the Marin Community Foundation was formed. The Marin Institute reported in 2006 that \\"countering the alcohol industry has always been a high priority for the Marin Institute, but we now want to make it the central focus of our efforts. That means we'll put 100% of our energy into stopping the alcohol industry from harming public health.\\" In July 2011, the Marin Institute changed its name to Alcohol Justice to better align the organization's name with the national reach of its network.J. Bernstein-Wax \\"San Rafael's Alcohol Justice, formerly the Marin Institute, still fighting after 24 years \\" Marin Independent Journal, August 21st, 2011 Campaigns and programs Alcohol Justice, although based in San Rafael, California, plays a research and advocacy role in other cities and counties of California, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, and has led numerous campaigns for legislation and regulatory reform in Sacramento, California. Nonetheless, it is a national organization that has conducted national and international research projects, conducted hundreds of trainings of youth, community leaders and public health advocates throughout the United States, and participated in international activities as well in Canada, Europe, Africa and Thailand. =Alcohol taxes and fees: Charge for Harm= The Marin Institute participated in a flurry of alcohol tax increase campaigns in the early 1990s, which resulted in small increases in beer excise taxes in California at the U.S. federal level in 1991 and 1992. From December 2006 to November 2010, The Marin Institute convened and organized a California coalition to promote proposals for nickel or dime a drink excise taxes or mitigation fees, including AB 1019 (Assm. Jim Beall, Dem-Santa Clara) supported in a testimonial video by John O. Whitaker, Jr.\\"Charge for harm testimonial,\\" by John O. Whitaker, Jr., October 2009 The Charge for Harm campaign supported various bills in Sacramento and the San Francisco \\"Alcohol Cost Recovery Fee\\" ultimately vetoed by PlumpJack wine- distributorship owning Mayor Gavin Newsom in September 2010.\\"Advocates Rally in San Francisco to Support a Charge for Harm Alcohol Mitigation Fee,\\" PRNewswire/Sys-Con Media, August 2, 2010, http://www.sys- con.com/node/1484758\\"City Hall clash brews over booze fee,\\" Wall Street Journal,Cari Tuna, August 12, 2010 (More info at San Francisco Alcohol Cost Recovery database.) Ultimately the California campaign ground to a halt in November 2010 with the passage of Proposition 26 with 51.4% of the vote, supported by the Wine Institute, the California Chamber of Commerce, Chevron, and collectively oil, tobacco, and alcohol corporations. Proposition 26 now requires in California a 2/3 vote of both legislative houses to pass impact or mitigation fees to charge industries for the harm caused by production or consumption, and requires a 2/3 vote of the electorate to pass such fees at the municipal or county level. =Stop Alcopops= Alcohol Justice argues that alcopops should be regulated because they appeal to youth, who might not like other alcoholic beverages. When caffeinated alcoholic beverages, commonly containing 12% ABV and packaged in 24-oz cans, went off the market, the manufacturers of these beverages reformulated the beverages so as to be without caffeine. Alcohol Justice especially argues against the reformulated products partly due to the fact that the alcohol content has not changed. Alcohol Justice is currently lobbying for legislation to limit the size and alcohol concentration of alcopops.

The view to the east of Carrbrook is dominated by the steep- sided Buckton Hill, on the summit of which is located Buckton Castle. Neighbouring communities include Millbrook, Heyheads and Micklehurst. Many properties in Carrbrook were threatened by a large wildfire burning on Saddleworth Moor in late June 2018. These fires lasted for weeks and the damage caused is still visible to this day. On 26 June, 50 properties in Carrbrook were evacuated as the fire advanced towards the settlement. Now Carrbrook is in a high fire risk zone. There is a village school named Buckton Vale Primary School. The current school is the 3rd building.

As his name indicates, he is a man made of moss, whose power is to camouflage into foliage and other green areas (making him a useful spy), as well as control all plant life. He lives in the Evergreen Forest in harmony among the animals and plants. Character history1980sOriginal figure= The Moss Man figure was first released in 1985, as part of the line's fourth wave of figures. The figure is a green repaint of the Beast Man action figure, covered with fuzzy \\"moss\\" flocking, with the fangs painted over, and a pine scent added to the body. He has a brown mace that is a recast of a weapon from the original Castle Grayskull playset. With his added scent, he can in some ways be considered a Heroic counterpart to the Evil Warrior Stinkor, released in the same wave, who also had an added scent. Examples of the Moss Man figure can be found both with hollow, 'squeezable' heads, as was common for earlier figures in the line, as well as more solid rubber heads, which became more common in the later days of the line. =Filmation cartoon series= Given that the accompanying cartoon series was drawing to a close at the time his toy was released, Moss Man's role in the cartoon is minimal and he appears in only two episodes: \\"Here, There, Skeletors Everywhere\\" and \\"The Ancient Mirror of Avathar\\". The former portrays him as a spy who can secretly observe danger by turning into a plant. The latter shows him using his abilities to rescue others by turning his arms into vines, as well as communicating with plants. He also has a non-speaking cameo appearance with a number of other lesser-seen characters in He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special, where he appears in the background at Prince Adam and Princess Adora's birthday party. =2002 series= Moss Man features in the 2002 relaunch of Masters of the Universe as part of the cartoon series. He was not part of the new toy line, because it was cancelled before his figure could be released, although a limited edition figure was given away as a Mattel exclusive. As with the original figure, this was a repaint of the line's Beast Man figure, this time replacing the mace with a club that came with the line's Mekaneck figure. The cartoon series depicts him as one of the most powerful beings on Eternia, possibly even more powerful than He-Man himself. He is introduced in the episode \\"Orko's Garden\\", in which he is an urban legend; an Eternian equivalent of the Green Man. He seems to be a kind of spirit who farmed and looked after the Eternian forestry and kept it in harmony. His rival in this episode is Evilseed, an evil counterpart who wants the plant world to overcome the human world. Moss Man's incredible powers help He-Man save the day, his power over all forms of vegetation able to overcome just about any obstacle. In a subsequent episode, \\"The Last Stand\\", he uses his abilities to save all the Masters from Skeletor's strongest trap yet. Given that he is so powerful, his appearances are sparse; only coming to the Masters' aid in times of desperation. =Masters of the Universe Classics= Moss Man was released on March 15 as the March 2010 Figure of the Month for the Masters of the Universe Classics line of action figures. The figure includes two distinct head sculpts, one looking more like his 200x counterpart and the other like his 1980's Beast Man head (painted green & flocked). Originally, Mattel had reported that they had problems with the flocking – with the line's increased articulation, the flocking had caused some of the joins to cease. However, the final production figure was released with most of the body covered in \\"moss\\" flocking. A variant of the figure with flocked ears was also released in small, limited quantities. Reception Comic Book Resources listed the character as part of He-Man: 15 Most Powerful Masters of the Universe. CBR voted Moss-Man 7th worst He-Man toy. Cracked thought poorly of Moss man.

Family and childhood Before going to Lebanon, her family was originally from Acre, Palestine. She also had a Syrian and Turkish ancestry. Her father, Nabil Salameh was an activist with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Initially he was associated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, and later he co-founded the more extreme Black September organization. During the 1982 Israeli intervention in Lebanon he went missing, with the presumption by family and friends he was captured by Israel. He has remained missing since this event, which occurred when Nadine was three years old. The Lebanese Civil War caused her to go to Syria, with her mother and two sisters. In Damascus, she studied in the Department of Acting of the Higher Academy of Theatrical Arts. She also studied Law at the Damascus University and had a master's degree in Political Sciences. She was mentored by some of Syria’s best known actors, including Naila Al Atrash, and Jihad Sa’d. Acting career While a freshman in college, Nadine made her first TV series with the famous Syrian director Najdat Ismail Anzour called al-Kawasir. It was a 29-episode fantasy epic set in medieval Arabia about chivalry, war, love, and tribalism. In it, Nadine played the role of Zumuruda, a horse-riding, sword-flashing barbaric heroin. She has since made one play, two TV movies, one film for the cinema, and over ten television TV series. Her most notable works are the movie Ru’aa Halima (Vision of a Dreamer) and the TV series al-Taghriba al-Filastiniyya (The Palestinian Exile). In Ru’aa Halima, she plays Jamila, a shy but revolutionary young girl in conservative Damascus during the 1970s who wants to explore the world, but is prohibited from doing so due to her restrictive father and the old-fashioned society she lives in. Her feminine awakening coincides with her national consciousness, and in despair from her surrounding, she escapes to Lebanon to join the PLO forces after the Israeli invasion of Beirut in 1982, seeing death, or \\"resistance\\", as the only solution to her suffering. Al-Taghriba al-Filistiniyya (The Palestinian Exile), directed by Hatem Ali, is her other significant work, where Nadine stars with Syrian actor Jamal Suliman. The series, about twentieth century Palestinian history, recounts the Palestinian uprising of 1936 against the British Mandate and the Zionist immigrants coming from Europe (actual Zionist immigration came from around the world including North Africa and the Southwest Asia). The movie is set in Haifa, Israel; and uses the Palestinian dialect of the Arabic language. Her other natable works include Faris Bani Marwan, Khalf al-Qudban (Men Behind Bars), Ashwak Na'ima (Soft Thorns), and Ahl al-Gharam (The People of Passion). Personal life She married a Lebanese businessman in 2011, with whom she had two daughters.

Importance The enactment and adoption of the Indian Evidence Act was a path-breaking judicial measure introduced in India, which changed the entire system of concepts pertaining to admissibility of evidences in the Indian courts of law. Until then, the rules of evidences were based on the traditional legal systems of different social groups and communities of India and were different for different people depending on caste, community, faith and social position. The Indian Evidence Act introduced a standard set of law applicable to all Indians. The law is mainly based upon the firm work by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, who could be called the founding father of this comprehensive piece of legislation. The Act The Indian Evidence Act, identified as Act no. 1 of 1872,Kerala Medico-Legal Society Indian Evidence Act. The Amendment by Act 10 of 2009 is also included and called the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has eleven chapters and 167 sections, and came into force 1 September 1872. At that time, India was a part of the British Empire. Over a period of more than 125 years since its enactment, the Indian Evidence Act has basically retained its original form except certain amendments from time to time. Amendments: The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2005 Applicability When India gained independence on 15 August 1947, the Act continued to be in force throughout the Republic of India and Pakistan, except the state of Jammu and Kashmir.https://sites.google.com/site/keralamedicolegalsociety/home-1/important- laws-and-rules/short-title-extent-and-commencement Then, the Act continues in force in India, but it was repealed in Pakistan in 1984 by the Evidence Order 1984 (also known as the \\"Qanun-e-Shahadat\\"). It also applies to all judicial proceedings in the court, including the court martial. However, it does not apply on affidavits and arbitration. Contents This Act is divided into three parts and there are 11 chapters in total under this Act. ;Part 1 Part 1 deals with relevancy of the facts. There are two chapters under this part: the first chapter is a preliminary chapter which introduces to the Evidence Act and the second chapter specifically deals with the relevancy of the facts. ;Part 2 Part 2 consists of chapters from 3 to 6. Chapter 3 deals with facts which need not be proved, chapter 4 deals with oral evidence, chapter 5 deals with documentary evidence and chapter 6 deals with circumstances when documentary evidence has been given preference over the oral evidence. ;Part 3 The last part, that is part 3, consists of chapter 7 to chapter 11. Chapter 7 talks about the burden of proof. Chapter 8 talks about estoppel, chapter 9 talks about witnesses, chapter 10 talks about examination of witnesses, and last chapter which is chapter 11 talks about improper admission and rejection of evidence. Indian Evidence Act Classic Classification In the Evidence Act All the Provisions can be divided into two Categories (1) Taking the Evidence (By Court) (2) Evaluation In Taking the Evidence Court take the Evidence for the Facts (Either \\"Issue of Facts\\" or \\"Relevant Facts\\"); The Facts means the things which is said before the court in connection with the matter, The main thing, which is Crime in Criminal and Right etc. in Civil matters are main Issues, So main Issues are known as \\"Issue of Facts\\", and the other facts which are Relevant to it are \\"Relevant Facts\\". For those Facts Evidence is Given to the Court by two ways, One is Orally and Second is Documentary (includes Electronic Documents), Oral Evidence mostly suggest the Verbal deposition before the Court (and not other wise), and Which includes oral statement regarding materials too, Documentary Evidence suggest the Documents. So The Evidence Regarding Matter which have number of Facts, for which Evidence by way of oral or Documentary produced before the court for its Evaluation for either one fact or facts. Court by going through those Documentary Evidence and Oral Evidence decide that particular fact and all facts are proved or not, or whether the fact or facts can be presumed to be proved? In Evaluation as above said by looking into the Oral and Documentary Evidence Court decide whether particular fact is proved or not, or facts are proved or not, In Evaluation there are two concepts to prove facts; One is Prove (Prove, Disprove or Not prove) and Other is Presumption (that fact is proved) (may Presume, Shall presume and Conclusive proof) After going to Oral and Documentary Evidence Court see that whether any fact or facts are proved by looking to such evidence or not? If at all no evidence is given or enough evidence is given for the fact its said fact is 'Not proved'; The second Concept for evaluation is \\"Presumption\\" In Evidence many Section suggest these presumptions, Where there is said Facts 'may presume', Court is extremely free to believe it or not and may ask to prove the fact, In 'shall presume' there is more weight given to believe facts but in that too court may ask to give more evidence to prove the facts, Where in any provision it is said that particular fact, or particular fact in particular circumstances must be concluded as \\"conclusive proof' Court has no liberty then to believe it to be proved.  Classification of Evidence Act in Four Questions Evidence Act may be divided in four questions. Question 1 What is the Evidence given of? Answer 1 of Facts (\\"Issue of Facts\\" or \\"Relevant Facts\\") Question 2 How the Evidence of such Facts are Given Answer 2 The Evidence of Such Facts is Given Either by way of \\"Oral Evidence\\" or \\"Documentary Evidence' Question 3 On whom does the Burden of proof lie? Answer 3 \\"Burden of Proof\\"(of particular fact) or \\"Onus of proof\\" (to prove whole case) lies on the Prosecution incharge Question 4 What are the Evaluation of the Facts. Answer 4 The Evaluation is \\"Prove\\" or \\"Presumption\\"(of prove); The fact is either 'proved','disproved', or 'Not proved'; or there may be presumption that proof of facts \\"may presume', 'shall presume', or 'conclusive proof'.

His first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU, a forerunner league to today's Canadian Football League) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders. He then played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League (AFL) with the Houston Oilers. Commonly referred to as simply John Henry, an allusion to the folk hero of the same name, Johnson was a tough and tenacious player who performed at a high level well into the tail end of his career. After playing college football for St. Mary's College of California and Arizona State, Johnson was selected in the second round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Steelers, the 18th overall pick. He instead played one season of Canadian football for the Stampeders, in which he won the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player. He then signed with the 49ers, and played left halfback in San Francisco's famed \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\". He was traded to Detroit in 1957, and became the team's leading rusher en route to that year's NFL championship, their most recent. His abilities seemingly in decline, Johnson was traded to Pittsburgh in 1960, where he had the most productive years of his career, recording two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He remains the oldest player to record a 1,000-yard rushing season as well as the oldest to rush for 200 or more yards in a game, each at age 34. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Johnson ranked third on the NFL's all- time rushing yards list when he retired, but was best remembered by his peers for the mark he left with his blocking. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987. Early years Johnson was born in northeastern Louisiana, at Waterproof in southern Tensas Parish. He played high school football in northern California at Pittsburg High School, and college football at Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga before transferring to Arizona State College in Tempe. While at Saint Mary's, sportswriters deemed Johnson \\"one of the fleetest and finest players on the Pacific Coast.\\" The school dropped its football program after the 1950 As a senior at Arizona State in 1952, he played left halfback and was recognized as one of the roughest and hardest runners in the country, and as one of the top defensive players as a safety. He also excelled as a punt returner, and had a two-game stretch in which he returned four punts for touchdowns. Johnson's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college. Professional careerCanadian football= Selected in the second round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Johnson instead played one season in Canada with the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) in 1953. Johnson reasoned that Calgary had offered more money, but Steelers owner Art Rooney speculated that Johnson thought it was too cold in Pittsburgh. \\"He must have thought he was going to some resort up there,\\" joked Rooney. He led the Stampeders in rushing that season with 107 carries for 648 yards, an average of six yards per carry with five touchdowns. In addition, Johnson caught 33 passes for 365 yards and three more touchdowns, returned 47 punts for 386 yards, and had a 104-yard kickoff return touchdown. He also starred on defense and intercepted five passes.Stamps mourn death of John Henry Johnson. Calgary Stampeders. June 4, 2011. Retrieved March 19, 2017. He was awarded the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player. Johnson was also a leading WIFU All-Star vote receiver, but because he played both offense and defense so well voters split their votes and he was left off the team's \\"roster\\". =American football=San Francisco 49ers Johnson was signed by the San Francisco 49ers in 1954 as a halfback, where he joined Hugh McElhenny, Y. A. Tittle, and Joe Perry to form the 49ers' famed \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\". That year, the 49ers shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season. Johnson finished second in the league in rushing with 681 yards, behind only Perry, who picked up the majority of his 1,049 yards behind blocking from Johnson. Johnson scored nine touchdowns, which were the most for a season in his career. He was invited to his first Pro Bowl following the season, joining Tittle and Perry. Johnson earned second-team All-Pro honors from United Press International (UPI) and the New York Daily News. For the remainder of his time in San Francisco, Johnson was unable to replicate the success of his rookie year, as his production dropped significantly in the following two seasons. He played in seven games in 1955 before suffering a shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Rams, and finished the year with only 19 carries for 69 yards and one touchdown. He was traded to the Detroit Lions following the 1956 season in exchange for fullback Bill Bowman and defensive back Bill Stits. Detroit Lions Lions head coach Buddy Parker saw Johnson's value as a blocker and moved him to fullback. In his first season with Detroit in 1957, he led the team in rushing, carrying for 621 yards and five touchdowns. In the 1957 NFL Championship Game, which was won by the Lions 59–14 over the Cleveland Browns, Johnson carried seven times for 34 yards, caught a 16-yard pass, and recovered a fumble on defense. Going into the 1958 season, the Lions looked to continue their success, and Johnson was expected to be the team's primary ball carrier. However, Johnson missed several games due to injuries, and the Lions finished with a 4–7–1 record and one of the league's worst rushing offenses. In 1959, Johnson was suspended indefinitely by the Lions after he missed the team plane back to Detroit following a November 1 blowout loss to the 49ers. To that point, the Lions had a 1–5 record, and coach George Wilson used Johnson's suspension as an opportunity to scold the whole team for its lack of \\"desire.\\" Johnson was ultimately fined $1,000. Wilson took the brunt of the blame for Detroit's struggles in 1958 and 1959, but he questioned the resolve of some of the team's higher-paid players, including Johnson. Following the season, Johnson was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for two draft picks. \\"That's all we could get for him,\\" explained Wilson. Johnson with the Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers The Steelers finally acquired Johnson in 1960, after having lost him to the CFL when they drafted him eight years prior. His career rejuvenated, he had his most productive years as a pro while in Pittsburgh. In his first season with the team, he rushed for 621 yards with a 5.3 yards-per-carry average, which included a career-high 87-yard score against the Philadelphia Eagles. He became the first Steelers player to rush for 1,000 yards in a season when he did so in 1962, and he repeated the feat in 1964. He made three straight Pro Bowl appearances, and was a second-team All-Pro selection by the AP, UPI, and Newspaper Enterprise Association in 1962. As of 2017, he remains the oldest player in NFL history to eclipse 1,000 yards rushing in a season, finishing with 1,048 in 1964, aged 35. In a game that season against the Cleveland Browns, then aged 34, Johnson carried 30 times for 200 yards and scored three touchdowns, out-dueling the great Jim Brown. It was only the ninth 200-yard rushing game in NFL history to that point, and the performance made him the oldest player to reach that mark, a record he still holds. Johnson's effort impressed Steelers president Dan Rooney, who remarked that \\"he got almost all the yardage by himself.\\" Age and injuries caught up to Johnson in 1965, as he was limited to just three carries for 11 yards. Houston Oilers and retirement After playing out his option with the Steelers, in July 1966 Johnson signed as a free agent with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League. He joined the Oilers with the hope of helping the team win an AFL championship. However, the team finished the season last in the Eastern Division with a record of 3–11. Johnson retired after the season at the age of 37. He completed his NFL career having carried 1,571 times for 6,803 yards and 48 touchdowns, and picked up 1,478 yards on 186 pass receptions for seven receiving touchdowns. Playing style Equally proficient as both a blocker and runner, Johnson was described as \\"the perfect NFL fullback\\". A talented runner, he ran with power both inside and outside the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career.Wexell, Mendelson, & Aretha 2014, p. 62. \\"Football was like a combat zone,\\" said Johnson. \\"I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent. If you wait for it, the impact will be on you.\\" Perhaps the most notable aspect of Johnson's game was his blocking abilities, for which he received heavy praise. He took pride in it, saying \\"It gave me a chance to hit all those people who hit me all the time.\\" Quarterback Bobby Layne, a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers, listed Johnson as one of the one of \\"Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men\\" in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. \\"By 'mean,' I mean vicious, unmanageable, consistently tough,\\" said Layne. \\"I don't mean dirty.\\" Layne also called Johnson his \\"bodyguard,\\" saying \\"Half the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them around long enough. But a quarterback hits the jackpot when he gets a combination runner-blocker like Johnson.\\" Honors Upon his retirement, Johnson was ranked fourth on pro football's all-time rushing yards list, behind Jim Brown, Jim Taylor, and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate Perry. As of 2016, he is fourth on the Steelers franchise all-time rushing yards list, behind Franco Harris, Jerome Bettis, and Willie Parker. In 1987, he was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and chose Steelers owner Art Rooney as his presenter. Many of his contemporaries felt his induction was belated; he had been eligible for induction for the past fifteen years.Players become eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame five years after their final pro season. The 49ers' \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\" is currently the only full-house backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Johnson is a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers Legends team, which honors the franchise's best players pre-1970. He was a charter inductee to the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Personal and later life In November 1955, while on the sick list for the 49ers due to a shoulder injury, Johnson carried two women to safety out of a blazing apartment building in Oakland, California. One of the women was his pregnant wife, Barbara Johnson. The couple divorced in 1959, and a bench warrant was issued for Johnson after he fell $2,360 behind on alimony payments, concurrent with his suspension from the Lions for missing the team plane. After retiring as a player, he worked for Columbia Gas and later for Warner Communications. He had aspirations of coaching football, but the opportunity never arose. Johnson died at age 81 in 2011 in Tracy, California. Several days later, it was announced that Johnson and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate, Joe Perry, who died six weeks earlier, would have their brains examined by researchers at Boston University, who were studying head injuries in sports. Both men were suspected of suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma. According to his daughter, Johnson could not talk or swallow in the final year of his life and also used a wheelchair. She told the San Francisco Chronicle that she hoped by donating her father's brain, it would \\"help with a cure.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * External links  Category:1929 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American football fullbacks Category:American football halfbacks Category:Canadian football running backs Category:Arizona State Sun Devils football players Category:Calgary Stampeders players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Houston Oilers players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Saint Mary's Gaels football players Category:San Francisco 49ers players Category:Eastern Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Western Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Waterproof, Louisiana Category:Players of American football from Louisiana Category:African-American players of American football Category:African-American players of Canadian football Category:American Football League players ","title":"John Henry Johnson"},{"id":"2499075","text":"The Mount Hood Highway No. 26 (see Oregon highways and routes) is the Oregon Department of Transportation's designation for a highway from Portland east around the south side of Mount Hood and north via Bennett Pass to Hood River. It is marked as U.S. Route 26 from Portland to near Mount Hood and Oregon Route 35 the rest of the way to Hood River. Much of the highway is part of the Mount Hood Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway which connects Troutdale with Hood River via the southern flank of Mount Hood. The Byway's route includes parts of present-day U.S. Route 26 and Oregon Route 35 and the historic Barlow Road through the Mount Hood Corridor. It also forms a loop with the Historic Columbia River Highway, an All-American Road. The portion from Sandy to Barlow Pass on the south flank of Mount Hood is aligned to the land portion of the historic Oregon Trail. It was developed in the 1840s as the Barlow Road. Mount Hood as seen from the Mount Hood Highway (OR 35)  Route description  The highway begins in Portland at the west end of the Ross Island Bridge, with access to the Oswego Highway (Oregon Route 43), Pacific Highway (Interstate 5) and Pacific Highway West (Oregon Route 10). US 26 itself heads west on Arthur Street, which is not a state-maintained Highway, to reach the Stadium Freeway (Interstate 405). After crossing the Willamette River on the Ross Island Bridge, the Highway is locally known as Powell Boulevard through Portland and Gresham. State maintenance ends at the Portland/Gresham border, beginning again where the Highway turns southeast at Burnside Street east of downtown Gresham. Soon after that turn, Highway 26 uses the completed part of the Mount Hood Freeway (built only to surface expressway standards) to Sandy, where it runs through downtown on a one-way couplet. The section of Powell Boulevard from Interstate 205 east into downtown Gresham carries only two lanes. When I-205 was built, the ramps at Powell Boulevard were configured to only allow traffic towards the west, with US 26 east pointed along the four-lane Division Street, about 1/2 mile (1 km) to the north. (Right turns were even banned to and from the I-205 north ramps at first.) Division Street runs east into Gresham, where it meets Burnside Road, at which a right turn to the southeast leads into the Mount Hood Highway and US 26. Despite this signage pointing US 26 east on Division Street, traffic already on US 26 is pointed straight along Powell Boulevard (the Mount Hood Highway), in agreement with ODOT's route description.Oregon Department of Transportation, Digital Video Log Oregon Department of Transportation, Descriptions of US and OR Routes (PDF) East of Sandy, the highway is a (mostly) four-lane undivided highway approaching the slopes of Mount Hood; as the highway climbs up towards Government Camp it reduces to two and three lanes. It is four lanes again through Government Camp. East of Government Camp is an interchange with Oregon Route 35, where US 26 heads southeast on the Warm Springs Highway towards Madras and the Mount Hood Highway heads north with Route 35. Route 35 winds over Bennett Pass and around the eastern side of Mount Hood, and descends into the Hood River Valley. The Mount Hood Highway designation ends at the intersection with the Historic Columbia River Highway, which carries U.S. Route 30 to the west. To the north, the road continues as a spur of the Columbia River Highway No. 2 (Interstate 84), bringing US 30 back onto that freeway. Officially Route 35 heads west from there on US 30 through Hood River to end at I-84 west of that town, but all signage ends at the end of the Mount Hood Highway. The general public uses the name Mount Hood Highway to refer to much the same route, excluding the portions inside Portland and western Gresham (which are referred to by the street name of Powell Boulevard). Between 1955 and 1978, the 15-mile (25 km) segment of the route through southeast Portland was proposed to be moved from Powell Boulevard to a new similar alignment known as the Mount Hood Freeway. Due to intense local opposition, this proposed freeway was cancelled.  Scenic Byway  From Troutdale, the Mount Hood Scenic Byway starts at the end of the Historic Columbia River Highway where the Troutdale Bridge crosses the Sandy River. For the first twenty miles (32 km) of the route, it follows a southwestern path along city streets: west on Glenn Otto Park Road into downtown Troutdale, connecting with Halsey Street, south along 238th Street (which veers to become 242nd Street), Burnside Street, Orient Drive, Dodge Park Boulevard, Lusted Road, and Ten Eyck Road. Mount Hood and the Sandy River as seen from the Jonsrud Viewpoint along the byway. The Byway continues into Sandy on US 26, heads west briefly on a spur to Jonsrud Viewpoint on Bluff Road, then backtracks to US 26. It continues along U.S. Route 26 for about thirty miles, then leaves the highway proper in favor of the business loop through Government Camp. The Byway follows a spur just east of Government Camp to Timberline Lodge. After returning to US 26, it continues to the junction with Oregon Route 35 where it exits US 26 and goes north on OR 35 for about . At the eastern outskirts of Hood River, OR 35 intersects with U.S. Route 30 and the Historic Columbia River Highway. =Points of interest= From west to east: * Sandy River: the mouth close to Troutdale is where William Robert Broughton spotted and named Mount Hood * Portland Women's Forum State Scenic Viewpoint, also known as Chanticleer Point: views of the Columbia Gorge, Historic Columbia River Highway, Crown Point and Rooster Rock State Park * Jonsrud Viewpoint: view of Sandy River basin and Devil's Backbone, route of the Oregon Trail and Barlow Road * Wildwood Recreation Site - Cascade Streamwatch, Oregon: underwater stream and fish habitat viewing, five miles (8 km) of interpretive trails along the Salmon River, access to the Salmon- Huckleberry Wilderness via the Salmon River National Recreation TrailWilderness.net- Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness * Lost Creek Campground: Nature Trail & Old Maid Flats * Philip Foster Farm National Historic Site * West Barlow Tollgate: operated from 1874 to 1919http://www.byways.org/browse/byways/61400/places/61454/ disagrees with 1915 end date in Barlow Road * Laurel Hill Chute: This effectively made the Barlow Road one way by its 60% grade, easily the most harrowing portion of the Oregon Trail. * Mount Hood Cultural Center and Museum: historic photos by Ray Atkeson in downtown Government Camp, Oregon * Timberline Lodge and Ski Area * Trillium Lake/Summit Meadow: a Barlow Road tollgate from 1866 through 1870 * White River Canyon: views of lahar and mud flows and evidence of frequent floods * Barlow Pass/Pioneer Woman's Grave Barlow Pass/Pioneer Woman's Grave * Sahalie Falls: a horsetail waterfall high and wide, fed by Newton Clark Glacier and a tributary of Hood River * Tamanawas Falls: a gentle two mile (3 km) trail along Cold Springs Creek to high falls * Toll Bridge County Park * Panorama Point County Park and Viewpoint * Jesse and Winifred Hutson Museum: a National Historic Site in Parkdale, Oregon * Mount Hood Railroad * Historic Downtown Hood River Major intersectionsReferencesExternal links *ORoads - Mount Hood Freeway *Description of Mount Hood Scenic Byway, from a Federal Highway Administration website *Description from the Hood River County Chamber Of Commerce website *Mount Hood Scenic Byway gets federal designation, a September 2005 article from Portland Business Journal *Oregon Transportation Commission approves Byway proposal, a March 2005 press release from the official Oregon website *Mount Hood Scenic Byway (with map), from the Oregon Tourism Commission website Category:Named state highways in Oregon Category:Transportation in Portland, Oregon Category:Mount Hood Category:U.S. Route 26 ","title":"Mount Hood Highway"},{"id":"2499082","text":"Beaching a casualty while providing artificial respiration Diver rescue, following an accident, is the process of avoiding or limiting further exposure to diving hazards and bringing a diver to a place of safety. A safe place is often a place where the diver cannot drown, such as a boat or dry land, where first aid can be administered and from which professional medical treatment can be sought. In the context of surface supplied diving, the place of safety for a diver with a decompression obligation is often the diving bell. Rescue may be needed for various reasons where the diver becomes unable to manage an emergency, and there are several stages to a rescue, starting with recognising that a rescue is needed. In some cases the dive buddy identifies the need by personal observation, but in the more general case identification of the need is followed by locating the casualty. The most common and urgent diving emergencies involve loss of breathing gas, and the provision of emergency gas is the usual response. On other occasions the diver may be trapped and must be released by the rescuer. These first responses are usually followed by recovery of the distressed diver, who may be unconscious, to a place of safety with a secure supply of breathing gas, and following rescue, it may be necessary to evacuate the casualty to a place where further treatment is possible. In all rescue operations, the rescuer must take care of their own safety and avoid becoming another casualty. In professional diving the supervisor is responsible for initiating rescue procedures, and for ensuring the safety of the dive team. The rescue is generally carried out by the stand- by diver, and for this reason the stand-by diver must be willing and competent to perform any reasonably foreseeable rescue that may be required for a planned diving operation.  Reasons for needing rescue  There are many reasons why a diver may need rescue. These generally imply that the diver is no longer capable of managing the situation. Scenarios requiring rescue include: * running out of breathing gas * inability to access the breathing gas due to an equipment failure * unconsciousness * inability to see the depth gauge or diving computer to make a safe ascent, generally because the diving mask is lost, keeps flooding or is damaged * panic * incapacitated due to trauma, diving disorder, or other medical condition * becoming lost or trapped underwater * inability to control buoyancy and/or inability to apply thrust sufficiently to ascend (in Scuba diving without a lifeline) * inability to return to the shore or a boat after a dive * hypothermia * narcosis * exhaustion The diver may get into a situation requiring rescue through incompetence, unfitness or bad luck. Rescue activities The effort and difficulty of a rescue varies widely and depends on many factors such as the nature of the problem, the underwater conditions and the type and depth of the dive site. A simple rescue could be to tow to safety a diver on the surface who is exhausted or suffering from leg cramps. A complex and high-risk rescue would be to locate, free and bring to the surface a lost diver who is trapped underwater in an enclosed space such as a shipwreck or cave with limited breathing gas supplies. The sequence of potential activities needed in a generic rescue are: * Recognising or identifying the need for a rescue * if the casualty's position underwater is unknown, locate the casualty and, if possible, mark the position * if the casualty is low on breathing gas, provide more gas * if the casualty is trapped, free the casualty * if the casualty is submerged, bring the casualty to the surface * if the casualty has a decompression obligation, decompress if safely possible. The rescuer must also take into account his/her personal decompression requirements. * if the casualty is not buoyant at the surface, make the casualty buoyant * if help at the surface is available but not at hand, attract help * if the casualty is not breathing, carry out continuous artificial respiration on the surface * if the casualty is on the surface in the water and no help is available, tow the casualty to a boat or to land * if the casualty is beside a boat or the shore, remove the casualty from the water * if necessary, resuscitate, provide first aid and arrange transport to professional medical help =Recognition of an emergency= Before any attempt to perform a rescue can be made, a person or group of people who are in a position to initiate appropriate procedures must be aware of the need. This may seem an obvious requirement, but many diving fatalities occur without anyone knowing that there is a problem, and in many others the problem is initially the loss of information regarding the current status of the diver. This is common in scuba accidents, where separation of the diving team members is often the first indication of a potential problem, and many emergencies are first recognised when a diver fails to surface at the expected time. Scuba divers generally have no voice communication and are generally restricted to visual signalling. this is limited by line of sight and visibility, which may be poor. In some cases scuba divers may be connected by a tether, or buddy line, which allows communication by line signals, and professional scuba divers often tow a surface marker buoy, which may be used to transmit a very limited range of signals to surface personnel, mainly location of the diver, and if the diver needs help. Surface supplied divers are less likely to get lost, as they are initially connected to the surface team by at least an airline, and usually also a lifeline which may be used by the line-attendant to communicate with the diver using line signals. Most 21st century surface supplied divers also have voice communication with the surface team, and this allows constant monitoring of the diver's condition by listening to the breathing sounds. Surface supplied divers are therefore able to indicate distress and need for assistance promptly and effectively in almost all cases, and the simple failure to respond appropriately to communications from the surface is also an effective indication of a problem. =Locating the casualty underwater= It may be difficult to locate the diver underwater where dives take place in low visibility conditions, in currents or in enclosed spaces such as caves and shipwrecks or where the diver uses breathing equipment which releases few bubbles, such as a rebreather. Even when open circuit equipment is used it may be difficult to see the bubbles due to surface conditions of wind, waves and spray, fog, or darkness. Surface supplied divers are usually easy to find, as they are at the far end of the umbilical, and it is extremely rare for the umbilical to be completely severed. The standard procedure for rescue of a surface supplied diver is for the standby diver to follow the umbilical to the diver, reporting back frequently to the supervisor on progress. Divers often use guidelines, surface marker buoys, diving shots, lightsticks and strobe lights to indicate their position to their surface support team. A standard precaution when entering enclosed spaces is to use a guideline; this marks the exit route, which may be needed after the diver's fins, wash, and bubbles dislodge silt and loose overhead materials such as rust which can reduce visibility to near zero. Common search techniques such as the circular search or jackstay search, need preparation and practice if they are to be used effectively and safely. The spiral box search and compass grid search require less preparation, but probably greater skill, and may be rendered ineffective by currents. Searches of enclosed spaces expose the rescuer to danger. The rescuers may need training and experience in cave diving, ice diving or wreck diving to minimise the risks of that type of rescue. =Providing emergency gas= Providing emergency gas to a diver who has run out is the highest priority after finding the diver. Without breathing gas the diver will die in minutes. Running out of gas is a major contributor to diving accidents. Many scuba accidents start in some other way and culminate in running out of gas. The main reasons for running out of scuba gas are: * failing to monitor consumption of the gas - not watching the contents pressure gauge * underestimating the amount of gas needed for the return and ascent and decompression stops * consuming gas faster than estimated by going too deep, over-exercising or psychological stress * delayed exit or ascent due to other problems, such as getting lost or entrapped * equipment failure, such as a regulator freeze or blown o-ring, in the main breathing set leading to escape of gas. Even when the prime cause of an underwater emergency is not running out of gas, lack of gas can easily become another problem for the rescuers to overcome because more gas is consumed during the accident and its aftermath. This could be due to the diver remaining at depth for longer than planned or due to increases in the diver's breathing rate, due to exertion, stress or panic. Common configurations of diving cylinders and diving regulators used as a backup or reserve for emergencies include: * An independent set carried by the diver; **a complete, backup scuba set such as a \\"pony\\" (or bailout cylinder), or **the cylinder not currently in use of an independent twin set, or **a cylinder not currently in use of a group of side-mounted cylinders, or **a separate rescue set brought down by the rescuer, or **a \\"spare air\\" - a small independent set with integrated regulator and mouthpiece * A potentially independent pair of twins connected by an isolation manifold and carried by the diver. If the diver can isolate them in time, the remaining gas in the uncompromised side is available. * Sharing gas with another diver via an \\"octopus regulator\\" - a second, backup regulator or second stage on a scuba set that is in use by the buddy or rescue diver There are two main ways of delivering breathing gas to the out-of-air scuba diver; *provide the casualty with a separate demand valve, preferably on a long hose or , so that rescuer and casualty can breathe simultaneously, and concentrate their efforts on getting to a safer place, or *share a single demand valve with the casualty by \\"buddy breathing\\", which is a more risky procedure, and requires constant attention to breathing and management of the demand valve by both divers. The additional task loading of buddy breathing may reduce the capacity of the divers for other activities required for safe resolution of the emergency. The gas capacity of the cylinder is important. Divers breathing at depth consume more gas because the gas must be delivered to them at ambient pressure, and volumetric breathing gas consumption is driven by partial pressure of CO2. At the end of a deep dive they will need more gas to breathe during the longer ascent to the surface and during any decompression stops. The mixture of the breathing gas is important. Hyperoxic gases cannot be breathed safely below their maximum operating depth because of the risk of oxygen toxicity and hypoxic gas cannot be breathed safely in shallow water because the partial pressure of oxygen falls below that needed to sustain consciousness. A surface supplied diver can provide breathing gas from their pneumofathometer hose, which can be inserted under the neck seal of the helmet and turned on at the gas panel to provide an adequate but noisy free-flow supply. This is normally sufficient to ventilate the casualty for the return to the surface or bell. In some cases it may be necessary to disconnect the casualty from their umbilical, if it is irretrievably trapped. This requires a few minutes work with spanners, and will lose any voice communications that may have remained. It is possible to connect a replacement umbilical if one is available. This is not usually the case from a bell, as the umbilicals occupy too much space to carry a spare. =Freeing the trapped casualty= Divers may become trapped in fishing nets; monofilament is almost invisible underwater. Loose ropes and lines are also an entanglement hazard; normal diving equipment has many inaccessible snag points that can trap the diver, particularly when components are left to dangle, and when clips are used which can hook onto line without active intervention by the diver (known to technical divers as suicide clips). Another entrapment risk occurs when divers try to squeeze through small gaps where they or their equipment can become wedged or caught. Old ferrous shipwrecks can be structurally unstable; they may retain their shape but have lost their strength through corrosion and therefore have components or cargos that have high potential energy due to gravity, and may collapse without warning. Divers routinely carry a knife, line cutter, scissors or shears to free themselves from ropes, lines and nets. Lifting bags can be used to help move heavy objects underwater, but are not carried as standard equipment by most divers. =Taking the casualty to a place of safety= The safest place may be the surface, where the supply of breathing gas is unlimited, or if the diver was diving from a bell, the diving bell. where the gas supply is relatively secure, and some first aid is possible. The procedure for retrieving the casualty to the bell is relatively straightforward. The casualty is simply carried there by the rescuer. A rescue tether may be used to aid this process as it allows the rescuer the use of both hands. Once at the bell the casualty will generally be suspended by the harness using a lifting tackle provided tor this purpose. =Bringing the casualty to the surface= If a diver is out of gas and is breathing gas supplied by the rescuer, the rescuer and casualty must remain close to one another and ascend together. Starting the ascent may be complicated by the casualty's lack of gas to inflate the buoyancy compensator to become buoyant at the start of the ascent and later, at the surface. At the start of the ascent the casualty may need to fin upwards and keep pace with the rescuer until, with the drop in ambient pressure, the gas already inside buoyancy devices such as the buoyancy compensator or diving suit, expands and provides sufficient buoyancy. If the casualty is not capable of making an ascent, due to injury or unconsciousness, or the casualty cannot make a safe and controlled ascent, perhaps due to the loss or damage of the diving mask, the rescuer must control the casualty's ascent. This may be done by using the Controlled buoyant lift. As the casualty is totally dependent on the rescuer, it is important if the two were to separate underwater the casualty should continue to ascend to the surface in a failsafe way. The options, in order of desirability, for making the casualty buoyant include: * inflate the casualty's buoyancy compensator to lift off the seabed, then vent it to make a controlled ascent. * inflate the casualty's drysuit, if one is worn, to lift off the seabed, then vent it to make a controlled ascent. A drysuit is a less secure buoyancy device than a buoyancy compensator, and more difficult to inflate if the connected hose has no pressure on it. * drop the weights from the casualty's diving weighting system. This may result in a dangerous and rapid ascent. * lift, by finning, the casualty into shallower water where gas in the casualty's buoyancy devices will expand, then vent it to make a controlled ascent. * It is possible to use the rescuer's buoyancy compensator to lift both divers. A technique for this is taught by some agencies, in which the rescuer holds the casualty with his/her legs wrapped round the torso, freeing the hands for buoyancy control. This technique does not allow the rescuer to provide upward thrust by finning, and all lift must be from buoyancy. A further problem is that if the divers are separated, the rescuer will be considerably positively buoyant, and the victim may well be negative, and sink away before the situation can be corrected. If there is a surface marker buoy available with sufficient buoyancy, the rescuer can clip the casualty to the reel and use the reel to hoist the casualty to the surface.in this case the casualty will not sink back down if released for any reason. Not all diving reels are suitable for this application. The reel needs a ratchet and a winding knob with a good grip. Some reels seize up when wound in under too much tension. If the casualty is not breathing, an urgent ascent directly to the surface is needed so that resuscitation can take place there. In this situation and if the rescuer needs to do decompression stops, the rescuer has a dilemma; take the casualty to the surface and increase the risk or severity of decompression sickness, including irreversible injuries or death, or do the stops and risk leaving the casualty to die by asphyxiation or drowning. In these circumstances the value of a surface backup team becomes obvious, as a message or pre-arranged signal to the surface can bring a standby diver down to take over the recovery of the casualty while the initial rescuer attends to his own safety, or the rescuer can send the casualty to the surface by buoyancy, while remaining at the required depth for decompression. If the rescuer chooses to stop for required decompression, the non-breathing casualty may be made positively buoyant and allowed to surface, where there is at least a possibility of assistance from bystanders or surface team members. This strategy has been successfully used in at least one incident. Active management of the casualty's airway during the ascent is necessary only as far as avoiding or correcting any position that tends to close the airway, such as extreme flexion of the neck. Expanding gases will generally pass passively out of the airway during rescue from depth, and pulmonary barotrauma is rare. A gradual and natural outflow of expanding air during the ascent may help prevent aspiration of water into the lungs. There is no evidence that compressing the chest to promote exhalation is more effective than simply maintaining an open airway. Managing a convulsing casualty Convulsions due to acute oxygen toxicity may render a diver unconscious. A common symptom is convulsions similar in appearance to epileptic seizure.OXTOX: If You Dive Nitrox You Should Know About OXTOX. DAN Diving Medicine Articles The US Navy Diving Manual Revision 6 Volume 4 section 17.11.1.4 recommends the following procedure for managing a convulsing casualty at depth. This differs significantly in some details from the procedure recommended by Dr E.D. Thalmann on the DAN website. *Assume a position behind the convulsing diver. *Only release the casualty's weights if progress to the surface is significantly impeded. (Thalmann recommends releasing the weights unless the diver is wearing a dry suit, as the dry suit without weights may cause the surfaced diver to take a face down position on the surface.) *Do not ascend in the water until the convulsion subsides (Thalmann makes no recommendation to delay the ascent.) *Open the victim's airway and leave the mouthpiece in his mouth. If it is not in his mouth, do not attempt to replace it. However ensure that it is switched to \\"Surface\\" position in the case of a rebreather, so that the loop does not flood. (Thalman makes no mention of opening the airway, possibly on the assumption that air will escape without this manoeuvre.) *Grasp the victim round the chest above the UBA or between the UBA and his body. If this is difficult, use the best method possible to obtain control. *Ventilate the UBA with diluent to lower ppO2 and maintain depth until the convulsion subsides. (This step is significantly omitted by Thalmann.) *Make a controlled ascent to the first decompression stop, maintaining a slight pressure on the diver's chest to assist exhalation. **If the diver regains control, continue with appropriate decompression. (omitted by Thalmann) **If the diver remains incapacitated, surface at a moderate rate, establish an airway and treat for symptomatic decompression. (omitted by Thalmann) *If additional buoyancy is required, activate the victim's life jacket (inflate BC). The rescuer should not release his own weight belt or inflate his life jacket. *On reaching the surface, inflate the victim's life jacket if not already done. *Remove the victim's mouthpiece and (in the case of a rebreather) close the switch the valve to \\"surface\\" to prevent the rig from flooding and weighing down the victim. *Signal for emergency pickup. (Recreational divers may not have this option.) *Ensure the victim is breathing. Initiate rescue ventilation if necessary. *If an upward excursion occurred during the actual convulsion, transport to the nearest chamber and have the victim evaluated by an individual trained to recognize and treat diving-related illness. Thalmann further comments that the decision whether to ascend with a diver who is convulsing is tricky, and cites the US Navy Diving Manual again, specifically: *If a diver convulses, the UBA should be vented immediately with a gas of lower oxygen content, if possible. (This is only appropriate with rebreathers, full-face masks with more than one gas supply connected, or with surface supply.) *If depth control is possible and gas supply is secure (helmet or full face mask), the diver's depth should be kept constant until the convulsion subsides. *If an ascent takes place it should be done as slowly as possible. (To some extent this is incompatible with the need to get the victim to a place where treatment is possible.) *If a diver surfaces unconscious because of an oxygen convulsion or to avoid drowning, the diver must be treated as if suffering from arterial gas embolism. Thalmann further comments that a full face mask is desirable for use with high oxygen mixes, as it allows the diver to be kept at depth until the convulsion subsides, and that a diver who loses the mouthpiece must be surfaced as he will try to take a breath when the convulsion stops, and on open circuit, that as long as the diver has the mouthpiece in place and is breathing, it should be left until you can get him out of the water, but should be removed on the surface if rescue breathing is necessary and possible. Furthermore, the main goal while the diver is in the water is to prevent drowning and secondarily ensure that the airway is open after the convulsion stops by keeping the neck extended. =Making the casualty buoyant on the surface= Once the casualty has been brought to the relative safety of the surface, it is important that the casualty does not accidentally sink again. The usual methods of making the diver positively buoyant are to: * inflate the buoyancy compensator. This is a routine surfacing drill in some training schemes. * inflate the drysuit, if one is being worn. The gas in a dry suit is not very secure; it can easily escape from seals and vents. Also, excess gas in the suit tends to make the legs buoyant causing the diver mobility problems. * drop weights. Divers who are out of air will probably not be able to inflate their buoyancy compensator or drysuit using the normal and simple technique of pressing the direct feed injection valve. If their equipment allows it, and this is almost always the case, they may be able to inflate these devices orally or use an integrated gas cylinder (if fitted). =Attracting help= At this stage in the rescue immediate help is desirable. An immediate call or signal for help may take very little time to get the attention of potential assistance. However, if this fails, the survival of the casualty should be attended to, by artificial ventilation if necessary. Very often, the only people that can provide that help are nearby boat users and people on the shore. Unless the emergency services are very close by or the rescue is beyond the capability of the local rescuers, they will not be on the scene quick enough to be able to provide help. Often with a small group of rescuers the emergency services can only be contacted after the highest priority job of getting the casualty is out of the water has taken place. Often the rescue can be quickened if a boat can come to the casualty rather than a rescuer having to tow the casualty to safety. Once at the surface, using many rescuers becomes feasible; they can communicate and co-operate to make the rescue more efficient. Methods of attracting help include shouting, waving a straight arm, flag or surface marker buoy, blowing a whistle, flashing or swinging a torch/flashlight at night, or using a strobe at night. Cylinder powered, high-pressure gas whistles may be effective even over the sound of engines. =Carrying out artificial ventilation in the water= If the casualty is not breathing, it is possible to sustain respiration or even restart it by artificial ventilation (AV) at the surface of the water. It may be difficult for the rescuer to assess breathing, but it is more likely that this would fail to indicate shallow breathing than a false positive, and as there is little risk of harm from an attempt to administer rescue breathing when it is not needed, there is no reason to not administer AV if there is any suspicion that the casualty in not breathing. Methods of in-water AV vary depending on diver training organization: The BSAC technique works like this: * the casualty and rescuer are buoyant * the rescuer is positioned at the side of the casualty's head facing the ear * the rescuer extends the casualty's neck and closes the mouth by lifting the chin with one hand * the rescuer pushes the casualty's far shoulder upwards with the other hand causing the head to twist towards the rescuer * the rescuer makes a seal over the casualty's nose using the rescuer's mouth and exhales to fill the casualty's lungs * the rescuer aims to do 10 inflations per minute if stationary, 2 inflations every 15 seconds if towing It is not possible to provide effective cardiac compression in the water, and it is also unlikely to reliably identify cardiac arrest in the water. =Towing the casualty= If the casualty is incapacitated or exhausted, help is needed to move the casualty to safety. Towing is time-consuming and will exhaust the rescuer, especially in rough water, currents, or if the rescuer is wearing high-drag equipment such as a drysuit or carrying bulky equipment. It may be possible to avoid a tow by using a boat to pick up the casualty and rescuer. Alternatively, ropes thrown to the rescuer can be used to pull the pair towards safety. =Removing the casualty from the water= Urgently lifting an injured or incapacitated casualty from the water is a significant problem especially where there are few rescuers, the sea is rough, the boat has high sides or the rescuers on the shore cannot get in or close to the water to help. Ropes and webbing can be very useful, but some precautions are need: * avoid looping the rope so that it goes round the chest, preventing breathing, or the neck, causing asphyxia. * when near boats, keep the minimum rope in the water to prevent fouling propellers * the minimum safe diameter is 12 mm, 1/2 inch. The rope should be doubled to increase the area of contact and reduce the lifting pressure on the casualty. \\"Purbuckling\\" (or parbuckling) can be used to lift a casualty from the water up a vertical surface such as a high sided boat, pontoon or a jetty. For a 1.5 metre lift, a length of rope of at least 4 metres / 13 feet is needed. The casualty is brought horizontally alongside. A rescuer in the water with the casualty takes the loop of rope under the casualty and passes it back to two rescuers at the top of the vertical face. The loop of rope is positioned so that in passes outside the arms between the shoulder and elbow and around the outside of the legs between the knee and the hip. The two rescuers on land secure the end of the loop that they control by standing heavily on it with one foot. They both pull on the central part of the loop rolling the casualty up the surface taking care to co-ordinate the tension so that the casualty remains horizontal and that the rope remains in position on the casualty's arms and thighs. A rescuer should take care that the casualty's head and neck are not injured during the lift. An alternative method of lifting the casualty using a rope is to pass the rope under an arm, around the back and under the other arm. The casualty is lifted vertically. There is a risk of spine damage by bending if the casualty is positioned with his or her back to the vertical surface and the rescuers pull the casualty's shoulders in board before lifting the lower end of the torso over top of the vertical surface. Commercial divers generally wear a safety harness with lifting points, which simplifies the attachment of equipment for lifting the casualty, and if they are using a lifeline or umbilical, it would be strong enough to lift the diver out of the water. Recreational and technical diver harnesses are generally unsuited and unsafe for lifting a casualty. A proper spine board or rescue stretcher is far more suitable, but not often available. =Providing first aid= If the casualty is not breathing artificial respiration must be provided continuously. It is more likely to succeed if it is started promptly. If the casualty is showing no signs of circulation, chest compression is needed. See main article: cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If the casualty has injuries the rescuers will need to provide first aid and prepare the casualty to be transported to professional medical help. See main article: first aid. In the developed world, transporting a diving casualty to hospital or a recompression chamber may be as simple as contacting the marine emergency services, generally by using marine VHF radio, telephone or a distress signal, and arranging a lifeboat or helicopter. If a diving injury such as decompression sickness is suspected, the success of recompression therapy as well as a decrease in the number of recompression treatments required has been shown if first aid oxygen is given within four hours after surfacing. In other parts of the world and particularly in remote locations, it may be difficult to quickly arrange reliable emergency medical transport and treatment; good insurance and self- reliance are needed. In-water recompression is a high-risk alternative that may be useful in locations where the casualty would not survive the journey to the nearest recompression chamber due to its distance. Rescue involving a decompression obligation The rescuer is primarily responsible for their own safety, and is expected to complete all personal decompression obligations. This may in some cases involve sending an unresponsive victim to the surface by making them positively buoyant while the rescuer completes their decompression. Where a decompression chamber is available on site, it may be deemed appropriate to surface the divers and recompress following surface decompression schedules, which can be extended to a treatment schedule if symptoms of decompression sickness manifest. This decision should be made by a diving medical practitioner qualified to advise on hyperbaric treatment. Sometimes this is not practicable and the diving supervisor will make the call guided by the operations manual and relevant code of practice. Saturation divers cannot be decompressed to surface at acceptable risk, and must remain under pressure during first aid and further medical treatment. Rescue of divers from a disabled bell If a closed bell cannot be sealed, it cannot be safely retrieved to the surface. Recovery of saturation divers in such a case can be done by lowering another bell close to the disabled bell and transferring the divers through the water to the rescue bell, which is then sealed and recovered and locked on to the surface chamber in the normal way, after which the empty bell can be lifted by whatever means are available, for repair. A similar procedure may be used if for any reason the bell cannot be lifted. In the case of an open bell that cannot be raised the divers will abandon the bell by a method which depends on the type of bell. A wet bell which does not have a bell umbilical is the simple case as the divers are supplied direct from the surface through individual umbilicals which pass through the bell. The divers simply pass through the bell following their umbilicals and ascend to the surface assisted by the surface tenders. Any decompression required can be done in the water, or if there is a suitable hoist, surface decompression in a chamber may be practicable. If the divers are using excursion umbilicals supplied from the bell, they may not be long enough to reach the surface, and it may be necessary for the surface standby diver to meet them in the water and switch them over to umbilicals directly supplied from the surface. Rescue of saturation divers Rescue of saturation divers may be necessary in several possible scenarios: *A diver working at the bottom may need to be recovered to the bell by the bellman *The divers on a bell run may be stuck at the bottom because it is not possible to lift the bell. This is unlikely as there are usually alternative methods of lifting available. *The divers may be unable to get the bell to seal and hold pressure at the end of the dive. *The divers in the saturation system may be in danger from an uncontrollable hazard such as fire or imminent sinking of the platform Any rescue of saturation divers is logistically complicated by the absolute barrier that they must remain at or very near their saturation pressure at all times until they can be decompressed according to a suitable saturation decompression schedule. This means that they must transfer from whatever environment they occupy at the time of the emergency, to a place of safety at effectively the same pressure at all stages. First aid and urgent medical treatment must also be done in the hyperbaric environment. It is not practicable to decompress from saturation outside of a hyperbaric chamber, as the decompression generally takes several days. Rescue of a diver and recovery to the bell by the bellman is relatively straightforward, and much like the case for a wet bell. Hoisting tackle is provided to lift the casualty into the bell through the hatch, using the lifting points on the harness, and the bell can be partially flooded to assist with buoyancy. Once both divers are back in the bell, and the umbilicals stowed, the bell can be sealed and lifted while first aid is administered, and the divers transferred to the accommodation chambers for further treatment by the diving medical technician under instructions from the hyperbaric physician. Rescue from a disabled bell usually involves another bell capable of the same depth. Divers will generally transfer between bells at or near the bottom at ambient pressure. It is possible in some circumstances to use a bell as a rescue chamber to transport divers from one saturation system to another. This may require temporary modifications to the bell, and is only possible if the mating flanges of the systems are compatible. Rescue from a saturation system in imminent danger is generally known as hyperbaric evacuation, and generally makes use of a hyperbaric lifeboat or rescue chamber to transport the divers and a hyperbaric reception facility where divers can be decompressed and treated in relative comfort. Evacuation of a single diver who is medically stable, or a single diver with an attendant, may be possible using a hyperbaric stretcher or a small portable chamber if the duration of the trip is short, the pressure is suitable and the mating flanges are compatible. Precautions during the rescue Rescuers should not take unacceptable risks; any rescuers who become casualties themselves may jeopardise the rescue of the original casualty particularly as many of the emergency resources available at dive site, such as rescue manpower, first aid oxygen, underwater time and gas are generally in short supply. Conscious casualties may panic and put the rescuer's safety at risk particularly when the rescuer approaches a casualty in or under the water. It may be possible to avoid contacting a panicked casualty by throwing a rope or buoyancy aid and encouraging the casualty to help him or herself. If contact must be made, the rescuer should try to approach the casualty from a direction that presents least risk to the rescuer, such as from behind. Alternatively, the rescuer may need to wait until the casualty is incapacitated before approaching. Incident management In a professional diving operation, management of any rescue or other emergency is the responsibility of the diving supervisor. In a recreational scenario, it may be the responsibility of the Instructor, dive-master or boat skipper, if professionally involved. In many recreational incidents there is no specific person responsible for the safety of others, and a rescue is often managed by the person best able to deal with the situation on site. When the rescue involves a group of people, co-ordination is needed to make it quick and effective. This may be carried out by the skipper of the boat, if diving is taking place from a boat, or by a diver. Some training agencies offer courses to prepare divers for such as role, for example BSAC's Practical Rescue Management course. Equipment Diver rescue may involve equipment used underwater and equipment used in the recovery of the diver from the water and subsequent first aid and transportation to a suitable medical facility. ;Rescue tether: Surface supplied standby divers and bellmen may carry a short length of rope with a clip on each end to support a disabled diver from the rescuer's harness, to allow the rescuer the use of both hands during the recovery to the bell or the surface. ;Oxygen administration equipment:Administration of 100% oxygen at the surface is indicated as first aid for a large range of diving related conditions, and is not, as a general rule, contraindicated for any person medically fit to dive. If the diver is conscious and breathing spontaneously without difficulty, a demand regulator supply is convenient and economical of the gas supply. A demand valve can deliver about 95% oxygenWith a well-sealed mask. Non-rebreather masks provide a constant high flow rate of oxygen, usually from 10 to 15 litres per minute, which can be manually set to just sufficient to prevent the reservoir bag from emptying on the average inhalation. For casualties who are not breathing spontaneously, or who are breathing with difficulty, Bag-valve masks and manually triggered ventilators may be used to administer positive-pressure ventilation. Effectiveness of all delivery systems depends on a good seal between the administration mask and the casualty's face. Nasal cannulas provide inspired oxygen fractions only slightly more than air, and are not of much benefit to injured divers. Air breaks are not necessary to avoid oxygen toxicity at surface pressure. ;Emergency oxygen supply: Sufficient oxygen to provide two divers with 100% oxygen at 15 litres per minute for long enough to reach further supplies of oxygen is standard equipment for commercial diving operations under the Scientific and Inshore codes of Practice in South Africa. ;Extrication and transportation equipment: An injured diver may need to be removed from the water in an inconvenient place, and special equipment such as a stretcher, spine board, high-angle rescue equipment or recovery slings may be required to get the casualty to a place more suitable for first aid, or to a vehicle for transportation to medical facilities. Emergency services Coast guard and sea rescue services, ambulance and paramedic services, mountain rescue services etc. may be involved in the later stages of a diver rescue operation. Rescuers and training In recreational diving, the urgency of the rescue and the remoteness of dive sites mean that professional rescuers rarely take part in diver rescues. Other divers at the scene become rescuers. As the immediate in-water rescuer is often the diver's own buddy, recreational diver training agencies often teach rescue techniques in intermediate-level diver training courses; examples are the PADI Rescue Diver, the BSAC Sport Diver and the DIR Rebreather Rescue courses. Professional divers are usually trained in diver rescue for the modes of diving they are certified in, as part of the work of a professional diver is as stand-by diver to the working diver. The level and quality of training and required skill for certification may vary depending on the jurisdiction and relevant code of practice. During professional diving operations there will usually be a competent diver on stand-by at the surface control point, or in the water with the working diver, or both. The surface stand-by diver should be ready for immediate deployment for a rescue if this is deemed necessary by the diving supervisor, who is responsible for the safety of the dive team and for managing a rescue. Appropriate equipment based on the operational hazards and risk should be available on site. The bellman is the in-water standby diver in wet and dry bell operations.

A bronze tablet dedicated to his memory is found in Appleton Chapel, Cambridge, Massachusetts (see the Memoir by Edward J. Young, Cambridge, 1896). The inscription on the tablet concludes with: \\"He moved among the teachers and students of Harvard College, and wist not that his face shone.\\" Andrew Peabody was an accomplished scholar, and also a firm believer in ethical behavior. He championed many causes during his life, including peace, the end of slavery, the education of women, and better treatment for the mentally ill. The Peabody School in Cambridge, Massachusetts was founded in 1889. The original building was three stories high and cost $25,000. That building was razed and a new one built in 1962 at a cost of $1,420,000. In 2003, the Peabody School was relocated to its current facility, which received extensive renovations and additions in 2001. The Peabody School today continues to represent the two things for which Andrew Peabody is remembered: the pursuit of academic excellence, coupled with a caring and respect for others. Published works In addition to brief memoirs and articles, Peabody wrote: * Christianity the Religion of Nature (2 vol. ed., 1864) *Lowell Institute Lectures; Reminiscences of European Travel (1868) *A Manual of Moral Philosophy (1873) *Christian Belief and Life (1875) *Harvard Reminiscences (1888).

He was born in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire and was educated at Clifton College and played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Kent County Cricket Club. He also played six Test matches for England. His career lasted from 1869 to 1886.Brief profile of E.F.S.Tylecote, CricketArchive. Retrieved 2020-06-05. by Don Ambrose]Edward Tylecote, CricketArchive. Retrieved 2020-06-05. Highest innings record When he was 19, Tylecote set the then record for the highest score ever made in a cricket match when playing in a school match at Clifton College; he was playing for the Classicals against the Moderns. The Moderns batted first, scoring 100, with Tylecote taking three wickets. He then opened for the Classicals, and although this was a one-innings match, the game was continued until all the Classical players had an innings. Tylecote's innings covered three afternoons and six hours as he amassed 404 not out: the first quadruple century in a cricket match. The next highest score was 52. Tylecote scored one seven, five fives, 21 fours, 39 threes, 42 twos and 87 ones, all of which were run except for one four hit out of the ground. The record has since been exceeded – by another Clifton College schoolboy AEJ Collins – who scored 628 not out. Oxford University, Kent and England Tylecote went on to Oxford University, winning his Blue in 1869, 1870, 1871 and 1872. He was captain in the last two of those years. He went on to play for Kent in 1875, and he continued to play for them to 1883. Tylecote also played some cricket for his home county of Bedfordshire, which is not a first-class county, from 1870 to 1877. He was a member of the Honourable Ivo Bligh's team to Australia to recover the Ashes in 1882/3. A fully representative England side had lost to Australia at home for the first time in 1882, after which a mock obituary to English cricket had appeared in The Sporting Times. The joke at the time was that Bligh's tour was going over to Australia to recover the ashes. This he succeeded in doing, by beating the team that had beaten England two-one, and afterwards Bligh was presented with an urn with ashes in it by some Melburnian ladies as a memento. A poem was attached to the urn, which memorialises Tylecote's contribution, along with the contributions of a number of his teammates: :When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn; :Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return; :The welkin will ring loud, :The great crowd will feel proud, :Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn; :And the rest coming home with the urn. Career outside cricket Outside of cricket Tylecote taught mathematics at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich from 1875 to 1895, as well as teaching in some preparatory schools. His hobbies included collecting butterflies, and he left his collection to a museum in Oxford. He died in Hunstanton, Norfolk, in 1938.

While at Langley, he directed important aerodynamic research which led to increased high-speed performance of most of the combat aircraft of World War II. In 1944 he joined the High- Speed panel and advocated the supersonic wind tunnel, completed in 1949. Following World War II, Silverstein was responsible for the conception, design, and construction of America's first supersonic propulsion wind tunnels. The investigations in these facilities greatly contributed to the development of supersonic aircraft. He also directed research in propulsion aerodynamics in the Altitude Wind Tunnel that led to significant improvements in both reciprocating and early turbojet aircraft engines. He also pioneered research on large-scale ramjet engines. Silverstein was placed in charge of all research at the Lewis Research Center in 1949. In 1952 he was appointed its Associate Director. He received an honorary doctorate in 1958 from Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland.Biographies of Aerospace Officials and Policymakers, O-S, NASA.gov.

Whalen was also a popular sportcaster in Calgary, Alberta whose nickname \\"Wailin' Ed\\" was indicative of his famous nasal announcing voice. Biography Born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Ed Whalen was studying medicine at the University of Saskatchewan in 1948 when he dropped out to take a part-time job in radio broadcasting at CFQC radio. In 1955, he moved to Calgary and became the News and Sports Director for the new Calgary TV station CHCT (later popularly known as 2&7, and then Calgary 7, and later still as part of the Global Television Network). =Wrestling= Stu Hart was introduced to Ed Whalen while he promoted shows in Saskatchewan in 1949, Ed was tapped to be the ring announcer on the shows there. Ed recalls one of his stints when he was just 21 and started in radio with his sign off of I'm 48 degrees and outside it's Ed Whalen. When Ed had the chance to apply for TV from radio in Saskatchewan, he jumped at the chance. The friendship with Stu was not forgotten as Stu, looking to air his program, contacted Ed Whalen. Whalen went to bat for Stu and the first program aired in 1957. Henry Viney was the first host of the show known as Wildcat Wrestling. In 1962, Ed took over as the host of the show and it was renamed to its run as Stampede Wrestling. It was bestowed the official Stampede name in 1975.Ed would be the host of the show from 1962 to 1983. It was there he would quit on air citing its violent and bloody matches and lack of family entertainment. Ed would rejoin Stampede Wrestling when it resumed in 1985 to 1989). The show popularized several Whalen catchphrases including \\"It's going to be a ring-a-ding-dong dandy!\\" and his trademark sign- off, \\"In the meantime and in-between time.\\" According to Ross Hart, Whalen, along with Helen Hart, were the only classy elements to the wrestling business, stating that Whalen and she added dignity to Stampede Wrestling. =Hockey= After his time with Stampede Wrestling, Whalen became beloved by Calgarians as the television voice of the Calgary Flames on 2&7/Calgary 7 from 1980 (right after the city won the NHL franchise) until his retirement in 1999, and was famous for his introduction, \\"Hello hockey fans!\\", and catchphrases such as \\"a ring-a-ding-dong dandy\\". During Flames telecasts, Whalen was memorable in showing high & intense enthusiasm with phrases such as, \\"put it out in front\\"!! or \\"oh they jam away\\"!! When Flames captain Lanny McDonald scored his 500th goal in 1989 (his final season & just prior to the team's Stanley Cup winning playoff run) on a wrap-around effort, Whalen made the call, \\"Otto battling for possession, gets it behind the net to McDonald, he scores!! He did it!! 500!!\\" Whalen also wrote a weekly column in the Calgary Sun newspaper for many years, and even after his retirement he continued to make occasional appearances on TV and still wrote his column. He also was a regular local host of the Children's Miracle Network telethon. =Death= Whalen died of a heart attack while on vacation in Venice, Florida in 2001. The broadcasting booth in Calgary's Scotiabank Saddledome (home of the Calgary Flames) was renamed the Ed Whalen Broadcast Booth in his honour. A year after his death, his wife released a CD of musical recordings Whalen made, with the proceeds going to charity.

As a result, most of the Tuscarora left the area and migrated north, reaching present-day New York and Ontario to join the related Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Iroquois tribes. The Cape Fear Indians and the Winyaw migrated from their coastal villages up the Pee Dee River adjacent to a trading post the British founded in 1716.Rudes, Blumer, and May 310 They eventually settled inland from Charleston in what is now known as Williamsburg County, South Carolina. In May 1749 provision was made by the Governor in Council to render them protection through supplying their representatives with fifty pounds of bullets and twenty-five pounds of powder. There had previously been complaints that the Cape Fear were being abused and driven from nearby hunting lands by neighboring Europeans. It was ruled that they were a peaceable people and that their rights to hunt were protected by the government. Anthropologist John R. Swanton wrote, \\"In 1808 White neighbors remembered when as many as 30 Pedee and Cape Fear Indians lived in their old territories,\\" but by this time \\"the Pedee and Cape Fear tribes were represented by one half-blood woman.\\"Sawnton p. 97 NotesReferences  Category:Native American history of North Carolina Category:Native American history of South Carolina Category:Native American tribes in North Carolina Category:Native American tribes in South Carolina Category:Cape Fear (region) ","title":"Cape Fear Indians"},{"id":"2499210","text":"Kenneth McKellar (23 June 1927 – 9 April 2010) was a Scottish tenor.Obituary London Independent, 14 April 2010. Career McKellar studied forestry at the University of Aberdeen, after graduation working for the Scottish Forestry Commission. He later trained at the Royal College of Music as an opera singer. He did not enjoy his time with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and left them to pursue a career singing traditional Scottish songs and other works. From 1959 to 1977 he frequently toured the United States and Canada with other Scottish entertainers such as Helen McArthur, often appearing in small local venues. From 1957 he starred each year in innovative pantomimes by Howard & Wyndham Ltd notably at their Alhambra Theatre Glasgow. In 1958/59 he played Jacob Bray in a successful revival of 'Old Chelsea' by Richard Tauber, along with Vanessa Lee and Peter Graves, which opened in Glasgow and then toured. For a decade from 1960 he starred as Jamie in the new pantomimes devised around him, starting with A Wish For Jamie, followed by A Love For Jamie, which ran at the Alhambra in each of five years, accompanied by Rikki Fulton, and moved after to Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Newcastle. He described these years as the most fulfilling of his stage life outside his international recording career.Alhambra Glasgow by Graeme Smith McKellar toured New Zealand in 1964. On many occasions in the 1960s and 1970s he appeared on the BBC Television Hogmanay celebration programme, alongside Jimmy Shand, Andy Stewart and Moira Anderson. He also made numerous appearances on the popular White Heather Club television series (1959–1968), hosted by Andy Stewart. His last Hogmanay Show appearance was on STV in 1991. In 1965, the BBC selected McKellar to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest in Luxembourg. He sang five titles from which viewers selected \\"A Man Without Love\\" as the 1966 entry. According to author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor's The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History, the Scottish tenor – who had changed into a kilt at the last moment – drew gasps from the audience when he appeared on stage.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 The song was placed ninth of the eighteen entries, making it the least successful UK placing in the contest until 1978. McKellar received scores from only two countries. The Irish jury gave the UK song top marks, one of only two occasions the Irish have done so in Eurovision history. \\"A Man Without Love\\" peaked at #30 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1966. His albums The World of Kenneth McKellar (1969), and Eco Di Napoli (1970), had a total of ten weeks presence in the UK Albums Chart. He recorded an album in Afrikaans, entitled Kuier By Ons, which was released just before his tour of South Africa in October 1970. On 31 December 1973, the first Scottish commercial radio station Radio Clyde began broadcasting to Glasgow. The first record they played was \\"Song of the Clyde\\" sung by Kenneth McKellar. The same recording featured over the opening titles of the 1963 film Billy Liar. McKellar lived in Lenzie, Glasgow in the house called \\"Machrie Mhor\\". Outside music, McKellar wrote a sketch which was performed by the Monty Python team at The Secret Policeman's Ball. This was the only time that a sketch written by a non-member was performed by them. McKellar made the majority of his recordings on the Decca Records label. He also recorded several classical works, including Handel's Messiah alongside Joan Sutherland in a performance conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. After he left Decca in the 1970s he then recorded from 1983 to 1996 for Lismor records, recording several albums for them before retiring in the late 1990s. McKellar also recorded the musical Kismet with Robert Merrill. He was also notable for his recordings of Gaelic songs in translation such as the Songs of the Hebrides arrangements by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser. Death McKellar died of pancreatic cancer, at the age of 82, at his daughter's home near Lake Tahoe in the United States, on 9 April 2010. His funeral was in Paisley.

First proposed by Vanity Fair columnist Maureen Orth in her book, The Importance of Being Famous (2003), it is fueled both by the celebrities' seemingly continual search for fame and attention and the business corporations' search for catchy headlines as well as viable name brands that could be sustained by such celebrities. In the celebrity- industrial complex, the celebrity either has a particular feature that is attractive to a public audience or is a victim of an occurrence that wins sympathy or condemnation from that same audience; this celebrity, for an initial period of time, becomes a subject of media scrutiny or marketing by properly funded media publication distributors. This media scrutiny, however, can often become a source of income for the celebrity, or the media scrutiny becomes an outlet of promotion for future manufactured publications or initiatives by the celebrities, and the media scrutiny around the celebrity expands to include coverage of such products. The term \\"celebrity-industrial complex\\" is an homage to the much older term military–industrial complex, which refers to a similar bilateral relationship between national militaries and industrial corporations which profit from each other.

Located on Highway 167 in the rural municapility of creighton No. 550. the community is southwest of Flin Flon and northeast of Prince Albert in central saskatchewan. History The area originally settled around Amisk Lake was called \\"Beaver Lake\\". Amisk is Cree for Beaver and thus the origin of the name. In 1937, the subdivision of the present community of Denare Beach took place. The community quickly became a resort area following the construction of a roadway to the mining centre of Flin Flon. When Saskatchewan Parks became responsible for the area they changed the name from Amisk or Beaver to Denare Beach. Taking the first two letters from Department of Natural Resources they arrived at the name of Denare Beach. The community has managed to retain its resort atmosphere. Demographics In the 2011 Census, Denare Beach had a population of 820 living in 310 of its 449 total private dwellings. Economy The area is rich in heritage of the Native Canadian culture, the fur trade, European exploration and mineral prospecting. The landscape and lake frontage have attracted human activity for many centuries. An old portage along the \\"Mill Stream\\" has from time immemorial provided a transportation link between Amisk Lake and Mosher Lake. Archaeological discoveries indicate that this route was popular with the Indian and fur trading travelers. Many pictographs can be seen in the southern part of the lake to this day. Swampy and Woods Cree are the prevalent Aboriginal cultures which thrive in this beautiful area. A trading post and small permanent settlement of white trappers and fishermen was established in the immediate vicinity in the early part of the 20th century. The Konuto Lake mine operated by Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Company Limited was located less than 2 kilometers south east of the Northern Village of Denare Beach. Medical service Due to the small population of Denare Beach, the Government of Saskatchewan permits its residents in Creighton, Denare Beach, Sandy Bay, and Pelican Narrows to utilize the basic and emergency medical services of Flin Flon. The nearest Saskatchewan medical centre is in Prince Albert, 400 kilometers southwest of Creighton. One of the most frequently accessed services is the Flin Flon General Hospital, and Flin Flon Ambulance Service.

The phrase indicates a type of cognitive dissonance on the part of the machine in question. The expression of the phrase \\"does not compute\\" by robots or computers attempting to process emotions, contradictions or paradoxes is frequently satirized in popular culture, often leading to the machine's inaction, malfunction or self-destruction. The phrase was used as a catchphrase by the television show My Living Doll in 1964.Does not compute (Jesse Sheidlower, American Dialect Society mailing list, 2001-09-15) — cites The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang It was further popularized in Lost in Space (1965) as a catchphrase often uttered by The Robot character. The problem of how to hold the result of a computation that is not a number is genuine (for example, 1/0) and represented a problem for early computers that would experience divide-by-zero errors or other mathematical paradoxes that software had not yet been written to deal with, leading to a computer crash. The NaN and related data types were invented to solve this problem. History and usage The phrase was often present in stories which carried a theme of the superiority of human emotion over limitations within the logic utilized by machines. Despite the superior ability of computers to calculate and process information, their lack of emotion and randomness made them unable to resolve cognitive dissonance, which often led to the output of \\"Does not compute\\". It was usually the computer's response to information which it had received but could not reconcile with other information it already held to be true. It could also be seen as a depiction of the limited (and thus flawed) nature of a machine's programming; due to its pre-programmed nature, it would be unable to adapt itself to circumstances beyond the scope of its programming, as opposed to humans who could adapt to such unforeseen events. The phrase was used in the sitcom My Living Doll in which the android protagonist, Rhoda Miller, uttered the phrase regularly when confronted with contradictory information, usually in relation to human behavior. On a few occasions when she did understand the information, her response was \\"that does compute\\". Perhaps the most famous use of the phrase is in the television series Lost in Space where the robot often says, \\"It does not compute!\\", to which Dr Smith would give a reply of \\"What do you mean it doesn't compute, you ninny?!\\" or something to that effect. However, the robot did not shut down or explode; it simply refused to continue working until a more logical command was given. In some cases, presenting a computer or robot with such a contradiction would cause it to violently self-destruct. This occurs in several episodes of the original series of Star Trek (e.g. \\"I, Mudd\\", \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\", \\"The Return of the Archons\\" and \\"The Changeling\\"), as well as in the finale to Logan's Run. In the episode of the 1968 television series The Prisoner entitled \\"The General\\", Patrick McGoohan causes a supercomputer to explode by feeding it the question \\"Why?\\". Such depictions reflect common perceptions of real computers at the time, which usually lacked friendly user interfaces. Computers often responded to bad input with an error message on the same order of utility as \\"does not compute\\", although self-destruction was an unlikely result from bad inputs or insoluble problems fed into the computer. The concept of a \\"killer poke\\", however, refers to user input intended to induce hardware damage. (See also \\"Halt and Catch Fire\\".) Although not using the phrase \\"does not compute\\", the short story \\"Liar!\\" (1941) by Isaac Asimov is a striking early example of cognitive dissonance leading to a robot's self-destruction: that whether it lies, tells the truth or says nothing, it will cause humans injury, so being unable to avoid breaking Asimov's First Law Of Robotics: \\"A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\\" This example is a more sophisticated treatment of cognitive dissonance leading to self-destruction than most examples from later television science fiction. Asimov explored the theme of AI cognitive dissonance at length in his robot stories. In the Doctor Who story \\"The Green Death\\", the Doctor attempts to put the computer BOSS, which claims to be infallible, out of action using the liar paradox. BOSS feigns suffering from confusion as he appears to try to resolve the paradox, but has in fact summoned security. By the 1990s, with the rise of personal computers and the graphical user interface, the public conception of computers became more friendly and sophisticated, and the image of the computer intelligence unable to respond gracefully to unexpected inputs has gradually faded away from fiction, though the phrase did show up in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace as comic relief in 1999. It re-appeared in the CGI series Star Wars: The Clone Wars in an episode on the planet Ryloth, when a number of Twi'Lek characters attacked a robotic general, much to the robots' fatal surprise. In popular culture The Star Trek franchise once again used a variation of the phrase in the 2009 film Star Trek, in which the character James T. Kirk used the phrase to goad Spock (a character known for his propensity for logic) to anger, in order to make the latter realize that he was emotionally compromised. In the film Alien, Captain Dallas (of the Nostromo) uses 'Mother' - the ship's computer - to evaluate the ship's procedures for dealing with the alien, but receives unfruitful responses in greenish letters: \\"Unable To Compute\\" and \\"Available Data Insufficient\\". Finally, he types in \\"WHAT ARE MY CHANCES?\\" The answer returns: \\"Does Not Compute.\\" In a Futurama episode, Leela's attempt to thwart Robot Santa with a paradox was stopped by his \\"paradox-absorbing crumple zones\\". In addition, the robot character Bender referred to the phrase as an \\"old robot saying\\" in \\"A Taste of Freedom\\". In \\"A Fishful of Dollars\\", Fry asks for anchovies (extinct in the Futurama universe) which eventually makes a chef-robot repeat, \\"Does not compute,\\" before exploding. In the Red Dwarf episode, \\"The Last Day\\", the android Hudzen is told by Kryten that silicon heaven does not exist. Hudzen, a believer in the android afterlife, cannot reconcile the contradiction and shuts down. Kryten, also an android, is not harmed by this dissonance, as he believes he is simply lying. On Prince's album 1999, there is a song titled \\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)\\". A popular web series titled Does Not Compute was created by Michael Swaim The Simpsons writers often parody this phrase and its implications. In one episode, Homer said he wanted to make a robot repeat the words \\"It does not compute\\" until it exploded by giving it illogical commands. In the episode \\"Trilogy of Error\\", Lisa's school project, a grammar-fixing robot, explodes after hearing too much bad grammar from the mobsters led by Fat Tony. The robot repeats the phrase \\"Bad grammar overload!\\" as a parody of the original phrase. In \\"Treehouse of Horror XIX\\", there is the following dialogue: ::Destructicus: That does not compute. ::Marge: (sternly) Really? ::Destructicus: Well, it computes a little. In The IT crowd episode \\"The Dinner Party\\", the phrase is said by Jessica, one of Jen's friends, to Moss. In an episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures, \\"Warriors Of Kudlak: Part 2\\", the computer Mistress responds to the news of peace with \\"Peace does not compute\\", as it was only programmed for war situations. In Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, one computer developed the ability to pose paradoxes to other computers, causing one computer to go in a corner and sit, pondering \\"does not compute.\\" The phrase is also the title of a song sung by the robotic vocalist ALT in the arcade game Pop'n Music 20 Fantasia.

It was the first notable U.S. railroad with its mainline entirely abandoned.kodtrak.railfan.net The railroad began life as the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad, organized by Dewitt C. Littlejohn in 1868. Its mainline extended from Weehawken, New Jersey, in the greater New York City area to Oswego, New York, a port city on Lake Ontario. It had branch lines to Scranton, Pennsylvania; Kingston, New York; Port Jervis, New York; Monticello, New York; Delhi, New York; Utica, New York and Rome, New York. The part south of Cornwall, New York, was operated over the New York Central Railroad's West Shore Railroad via trackage rights.  History  An O&W; passenger train at Weehawken Terminal, N.J. Cadosia Trestle On September 3, 1869, the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad began using the Pennsylvania Railroad's station at Exchange Place which provided its passengers with ferry access to the Cortland Street Ferry Depot in lower Manhattan and the Desbrosses Street Ferry.Railroad Ferries of the Hudson: And Stories of a Deckhand, by, Raymond J. Baxter, Arthur G. Adams, pg. 69 ,1999, Fordham University Press, 978-0823219544 In 1880, the O&W; inherited the Oswego-New York corridor as well as the branches to Ellenville, Delhi and New Berlin, New York, from the New York & Oswego Midland, which had constructed the lines. The O&W; improved the line by providing a new route to the New York City area from Middletown, NY which extended to Cornwall on the Hudson River and then to Weehawken Terminal. This development was made possible by negotiating rights of way from the New York, West Shore & Buffalo Railway, later part of the New York Central system. In 1886, the O&W; acquired the operations of both the Utica, Clinton & Binghamton and the Rome & Clinton railroads from the Delaware & Hudson Canal Company. By acquisition of these assets and construction of a new line to Sylvan Beach on the east shore of Lake Oneida, the O&W; extended its operations into new market areas, and the Sylvan Beach Loop became a seasonally-significant corridor by providing transportation to central New York's recreational resort area. By 1889, the O&W; added two new branches, New Berlin to Edmeston, and Port Jervis to Monticello, connecting to the main line at Summitville, New York. The most significant addition occurred in 1890, when the O&W; constructed a 54-mile branch from Cadosia, New York, to Scranton, Pennsylvania, through the rich anthracite coal reserves in Pennsylvania's Lackawanna Valley. Revenues from this Scranton division strengthened O&W;'s revenues and provided the means for future improvements to the railroad. The railroad's W-in-O logo first appeared in 1892Early 1890s O&W; Annual Passes O&W; Engine 405 Share of the New York, Ontario and Western Railway, issued 7 October 1921 During the ill-fated \\"Morganization\\" of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NH), the railroad acquired control of the O&W; and installed NH president Charles Sanger Mellen as president for a year. Regulatory difficulties frustrated Mellen's plans to barter the O&W; to the New York Central Railroad for concessions elsewhere. The 1940s saw a receding of passenger service. In the early years of the 1940s, the Summitville-Kingston branch was reduced to a Sundays and holidays, summers only service. Improved highways ended the O&W;'s passenger service to the resort areas of the lower Catskill Mountains (the \\"Borscht Belt\\") and lightly populated portions of Upstate New York, with the last train from Walton, New York, to Weehawken operating during the summer of 1948. The O&W;'s Walton-Delhi branch, all in Delaware County, was also eliminated in this period. The last passenger train (from Roscoe, New York, to Weehawken Terminal) operated on September 10, 1953.American Rails, 'New York, Ontario and Western Railway' https://www.american-rails.com/nyow.html =Bankruptcy= The O&W; began bankruptcy proceedings, from which it would never emerge, as early as 1937. Apart from total dieselization by 1948, it became antiquated. (It was known to locals as the \\"Old & Weary\\", \\"Old & Wobbly\\" or \\"Old Woman.\\") The decrease of coal as a heating fuel for other than major power plants damaged its primary freight business, as did the end of rail transport of high-priority dairy products from Upstate New York to the Metro New York City area. The NH offered to purchase the company in 1952, but later withdrew its offer, citing its own financial problems. Abandonment was loudly protested by towns along the line, which considered unpaid back taxes as an investment in the railroad. The New York state legislature approved a $1 million aid bill, citing the O&W; as essential for civil defense, but the state civil defense commission rejected it. The federal government eventually recommended complete liquidation, which occurred on March 29, 1957. All O&W; assets were auctioned. The diesel locomotives found new owners, but most of the rest was scrapped. Certain sections of track serving shippers, many of which were industrial factories, were transferred by the bankruptcy court to other railroads allowing continued rail access by the plants. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad received track from Utica to New Hartford, New York, and track in Norwich, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. The New York Central took over sections of O&W; New York track between Fulton and Oswego, as well track in Rome, Oneida, and Kingston. The transfers were approved before operations ceased at midnight on the 29th, and the transfer of other sections to the Erie Railroad was expected to be approved later. A section of the track in New Hartford was still in operation in 2018 by the Northern Division of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. Legacy General Electric 44-ton switcher preserved at the Southeastern Railway Museum, Duluth, Georgia By virtue of its superb online scenery and anachronistic operations, the O&W; retains \\"cult status\\" among railroad and history buffs more than 50 years after its abandonment, with periodic bus tours of remaining railroad artifacts. New York State Route 17 parallels the O&W; from south of Liberty to Hancock in Sullivan and Delaware counties. Rail historian George Drury later commented that the O&W; \\"had always been sickly and should not have been built\\" at just \\"541 miles\\". Parts of the Summitville - Kingston division, ending at Kingston, have become a rail trail. Some of the stations have been converted into residences, including the Alligerville station in High Falls, New York, owned by Gerry Leonard since 2001 and used as a recording studio.  The \\"Flying Diesel Corps\\"  On September 27, 1955, a 50-car O&W; train in Hamilton, New York, traveling on a mainline approached a switch set for a siding which led to a coal trestle. Although the engineer fully applied the brakes, the train continued up the siding at more than and through the trestle. It was learned that the 213-ton EMD FT diesel locomotive at the head of the train \\"flew\\" a distance of beyond the coal trestle from an elevation of ; total time of \\"flight\\" was later estimated to be between six and seven seconds. Two of the crew were seriously injured, but no crewmen were killed in the wreck. An investigation by New York state police as to why the switch had been thrown resulted in no arrests. A dinner was later given in honor of the crew who each received a plaque proclaiming them to be members of the O&W;'s new \\"Flying Diesel Corps.\\" Each plaque was topped with a cast presentation model of their F-unit locomotive; the castings were provided by EMD. One of the freight cars involved in the accident was loaded with chocolate bars from the Nestlé plant in nearby Fulton, New York. It was said that when the younger residents of Hamilton learned of the spilled candy, they raced to collect what they could, and that as a result candy sales in the town were for some time afterward very low.O&W; history at www.nyow.org See also *O & W Railroad Station at Port Ben ReferencesExternal links *Ontario and Western at Abandoned Rails *Ontario and Western Railway Historical Society *De Diver Railroad Photographs (Flickr) *Flickr NYO&W; group *O&W; Rail Trail - New York *NYO&W; Timetables and maps Category:Former Class I railroads in the United States Category:Defunct New Jersey railroads Category:Defunct New York (state) railroads Category:Defunct Pennsylvania railroads Category:Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania–New York) Category:Railway companies established in 1880 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1957 Category:American companies disestablished in 1957 Category:American companies established in 1880 ","title":"New York, Ontario and Western Railway"},{"id":"2499287","text":"The Mist is the name of different DC Comics supervillains, archenemies of the original and 1990s Starman.

In the early 1990s, after Ted Knight had retired (following the events of Zero Hour), the Mist planned his final revenge on Starman and sent his son, also named Kyle, to kill Knight's son David, as well as nearly killing his second son, Jack, demolishing his home and kidnapping the elder Knight. In exchange for his father, Jack battled the younger Kyle, resulting in the junior Kyle's death, which drove the Mist insane. He was like this for some time until making a deal with the demon-lord Neron, restoring his sanity and curing his senile dementia. This allowed him to advise his daughter on joining Simon Culp's scheme to destroy Opal City and conversely kill Culp himself when he threatened her, on the grounds he \\"hated dwarfs\\". Ultimately, he revealed he was tired and had decided to end his life, planting a nuclear bomb in Opal City set to detonate at the moment of his death and then taking poison. However, he failed to destroy the city, as a terminally ill Ted Knight used an advanced version of his gravity rod to lift the entire building miles into the air; the two enemies made peace with each other just before the Mist's heart stopped, killing them both.Starman Vol. 2 #72. DC Comics. Earth-Two version What follows is an account of the Mist's history as it existed on the world of Earth-Two, prior to the consolidating of DC Comics' alternate Earths in the Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries. Much of this can still be considered canon where it does not contradict later established information. June 1962 saw Earth-Two's public re-emergence of Vandal Savage. He briefly terrorized a handful of important U.S. cities and was able to attack and incapacitate various members of the retired JSA.Flash #137. DC Comics. This brazen attack on major American cities and on the persons of a handful of retired JSAers resulted in the re-emergence and the re-formation of the Justice Society of America. This did not have an immediate effect on the super-scientists and criminals who operated openly in the 1940s and covertly in the 1950s, but over time this curious breed of villain did begin to re-emerge. September 1965 found the Mist working with a gang of hoodlums along the Atlantic Coast in Park City. With his secret formulas and gadgetry he was controlling Mrs. Dinah Lance, using the Drake Flower Shoppe as the means to gain access to the wealthy citizenry, and using his hypnotic influence to have the rich rob themselves and hand over their wealth to the Mist's henchmen. Though Park City did have a protector in the guise of the Black Canary, this heroine was only seen infrequently and the Mist seemed not to have been perturbed by this. Though he was using Mrs. Lance, he never discovered her dual identity as the Black Canary. By September, his crime spree was advancing nicely and was baffling the local police. Finally, a local private investigator – Mr. Larry Lance (husband to Dinah Lance) figured out the connection between those robbed and his wife's flower shop. At about this time, the Lance family was visited by their friend Ted Knight, he accidentally intercepted a hypnotic sound wave sent by the Mist. Together, the three heroes went about hunting down the gang and its leader. During this crime spree, the Mist discovered how to use his inviso-solution, sound waves and a recording of motor noises from the Park City Observatory to block star-energy from reaching Starman's gravity rod, in effect making it powerless; however, Starman had with him a newer, quasar-powered rod, which proved impervious to the deactivation. In the end, the Mist and his men were defeated and handed over to the police.The Brave & the Bold #61. DC Comics. =Nash Nimbus= Nash was not initially the villain that her father or brother were, but rather a meek, stuttering girl. During her father's campaign of revenge against Ted Knight, she was in a position to kill Jack Knight, but let him go after he reasoned that she personally had no reason to kill him. After Jack killed her brother Kyle, she underwent a major personality shift and became the second Mist, exposing herself to the same process that had given her father his powers. During her first major crime wave she drugged Jack, had sex with him while he was unconscious and became pregnant. She later gave birth to a son, Kyle Theo, named after her father and Jack. She passed on a second opportunity to kill Jack, deciding to better herself as a villain whilst Jack worked to become a better hero. She spent much time in Europe where she killed the second Amazing Man, the Crimson Fox and Blue Devil. She was then one of the many villains who took part in the plan to destroy Opal City during the Grand Guignol storyline. After this failed, her father made his own attempt to destroy the city. Since his plan would kill Nash and her son, she attempted to stop him. Her father then shot her. In her dying moments, she gave her son over to Jack. Powers and abilities Both Mists are able to transform into a living vapor and become tangible and intangible at will. Other versions In the pages of Earth 2: Society, Kyle Nimbus is the CEO of Nimbus Solutions who can make himself intangible at will where he has to be tangible to attack. In his plans, he used mind-control chemicals on Hourman's Miraclo in order for him to serve Nimbus. With help from Red Arrow and Ted Grant, Dick Grayson as Batman defeated Kyle Nimbus.Earth 2: Society #10-11. DC Comics. In other media The Kyle Nimbus version of the Mist appears on The Flash, portrayed by Anthony Carrigan. Introduced in the episode \\"Things You Can't Outrun\\", Nimbus is a mob hitman who was betrayed by and testified against his employers. After being charged, he was put on death row. However, as he was in the midst of being executed via gas chamber, the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploded, giving him the ability transform into the gas that was being used to execute him. With his powers, he attempted to kill all of the people he deemed responsible for imprisoning him before the Flash exploited Nimbus' weakness and keep him trapped in his gaseous state until he fell unconscious. He was later locked in a makeshift cell in the converted particle accelerator. After making a minor appearance in \\"Power Outage\\", he appears again in \\"Rogue Air\\" when the S.T.A.R. Labs team attempted to transfer their metahuman prisoners to a new prison, only for Captain Cold to free them. A younger, dark-skinned version of Nash Nimbus, renamed Andy, appears in Young Justice: Outsiders, voiced by Daniela Bobadilla. Introduced in the episode \\"Triptych\\", she faced Nightwing's team alongside Livewire and the Shade. She seemed nervous and insecure, even apologizing to Nightwing as she attempted to throttle him, but he managed to freeze and defeat her. Following this, she went on to reside at the Metahuman Youth Center. Unlike other incarnations, when Andy changes into her gaseous state, she leaves her clothes behind.

They are ridges that closely follow the moons' equators. They appear to be unique to the Saturnian system, but it is uncertain whether the occurrences are related or a coincidence. All three were discovered by the Cassini probe in 2005. Daphnis also appears to have such a ridge. The ridge on Iapetus is nearly 20 km wide, 13 km high and 1,300 km long. The ridge on Atlas is proportionally even more remarkable given the moon's much smaller size, giving it a disk-like shape. Images of Pan show a structure similar to that of Atlas.  Formation  It is not certain how these ridges formed, or whether there is any connection between them. Because Atlas and Pan orbit within the rings of Saturn, a likely explanation for their ridges is that they sweep up ring particles as they orbit, which build up around their equators. This theory is less applicable to Iapetus, which orbits far beyond the rings. One scientist has suggested that Iapetus swept up a ring before being somehow expelled to its current, distant orbit. Others think it was stationary and it is the rings that have been pulled away from it, falling into Saturn's gravity field. Perhaps more likely is the theory that because Iapetus has an unusually large Hill sphere compared to other moons in the Solar System, it could once have had its own ring, or even a moonlet that was slowly pulled in closer, torn up into a ring, and then gradually accreted onto Iapetus' equator. But most scientists prefer to assume that Iapetus's ridge was produced by some kind of internal source and is unrelated to the ridges on Atlas and Pan. Another theory suggested is that low velocity collisions between moons could have formed the bulge at the centre although the circumstances for such an event to happen are slim.

During his tenure as the Executive Director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission from 1949 to 1970, his visions shaped today's Philadelphia, the city in which he was born, to the extent that he is sometimes described as \\"The Father of Modern Philadelphia\\". Early life Bacon was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Helen Atkinson (née Comly) and Ellis Williams Bacon.Greg Heller, Ed Bacon: Planning, Politics, and the Building of Modern Philadelphia. (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013) p.17 He grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and graduated from Swarthmore High School in 1928. He was educated in architecture at Cornell University, where his senior thesis for a new civic center for Philadelphia included an urban park at the position where Philadelphia's famous LOVE Park was later built. After college, while traveling the world on a small inheritance, Bacon found work as an architect in Shanghai, China in Henry Murphy's office. He was responsible for designing the Nanking airport. With Murphy, he visited Beijing, a city that exerted a deep influence on his thinking. After a year in China, he returned to Philadelphia where he worked for architect William Pope Barney. He soon was awarded a scholarship to the Cranbrook Academy of Art, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, with Finnish architect/planner Eliel Saarinen, whom Bacon revered and whose theories about the city as a living organism as expressed in Saarinen's book The City were a basis for Bacon's later work. Saarinen sent Bacon to Flint, Michigan to guide a WPA traffic survey. This project transformed into a permanent position for Bacon at the Flint Institute for Planning and Research. Bacon became very active in civic life in Flint, helping to establish the Flint Housing Association and reforming the city's Planning Commission. During his time in Flint, Bacon witnessed the 1936-37 Flint Sit-Down Strike, and felt empathetic to the workers. Bacon gained close contacts with individuals who were active in establishing the Federal Housing Authority, such as Catherine Bauer and Lewis Mumford. Through these contacts he helped secure federal housing dollars for Flint. However, the local real-estate industry came to see this Federal funding for public housing as a threat to their business (as was the case in several cities early in the history of the FHA). The funding was turned down, and Bacon was effectively run out of Flint in 1939. Career From Flint, Bacon returned to Philadelphia to serve as Managing Director of the Philadelphia Housing Association. He served in the United States Navy aboard the USS Shoshone in the Pacific in World War II. In 1947, he joined the staff of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission under then-Executive Director Robert Mitchell (not the Canadian politician), and served as co-designer to the 1947 Better Philadelphia Exhibition in collaboration with Oscar Stonorov and Louis Kahn. Bacon was also an early member of the City Policy Committee, a grassroots movement of young Philadelphians, established by future civic leader Walter M. Phillips, that was instrumental in Philadelphia's political reform movement. Members of the Committee went on to become leaders in Philadelphia government after 1952, when the reform Democrat (and later U.S. Senator) Joseph Sill Clark was elected Mayor, Richardson Dilworth became District Attorney, and a new Home Rule Charter was instituted. In 1949, Bacon succeeded Mitchell as Executive Director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. Serving under Mayors Samuel, Clark, Dilworth, and Tate, his work brought him national repute along with his counterparts Edward J. Logue in Boston and Robert Moses in New York City during the mid-century era of urban renewal. His face appeared on the cover of TIME magazine in 1964, and in 1965, Life magazine devoted its cover story to his work. That same year, Bacon was appointed by President Johnson to serve as a member of the White House's Conference on Recreation and Natural Beauty. In 1967, he wrote Design of Cities, still considered an important architectural text. It is a seminal work on urban design that illustrates the relationship between historical and modern principles, as well as practices of urban planning, applied particularly to Philadelphia. It was during his tenure at the City Planning Commission that Bacon and his staff conceived and implemented numerous large- and small-scale design ideas that shaped today's Philadelphia. These design concepts became Penn Center, Market East, Penn's Landing, Society Hill, Independence Mall, and the Far Northeast. The Center City Commuter Connection, a seemingly radical idea at the time, was conceived during the 1950s by Planning Commission staff member, R. Damon Childs, who succeeded Bacon as Executive Director. Not all of the concepts that Bacon supported materialized. One proposal that he inherited from Robert Mitchell was to encircle Center City with a series of expressways, including the so-called \\"Crosstown Expressway\\" (I-695) and the Vine Street Expressway (I-676) linking the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) with the Delaware Expressway (I-95) via South Street. Three of the four expressways were built; however, the Crosstown Expressway faced significant local opposition and was never built, while a scaled-down expressway was built at Vine Street. As an unintended consequence, the Crosstown Expressway proposal depressed property values and rents in the South Street corridor, leading to a turnover of the neighborhood's character from largely Jewish-owned garment shops to the thriving commercial and nightlife center that it is today. Other concepts conceived during Bacon's tenure, such as Schuylkill River Park, included in the 1963 Center City Plan, came into being many years later. After Bacon's retirement from the Planning Commission in 1970, he served as vice president for the private planning firm Mondev U.S.A., was an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at the University of Pennsylvania, from 1950 to 1987, and narrated \\"Understanding Cities\\", an award-winning series of documentary films describing the history and development of Rome under Pope Sixtus V, Paris under Georges-Eugène Haussmann, Regency London under John Nash, American cities, and cities in the future post-oil era. He vociferously but unsuccessfully opposed the development of skyscrapers in Center City Philadelphia taller than Philadelphia City Hall, which until 1984 set the informal height limit for downtown at the hat of the statue of William Penn. That custom, known as the \\"Gentlemen's agreement,\\" was broken by developer Willard G. Rouse III's One Liberty Place. The New York Times correctly noted Bacon's opposition to the project, but it was incorrect in saying that \\"in opposing the skyscraper One Liberty Place, Mr. Bacon refused to attend the tower's 1986 groundbreaking and stopped speaking to his friend Willard G. Rouse III, who built it. 'I think it's very, very destructive that he and he alone has chosen to destroy a historical tradition that set a very fine and disciplined form for the city,' Mr. Bacon said at the time.\\" Bacon was present at the groundbreaking, which took place in May 1985. Of course, Rouse was not capable of single-handedly changing the custom, even if it was not formally legal. Rouse's enormous project had the support of Mayor W. Wilson Goode, Philadelphia City Council, and the City Planning Commission, which was forced by the announcement of Rouse's plan to admit that it had no up-to-date plan of its own for the future of Philadelphia's downtown. Bacon won numerous honors including the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1962, the American Institute of Planners Distinguished Service Award, the Philadelphia Award, and an honorary doctorate from Penn. In 1983, Bacon was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member, and became a full member in 1994. From 2004 until his death at the age of 95 the following year, Bacon helped found and served as an honorary director of a foundation that bears his name, The Ed Bacon Foundation, whose programs are now managed by the Edmund N. Bacon Memorial Committee at the Philadelphia Center for Architecture. Bacon continued to assert his vision for Philadelphia's future actively in his later years. During the 1990s he proposed new concepts to improve Independence Mall, Penn's Landing, and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. During the same period, he promoted a design competition for North American cities to design the best \\"Post-Petroleum\\" city. Only one municipality, in Ottawa, Canada, committed to it. In 2002, at age 92, he skateboarded in LOVE Park, the plaza he founded and designed at Cornell in 1932, as a protest against the City's ban on the sport. In 2003 he appeared in the documentary My Architect about Louis Kahn, a Philadelphia architect. In September 2006, at the northwest corner of 15th Street and J.F.K. Boulevard, by LOVE Park, The Ed Bacon Foundation and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission dedicated a state historical marker honoring Bacon's memory and commemorating his work. Personal life Bacon was the father of six children: two sons, actor Kevin Bacon, musician Michael Bacon, and four daughters, Karin, Elinor, Hilda and Prudence (later Kira). His wife was Ruth Hilda Holmes, a teacher and liberal political activist. His friends included Buckminster Fuller, Steen Eiler Rasmussen, James Rouse, and Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis.

It is one of the largest museums in the country. The name Kunsthalle indicates the museum's history as an 'art hall' when founded in 1850. Today, the Kunsthalle houses one of the few art collections in Germany that covers seven centuries of European art, from the Middle Ages to the present day. The Kunsthalle's permanent collections focus on North German painting of the 14th century, and paintings by Dutch, Flemish and Italian artists of the 16th and 17th centuries, French and German drawings and paintings of the 19th century, and international modern and contemporary art. The Kunsthalle consists of three connected buildings, dating from 1869, 1921 and 1997, located in the Altstadt district, between the Hauptbahnhof (central station) and the two Alster lakes.  History  Kunsthalle (main building) The Kunsthalle has its origins in 1849, when established and opened a year later as 'Städtische Gallerie' (municipal painting gallery) by the Hamburg Kunstverein, which was founded in 1817. The collection grew quickly, and it soon became necessary to provide a building. The original red brick Kunsthalle was built from 1863 to 1869, designed by architects Georg Theodor Schirrmacher and Hermann von der Hude, and financed largely through private donations. The first director became the art historian and educator Alfred Lichtwark (1852–1914). His successor during the interwar period was Gustav Pauli, who also oversaw the completion of the Kuppelsaal (domed-hall) extension, the Kunsthalle's first annex, designed by Fritz Schumacher and erected between 1914 and 1921. In 1994, one painting of the Kunsthalle was involved in the so- called Frankfurt art theft. While on loan to the Kunsthalle Schirn in Frankfurt, the painting Nebelschwaden by Caspar David Friedrich was stolen. After negotiations with the thieves, a lawyer bought back the painting; when the Kunsthalle refused to pay him the agreed \\"consideration\\", he sued and won. In 1997, the Kunsthalle received, the 'Galerie der Gegenwart', a extension, designed by Cologne architect Oswald Mathias Ungers and dedicated to the Kunsthalle's contemporary art collections. The cubic building sits on a monolithic base at a prominent location in close proximity to the Binnenalster.  Collections  The Kunsthalle is divided into four different sections: the Gallery of Old Masters, the Gallery of 19th-century Art, the Gallery of Classical Modernism and the Gallery of Contemporary Art. The highlights of the collection include the medieval alters of Master Bertram and Master Francke, 17th-century Dutch paintings, works of early to mid 19th century German Romanticism, and collections of impressionism and classic modernism. The Kunsthalle Museum is also known for its international contemporary art collections and exhibitions, which include post-1950 Pop Art, conceptual art, video art and photography. = Old Masters = The Old Masters Collection shows works by Bartel Beham, Bernardo Bellotto, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Master Francke, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes, Johann Georg Hinz, Jan Massys, Giambattista Pittoni, Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, among others.

After 1959, Rock and Roll followed the same path, although artists like Argentinean Luis Aguile emerged.\\" When Cuba and the United States broke relations, some people considered rock \\"the music of the enemy, the language of the enemy\\". Then, there was the time of the Cold War, the Bay of Pigs, the Missile Crisis and the uprising of armed bands throughout the country. Nevertheless, rock continued to be played. And though it didn't have a good reputation, it was tolerated. And though somehow its performers were considered to have a deviant ideology, many groups continued playing the genre. Among these were included Los Vampiros and Los Satélites. These bands were composed of black people and had a style similar to that of Limbo Rock in the United States. This was the origin of street rock. And the situation continued like that until 1965. Salvador Terry's Los Vampiros and Los Satélites helped keep Cuban rock alive and showed that black and mixed race people also loved it. From 1961 to 1964, they made people put aside the old quarrels and misunderstandings that rock was the music of high life of the white majority. Today, all the manifestations and subgenres of rock are performed, no matter how atypical they are. History of rock in CubaThe 1950s= The strong influence of American music on the younger Cuban generations paved the way for the introduction of rock & roll in the island during the 1950s. Many Cuban artists sung versions of American songs translated to Spanish, as it was also happening in Mexico. One of the first Cuban rock groups, Los Llopis pioneered the use of the electric guitar in Cuba,Los Sonidos de la Música cubana – Armando Rodríguez Ruidíaz – Academia.edu -https://www.academia.edu/18302881/Los_sonidos_de_la_m%C3%BAsica_cubana._Evoluci%C3%B3n_de_los_formatos_instrumentales_en_Cuba although electrically-amplified treses were already being played by musicians such as Senén Suárez. The repertoire of Los Llopis consisted of a combination of American and rock pieces, such as \\"See You Later, Alligator\\" and \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" by the Bill Haley group, with other Cuban and Hispanic pieces like \\"Goza mi Guaracha\\", \\"Maquinolandera\\" and \\"La pollera colorá\\". Los Llopis also succeeded in Spain, where they established their residence for some years and introduced pachanga, a new Cuban rhythm with an influence from the Dominican merengue. In 1959 Luisito Bravo bursted into the Cuban musical scene with songs such as Neil Sedaka's \\"Oh Carol\\" and the Italian song \\"Tiernamente (Torna a Surriento)\\" (covered by Elvis Presley as \\"Surrender\\", reaching 500,000 record sales by 1961. Other solo artists followed Luisito Bravo, such as Rogelio Sanzarini and Jorge Bauer, as well as groups such as the Satélites of Antonio María Romeu and the Tony Taño band. =The 1960s= The development of Cuban rock was interrupted by the Cuban Revolution. In the same way that Joseph Stalin had interfered in the culture of the Soviet Union in previous years, Fidel Castro banned rock music in 1961, for being a corrupt North American influence that didn't belong in the new communist Cuba; a position that ironically was in contradiction with the own liberal vision of Karl Marx with respect to the arts and culture; not to mention that the international rock groups had embraced in general a leftist ideology by then. Despite this, several rock artists emerged that year. Dany Puga, called the King of Twist, and bands such as Los Diablos Melódicos and Los Enfermos del Rock, as well as Los Halcones of IvanFariñas and Los Huracanes from Marianao. The vocal quartet Los Zafiros was another successful group from the beginning of the sixties. Founded in 1961, it was influenced by the doo-wop style of The Platters, The Diamonds and other American groups, and counted on a repertoire consisting of ballads, calypsos and bossanovas, as well as songs with slow rock and bolero rhythms. One of the most salient traits of the group was the treble voice of the counter-tenor Ignacio Elejalde, supported by Miguel Cancio, Leoncio Morúa and Eduardo Elio Hernández (El chino), as well as by the guitarist Manuel Galbán. The guitarist Franco Laganá, an Italian musician that had participated in the renowned group of Renato Carosone, was an early representative of the music with an American influence in Cuba, during the beginning of the sixties decade. At that time, the popular group Los Astros (not to be confused with René Álvarez' band), led by the singer and guitarist Raúl Gómez, was threatened by pressures exerted by the Fidel Castro regime over the rock groups, which were considered as a form of “ideological diversionism” and actively opposed in all its manifestations. Its style, strongly influenced by British Invasion groups like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, was labelled as \\"deviant\\" and consequently repressed without any hesitation. Since then, the Revolutionary government of Cuba began to implement an absolute control over all aspects of the Cuban society, including, of course, all cultural expressions. In 1963, Fidel himself delivered a speech at the steps in front of the Havana University, which clearly expressed his contempt and dissatisfaction toward certain manifestations influenced by foreign trends, such as the Elvis Presley (\\"elvispresliana\\") music, the tight blue jeans (pitusas), and also homosexuality; thus establishing the official parameters from the regime on that subject: > \\"... Many of those lazy tramps (pepillos), sons of the bourgeoisie, that > roam around with pants that are too tight (laughter); some of them with a > guitar in “elvispreslianas” (from Elvis Presley) attitudes, that have gone > too far on its venture as to go to public places with the intention of > freely organizing their feminine shows.

Los Astros followed the classical format coined by the British groups: Raúl Gómez, leading voice and rhythm guitar, his cousin Luis Gómez, second voice and lead guitar, Marcelo, accompanying voice and sax, and Gerardo López, drums. Its repertoire consisted of American hits from the sixties. During its short existence, the group had to confront numerous adversities and a hostile environment. Eres como el Fuego (You are like fire), their first song broadcast by a radio station in the capital city, was recorded with great difficulties, and therefore the result was of very little audio quality. Los Astros used to play in the radio program Buenas Tardes Juventud, from Radio Marianao. According to Jorge Luis González Suárez: \\"Those shows also suffered the regime's ban for being considered a form of 'ideological diversion'.\\"Primavera digital: Los que no pueden faltar. Los Astros de Raúl Gómez. Jorge Luis González Suárez. http://primaveradigital.net/los-que-no- pueden-faltar-los-astros-de-raul-gomez/. Consultado: 07/07/16. In spite of the political discrepancy between the US and Cuba since 1960; after the closing of the US embassy, and after the country being \\"invaded from the neighbor at the North\\" by Cubans opposed to the socialist regime, rock music never stopped to be performed, despite being considered as subversive. After the disintegration of some rock bands, their members formed new ones, as in the case of Los Halcones in the Quinteto Negro, and the Príncipes del Rock in Los Buitres, consisting of Rey Montesinos, Dino Fregio, vocals an guitar and Jorge Calvet Vidales (Coqui), guitarist and leader of the \\"Orquesta 440\\". Already in 1964, other bands imitating the Beatles emerged, such as Los Kent, Los Pacíficos from the Pre-Universitario del Vedado; and then many amateur bands, creating what was called (street rock) “rock de la calle”. That way Los Violentos of Reynaldo Montesinos was created. That group was part of the psychedelic show of Maricusa Cabrera and Arístides Pumariega (a famous cartoonist from the Cuban TV and press). In 1969, Los Violentos brought to the group Miguelito and Aimé Cabrera, two singer-dancers of very high artistic quality, thus providing a different image to the audience of the Maricusa Cabrera shows. Although its members were considered as ideological deviants, many groups continued cultivating this genre. We can include among them Los Vampiros and Los Satélites. Those groups led by Salvador Terry contributed to keep Cuban rock alive and demonstrated that it was appreciated by people from different races. Between 1961 and 1964, they were able to make people leave behind their old misunderstandings, created by those who thought that rock was the music of the high classes and the white majority. These bands were composed of black people and possessed a style similar to the Limbo Rock from the US. That was the origin of “street rock” and it continued until 1965. Around 1965, the Cuban government implemented a strategy to substitute the foreign products that the young people preferred, with others that better matched their official guidelines; and as a result of this strategy, a new radio program called Nocturno was broadcast in 1966, which initial musical theme was “La chica de la valija” (Girl with a suitcase) from the Italian sax player Fausto Papetti. The program presented modern songs, giving priority to the European repertoire in Spanish language of soloists and groups such as Los Mustang, Los Bravos, Los Brincos, Juan y Junior, Rita Pavone, Massiel, Nino Bravo, Leonardo Fabio, Salvatore Adamo and Raphael, and some Cuban groups as Los Zafiros and Los Dan.Nocturno: http://radionocturno.com/ : Consultado: 07-07-16. The ban against rock music was lifted in 1966, but rock fans continued to be marginalized by the communist establishment, and watched over with suspicion as “counter-revolutionaries”. When the ban was lifted, Los Pacíficos planned to offer a rock concert. They borrowed their instruments and played without a previous rehearsal. The two full hours long concert was recorded. Los Pacíficos paid a high price for their performance, because one of its members, Carlos Avila, was killed in the Angolan war during the sixties. The recording was smuggled out of Cuba during the nineties and published as a remastered album. The Pacíficos won an entry in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest in New York. The Castro government's attitude towards rock, until recently, was quite negative, although it has varied greatly in severity throughout the regime's existence. During the 1960s and 1970s rock was prohibited, although nueva cancion/nueva trova artists like Silvio Rodríguez and Carlos Varela would sometimes perform rock material. In more recent years, with the re- transition to a tourism-based economy, attitudes of the Castro regime towards rock have softened somewhat, not only towards domestic and Latin American artists but also towards foreign Anglophone artists. Independent the very trouble Quinteto Negro of Ivan Fariñas and Carlos Cory improvised concerts together with The Zafiros and quartet of Meme Solis in Carpas Teatros, other bands as Los Buitres with plays version about music of The Beatles and The Dave Clark Five also played in Carpas. In 1968 other cover bands started such as Dimension Vertical with Oscar Quesada, last drummer of Quinteto Negro and many others; for example Los Kent and Jets in the Vedado Zone. =The 1970s= Rock music began to be heard in Havana during the seventies, in a radio program from Radio Marianao called Buenas Tardes Juventud. That program presented groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Dave Clark Five, The Animals, Grand Funk, Rare Earth, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Neil Sedaka and Paul Anka. At the beginning of the eighties, that radio station joined Radio Ciudad de La Habana.Cubanet - Society - The History of Rock in Cubahttp://www.cubanow.net/articles/history-rock-cuba Near to the end of the 1970s, guitarist and singer Jorge Martínez created RED, a heavy metal band, in Municipio Playa, and presented his own music mixed with covers. This band put some hits on the radio like Murcielagos, Mako, La nueva historia and Burocracia. Also on TV, the band was co-founder of the legendary “Patio de María” in the late 1980s, and it was active until 1990. In 1979, a three-day music festival called Havana Jam '79 took place at the Karl Marx Theater, in Havana, Cuba, where a group of rock artists that included Billy Joel and Stephen Stills performed. =The 1980s and 90s= In the 1980s, a heavy metal band called Venus was formed by Roberto Armada in Playa, Havana. They achieved much success and created a headbanger following among the Cuban youth. Punk rock was introduced in Cuba in the late 1980s and gained a cult-type following among a minority of the youth. In 1982 Nilo Nunez formed the rock band called Rhodas in Camaguey. The band had a huge following as well as a number one hit with \\"Es Amor\\". Rhodas were active in Cuba until 1996 when they left Cuba for Spain. See A Traves De Los Obstaculos by Nilo Nunez and Parche by Humberto Manduley, Enciclopedia del Rock en Cuba. During the nineties, rock and roll in Cuba was still an underground phenomenon. In Havana, the Ciudad de La Habana radio station presented several programs showing the most recent tendencies on that type of music around the world. Juan Camacho, an old musician and radio host had a morning program called Disco Ciudad. El programa de Ramón was also a successful radio show. Some bands from that period were: Gens, Zeus and Los Tarsons. Despite being perceived as a small underground scene due to official disapproval by the state, Cuban rock since the late 1990s has become a larger phenomenon, with groups such as Burbles, Moneda Dura and Los Kent with Jorge Martínez gaining a new dimension with their guitar performance, more polished sound and musical lead, which broadened their audience. These bands performed rock music on Cuban TV, as well as in concerts and festivals; and since then, the profile of rock music has risen in the island. =The 21st century= The sleeve for the Manic Street Preachers single \\"The Masses Against the Classes\\" featured an amended version of the Cuban flag In 2001, the Welsh group Manic Street Preachers was invited to perform in Cuba, and Fidel Castro attended its concert along with other government authorities. In 2004, Castro gave a speech honoring the Birthday of John Lennon, whose music, as a member of the Beatles and as a soloist was banned in Cuba for a very long time. A bronze statue of Lennon was placed in a well known Havana park, which is now known as John Lennon Park. At the same time that the government was showing a more indulgent attitude toward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which purpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and investments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an inflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the case of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, Águila was arrested under charges of dangerousness, a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they think are likely to commit crimes; even when they have not yet committed them.Cuba punk rocker spared jail term. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7589405.stmGorki Águila, leader of the Cuban rock band Porno para Ricardo More recently, Rick Wakeman, Sepultura and Audioslave performed in Havana, and The Rolling Stones offered a historic concert that has become the most outstanding rock event since the beginning of the Revolutionary period in 1959. Their concert was commemorated in the film Havana Moon. A new phenomenon occurred in 2013 when several Cuban metal bands begin to emigrate to the United States, creating a parallel scene with the bands Agonizer, Escape, Ancestor, Hipnosis, Suffering Tool and Chlover.\\"¡Libertad!\\": Cuban Metal Bands Get Their First Taste Of Freedom\\".

The Chitlin' Circuit was considered to be by, for, and about black people. Topics of plays were often farcical and over-dramatic. There is debate as to when the Chitlin' Circuit peaked. Some say its peak was in the 1930s, some say it was after World War II, and others say it was the time of the blues.Stober, Karl H. \\"The Chitlin Circuit Revisited.\\" Cadence Magazine, the Independent Journal of Creative Improvised Music, October 2014: 61–4. ProQuest. September 20, 2018 .  Terminology  The name derives from the soul food dish chitterlings (stewed pig intestines). It is also a play on the term \\"Borscht Belt\\", which referred to particular resort venues (primarily in New York State's Catskill Mountains) that were popular with Jewish performers and audiences during the 1940s through the 1960s.Frederick Douglass Opie, Hog and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America (Columbia University Press 2008), Chapter 7. Chitterlings are part of the culinary history of African Americans, who were often limited to the intestines of the pig to eat as opposed to the bacon or ham. The food symbolizes acquiring a taste out of necessity and eventually coming to like it. The term \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" did not appear in print until a 1972 article on Ike & Tina Turner in The Chicago Defender. However, the slang term \\"Chitlin'\\" was used long before it was printed. Blues musician W.C. Handy wrote of chitlin' cafes in his 1917 song \\"Beale Street Blues\\". In the 21st century, the term is applied to the venues, especially in the South, where contemporary African-American blues singers such as Bobby Rush, Denise LaSalle, and O.B. Buchana continue to appear regularly. = Contemporary use = Ebony magazine prefers the term \\"urban theater circuit\\" for recent work like that of playwright and actor Tyler Perry. In a January 2004 interview with Perry, the genre's leading practitioner, Ebony wrote that his work marked \\"a new chapter in the urban theater circuit as a whole—a genre that has been dogged by criticism from some Blacks in the traditional theater. Perry, as the most visibly recognized player in the circuit, has felt the brunt of this criticism.\\" \\"They say that Tyler Perry has set the Black race back some 500 years with these types of \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" shows. The problem with the naysayers is that they don't take the opportunity to see my shows,' Perry argued. \\"With my shows, I try to build a bridge that marries what's deemed 'legitimate theater' and so-called 'chitlin' circuit theater,' and I think I've done pretty well with that, in bringing people in to enjoy a more elevated level of theater.'\\" Origins Leading figures in establishing the Chitlin' Circuit were the black Indianapolis entrepreneurs Sea and Denver D. Ferguson. After the collapse of the Theatre Owners Booking Association (TOBA) in 1930, the Ferguson brothers drew on bandleader and influential columnist Walter Barnes and his contacts to bring top black entertainers to Indianapolis in the 1930s. When their businesses' licenses were revoked in 1940, they opened Ferguson Brothers, a booking agency, which grew rapidly and became the most powerful black-owned talent agency in the country. They helped various orchestras, bands, and vaudeville shows book gigs, including Jay McShann, King Kolax, Tiny Bradshaw, Roosevelt Sykes, Claude Trenier, the Bama State Collegians, Carolina Cotton Pickers, Snookum Russell, Milton Larkin, Clarence Love, Gene Pope, and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, and organised tours around the South playing to black audiences.

The centre of the town is historically significant and is protected by law as Urban monument zone. History Formerly known as a Market Community Lešno, the first written mention of the place comes from a 1320 document. The town obtained the right of beer-brewing prior to this 1320 document. In the 14th century it became known as Dobruška, a seat of Church administration. In 1495, with arrival of Noble Family of Trčka of Lípa, the town started to develop. The centre of the town gained its present appearance in Neo-Gothic style after a large fire broke out on October 7, 1866, which was painted by Alois Beer (1833–1897). The town of Dobruška is known mainly because of the Czech patriotic writer František Ladislav Hek, whose career was described in Alois Jirásek's novel entitled F. L.

This would be the final game in the NCAA Football series to be released for the Nintendo GameCube. GameplayHome-field advantage= The main focus of NCAA Football 2005 is home-field advantage. While playing at home is an advantage in any sport, amateur or professional (especially in the playoffs), some say the concept of home-field advantage matters most in college football. Hence, the major addition to the 2005 game is the \\"Top 25 Toughest Places to Play,\\" compiled by EA Sports. These rankings are based on home winning percentage, average attendance, and \\"atmosphere\\" (i.e., fan rowdiness and noise). Players with the home field advantage on defense can increase the crowd's volume before the snap by repeatedly pressing a certain button on the controller, depending on the system. Likewise, the player with the home field advantage on offense can quiet the crowd with one press of the same button. Crowd noise may affect the quarterback's ability to get an audible across to his other players. If the noise is sufficient, when the quarterback tries to call an audible, one of his teammates will come down to him and gesture that he can't understand him.

David Mercer circa 1963  Early life  Mercer was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England, the son of an engine driver while his mother had been a domestic servant. Both of his grandfathers had been miners. After failing to gain entry to the local grammar school, Mercer left school at 14, worked as a laboratory technician and in the Merchant Navy before attending university. After attending courses at Wakefield Technical College he matriculated at University College, Durham to study chemistry, but eventually grew bored of this and switched to studying art at King's College Newcastle – which was then part of Durham University. Just after graduation he married Jitke Sigmund, a Czechoslovakian refugee who was studying Economics at King's. Her father had been killed by the Gestapo. With his wife, he spent a year in Paris living with emigres from Communist regimes, where he attempted to become a painter. On realising he was not cut out to be a painter, he burnt all of his canvasses and turned to writing instead. In late 1957, now separated and living with Dilys Johnson (whom he later married), he rented a room in a flat at 10 Compayne Gardens, London NW6, that was rented, in turn, by the poet Jon Silkin from Rudolf Nassauer (a wine merchant, poet, and novelist) and his wife, Bernice Rubens, who was later recipient of the 1970 Booker Prize. The historical novelist Malcolm Macdonald, then a student at the Slade, was another of Silkin's tenants at that time. At this location, Mercer wrote a more political novel whose acerbic Northern hero, Congo Booth, was an early prototype of many disaffected-marxist heroes in his television plays. Neither novel was ever published. All three – Silkin, Mercer, and Macdonald – earned a living teaching English as a Foreign Language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford St. Mercer later taught English and Science at the Hairdressers College until his television and stage earnings enabled him to write full-time. Writing career Much of Mercer's television work for the BBC was made in collaboration with the director Don Taylor. This dated from the beginning of Mercer's career as a television dramatist with the play trilogy, The Generations, an attempt to depict the decline of an idealistic form of socialism over 60 years through the members of three generations of one family. This was composed of Where the Difference Begins (1961), a tale about two brothers, one who has abandoned socialism, while the other is a Labour Party intellectual; A Climate of Fear (1962) a piece in which a scientist in Britain's nuclear programme discovers his children have joined CND; and the non-naturalistic The Birth of a Private Man (1963), an account of an activists disenchantment with protest who attempts to match left-wing attitudes with the emerging 'affluent' society. The hero of the last play dies at the Berlin Wall facing a stream of bullets from both east and west. A Way of Living (1963) was a naturalistic piece, and dealt with the division between a young fisherman and a girl from a mining family who is about to go to university. Three other television plays from this period – A Suitable Case for Treatment (1962, film adaptation: Morgan, 1966), For Tea on Sunday (1963) and In Two Minds (1967) share a concern with madness or, in the critic John Russell Taylor's words, \\"social alienation expressed in terms of psychological alienation\\".John Russell Taylor The Second Wave, London: Eyre Methuen, 1978 reprint, p. 42 In Two Minds, directed by Ken Loach, was remade as the feature film Family Life (1971), again directed by Loach. Morgan won a British Film Academy Award for Best Screenplay. Mercer's first play to be written for the stage, Ride a Cock Horse, was seen in the West End in a 1965 production starring Peter O'Toole. An early work, the one-act The Governor's Lady, in which an elderly colonial governor gradually turns into a gorilla, was originally written for radio in 1960 but not performed until it was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1965. The RSC later premiered many of Mercer's works, including his next play Belcher's Luck (1966), \\"a wild tragi- comedy full of Lawrentian symbolism about fertility and impotence\\".John Russell Taylor Anger & After, Methuen University Paperbacks edition, 1969, p. 316 The RSC staged it at the Aldwych Theatre, as they did After Haggerty (1970); the father in the later is an engine driver, like Mercer's own father. The Comedy Flint (1970) was first performed at the Criterion with Michael Hordern in the lead as a parson who believes he could not have survived \\"without a complete lack of faith\\", his sermons being \\"a form of bewildering interior monologue\\", Other plays for television broadcast in the 1960s are And Did Those Feet (1965), The Parachute (1968) and Let's Murder Vivaldi (1968)John Russell Taylor Anger & After, Methuen University Paperbacks edition, 1969, pp. 314–6 and another trilogy, comprising On the Eve of Publication (1969), The Cellar and the Almond Tree (1970) and Emma's Time (1970). The content of this body of work made John Russell Taylor regard Mercer as the most political of British dramatists of this period.John Russell Taylor The Second Wave, Eyre Methuen, 1978 reprint, p. 36 Let's Murder Vivaldi, which originated in the BBC's Wednesday Play series, received a stage production at the King's Head theatre club in 1972. In 1970, Mercer contributed White Poem – a monologue for a white Rhodesian racialist – to a Sharpeville massacre commemoration.John Russell Taylor The Second Wave, Eyre Methuen, 1978 reprint, p. 56 Mercer wrote the screenplay for the Alain Resnais film Providence (1977), in which John Gielgud portrays an elderly, dying writer. The film won a César Award. Private life In 1967, Mercer met a German actress, Maria Machado with whom he later had his first child, Maya Mercer. A long-term heavy drinker, Mercer died after suffering a heart attack in Haifa, Israel, where he was living with his Israeli wife Dafna and their daughter Rebecca.  As fictional character  Mercer is depicted as Malcolm Sloman in the Trevor Griffiths play The Party (1973). In 1982, The Arcata Promise, a stage adaptation of the 1974 television play, was produced by Brockman Seawell and premiered in New York in 1982, starring Brian Murray.https://www.nytimes.com/theater/stage-arcata-promise-study-of-a- psychopathic-actor.html, Mel Gussow, The New York Times, 4 June 1982.

The spelling varies between Zodac and Zodak in different sources (until the two were later defined as separate characters). In a unique curiosity of the Masters of the Universe franchise, portrayals of Zodac vary considerably from medium to medium since the franchise began in the 1980s, leaving many confused over the character. The fact that in the original line and accompanying animated series's run, the character was very seldom used, added to the mystery surrounding him even further. The general representation of Zodac is that he is a neutral character, a cosmic enforcer who participates little in conflict but can aid either the heroic or evil sides in their hour of need. However, the original 8-back release of the figure has his title as \\"Cosmic Enforcer\\", and in later re-release it was changed to \\"Evil Cosmic Enforcer\\", and this representation filtered through to a few other versions of the franchise. The design and character of Zodac is heavily influenced by the New God, Metron, created by Jack Kirby for his Fourth World comic series. Fictional character biographyPre-cartoon era= Zodac was one of the first characters to be conceived by Mattel in the development of the Masters of the Universe toy line, and was released in 1982. Created by Mark Taylor. Mattel's original idea was to have two female action figures Sorceress and Teela. But a later change had Mattel only release one figure Teela, with the ability to change her armor on and off to be used as different characters. So Zodac was last-minute addition. Original B-sheet design by Mark Taylor describes Zodac (with early name Sensor): \\"Sensor: Man of the Future. Scientifically heightened senses, knowledge & weapons. Acts in support roll [sic] to He-Man and as a foil to Tee la's mystic nature.\\" His action figure is tagged as a 'Cosmic Enforcer' and his action figure, despite being generally human in appearance, was given claw-like feet and hands, a standard trait of the line's evil characters. Original 8-back packaging also describes him as \\"Cosmic Encorcer\\" which appears in promotional toy-adverts and mini-comic crossell inner art. The character was originally to be named Sensor, and was always intended to have the \\"evil\\" limbs. Early Mattel 1981 Licensing Kit has Zodac described as \\"The Cosmic Enforcer. The bounty hunter of our exciting universe.\\" Many characters don't have a clear good/evil connotation, though same Licensing Kit described Stratos as \\"a villain soaring on the Wings of Wickedness.\\" Later when Zodac was re-released in the vintage line, his title was changed as \\"Evil Cosmic Enforcer\\", putting him in the villain side and thus balancing out the character numbers of heroes and villains. He does not appear in any of the toys' accompanying minicomics, leaving many kids unsure of the exact nature of his character or what role he was supposed to play in the story. The description on the back of his toy card read \\"Zodac attacks the Heroic Warriors with all the evil power at his command\\", an ambiguous description, which one can interpret as signifying either a generic Evil Warrior, or a universal enforcer of evil who somehow epitomized all evil power. The mystery surrounding Zodac is heavily exacerbated by his use in the DC Comics, which features him acting as a neutral character who seemingly oversees the whole conflict and serves to maintain balance between the two sides of good and evil, ensuring when he can, that both sides get their way, and helping either side when they need it. As a watcher of the universe, he naturally knows that Prince Adam is He-Man. Although he does not appear in any of the regular minicomics, he appears in the book and record that comes with the Point Dread & Talon Fighter playset, which also presents him in such a neutral role. However, as this playset was less commonly owned than the standard figures, many fans never saw this appearance and thus were still confused. It is often believed that this \\"neutral\\" role was Mattel's original concept behind Zodac, and the labelling of him as 'Evil' was done purely to even out the evil figures against the heroic, or that he was classed as an Evil Warrior simply because the 'Heroic' and 'Evil' groupings on the boxes did not have a 'Neutral' category, but Mattel has never confirmed this. Filmation era In He-Man and the Masters of the Universe by Filmation, Zodac appears in three episodes of the show's first season: \\"Quest for He-Man\\", \\"The Search\\" and \\"Golden Disks of Knowledge\\". The show's portrayal of the character is generally in keeping with that of the DC Comics, although it is clear in the cartoon that he leans more towards the side of good and serves essentially to help maintain peace within the universe. As the cartoon never shows him acting on the side of evil, and he never shares any scenes with Skeletor, many viewers of the show perceive him as one of the good guys, even though this is not entirely true. It is his portrayal on the cartoon that heightened the confusion over the character, as viewers of the show who saw him as a good guy were perplexed when they went out to buy his figure. In the cartoon he is presented as an all-powerful character who sees and understands all. The most important of his three episodes is \\"The Search\\", in which he sends He-Man out on a quest to prevent Skeletor from reaching the Star Seed, a powerful object that will give him control over the whole universe. A twist ending reveals that Zodac set up the whole affair, telling Skeletor of the Star Seed and sending He-Man to defend it, in a test of He-Man's ability to resist the temptation of using the Star Seed's power for himself. The episode \\"Golden Disks of Knowledge\\", meanwhile, reveals that Zodac is the last remaining member of the Council of the Wise, often referred to as \\"The Council of Elders\\", a universal council of knowledge and wisdom keepers. It is revealed that Skeletor achieved most of his power after he stole the Golden Disks from the Council of the Wise after corrupting another of its members, Zanthor, into selling them to him. The end of the episode features the reformed Zanthor donning a uniform like Zodac's and leaving for the stars together with him to watch over the universe. The series bible delves more into the history of Zodac, telling us that not only was Zodac a member of the Council of Elders, he was also the leader, and the only member to retain his human form after the Council became the spirit of Grayskull. He then vowed to sail the universe, keeping watch over Eternia but not interfering in the natural course of events. In the 1980s cartoon, Zodac hosted the closing moral/PSA segment for two of the episodes he appears in: \\"Quest for He-Man\\" and \\"The Search\\". Being a duty widely considered suitable only for the \\"good\\" characters, this reinforces the notion of Zodac's default alignment being benevolent. Other media Other media to produce Masters of the Universe stories throughout the 1980s took radically differing approaches to the character of Zodac. Some storybooks, most notably the UK Ladybird Books, portray him as a wholly evil character in servitude to Skeletor. In this storybook series he is portrayed as just another of Skeletor's bumbling henchmen, the complete opposite of the noble deity-like figure of the cartoon series. Several other books and comic series portray him as a fully heroic character, while others are more in-keeping with the DC Comics and Filmation's portrayals. 2002 series When Zodak featured in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe franchise, Masters of the Universe vs. The Snake Men, complexities arose in updating the character for a modern audience. Indeed, toy sculptors the Four Horsemen originally planned a radical change for the character by making him a strange alien creature rather than a human, in an apparent effort to enhance the view of him as a universal watcher. However, when Mattel demanded racial diversity in the toy line, the Four Horsemen looked to change skin colours and, after firstly considering Stratos, but deciding that Stratos' overall design did not go well with the racial change, Zodak was chosen. Just as in the original line, the Zodak figure appears as a brown or bronze-skinned character and slightly darker than the action figure; for the new toyline, tribal markings were added to his arms and forehead. As Ian Richter of Mattel worked on developments for the cartoon's storyline with Mike Young Productions, it was decided to link Zodak to the planned story line for season 2, dealing with the resurrection of the Snake Men. Although Zodak had no connection with the Snake Men in the old continuity, in the new series his whole role in the show revolves around them. Zodak appears in this series as an all-powerful and immortal warrior from Ancient times, presumably the most powerful warrior on Eternia in the present time. Having aided the Elders in the defeat of the Snake Men centuries ago, Zodak is called upon in the episode \\"Snake Pit\\" to help prevent the Snake Men from being released from their ancient prison. It is revealed in this episode that Zodak harbors a centuries-old grudge against the Snake Men after King Hiss ate his brother, Zeelahr. Presumably it was his brother's murder that convinced Zodak to give up his mortality. Zodak resides in a small wooden temple in the Mystic Mountains, where he spends most of his time in deep meditation. He refuses to let his grudge against the Snake Men die and will do everything he can until King Hiss has perished. Although this inevitably involves him aiding He-Man and the Masters from time to time, he has pledged no alliance and refuses to officially side with anyone in the battle, abiding purely by his own sense of right and wrong with little consideration for others. In season 2 it is Zodak who allows the Snake Men to be freed, placing Eternia in danger, for the sake of achieving his own revenge, which leads to a conflict between him and He-Man in the \\"Rise of the Snake Men\\" 2-parter. Zodak returns in the final episode of the series, \\"Awaken the Serpent\\", in which he finally defeats King Hiss. During this episode Zodak finds an unconscious Prince Adam and upon awakening him Zodak hands Prince Adam the Power Sword stating, \\"He-Man is needed.\\" Prince Adam proceeds to turn into He-Man but right before holding aloft the Power Sword asks Zodak, \\"Could you at least turn your back?\\" The whole series ends with a shot of Zodak flying off into the sky in his chair, as He-Man thanks him for winning the conflict against the Snake Men.  Masters of the universe classics era  Also to note is the exact spelling - in the later Masters of the Universe Classics line, Zodac and Zodak would become two different characters, while in the original line both spellings were used for the same character. The front of the box spelled the name 'Zodac' and backside, while some mini-comics listings later for the figure spelled it 'Zodak'. The 2009 Zodac action figure establishes that his real name in this canon is Zodac Zur. The 2009 Zodak action figure establishes that his real name is Kar-Tor, and that he is the apprentice of the original Zodac. In 2002-era he didn't have \\"real name\\". Live Action He-Man movie Zodac will appear in the Live Action He-Man movie. In the film, Zodak is King Randor’s Minister of Technology and his right hand man.

It has around 5,800 inhabitants. It is away from the city of Hradec Králové. The town is situated beneath the hill Oreb. Třebechovice is best known for its Nativity Museum. History The town was founded in the 14th century, near a trade route. According to legend, the town was founded on the right bank of the river Dědina by Třeboch who brought his people there and gave the name to the town. In the 14th century the town was owned by Hynek Hlaváč of Dubé and his descendants until the end of the 15th century when Přibík Kroměším of Březovice became an owner. The town was owned by Trčkové of Lípa in the 16th century and it economically developed. In 1849, Třebechovice became an independent town.Třebechovice Nativity Museum The museum was founded in 1925 by Vilém Koleš. There are more than 400 exhibits of nativities. The museum is the only one of its kind in the Czech Republic. The most valuable exhibit is Probošt's Nativity which was made by Josef Probošt and it is all created from wood. The Nativity has motion mechanism and it is long, deep and high and has more than two thousand carved pieces and 373 figures. Coat of arms The emblem is created by golden shield with one vertical brown branch and roots. This comes from emblem of the Dubé family who established the town. There are three blue cannonballs on both sides of the emblem. There is a golden crown on the top of the emblem which means sovereign grace, above it there are three ostrich feathers in red, white and blue. Oreb Oreb is a hill above the town and it is high. The hill got its name after the large gathering of members of the Hussites in 1419. In 1528 a small wooden church at the owner's command was built here. This church burned and was replaced by new one in 1835. The new church is called Church of Corpus Christi.Třebechovice Notable people *Jan Theobald Held (1770–1851), physician, educator and composer *Jan Doležal (born 1996), decathlete Twin towns – sister cities Třebechovice pod Orebem is twinned with: * Bethlehem, Palestine Gallery File:Kostel Božího Těla na Orebu.jpgCorpus Christi Church on the top of the Oreb hill File:Třebechovice - kostel Svatého Ondřeje.jpgSt Andrew's church File:Třebechovice - socha Nejsvětější Trojice.jpgStatue of Trinity at the town square File:Třebechovice pod Orebem from air K2 -1.jpgAerial view ReferencesBibliography Team of authors (2004): Třebechovice pod Orebem.

Biography The group formed while its members attended the Edinburgh College of Art. After playing a supposed one off gig of Northern Soul covers for a friend's birthday party they began to write their own material and settled into a lineup of Tommy Stuart (vocals/synths), Steven McGregor (synths/vocals), Drew McFadyen (guitar/vocals) and Casey Miller (drums). Incorporating elements of Krautrock, electro and noise music they combine vintage analogue synthesizers with distorted guitar and the aggression of punk creating a sound described by the NME as, \\"a wonder to behold... synth-punk sass in excelsis; a tangle of disco and hysterical sloganeering that sounds, precisely, like Nobody Else Ever\\". They soon gained a reputation as both a riotously exciting and volatile live act. They recorded their first EP Kids Now at their own M-Bunker studio which was released on German label Erkrankung Durch Musique in 2001. This led to the group's first tour overseas visiting Germany, Austria and Switzerland and a series of supports with established alternative bands visiting Scotland such as Stereolab, Broadcast, Trans Am and Enon. After the release of 2003's more electronic based 4 Claws Of The Underground EP on Scandinavia Records, the band recorded their self titled debut album. Now recording for KFM Records the sessions took place at The Diving Bell Lounge Studio in Glasgow. Released in early 2004, the album was generally well received and gained airplay from the likes of Vic Galloway, Stuart Maconie and the late John Peel. That same year the band were invited to Austin, Texas to play at the SXSW Music Festival and supported The Beta Band on their final UK tour. The group have also recorded various live radio sessions, including for BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio Scotland and featured on the BBC Radio 3 programme Mixing It about experimental music in Scotland. In 2005 the band entered Metway Studio in Brighton and recorded three tracks with producer Damien Taylor which would eventually be on the band's second album Year Of Explorers. In 2006 they went on their most extensive tour to date, supporting fellow Scots Mogwai on their European tour. Following this, work was completed on Year Of Explorers at Castle of Doom Studios with Mogwais' John Cummings producing. The album was preceded by the Ring Ring EP in May 2007 before its August release.

T. Hamlin, created the popular, long-run comic strip Alley Oop, syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association.  Biography  Early life = Born in Perry, Iowa to Erma Trout Hamlin and Dr. Frederick Clarence Hamlin, a dentist. Vincent began drawing at an early age; he first drew the character that became Alley Oop at age 11. Four years later, his first cartoons were published in the Perry Daily Chief. At Perry High School, he went by the nickname Snick, which he used as his signature on cartoons he drew for his high school yearbook, The Eclipse. = World War I = Lying about his age, Hamlin enlisted in the Army at 17 to fight in World War I. He shipped out as part of the Sixth Army's Motor Transport Group, arriving in France where he served with the American Expeditionary Forces in 1918. Recovering from a poison gas attack in France, Hamlin began illustrating the letters of fellow soldiers, and a newspaper man he met in the Army convinced him he could make a living from his art abilities.University of Missouri: V.T. Hamlin CollectionStiles, Steve. \\"The Man Who Walked with Dinosaurs\\", Collecting Channel. =After World War I= After his discharge, Hamlin returned to Perry High School in 1919. He then attended college, first a term at the University of Missouri in 1920, followed by studying journalism at Drake University in 1922. His college experiences ended after a quarrel with an art teacher, as he recalled: \\"Then the teacher took out my drawing and she stood up with it before the class and announced: 'Now here's a man with a wonderful talent and he wants to waste it on being a cartoonist!'\\" He traveled around the US, working at various jobs as a sign painter, animator, window dresser, card writer, movie projectionist and semi-professional boxer. After employment in 1922 as a journalist at the Des Moines News, Hamlin worked for the Texas Grubstakers newspaper and the Fort Worth Record. His income in 1922 was $910. By 1923, he was a staff photographer, cartoonist and writer at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, where he created his first comic strip, The Hired Hand, and a sports feature, The Panther Kitten. Cartoonist Steve Stiles noted: > The job only lasted a year. It was the Prohibition era and Hamlin and a > friend were discovered using the paper's engraving equipment to make > counterfeit labels for bootleg whiskey bottles. Hamlin moved on to doing art > for an oil industry publication and one day, while wandering through the > desolate landscape of the oil fields, began musing about the dinosaurs who > had once roamed through the very same territory. Hamlin also acquired a > lifelong interest in paleontology through conversations with geologist > acquaintances. On December 24, 1926, he married high-school sweetheart Dorothy Stapleton, who became the model for the character Ooola in Alley Oop. Their daughter Theodora was born in 1927, followed by their son Jon in 1936. In 1928, he worked as a photographer for the Houston Press. When the oil industry magazine went defunct, the Hamlins returned to Perry, Iowa in 1930.Alley Oop: 75 Years of the Comic World of V. T. HamlinThe Cartoonists: V.T. Hamlin V. T. Hamlin's Alley Oop (March 19, 1946). Oop and Ooola time travel to a post-World War II party. =Alley Oop begins= In Perry, Hamlin thought about those dinosaurs, and started drawing a comic strip titled The Mighty Oop. He was not pleased with his creation, and destroyed it. A year later, he tried again, submitting Alley Oop to a small syndicate, Bonnet-Brown, which launched the strip as a daily, beginning December 5, 1932. A few months later, Bonnet-Brown collapsed, bringing the strip to an end. NEA picked it up, and it started again on August 7, 1933. Success led to a Sunday strip, added on September 9, 1934. Dorothy Hamlin also worked on the strip, creating color roughs and contributing story ideas, including the important plot device of time travel, introduced April 5, 1939. Hamlin wrote and drew Alley Oop with the help of, Dave Graue, until his retirement in 1971. When Hamlin retired because of failing eyesight, Graue took over full-time. Graue had been assisting Hamlin since 1950, and he had been doing the daily solo since 1966, although it was co-signed by Hamlin. The last daily signed by Hamlin appeared December 31, 1972, and his last signed Sunday strip was April 1, 1973. From his studio in North Carolina, Graue wrote and drew the strip through the 1970s and 1980s until Jack Bender took over as illustrator in 1991. Graue continued to write the strip until his August 2001 retirement. On December 10, 2001, the 75-year-old Graue died in Flat Rock, North Carolina in a traffic collision. The current Alley Oop Sunday and daily strips are drawn by Jack Bender and written by his wife Carole Bender. = Later life and death = The Hamlins moved to Sarasota, Florida, after his retirement. He wrote his autobiography, The Man Who Walked with Dinosaurs and a novel The Devil's Daughter. Four Rivers is his fishing memoir. Dorothy Hamlin died in 1985, and V. T Hamlin died in Brooksville, Florida, in 1993 at the age of 93. Archives Theodora Hamlin Dewalt donated the V.T. Hamlin Collection to the University of Missouri-Columbia Libraries on December 22, 1990. It includes 126 original cartoons and 436 personal and career photographs, along with newspaper and journal articles about Hamlin's work, contracts and correspondence with Newspaper Enterprise Association, personal and family papers, correspondence and memorabilia.

Introduced in 1972, it remains in service but has been superseded by the SS-N-22 Sunburn. Development The Echo class submarine required the submarine to spend 30 minutes or more on the surface when firing its P-5 Pyatyorka (SS-N-3A 'Shaddock') missiles. This made the submarine very vulnerable to enemy attack, so in 1963 the Soviets started work on a new missile that could be fired whilst submerged, and a submarine to carry it. These became the P-50 Malakhit and Charlie class submarine. The P-50 was replaced by the P-120 design during development. However, problems in development meant that the twelve Charlie I submarines were built with the shorter-ranged P-70 Ametist (SS-N-7 'Starbright', an evolution of the SS-N-2C 'Styx') as a stopgap before the introduction of the P-120 Malakhit on the Charlie II. The P-120 missile was later used as the basis for the SS-N-14 Silex rocket-propelled torpedo. Design The L band seeker and radar altimeter originally designed for the 'Siren' were first used on the 'Starbright' whilst the Soviets sorted out the P-120's troublesome engines. However the 'Siren' has space for datalink equipment, allowing mid-course guidance from the launch platform or something else. When fired from a submarine, the missile can be launched at a maximum depth of 50 meters. Operational history The 'Siren' entered service on corvettes of the Soviet Navy on March 17, 1972. It would be installed on Nanuchka-class corvettes. About 500 missiles were produced. It was not until November 1977 that it was accepted for use on submarines. The Charlie-II submarine carried eight missiles (of which two usually carried nuclear warheads). It saw action in 2008 in the hands of the Russian Black Sea Fleet during the action off Abkhazia, where it was used successfully against the Georgian Navy.

It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN on account of its wide distribution, its large population, and its presence in a number of protected areas. It is superficially similar to the pine marten, but differs from it by its smaller size and habitat preferences. While the pine marten is a forest specialist, the beech marten is a more generalist and adaptable species, occurring in a number of open and forest habitats. Evolution Its most likely ancestor is Martes vetus, which also gave rise to the pine marten. The earliest M. vetus fossils were found in deposits dated to the Würm glaciation in Lebanon and Israel. The beech marten likely originated in the Near East or southwestern Asia, and may have arrived in Europe by the Late Pleistocene or the early Holocene. Thus, the beech marten differs from most other European mustelids of the Quaternary, as all other species (save for the European mink) appeared during the Middle Pleistocene. Comparisons between fossil animals and their descendants indicate that the beech marten underwent a decrease in size beginning in the Würm period. Beech martens indigenous to the Aegean Islands represent a relic population with primitive Asiatic affinities.Schreiber, A. On the status of Martes foina bunites Bate, 1905 . 1999, Small Carnivore Conservation 20: 20-21 The skull of the beech marten suggests a higher adaptation than the pine marten toward hypercarnivory, as indicated by its smaller head, shorter snout and its narrower post-orbital constriction and lesser emphasis on cheek teeth. Selective pressures must have acted to increase the beech marten's bite force at the expense of gape. These traits probably acted on male beech martens as a mechanism to avoid both intraspecific competition with females and interspecific competition with the ecologically overlapping pine marten.Anna Loy, Ornella Spinosi & Rossella Carlini (2004): Cranial morphology of Martes foina and M. martes (Mammalia, Carnivora, Mustelidae): The role of size and shape in sexual dimorphism and interspecific differentiation, Italian Journal of Zoology, 71:1, 27-34 =Subspecies= , eleven subspecies are recognised. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" width=80% font=90% - style=\\"background: #115a6c\\" !Subspecies !Trinomial authority !Description !Range !Synonyms ---- European beech marten Martes f. foina (Nominate subspecies) 150 px Erxleben, 1777 A small subspecies, with an average-sized skull.

Its nose is also of a light peach or grey colour, whereas that of the pine marten is dark black or greyish-black. Its feet are not as densely furred as those of the pine marten, thus making them look less broad, with the paw pads remaining visible even in winter. Because of its shorter limbs, the beech marten's manner of locomotion differs from that of the pine marten; the beech marten moves by creeping in a polecat-like manner, whereas the pine marten and sable move by bounds. The load per 1 cm2 of the supporting surface of the beech marten's foot (30.9 g) is double that of the pine marten (15.2 g), thus it is obliged to avoid snowy regions. Its skull is similar to that of the pine marten, but differs in its shorter facial region, more convex profile, its larger carnassials and smaller molars. The beech marten's penis is larger than the pine marten's, with the bacula of young beech martens often outsizing those of old pine martens. Males measure 430–590 mm in body length, while females measure 380–470 mm. The tail measures 250–320 mm in males and 230–275 mm in females. Males weigh 1.7–1.8 kg in winter and 2–2.1 kg in summer, while females weigh 1.1–1.3 kg in winter and 1.4–1.5 kg in summer. The beech marten's fur is coarser than the pine marten's, with elastic guard hairs and less dense underfur. Its summer coat is short, sparse and coarse, and the tail is sparsely furred. The colour tone is lighter than the pine marten's. Unlike the pine marten, its underfur is whitish, rather than greyish. The tail is dark-brown, while the back is darker than that of the pine marten. The throat patch of the beech marten is always white. The patch is large and generally has two projections extending backwards to the base of the forelegs and upward on the legs. The dark colour of the belly juts out between the forelegs as a line into the white colour of the chest and sometimes into the neck. In the pine marten, by contrast, the white colour between the forelegs juts backwards as a protrusion into the belly colour. Behaviour A litter of beech marten kits in а farm outbuilding in the village of Orlintzi, Bulgaria Beech marten fighting a European otter, as illustrated in Brehm's Life of Animals The beech marten is mainly a crepuscular and nocturnal animal, though to a much lesser extent than the European polecat. It is especially active during moonlit nights. Being a more terrestrial animal than the pine marten, the beech marten is less arboreal in its habits, though it can be a skilled climber in heavily forested areas. It is a skilled swimmer, and may occasionally be active during daytime hours, particularly in the summer, when nights are short. It typically hunts on the ground. During heavy snowfalls, the beech marten moves through paths made by hares or skis. =Social and territorial behaviours= In an area of northeastern Spain, where the beech marten still lives in relatively unmodified habitats, one specimen was recorded to have had a home range of with two centres of activity. Its period of maximum activity occurred between 6 PM and midnight. Between 9 AM and 6 PM, the animal was found to be largely inactive.López-Martín, J.M., Ruiz-Olmo, J. & Cahill, S. 1992. Autumn home range and activity of a Stone Marten ( Martes foina Erxleben, 1777) in Northeastern Spain. Misc. Zool. 16: 258–260. In urban areas, beech marten's dens are almost entirely in buildings, particularly during winter.Herra, J., Schley, L., Engel, E. & Roper, T. J. ; Den preferences and denning behaviour in urban stone martens (Martes foina), Mammalian Biology — Zeitschrift fur Saugetierkunde Volume 75, Issue 2, March 2010, Pages 138-145 The beech marten does not dig burrows, nor does it occupy those of other animals. Instead, it nests in naturally occurring fissures and clefts in rocks, spaces between stones in rock slides and inhabited or uninhabited stone structures. It may live in tree holes at a height of up to 9 metres. =Reproduction and development= Estrus and copulation occur at the same time as in the pine marten. Copulation can last longer than 1 hour.Lodé, T. \\"Conspecific recognition and mating in stone marten Martes foina.\\" Acta Theriologica 36.3-4 (1991): 275-283. Mating occurs in the June–July period, and takes place in the morning or in moonlit nights on the ground or on the roofs of houses. The gestation period lasts as long as the pine marten's, lasting 236–237 days in the wild, and 254–275 days in fur farms. Parturition takes place in late March-early April, with the average litter consisting of 3-7 kits. The kits are born blind, and begin to see at the age of 30–36 days. The lactation period lasts 40–45 days. In early July, the young are indistinguishable from the adults. =Diet= The beech marten's diet includes a much higher quantity of plant food than that of the pine marten and sable. Plant foods eaten by the beech marten include cherries, apples, pears, plums, black nightshade, tomatoes, grapes, raspberries and mountain ash. Plant food typically predominates during the winter months. Rats, mice and chickens are also eaten. Among bird species preyed upon by the beech marten, sparrow-like birds predominate, though snowcocks and partridges may also be taken. The marten likes to plunder nests of birds including passerines, galliformes and owls, preferring to kill the parents in addition to the fledglings. Although it rarely attacks poultry, some specimens may become specialized poultry raiders, even when wild prey is abundant. Males tend to target large, live prey more than females, who feed on small prey and carrion with greater frequency. =Relationships with other predators= In areas where the beech marten is sympatric with the pine marten, the two species avoid competing with one another by assuming different ecological niches; the pine marten feeds on birds and rodents more frequently, while the beech marten feeds on fruits and insects.Posłuszny, M., Pilot, M., Goszczyński, J. & Gralak, B. 2007: Diet of sympatric pine Marten (Martes martes) and stone marten (Martes foina) identified by genotyping of DNA from faeces.- Ann. Zool. Fennici 44: 269-284 There is however one case of a subadult beech marten being killed by a pine marten. The beech marten has been known to kill European polecats on rare occasions. Red foxes, lynxes and mountain lions may prey on adults, and juveniles are vulnerable from attack by birds of prey and wildcats. There is, however one case, from Germany, of a beech marten killing a domestic cat. Range The beech marten is a widespread species which occurs throughout much of Europe and Central Asia. It occurs from Spain and Portugal in the west, through Central and Southern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, extending as far east as the Altai and Tien Shan mountains and northwest China. Within Europe, the species is absent in the British Isles, Scandinavian peninsula, Finland, Denmark, the northern Baltic and northern European Russia. It occurs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and was recently confirmed to inhabit northern Burma. =Introduction in North America= The beech marten is present in Wisconsin, particularly near the urban centres surrounding Milwaukee. It is also present in several wooded, upland areas in the Kettle Moraine State Forest, and in nearby woodlands of Walworth, Racine, Waukesha and probably Jefferson Counties. North American beech martens are likely descended from feral animals that escaped a private fur farm in Burlington during the 1940s.Long, C.A. 1995. Stone marten (Martes foina) in southeast Wisconsin, U.S.A. Small Carnivore Conservation 13: 14.. They have also been listed as being released or having escaped in 1972. Relationships with humansTameability= British zoologist George Rolleston theorised that the \\"domestic cat\\" of the Ancient Greeks and Romans was in fact the beech marten.Hamilton, Edward (1896) The Wild Cat of Europe, pp. 80-81, London, HR Porter Pioneering marine biologist Jeanne Villepreux-Power kept two tame beech martens. =Hunting and fur use= Although the beech marten is a valuable animal to the fur trade, its pelt is inferior in quality to that of the pine marten and sable. Beech marten skins on the fur markets of the Soviet Union accounted for only 10-12% of the market presence of pine marten skins. Beech martens were caught only in the Caucasus, in the Montane part of Crimea and (in very small numbers) in the rest of Ukraine, and in the republics of Middle Asia. Because animals with more valuable pelts are rare in those areas, the beech marten is of value to hunters on the local market. Beech martens are captured with jaw traps, or, for live capture, with cage traps. The shooting of beech martens is inefficient, and trailing them with dogs is only successful when the animal can be trapped in a tree hollow. =Car damage= Since the mid-1970s, the beech marten has been known to occasionally cause damage to cars. Cars attacked by martens typically have cut tubes and cables. A beech marten can slice through the cables of a starter motor with just one bite. The reason for this is not fully known, as the damaged items are not eaten. There is, however, a seasonal peak in marten attacks on cars in spring, when young martens explore their surroundings more often and have yet to learn which items in their habitat are edible or not.Lachat, N. 1991. Stone martens and cars: a beginning war? Small Carnivore Conservation 5: 4-6 The fishoil often contained in the cables of cars from Japan may contribute to this. =Large Hadron Collider= On 29 April and 21 November 2016, two beech martens shut down the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, by climbing on 18–66 kV electrical transformers located above ground near the LHCb and ALICE experiments, respectively.Sample, Ian (29 April 2016). \\"Large Hadron Collider On Paws After Creature Chews Through Wiring\\", The Guardian.

The closest relatives of this species are the hoary marmot and the Vancouver Island marmot. In 2009, it was declared the official endemic mammal of Washington. This marmot is about the size of a domestic cat, typically weighing about in summer. The species shows the greatest sexual dimorphism found in marmots, with adult males weighing on average 23% more than females. It can be identified by a wide head, small eyes and ears, stubby legs, and a long, bushy tail. Its sharp, rounded claws aid in digging burrows. The coat color changes with the season and with age, but an adult marmot's coat is brown all over with small whiter areas for most of the year. The species has a diet consisting mainly of a variety of meadow flora, including dry grasses, which it also uses as bedding in burrows. It is preyed on by various terrestrial mammals and avian raptors, but its main predator today is the coyote. The Olympic marmot is rated a species of the least concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected by law in the Olympic National Park, which contains most of its habitat. The burrows of this marmot are made in colonies, which are found in various mountain locations and differ in size. A colony may contain as few as one marmot family or multiple families with up to 40 marmots. Olympic marmots are very sociable animals which often engage in play fighting and vocalize four different whistles to communicate. During hibernation beginning in September, they are in a deep sleep and do not eat, causing them to lose half their body mass. Adults emerge in May and their young in June. Female marmots reach sexual maturity at three years of age, and produce litters of 1–6 every other mating season. Taxonomy Clinton Hart Merriam, the first to describe the Olympic marmot American zoologist and ethnographer Clinton Hart Merriam first formally described the Olympic marmot in 1898, as Arctomys olympus, from a specimen he and Vernon Orlando Bailey collected on the Sol Duc River. The genus, Arctomys, is from the Greek for \\"bear-mouse\\". The species name, olympus (Olympic in Greek), was given because this species is native to the Olympic Peninsula. The species now is classified with all other marmots in the genus Marmota. Zoologist R. L. Rausch classified the Olympic marmot as the subspecies olympus of Marmota marmota (he included all North American marmots in this species, which now only includes the Eurasian Alpine marmot) in 1953, but it has usually been treated as a distinct species, a classification supported by taxonomic reviews starting with that of zoologist Robert S. Hoffmann and colleagues in 1979. Within Marmota, the Olympic marmot is grouped with species such as the hoary marmot (M. caligata) in the subgenus Petromarmota. Among this grouping, mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that the Olympic marmot could be the most basal species. The Olympic marmot is thought to have originated during the last glacial period as an isolated relict population of the hoary marmot in the Pleistocene ice-free refugia. The Olympic marmot deviates from the typical Petromarmota marmots in the shape and large size of its mandible (jawbone), in differences of the dorsal (back) region, and having 40 chromosomes instead of 42, all of which are characteristics that resemble the subgenus Marmota. Some of the differences of the Olympic marmot's jawbone from the typical Petramarmota are also evident in the Vancouver Island marmot (M. vancouverensis), which evolved separately, but also occurs in a restricted range with a small population. Description The lighter fur patches characteristic of the Olympic marmot in summertime The Olympic marmot's head is wide with small eyes and ears; the body is stocky with stubby legs and sharp, rounded claws that facilitate digging; the tail is bushy and ranges from long. The Olympic marmot is about the size of a domestic cat; adults typically weigh from and are from in length, with the average being . This species may have the most pronounced sexual dimorphism found in marmots, with adult males weighing on average , post emergence in spring and at peak weights in autumn, respectively, and adult females weighing at the same times. Going on published weights, the Olympic marmot is the largest of the six marmot species found in North America, averaging slight heavier in mean body mass than hoary marmot and Vancouver marmot. Mean linear dimensions suggest the Olympic species is about 7% larger on average than these other two large North America species.Braun, J. K., Eaton Jr, T. S., & Mares, M. A. (2011). Marmota caligata (Rodentia: Sciuridae). Mammalian Species, 43(884), 155-171. Furthermore, it rivals some lesser-studied Asian species as the largest marmots and largest members of the squirrel family in general, with perhaps similar body masses attainable by some species such as the Tarbagan marmot and the Himalayan marmot.Murdoch, J. D., Munkhzul, T., Buyandelger, S., Reading, R. P., & Sillero-Zubiri, C. (2009). The Endangered Siberian marmot Marmota sibirica as a keystone species? Observations and implications of burrow use by corsac foxes Vulpes corsac in Mongolia. Oryx, 43(3), 431-434.Chaudhary, V., Tripathi, R. S., Singh, S., & Raghuvanshi, M. S. (2017). Distribution and population of Himalayan Marmot Marmota himalayana (Hodgson, 1841)(Mammalia: Rodentia: Sciuridae) in Leh- Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, India. Journal of Threatened Taxa, 9(11), 10886-10891. The coat is double-layered, consisting of soft thick underfur, for warmth, and coarser outer hairs. Infant marmots' fur is dark gray in color; this changes in the yearling period to grayish brown with lighter patches. The adult coat is brown on the body with some smaller white or pale brown patches for most of the year, becoming darker overall as the year progresses. The first molt of the year occurs in June, commencing with two black patches of fur forming on the back of the shoulders. This black coloration then spreads to the rest of the body, and by the fall the coat is almost black. A second molt is thought to occur during hibernation, and upon emergence from hibernation in the spring Olympic marmots may be tan or yellowish. The Olympic marmot's muzzle is almost always white, with a white band in front of the eyes. This species can be readily distinguished from the hoary marmot, with which it shares almost every other physical trait, by the lack of contrasting black feet and a black spot on the head. The Vancouver Island marmot has a similar coat color, chocolate brown with white patches. Distribution and habitat Typical Olympic marmot habitat: a slope on Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park Olympic marmots are native to the Olympic Mountains in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. About 90% of Olympic marmots' total habitat is located in Olympic National Park, where they are often sighted, especially on Hurricane Ridge. Marmots are in decline in some areas of the park due to the encroachment of trees into meadows as well as predation by coyotes, and they are seldom seen in the wetter southwestern part. Within the park, Olympic marmots inhabit lush sub-alpine and alpine meadows, fields, and montane scree slopes. They live in colonies spread out in various locations in the mountains and containing the burrows of differing numbers of marmot families. Some meadows can contain as few animals as one marmot family, and some can have multiple families adding up to 40 marmots in total. There is a higher risk of inbreeding and death from random events in meadows with fewer marmots, making migration essential to the survival of the species. Burrows can be found at various elevations, ranging from to ; they are most often found in the range of to . Burrows are more frequently located on south-facing slopes, which generally receive more precipitation, per year (mostly snow), and thus have more available flora. The home range of a family of marmots usually covers from half an acre to five acres (0.2–2 hectares). The Olympic marmot is well-adapted to its generally cold natural habitat, where there is snowfall almost every month of the year on the mountain slopes and barren grasslands. EcologyFeeding= Lupine, a major part of the Olympic marmot's diet, near Hurricane Ridge Olympic marmots eat meadow flora such as avalanche and glacier lilies, heather blossoms, subalpine lupine, mountain buckwheat, harebells, sedges, and mosses. They prefer green, tender, flowering plants over other sources of food, but roots are a large part of their diets in the early spring when other plants have not yet appeared. During May and June, they may resort to gnawing on trees for food. They also occasionally eat fruits and insects. Their water requirements are met from the juice in the vegetation they eat and dew on the plants' surfaces. When snowfall covers vegetation, marmots have a more carnivorous diet, consuming carrion encountered while digging for roots and possibly killing late hibernating chipmunks. At this time, they also obtain water from melted snow. Hibernating Olympic marmots do not keep food in their burrows; instead, they gain fat before hibernating and can double their body weight to survive eight months without eating. =Predation= The coyote is the Olympic marmot's main predator. The Olympic marmot's predators are mostly terrestrial mammals such as coyotes, cougars, and bobcats; however, it is also preyed on by avian raptors such as golden eagles. Black bears probably rarely prey on marmots, as evidenced by the fact that their presence close to colonies generally does not generate alarm calls unless the bear advances to within of the colony. The coyote is the primary predator and studies have shown that marmots make up approximately 20% of coyotes' diet during the summer months. During a study in the Olympic Mountains, 36 coyote droppings were collected and two of them contained marmot hairs. In common with all other marmots, Olympic marmots use the trill as an alarm call to alert other marmots to predators. Continuing alarm calls indicate that a predator is close, and thus increase vigilance in the marmots; a single alarm call results in the marmots curiously looking around for the predator. Sightings of land predators, coyotes in particular, receive more alarm calls than aerial predators. Fishers are viewed as predators by Olympic marmots, eliciting alarm calls when just passing by a colony. It has also been observed that these trills can be used as a mechanism to trick and frustrate predators. An additional behavior that takes place when a marmot becomes nervous or bothered by a predator is that it retracts its top lip to show its upper incisors. It is almost like a greeting for predators. It was reported during a study by David P. Barash that when hunting Olympic marmots as prey, coyotes and cougars approach the marmot within about , advance to an alpine fir close to the victim, and then chase the marmot downhill to its colony. If the marmot is able to flee into a burrow and sound an alarm call, other marmots will scurry to their burrows for safety. But the predator does not stop here; it is usually persistent and will scratch outside the entrance to try to dig out its prey. Minutes later, when a marmot from a nearby burrow peers out to see if the predator has gone, it will sometimes sound another alarm call, which summons the predator to its burrow. It dives back underground and the predator usually remains frustrated as these alarm calls continue and force it to run around from burrow to burrow, getting tired and aggravated, and finally giving up. As humans in the Olympic National Park do not hunt the marmot, but simply observe them, they do not pose a threat. When researchers intrude on colonies to observe behavior, the families living in burrows there initially vocalize ascending calls, showing surprise, but later adjust to the presence of humans, allowing studies to proceed. The parasites of the Olympic marmot include the cestode Diandrya composita, and fleas of the genus Oropsylla. BehaviorColonies= Olympic marmot sunbathing at Hurricane Ridge Olympic marmots are gregarious burrowing animals, living in colonies typically containing multiple burrows. Activity varies with the weather, time of day, and time of year; owing to rainfall and fog cover during June, July, and August, the marmots spend most of the day inside their burrows, and forage for food mostly in the morning and evening. In between these times, Olympic marmots can sometimes be found lying on rocks where they sun themselves for warmth, grooming each other, playing, chirping, and feeding together. Burrows are multi-purpose structures, used for hibernation, protection from bad weather and predators, and to raise newborn pups. A typical colony of marmots consists of a male, two to three females, and their young, sometimes living in groups of more than a dozen animals; young marmots stay with their family for at least two years, so a burrow is often home to a newly born litter and a litter of two-year-olds. Marmots seldom move to other colonies with the exception of sub-adults of two to three years old, which may leave the home colony to start a new family elsewhere; females move only a few hundred meters, though males often move several kilometers away from their birth burrow. A colony may have a subordinate or \\"satellite\\" male, smaller and younger than the colony male, who may take over as the dominant male if the incumbent dies. The satellite male lives in a separate burrow, away from the rest of the colony. After emergence from hibernation, if the satellite male and the colony male are both still living in the same colony, the dominant colony male may chase the satellite around multiple times per day. The satellite male's feeding area is limited to areas far from the rest of the marmots in the colony, and he must stay away from the other marmots' burrows as long as the colony male is near. While the satellite male does not approach the other marmots in the colony, they sometimes make trips over to the satellite male's burrow, often about two times an hour. After more time has passed since hibernation, males will become less hostile towards each other, and less avoidance and chasing will occur. Male-male competition ends around the same time that the reproductive season does. The diminution of hostile behavior is only temporary, as the satellite male becomes assigned to its subordinate status again the following spring after emergence from hibernation and the ritual begins again. =Communication= When greeting each other, these very sociable animals will usually touch noses or nose to cheek; in courtship rituals they may inter-lock teeth and nibble each other's ears and necks. They may also engage in play fighting, in which two marmots on their hind legs push each other with their paws; this play fighting is more aggressive between older marmots. In fights that have been observed during a study, only about 10% of fights had distinct outcomes. When communicating vocally, they have four different types of whistles, differing in this from their close relatives, the hoary marmot and the Vancouver Island marmot. The Olympic marmot's whistles include flat calls, ascending calls, descending calls, and trills; all of these are in a small frequency range of about 2,700 Hz. Flat, ascending, and descending calls are most often voiced singly. The ascending call has a duration of about half a second, starting with a \\"yell\\" on one note and ending with a \\"chip\\" on a higher note; it is often used as a distress or warning call for unfamiliar smells and noises. These same \\"yips\\" are heard when Olympic marmots are play fighting, along with low growls and chattering of teeth. The descending call ends on a lower note than the one on which it started. The trill, which sounds like multiple ascending calls put together as one longer sound, consists of multiple ranging notes and is voiced as an alarm call to communicate to other marmots in the area that danger may be approaching and they should return to their burrows. Females with young have the responsibility to watch out for their young and other relatives near the burrow, and therefore voice the trill more often than other Olympic marmots. If marmots are not accustomed to human contact in a certain area, they may also sound a trill when seeing a person, in order to alert other marmots. At places like Hurricane Ridge, where seeing humans is a frequent occurrence, most marmots will not acknowledge human presence at all. They also communicate through the sense of smell. A gland located in their cheek exudes chemicals which they rub on scenting points, such as shrubs and rocks, which can be smelled by other marmots in the area. =Hibernation= Olympic marmots start to enter hibernation in early September. Before hibernating, the marmots bring dry grasses into the burrow for bedding or food. Sometimes in early September marmots will stay in their burrows for a few consecutive days, with only brief outings that allow for a little foraging. During this period, they do not play fight or socialize with other marmots; they limit themselves to peeking out and casually sitting outside their burrows. Nonparous females (those who have not given birth yet) and adult males become inactive first, because they do not need to store as much fat beforehand. The parous females, yearlings, and young of the year become inactive a few weeks later, because they have to gain more weight. The marmots of a colony hibernate in a single burrow space, which they keep closed with dirt. Adults emerge in May, and the young in June. Marmots do not eat during hibernation, so they have to store fat before becoming inactive. These marmots are \\"deep hibernators\\"; they cannot easily be awoken. Their body temperature drops to below and heart rate can slow to three beats per minute. Marmots warm their bodies about every ten days. Olympic marmots lose 50% of their body mass over the seven to eight months of winter hibernation. Hibernation is the most dangerous time for them as, in years of light snowfall, as many as 50% of the young born that year will die from the cold because of the lack of insulation that is provided by good snow cover. When they emerge in early May, thick snow cover is still present from the preceding winter, so they are not very active at this time. Sometimes they are so disoriented after awaking from hibernation that they have to relearn the colony's landmarks (which are now covered in snow, which obscures them even more); they wander around aimlessly until they find their burrows. =Life cycle= This species, along with the hoary marmot, has the lowest reproductive rate of any rodent. A female Olympic marmot has a litter of from one to six young (3.3 on average) in alternate years. In a given year, a third of females will have a litter. Half of the pups die before the following spring. Those pups that survive the following spring can live into their teens. Both males and females mature sexually at three years, but females generally do not reproduce until they are four and a half years old. The marmot comes out from hibernation at the beginning of May, and estrus (heat) occurs about two weeks later. After hibernation ends, both male and female Olympic marmots attempt to entice the opposite sex with courtship rituals. Females who have never produced a litter before tend to be more aggressive and will chase or instigate fights with males; females which have already produced young tend to greet the male with nasal to nasal or nasal to genital contact, with copulation following shortly afterwards. This approach is more successful than the aggressive manner of the non-parous female, with mating taking place within 11 to 20 days after hibernation. The relationship between a sexually mature male and female Olympic marmot is polygynous; males tend to breed with three or four females in each mating season. Approximately four weeks after mating, the female gives birth to her young in a grass-lined burrow underground. Newborn pups cannot see, have no fur, and are pink in color. At first, the young exhibit no sexual dimorphism. It is about a month before the young Olympic marmots first leave the burrow; around the same time, they begin to be weaned. Even after they are allowed to emerge, the young initially stay within the immediate vicinity of the burrow, where they can be found chasing each other and wrestling playfully. Within a few weeks after first emerging from the burrow, the young are fully weaned and can feed themselves. Olympic marmots are not completely independent from their mothers until they reach two years of age. Breeding-age female marmots are extremely important to marmot populations. If a female of breeding age dies it can take years to replace her; marmots are usually limited to six pups in a litter, the maturation period is long, and many marmots die before reaching maturity. Interaction with humans Relief map of Olympic National Park, where the Olympic marmot is protected The Olympic marmot is the second-rarest North American marmot, behind the critically endangered Vancouver Island marmot. Marmots were first sighted in the Olympic Peninsula in the 1880s. In the 1960s, David P. Barash conducted a three-year study of Olympic marmots after which he reported that there was an abundance of marmots in the mountains. In 1989, the total Olympic marmot population was calculated to be only about 2,000, but this low number was due to poor data collection. Other than this population census, little further research was done on the Olympic marmot until the late 1990s, when concerns arose about population status. Rangers and frequent visitors to the Olympic National Park had noticed that some populations of Olympic marmots had disappeared from their usual habitats. In response to this, the University of Michigan began a population study in 2002, in which the marmot population continued to decline by about 10% a year until 2006. Predation by coyotes that had not been present in the area before the 20th century was found to be the main cause of death of females, inhibiting population re-growth. By 2006, numbers had dropped to 1,000 individuals; this figure increased to around 4,000 from 2007 to 2010, when colonies stabilized and survival rates rose. In 2010, volunteers started to collect and store data about marmot populations in the park through a monitoring program. The Olympic marmot has been considered a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List since first being included in 1996. Its range is small, but 90% of its total habitat is protected due to being in Olympic National Park. The park, which holds multiple other endemic species, has been designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site. State law declares that the Olympic marmot is a protected wildlife species and cannot be hunted. The species is susceptible to climate change because of their sensitivity to changed habitats. When meadows in Olympic National Park dried out, marmots there died or moved. In the long term, meadows may be superseded by forests. Climate change will alter the timing, composition, and quality of the marmots' food. Olympic marmots can become more vulnerable to predators when daytime temperatures rise too high for foraging, causing them to forage in the cooler evenings when predators are more difficult to notice. In warm winters, there is heavier predation by coyotes. Marmots become more accessible to coyotes as lower banks of snow allow coyotes to move up higher on mountains where marmots dwell, into areas which they could not usually reach during an average cold winter. Climate change could also have positive effects; a warmer climate would result in a longer growing season in which marmots could mature more quickly and thus breed more often. In 2009, this marmot was designated a state symbol of Washington: the official \\"endemic mammal.\\" Governor Chris Gregoire's signing of Senate Bill 5071 was the result of a two-year effort by the fourth and fifth graders of Wedgwood Elementary School in Seattle. The students researched the marmot's habits, and answered legislators' questions to overcome initial bipartisan opposition to another state symbol.

It was first released in November 1987. After recording three singles, \\"In Purgatory\\", \\"Red Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Frans Hals\\", I Am a Wallet demonstrates jangly guitar pop reminiscent of The Byrds. While this form of indie pop was widespread in '80s underground Britain, McCarthy brought left-wing politics to the genre. Religion is attacked in \\"God Made the Virus\\", while the return of Victorian values espoused by Margaret Thatcher is compared to medieval oppression in \\"In the Dark Times\\". Johnny Dee of Underground magazine gave the album a 3/3 review, naming it as his favourite record of the year. I Am a Wallet has since been described by Nicky Wire as \\"the most perfect record, a Communist manifesto with tunes\\". On the album cover of the 2007 re-release he writes that McCarthy \\"are partly to blame for the realisation of the Manic Street Preachers\\". James Dean Bradfield rated I Am a Wallet as his top British album of all time. The cover art features Georg Grosz's painting Widmung an Oskar Panizza (The Funeral).

It was standard issue in the Russian army from 1870 to 1891, when it was replaced by the Mosin–Nagant rifle. It was widely used in Russia as a hunting weapon, and sporting variants, including shotguns, were produced until the mid-1930s. The Russian Berdan I (M1868) and Berdan II (M1870) rifles of .42 caliber are distinct from the Spanish Berdan 15mm (.58+ cal) conversion rifles adopted by Spain as the M1857/67 Berdan (and related engineer, artillery & short rifles). Berdan I Two different versions of the later single-shot Berdan rifle were adopted as service weapons by Imperial Russia. The first version, manufactured by Colt in the US, is known as model 1868, or Berdan I. It is a hammerless \\"trapdoor\\" breechblock design, and was manufactured in limited numbers (the contract stipulated 30,000) as a full length infantry rifle. Colt also manufactured a few half-stock Berdan I cavalry carbine prototypes, but these were never adopted for Russian service. Colt even produced a few target rifles based on the Berdan I. First model Berdan located at the bottom. Berdan II The model 1870, or Berdan II, is a single-shot bolt-action with a distinctive short, pear-shaped bolt handle. The bolt handle serves as the only locking lug for the action, and when closed, points upwards at a 30-degree angle, rather than horizontally. The Berdan II was produced in four variants: an infantry rifle, the lighter and slightly shorter dragoon rifle, a Cossack rifle with a button trigger and no trigger guard, and a cavalry carbine. Infantry and dragoon rifles were issued with quadrangular socket bayonets. Initial production of the Berdan II was at Birmingham Small Arms in England. The rifles were later manufactured in large numbers by Russian factories at Tula, Izhevsk, and Sestroretsk. Estimated total production of all models is over 3 million. The rifle was known for its accuracy, simplicity and reliability. Different variants of the Berdan II. Cartridge The 10.7×58mmR cartridge used in the Berdan was also invented by Hiram Berdan, with the assistance of Russian colonel . It was the subject of many patents in both the United States and United Kingdom. The bottleneck cartridge case used the Berdan primer, its first use in a small arms cartridge. Cartridges were issued in blue paper packets of six rounds each. In addition to the regular cartridge for rifles, a special cartridge was manufactured for use in the cavalry carbine. It consisted of the same cartridge case and bullet, but with a lighter powder charge of only 4.5 grams, and was issued in six round pink paper packets. At the time of its use, the 10.75×58mmR (4.2 line) cartridge was known for its power and accuracy. Later usage No magazine-fed versions of the Berdan ever progressed beyond the prototype phase. Russian troops, however, did have various cartridge holders, such as the Krnka quick-loader, attached to their rifles to aid in reloading. By the late 1880s Russia began the process of replacing the Berdan with a high velocity and magazine fed rifle, and this resulted in the adoption of the Mosin–Nagant. In 1892, a batch of 3,004 Berdan II rifles were converted to 7.62×54mmR for Russian service by arms makers in Belgium. These rifles have new barrels and sights, and new bolts with a front locking lug and longer bolt handle. Had the conversion been deemed fit for service, an additional 40,000 were to be converted. However this did not go through. Sporting rifles and shotguns were re-manufactured in Russia from surplus rifles after the Mosin–Nagant was adopted into service.Карабинъ системы Бердана русской работы // «Каталогъ ружей и принадлежностей охоты на 1898/99 годъ.

The manufacturer's name in Cyrillic, date of manufacture, and rifle serial number, are on the top of the barrel. Some rifles also show a date of manufacture on the receiver. The serial number was also applied to the bolt. Additional proof marks and property markings are found on the receiver and barrel. There is a factory cartouche on the right side of the buttstock.  Comparison with contemporary rifles  Users  * Russian Empire: Both the Berdan I and Berdan II were used by guard units in the Russian Army during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. Russian forces, although ultimately victorious, were badly mauled by the very long range fire from Turk Peabody–Martini rifles during the Siege of Plevna. After the war a long-range auxiliary sight was adopted and retrofitted to the Berdan II infantry rifle. The Berdanka, as it was called, continued on in Russian service even after the adoption of the Mosin–Nagant, primarily with reserve and rear echelon units when the Mosin-Nagant became plentiful. Many Russian troops had Berdan rifles in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. During World War I, some Russian second line, training and service units were armed with the Berdan II.\\"Во время первой мировой войны царская Россия испытывала недостаток в стрелковом вооружении, поэтому в армии кроме винтовок русского образца были также и иностранные - японские Арисака обр.1897 и 1905 гг., австро-венгерские Манлихера 1889 и 1895 гг., германские \\"88\\" и \\"98\\".

The Berdan II saw service, though by then very limited, in Finland as late as World War II. In the Finnish Civil War of 1918, troops stationed in Finland still had Berdan rifles in storage and some 2nd line troops continued to employ the Berdan II. During this conflict, newer rifles were not always available in needed numbers, so Berdans saw limited use on both sides. As the Finnish military was not interested in the obsolete Berdan, in 1919 some 2,500 were issued to the Suojeluskunta (National Guard) General HQ. When the Suojeluskunta obtained modern rifles, the Berdans were returned to Finnish Army stores. About 3,000 Berdan rifles were issued to Finnish troops during the initial stages of the 1939 Winter War due to the great lack of modern infantry weapons. These rifles were replaced by more modern rifles as soon as it was possible. It appears that the Finns retained the Berdan rifles in store until scrapping them starting in 1945. In 1955 the remaining 1,029 were sold abroad, mostly in the U.S., through surplus arms dealers.

A working coal mine from 1880 to 1980, it was opened to the public in 1983 under the auspices of the National Museum of Wales. The site is dedicated to operational preservation of the Welsh heritage of coal mining, which took place during the Industrial revolution. Located adjacent to the preserved Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway, Big Pit is part of the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, a World Heritage Site, and an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.  History of the working pit  Big Pit was originally an iron mine, driven into the side of the mountain not far from the surface due to the shallow iron deposits, the level is called Engine Pit Level and can still be seen on the bridge connecting Blaenavon and Garn Rd at . The Iron Workings are above the Big Pit coal workings, for some time Engine Pit Level was used as an emergency exit for Big Pit whilst it was working, now the River Arch Level is the escape route. Engine Pit Level was driven around 1810 by hand due to dynamite being invented 5 decades later, there are no known records of the iron mine. There are a few pictures online showing the interior of the Engine Level from the 1960s when miners from Big Pit explored the level, finding an old flange-less wheeled dram inside, now at a museum. There was also a known Iron Workings shaft, Engine Pit Shaft which existed, information and location of this shaft can be on Industrial Gwent. The Big Pit is part of a network of coal workings established in Blaenavon in the first half of the nineteenth century by the Blaenavon Iron and Coal Company as part of the development of the Blaenavon Ironworks, which means it has some of the oldest large scale industrial coal mining developments in the South Wales Coalfield. The mine was the most important of all the collieries located in Blaenavon. The nearby Coity pit is shown in reports in the 1850s, consisting of two shafts in diameter which were difficult to pump out. Historians disagree about when the Big Pit was first in consistent operation, but it may have been a development of a former pit called Kearsley's Pit mentioned in the company records from the 1860s, which lay at the other end of a geological fault from the Coity pits. A mines inspector report of 1881 is the first to describe a mine called the Big Pit due to its elliptical shape with dimensions of by , the first shaft in Wales large enough to allow two tramways. On completion it became the coal-winding shaft, while the older Coity shaft was used for upcast air ventilation. In 1878, the main shaft was deepened to reach the Old Coal seam at . By 1908, Big Pit provided employment for 1,122 people, and by 1923 at peak, there were 1,399 men employed, producing: House Coal, Steam Coal, Ironstone and Fireclay; from the Horn, No. 2 Yard, Old Coal and Elled seams. The peak of production was more than 250,000 tons of coal per year. During the height of production, coal from Big Pit was shipped as far as South America, and also to other points worldwide. Until 1908, when a conveyor became part of the mine equipment, everything at Big Pit was done by man power-including cutting the coal. The mine was one of the first to install electricity and by 1910, fans, hauling systems and pumps were electric powered. In 1939, pithead baths were installed at the mine; it meant miners no longer needed to walk home dirty and wet, risking illness. The baths were also beneficial to miners' families; women no longer needed to carry hot jugs of water to fill tin baths and children were no longer accidentally scalded during this process. During the Second World War, surface extraction of coal began at Blaenavon in November 1941 using equipment and skilled men from the Canadian Army. On nationalisation in 1947, the National Coal Board took over the mine from the Blaenavon Co. Ltd, which employed 789 men. By 1970 the workforce numbered only 494, as operations had focused solely on the Garw seam, with a maximum thickness of only . The NCB agreed the development of a drift mine, which by 1973 meant that windings at Big Pit had ceased, with coal extracted close to the refurbished Black Lion coal washery. The Coity shaft was abandoned, with the Big Pit shaft used for upcast air ventilation and emergency extraction. The pit finally closed on 2 February 1980 with a loss of more than 250 jobs; it was one of the last working coal mines in Blaenavon, leaving only Blaentillery No.2 Drift Mine, closing in 2010 and the Johnson Mine, closing in 2013. =Transport= Big Pit Halt railway station with the museum in the background In 1866, the Brynmawr and Blaenavon Railway opened, with access sidings to the mine workings. The line was immediately leased to the London and North Western Railway, allowing coal to be transported directly to the Midlands via the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway. By 1880, the line had extended south to meet the Great Western Railway at Abersychan & Talywain. Here the line carried on down the valley through Pontypool Crane Street Railway Station to the coast at Newport, and hence to overseas markets via Newport Docks. In 1922 the LNWR was grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. From World War II onwards, the line saw a variety of GWR locomotives operating from pit to port, with the line losing its passenger operations from 1941. After other pits in the area had closed, the line connection north was closed as a result of the Beeching cuts from 1964 onwards. The NCB paid for the line to be re-extended to Waunavon in the early 1970s, where the drift mine developments accessed the refurbished former Black Lion coal washery. Big Pit Halt which is on the heritage Pontypool and Blaenavon Railway line, adjacent to the museum, officially opened on 6 April 2012, however the line to Big Pit actually opened on Friday 16 September 2011. The line and station opened specifically for tourists visiting the museum. =Disasters= Between 1857 and 1880, more than 60 deaths were recorded by mine inspectors in the Blaenavon coal and ironworks, although these may not have been in the Big Pit itself. From 1880, there are regular reports of accidents at the Big Pit, often resulting in loss of life. In 1891 a boy called Thomas Oliver Jones was crushed to death in a roof fall. In 1894 and 1896 two further miners lost their lives in fatal accidents. On 11 December 1908 three men were killed in an explosion. A coroner's court found that the explosion had been caused by a naked light held by one of the miners. On 7 April 1913, another three men lost their lives in a localised fire that included a fireman, the face manager, and the under manager.  The National Coal Museum  Preserved Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. locomotive Nora No.5 at Big Pit Area of the former Coal Mine For some years before closure, the mine had been identified as being a possible heritage attraction and a working group was set up made up of the National Coal Board, local government, the National Museum, the Welsh Development Agency and the Welsh Office. Soon after the pit closed, Torfaen Borough Council bought the site for £1 and it was given to a charitable trust called the Big Pit (Blaenavon) Trust to manage the conversion to a heritage museum. The initial development cost £1.5 million with funding from the Welsh Tourist Board, the European Regional Development Fund, the borough council and Gwent County Council. The mine reopened for visitors in 1983 and created 71 jobs. A number of buildings were subsequently given protected status at the site. The Powder House, Saw mill Office Electrical Workshop, Pit Head Building, Headframe and Tram Circuit, and Miners' Bathhouse were each given Grade II Listed Building status on 2 September 1995. The Powder House building was used to store explosives needed for mine work during the time Big Pit was an active mine. = Big Pit as a tourist attraction = Visitor numbers were initially lower than expected, which threatened the long- term viability of the museum. In 1983, less than 100,000 visitors came to the site and the numbers reached a peak of 120,000 in 1992. Subsequently, the visitor numbers reduced significantly to less than 90,000 in 1998. The project plan at the start of the project suggested that 100,000 visitors were needed per year in the first five years. By 2000, it was clear that this target was not being achieved and that the £5.75 adult entry fee was not covering costs. A substantial Heritage Lottery Fund grant of more than £5 million was awarded in January 2000 which paid for a significant upgrade of the visitor facilities. On 1 February 2001, the museum was incorporated into the National Museum Wales; it was initially known as the \\"National Mining Museum of Wales\\", but is now called \\"Big Pit: National Coal Museum\\". As part of the National Museum Wales, the Big Pit became free to enter in 2001, and in 2015 First Minister Carwyn Jones announced that there would be \\"no payment for entry into any of the National Museums attractions\\". Since becoming part of the NMW, the numbers of visitors has increased significantly, with more than 140,000 visiting in 2014/15, and 150,176 visitors in 2017. Intentionally preserved as an operational attraction, the site was redeveloped in 2003, with design work from TACP/Brooke Millar Partnership. The pit props and steel bands are not for show, but to hold up the mine roof. The water flowing down the tunnel towards the cages is authentic, apart from the fact that it now flows down a channel rather than over the miners' feet. In 2005, the Big Pit National Coal Museum won the prestigious Gulbenkian Prize. The museum hired mining apprentices in 2011; after serving an apprenticeship, the trainees would then have the necessary qualifications to work in a mine. The museum features a range of above ground attractions including a winding house, saw mill, pithead, baths. Visitors are also taken below ground to the pit bottom where they tour the mine workings. In 2000, the Blaenavon industrial area, including Big Pit National Coal Museum, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This was in recognition of the town's importance to the Industrial Revolution. Museum staff walked out in disputes over pay in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The Blaenavon Cheddar Company, a local cheese company, ages its Pwll Mawr (Big Pit) cheddar at the base of the Big Pit mine shaft. = Safety = The mine is covered by HM Inspectorate of Mines regulations, because it is still classed as a working pit. Visitors wear a plastic hard hat, safety lamp, and a battery on a waist belt which weighs . Visitors must also carry on their belt a rebreather, which in case of emergency will filter foul air for approximately one hour, giving a chance for survival and escape. Before taking the 50 minute underground tour below ground, contraband must be surrendered, such as anything containing a dry cell battery from watches to mobile phones. The dangers of the mine are real, the safety posters on the stages of Carbon Monoxide poisoning serve as museum pieces and as real reminders of the dangers underground. Automatic gas monitoring systems are discreetly positioned around the tunnels, as are emergency telephone systems. Some safety beams were monitored around the area. Popular culture Big Pit winding tower The cover of the Manic Street Preachers album National Treasures – The Complete Singles shows the Big Pit winding tower. Historian Gwyn A. Williams used the Big Pit as a setting for one of his programmes in his Channel 4 series The Dragon Has Two Tongues, broadcast in January 1985 - near the end of the miners' strike and as men were returning to work. In it, Williams said \\"Today it looks to me as if the Welsh people have been declared redundant, as redundant as this pit which after 200 years is now a museum. This is a museum.

Cricket career  Lall Singh, whose full name was Lall Singh Gill was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya on 16 December 1909 and died at Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur on 19 November 1985. He was a member of India's test cricket team on its one match in inaugural tour of England in 1932. He was a right-handed batsman and an outstanding fielder. In the only Test played during the tour he batted at number 9 and scored 15 runs in the first innings behind only CK Nayudu (40), Naoomal Jaoomal (33), S Wazir Ali (31) and SMH Colah (22).

He was the youngest of 3 sons, the eldest being Santha Singh Gill (maternal grandfather of Tariq B Shamsi) and middle brother being Bishen Singh Gill. All three brothers studied at the prestigious Victoria Institute (V.I.) in Kuala Lumpur that had been set up under the auspices of Sultan Abdul Samad ibni Almarhum Raja Abdullah KCMG, the fourth Sultan of Selangor, and was named after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Victoria Institute or V.I. as it was and is known, had been opened specially to commemorate the golden jubilee of her reign. V.I. has had many honourable and distinguished individuals among its alumni, including royals like the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah - Sultan of Brunei and other royalty.

Lall Singh seated third from right Lall Singh and BS Gill Victoria Institute Cricket Team 1924 BS Gill and Lall Singh, Victoria Institute Cricket Team 1925 Lall Singh and BS Gill, Victoria Institute Cricket Team 1926 Being highly passionate to play cricket at the highest possible level, he convinced his mother to allow and sponsor him to play cricket in India. The family accordingly approached Maharajah Patiala, Bhupindar Singh who was known to the family. Maharajah Bhupindir Singh, himself a good cricketer and lover of the game, advised the family to send Lall Singh to Patiala to play in his team, Maharajah Patiala XI, which was led by the Maharajah himself. He reached Patiala in 1931 and in the company of Maharajah Bupindar Singh developed his lifelong love for the 'Patiala Peg'. The next year Lall Singh was selected for India's inaugural tour to England in 1932. The Captain of the team was to be Maharajah Bhupindar Singh but a few weeks before the departure of the team, he fell ill and the Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji, the Maharajah of Porbundar replaced him as captain. In 1934-35, Lall Singh represented Hindus in the Bombay Quadrangular tournament and South Punjab in the inaugural Ranji Trophy. The South Punjab team was led by the Maharajah of Patiala Bhupindar Singh. Notable players who played alongside the Maharajah and Lall Singh were Lala Amarnath, Mohammad Saeed, Nazir Ali and Nissar Mohammad. In the first match against United Provinces, batting at number 8, Lall Singh scored 56, the highest in the Southern Punjab's only innings. 820x820px He represented India in an unofficial 'Test' at Bombay against Jack Ryder's Australian side in 1935-36. Lall Singh's sole first-class hundred (107 not out) came in the 1935-36 Bombay Quadrangular Tournament for Hindus against Parsees at Gymkhana Ground, Bombay. Walking in with his team's score at 99-6, he shared an unbeaten stand of 132 for 8th wicket with a somewhat subdued, Vijay Merchant (30 not out). Maharajah Bhupindar Singh was very fond of Lall Singh and this closeness of Lall Singh to the Maharajah gave rise to many enemies, as a result of which, there was an attempt on the life of Lall Singh in 1936. He was seriously injured but survived. After recovery, with the permission of Maharajah Bhupindar Singh, he left for Paris in 1936.  Falling in Love and Paris  While in India, he met Myrtle Watkins, an Afro-American singer, who was performing at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay. After recovering from his injuries, he and Myrtle proceeded to Paris, where Lall Singh opened a night club for Myrtle to perform nightly. The money to open the night club was sent to Lall Singh by his mother. From Paris he send a studio photograph of himself and Myrtle to the family, behind which he had written, ‘This is she and this is me ….. very soon and we might be three’. Unfortunately, this affair did not last long and Myrtel and Lall Singh parted ways and selling off his night club he returned to Malaya in August 1939. The following month Germany invaded Poland and that was the beginning of WWII. Japan attacked Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941 and started the gradual occupation of Malaya the following day. By 31 January 1942 the whole of the Malayan peninsula had been was captured by Japan.  Second World War  In June 1942, SS Gill, the eldest brother of Lall Singh was arrested by the Japanese as he was helping British Army officers to escape from Malaya to Singapore. The following day his brothers BS Gill and Lall Singh were also arrested, all their assets including three houses, rubber plantation and a gold mine were confiscated by the Japanese. Within 3 months SS Gill and BS Gill were hanged by the Japanese occupation forces for helping the British and Lall Singh was sent to a slave labour camp in Borneo. SS Gill's elder daughter Ajmer Kaur (later Neelum Shamsi), then only 15 years old, was allowed to live in a portion of one house with her younger sister and paternal grandmother. However, the Mother Superior, of the sprawling Bukit Nanas Convent in Kula Lumpur, where Ajmer Kaur and her sister Amar Kaur studied, took both the sisters and their paternal grandmother into the Convent and kept them there and looked after them for the duration of the War. Lall Singh, managed to escape from the slave labour camp in Borneo and make his way back to Kuala Lumpur in August 1945. When he was reunited with his mother and two nieces he was mere skeleton of the person he used to be. He had been tortured so badly that his own mother initially refused to recognise him as her son.  After the War  After the War thumb Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on 5 September 1945. The immediate problem facing Lall Singh was how to look after and care for his ailing mother and two nieces as the family had been left penniless due to Japan's occupation of Malaya. Lall Singh had never worked in his life and was too proud to knock on anyone's door for help. Immediately, he started to look for a job and the only one in post war ravaged Malaya was that of groundsman at the acclaimed Selangor Club in Kuala Lumpur. While in captivity, the Japanese had shaved his head and beard. Thereafter, he never again grew his hair or beard or wore a turban. A.B. Shamsi, (Baseer Shamsi) then a Captain in the British Indian Army, was posted from Burma to Malaya, Kula Lumpur and being a keen cricketer, he went to the Selangor Club to play cricket and was surprised to meet Lall Singh working as groundsman at the club. In 1946, A.B. Shamsi, married Lall Singh's elder niece Ajmer Kaur, who converted to Islam taking the maiden name of Neelum, on 11 September 1946. In 1950, Sultan Sir Hishamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj, the Sultan of Selangor, a friend of the Gill family, visited the Selangor Club and was shocked to see Lall Singh working as a groundsman. To cut a long story short, the Sultan started the process of rehabilitating the estates of the Gill family to Lall Singh. Since most of the estates, fixed and moveable assets were in the name of Lall Singh's mother who had died in 1946 and SS Gill who had been hanged in 1942, it took over 2 years for these properties to be reissued in the name of Lall Singh in 1953. Lall Singh, spent rest of his days travelling abroad, mostly to Paris on a yearly basis in summer. He died peacefully on 19 November 1985 in Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur. An inter school cricket tournament is held annually in Kuala Lumpur for the ‘Lall Singh Shield’. The Sikh community in Malaysia, organise an annual tournament between clubs for the ‘Lall Singh Trophy’.  Golden Jubilee  He was one of oldest players to attend the Golden Jubilee Test in Bombay in 1980 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of BCCI.

In 1940, the Eagle acquired the Reading Times, which was a morning paper, but they remained separate papers. The staff of the two papers was combined in 1982. In June 2002, the Reading Times ceased publishing, and the Eagle became a morning paper. Both papers had been publishing a joint Saturday morning edition since 1988. Author John Updike worked at the Eagle as a copyboy in his youth for several summer internships in the early 1950s, and wrote several feature articles.

India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a full republic, when the nation adopted the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the Independence Movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience. Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided along religious lines into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence.

History European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the First War of Independence of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non- violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan. =Independence Day before Independence= At the 1929 Lahore session of the Indian National Congress, the Purna Swaraj declaration, or \\"Declaration of the Independence of India\\" was promulgated, and 26 January 1930 was declared as Independence Day at that time. The Congress called on people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and \\"to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time\\" until India attained complete independence. Celebration of such an Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence. The Congress observed 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1946. The celebration was marked by meetings where the attendants took the \\"pledge of independence\\". Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such meetings were peaceful, solemn, and \\"without any speeches or exhortation\\". Gandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, the day would be spent \\" ... in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or service of 'untouchables,' or reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these together\\". Following actual independence in 1947, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from 26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day. =Immediate background= In 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support nor the reliability of native forces for continuing to control an increasingly restless India. On 20 February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest. The new viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, advanced the date for the transfer of power, believing the continuous contention between the Congress and the Muslim League might lead to a collapse of the interim government. He chose the second anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, 15 August, as the date of power transfer. The British government announced on 3 June 1947 that it had accepted the idea of partitioning British India into two states; the successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth. The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of India and Pakistan (including what is now Bangladesh) with effect from 15 August 1947, and granted complete legislative authority upon the respective constituent assemblies of the new countries. The Act received royal assent on 18 July 1947. =Partition and independence= Jawaharlal Nehru delivering his speech, Tryst with Destiny, on the eve of India's first independence day. Millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding independence. In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people on both sides of the new borders died in the violence. While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an attempt to stem the carnage. On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi. The Constituent Assembly of India met for its fifth session at 11 pm on 14 August in the Constitution Hall in New Delhi. The session was chaired by the president Rajendra Prasad. In this session, Jawaharlal Nehru delivered the Tryst with Destiny speech proclaiming India's independence. The members of the Assembly formally took the pledge of being in the service of the country. A group of women, representing the women of India, formally presented the national flag to the assembly. The Dominion of India became an independent country as official ceremonies took place in New Delhi. Nehru assumed office as the first prime minister, and the viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, continued as its first governor general. Gandhi's name was invoked by crowds celebrating the occasion; Gandhi himself however took no part in the official events. Instead, he marked the day with a 24-hour fast, during which he spoke to a crowd in Calcutta, encouraging peace between Hindus and Muslims. Celebration Independence Day, one of the three National holidays in India (the other two being the Republic Day on 26 January and Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on 2 October), is observed in all Indian states and union territories. On the eve of Independence Day, the President of India delivers the \\"Address to the Nation\\". On 15 August, the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag on the ramparts of the historical site of Red Fort in Delhi. Twenty-one gun shots are fired in honour of the solemn occasion. In his speech, the Prime Minister highlights the past year's achievements, raises important issues and calls for further development. He pays tribute to the leaders of the Indian independence movement. The Indian national anthem, \\"Jana Gana Mana\\", is sung. The speech is followed by march past of divisions of the Indian Armed Forces and paramilitary forces. Parades and pageants showcase scenes from the independence struggle and India's diverse cultural traditions. Similar events take place in state capitals where the Chief Ministers of individual states unfurl the national flag, followed by parades and pageants. Until 1973, the Governor of the State hoisted the National Flag at the State capital. In February 1974, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi took up the issue with then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that the Chief Ministers should be allowed to hoist National flag on Independence Day just like how Prime Minister hoists National flag on Independence Day. Later Chief Ministers of respective states are allowed to hoist National Flag on Independence Day celebration from 1974. Flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural programmes take place in governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying adds to the occasion. National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India. The Indian diaspora celebrates Independence Day around the world with parades and pageants, particularly in regions with higher concentrations of Indian immigrants. In some locations, such as New York and other US cities, 15 August has become \\"India Day\\" among the diaspora and the local populace. Pageants celebrate \\"India Day\\" either on 15 August or an adjoining weekend day. Security threats As early as three years after independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in northeast India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e- Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations. In the anticipation of terrorist attacks, particularly from militants, security measures are intensified, especially in major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai and in troubled states such as Jammu and Kashmir. The airspace around the Red Fort is declared a no-fly zone to prevent aerial attacks and additional police forces are deployed in other cities. In popular culture On Independence Day and Republic Day, patriotic songs in regional languages are broadcast on television and radio channels. They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies. Patriotic films are broadcast. Over the decades, according to The Times of India, the number of such films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with patriotic films. The population belonging to Generation Y often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations. This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and garments that represent India's various cultural traditions. Shops often offer Independence Day sales promotions. Some news reports have decried the commercialism. Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August. Independence and partition inspired literary and other artistic creations. Such creations mostly describe the human cost of partition, limiting the holiday to a small part of their narrative. Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children (1980), which won the Booker Prize and the Booker of Bookers, wove its narrative around children born at midnight of 14–15 August 1947 with magical abilities. Freedom at Midnight (1975) is a non-fiction work by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre that chronicled the events surrounding the first Independence Day celebrations in 1947. Few films centre on the moment of independence, instead highlighting the circumstances of partition and its aftermath. On the Internet, Google has been commemorating Independence Day of India since 2003 with a special doodle on its Indian homepage.

It is a Kannada version of the great epic, the Mahabharata of Vyasa. Pampa choose the Arjuna, the central figure of the Pandava Clan, as the hero of his epic. This work differs from Mahabharata in several aspects, one of them being Arjuna crowned the king, subhadra the queen, after Kurukshetra war, instead of Yudhishthira, and Draupadi respectively. A court poet of Chalukya king Arikesari II, a Rashtrakuta feudatory, he is most known for his epics, Vikramarjuna Vijaya (Pampa Bharata) and Adipurana, both written in Champu style, which he created and served as the model for all future works in Kannada. The works of Jain writers Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna, collectively called the \\"three gems of Kannada literature\\", heralded the age of classical Kannada in the 10th century, the Medieval Kannada literature. History Vikramarjuna Vijaya is a 10th-century work of Adikavi Pampa. Content This work is not an abridged version of Vyasa's Mahabharata, but, rather, a recreation of the original in the cultural context of Karnataka and the religious context of Jainism. The relatively less dominant and slightly Machiavellian role given to Krishna is a major change. Pampa was the court poet of Chalukya King Arikesari, a Rashtrakuta feudatory. The work acquires a historical significance because of the equation made by the poet between Arjuna and Arikesari his patron king belonging to the Ganga dynasty.

Guillaume Dufay was a prominent practitioner of the form (as was John Dunstaple), and may have been its inventor. The homophony and mostly parallel harmony allows the text of the mostly liturgical lyrics to be understood clearly. Description In its simplest form, fauxbourdon consists of the cantus firmus and two other parts a sixth and a perfect fourth below. To prevent monotony, or create a cadence, the lowest voice sometimes jumps down to the octave, and any of the accompanying voices may have minor embellishments. Usually just a small part of a composition employs the fauxbourdon technique. Example of fauxbourdon. This is a portion of Ave Maris Stella, a Marian Antiphon, in a setting by Guillaume Dufay, transcribed into modern notation. The top and bottom lines are freely composed; the middle line, designated \\"fauxbourdon\\" in the original, follows the contours of the top line while always remaining exactly a perfect fourth below. The bottom line is often, but not always, a sixth below the top line; it is embellished, and reaches cadences on the octave. Hymn singing In a hymn, the term is sometimes used when the congregation sings in parallel octaves, with some singers singing a descant over the melody, but the term was historically used to indicate an arrangement of the tune in four parts with the melody in the tenor voice, such as those composed by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English composers including John Dowland, Giles Farnaby, and Thomas Ravenscroft. History The earliest explicit example of fauxbourdon may be in the manuscript I-BC Q15 (Bologna, Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica, MS Q15), compiled around 1435, which contains several examples, including one by Dufay dating probably to around 1430. Since many early 15th century compositions are anonymous, and dating is often problematic, exact determination of the authorship of the earliest fauxbourdon is difficult. Dufay's contribution to this collection contains the first actual use of the term, in the closing part of his Missa Sancti Jacobi. It is possible that his use of the word \\"bourdon\\" was intended as a pun on St. James' \\"staff\\" (which Dufay, or the copyist, drew in miniature above the music). Cividale, Museo Civico MS 101 has a work \\"O salutaris hostia\\" (f. 82v) which seems to be a work of fauxbourdon, but not labelled as such. The earliest definitely datable example of fauxbourdon is in a motet by Dufay, Supremum est mortalibus, which was written for the treaty reconciling the differences between Pope Eugene IV and Sigismund, after which Sigismund was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor, which happened on 31 May 1433. In this motet, which is for four voices, when the tenor—the lowest voice—drops out, the upper three voices proceed in fauxbourdon. Even though its first use appears to have been in Italy, fauxbourdon was to become a defining characteristic of the Burgundian style which flourished in the Low Countries through the middle of the 15th century. Composers such as Gilles Binchois, Antoine Busnois, and Johannes Brassart all frequently used the technique, always adapting it to their personal styles. A related, but separate, development took place in England in the 15th century, called faburden. While superficially similar, especially in that it involved chains of 6–3 chords with octave-fifth consonances at the ends of phrases, faburden was a schematic method of harmonization of an existing chant; in the case of faburden, the chant was in the middle voice.

Since 1971, stad has no administrative or legal significance in Sweden. History  The status of towns in Sweden was formerly granted by a royal charter, comparable to the United Kingdom's status of borough or burgh before the 1970s or city status today. Unless given such town privileges, a municipality could not call itself stad. To receive the privileges, there were several requirements a municipality needed to fulfill, like being of a certain size, and to have certain facilities. The criteria varied over time as they were at the discretion of the Riksdag or the monarch, but they could include a permanent town council hall and a prison. In the majority of cases, before a town received its charter, it would have previously been given the status of köping or \\"merchant town\\". Exceptions to this would be when a town was founded under Royal supervision, in which case it would often bear the name of the monarch, such as Kristianstad or Karlskrona (named after kings Christian IV of Denmark and Karl XI of Sweden). In the Late Middle Ages, c. 1450, Sweden (excluding Finland) had 41 chartered towns. By 1680 there were 83. The only town founded and chartered during the 18th century was Östersund (1786). In 1863 the first local government acts were implemented in Sweden. Of the around 2,500 municipalities that were created, 88 were chartered towns. The main difference between these and other municipalities was that a stad had its own jurisdiction, i.e. independent town courts. There were also laws on urban planning and building (Byggnadstadgan 1874), fire prevention (Brandstadgan 1874), public order (Ordningsstadgan 1868) and public health (Hälsovårdsstadgan 1874) which were compulsory applicable to towns. Prior to 1900, the two minor towns of Borgholm and Haparanda lost their courts, but retained the title of stad. Of the new towns chartered between 1901 and 1951 (44, making the total number of towns 133), not a single one was given its own jurisdiction, but remained under what was called landsrätt (\\"rural jurisdiction\\"). =20th century reforms= In the middle of the 20th century many administrative reforms were carried out that continued to diminish the difference between rural and urban areas. Police forces and district courts, as well as taxation, were centralized under state agencies, making the administration uniform all over Sweden. The amalgamations of municipalities reduced the number of local government units from a maximum of 2,532 in 1930 to less than 300 today. Consequently, by 1970 most municipalities contained both rural and urban areas. Since the urban and rural municipalities also with time got the same duties towards citizens, it became unnecessary to differentiate between towns and other municipalities, as all had the same powers. So, since 1 January 1971 all municipalities are designated as kommun, regardless of their former status. Modern use Most of the urban areas of Sweden which once were chartered towns are today still usually referred to as stad. The majority of them are also house the seat of their respective municipalities though the term is no longer an administrative term. In some municipalities there can be more than one former town, e.g. Eskilstuna and Torshälla in Eskilstuna Municipality, Kungälv and Marstrand in Kungälv Municipality, or Jönköping, Huskvarna and Gränna, which all three now are part of Jönköping Municipality. The town of Visby is the seat of Gotland Municipality, but is no political entity of its own. Some former towns have also grown together, forming one urban area. A few municipalities which used to be towns still style themselves as stad, e.g. Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. There are also municipalities with considerable rural areas that market themselves with the term. Statistics Sweden defines the term stad as a locality with more than 10,000 inhabitants of which there are currently 118.

Indeed, in 1769 another former British officer, John Bradstreet, filed a claim to based on that very assumption.

Likely having originated in Mexico, O. ficus- indica is the most widespread and most commercially important cactus. Fig opuntia is grown primarily as a fruit crop, and also for the vegetable nopales and other uses. Cacti are good crops for dry areas because they convert water into biomass efficiently. O. ficus-indica, as the most widespread of the long- domesticated cactuses, is as economically important as maize and blue agave in Mexico. Because Opuntia species hybridize easily, the wild origin of O. ficus- indica is likely to have been in Mexico due to the fact that its close genetic relatives are found in central Mexico. Names Most culinary references to the \\"prickly pear\\" are referring to this species. The name \\"tuna\\" is also used for the fruit of this cactus, and for Opuntia in general; according to Alexander von Humboldt, it was a word of Taino origin taken into the Spanish language around 1500.Baron F. H. A. von Humboldt's personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America tr. 1852 by Ross, Thomasina: \\"The following are Haytian words, in their real form, which have passed into the Castilian language since the end of the 15th century... Tuna\\". Quoted in OED 2nd ed. Common English names for the plant and its fruit are Indian fig opuntia, Barbary fig, cactus pear, prickly pear, and spineless cactus, among many. In Mexican Spanish, the plant is called nopal, while the fruit is called tuna, names that may be used in American English as culinary terms. Description Flowering Flower Fruit Opuntia ficus-indica is polyploid, hermaphrodite and autogamous. As Opuntia species grow in semi-arid environments, the main limiting factor in their environment is water. They have developed a number of adaptations to dry conditions, notably succulence. Blooming, Behbahan, Iran The perennial shrub Opuntia ficus-indica can grow up to 3–5 m height, with thick, succulent and oblong to spatulate stems called cladodes. It has a water-repellent and sun-reflecting waxy epidermis. Cladodes that are 1–2 years old produce flowers, the fruit's colours ranging from pale green to deep red. The plants flower in three distinct colours: white, yellow, and red. The flowers first appear in early May through the early summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and the fruits ripen from August through October. The fruits are typically eaten, minus the thick outer skin, after chilling in a refrigerator for a few hours. They have a taste similar to sweet watermelon. The bright red/purple or white/yellowish flesh contains many tiny hard seeds that are usually swallowed, but should be avoided by those who have problems digesting seeds. UsesHuman consumption= O. ficus-indica are consumed widely as food. The fruits are commercialized in many parts of the world, eaten raw, and have one of the highest concentrations of vitamin C of any fruit. The “leaves” (or cladodes - technically stems) are cooked and eaten as a vegetable known as nopalitos. They are sliced into strips, skinned or unskinned, and fried with eggs and jalapeños, served as a breakfast treat. They have a texture and flavor like string beans. The fruits or leaves can be boiled, used raw, or blended with fruit juice, cooked on a frying pan, and used as a side dish with chicken, or added to tacos. Jams and jellies are produced from the fruit, which resemble strawberries and figs in color and flavor. Mexicans may use Opuntia as an alcoholic drink called colonche. In Sicily, a prickly pear-flavored liqueur called ficodi is produced, flavored somewhat like a medicinal aperitif. In Malta, a liqueur called bajtra (the Maltese name for prickly pear) is made from this fruit, which can be found growing wild in almost every field. On the island of Saint Helena, the prickly pear also gives its name to locally distilled liqueur, Tungi Spirit. =Fodder= The cattle industry of the Southwest United States has begun to cultivate O. ficus-indica as a fresh source of feed for cattle. The cactus is grown both as a feed source and a boundary fence. Cattle are fed the spineless variety of the cactus. The cactus pads are low in dry matter and crude protein, but useful as a supplement in drought conditions. In addition to the food value, the moisture content adequately eliminates watering the cattle during drought. Numerous wildlife species use the prickly pear for food. =Soil erosion prevention= Opuntia ficus-indica are planted in hedges to provide a cheap but effective erosion control in the Mediterranean basin. Under those hedges and adjacent areas soil physical properties, nitrogen and organic matter are considerably improved. Structural stability of the soil is enhanced, runoff and erosion are reduced, while water storage capacity and permeability is enhanced. Prickly pear plantations also have a positive impact on plant growth of other species by improving severe environmental conditions which facilitate colonization and development of herbaceous species. Opuntia ficus-indica is being advantageously used in Tunisia and Algeria to slow and direct sand movement and enhance the restoration of vegetative cover, minimizing deterioration of built terraces with its deep and strong rooting system.Nefzaoui, A., Ben Salem, H., & Inglese, P. (2001). \\"Opuntia-A strategic fodder and efficient tool to combat desertification in the Wana region.\\" Cactus, 73–89. =Other= The plant may be used as an ingredient in adobe to bind and waterproof roofs. O. ficus-indica (as well as other species in Opuntia and Nopalea) is cultivated in nopalries to serve as a host plant for cochineal insects, which produce desirable red and purple dyes, a practice dating to the pre-Columbian era. Mucilage from prickly pear may work as a natural, non-toxic dispersant for oil spills. In Mexico there is a semi- commercial pilot plant for biofuel production from opuntia biomass, in operation since 2016. CultivationDistribution= In Secunderabad, India. In Behbahan, Iran A commercial use for O. ficus-indica is for the large, sweet fruits, called tunas. Areas with significant tuna-growing cultivation include Mexico, the Mediterranean Basin, Middle East and northern Africa. The cactus grows wild and cultivated to heights of . In Namibia, O. ficus-indica is a common drought-resistant fodder plant. O. ficus-indica grows in many frost-free areas of the world, including the southern United States. Prickly pears are a massive weed problem for some parts of Australia, especially southeast Queensland, some inland parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and south-eastern and eastern South Australia. =Growth= The plant is considered an invasive species in northern Africa. Factors that limit the growth of prickly pear are rainfall, soil, atmospheric humidity and temperature.Monjauze, A. & Le Houérou, H. N. (1965). \\"Le rôle des Opuntia dans l’économie agricole nord africaine.\\" Bulletin de l’Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Agronomie de Tunis, 8–9: 85–164. The minimum rainfall requirement is 200mm per year as long as the soils are sandy and deep. The ideal growth conditions when it comes to rainfall are per year. O. ficus-indica is sensitive to lack of oxygen in the root zone, requiring well-drained soils. Opuntia ficus-indica is similar to CAM species which are not salt-tolerant in their root zone where growth may cease under high salt concentration. O. ficus-indica grows usually in regions where relative humidity is above 60% and saturation deficit occurs. O. ficus-indica is absent in regions where there is less than 40% humidity for more than a month. Mean daily temperature required to develop is at least 1.5-2 °C. At −10 to −12 °C, prickly pear growth is inhibited even if it is exposed to these temperatures only for a few minutes. The maximum temperature limit of prickly pear is above 50 °C. =Harvest and preparation= Fruits As the fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica are delicate, they need to be carefully harvested by hand. The small spines on the fruits are removed by rubbing them on an abrasive surface or sweeping them through grass. Before consumption, they are peeled and sliced. The pads of the plant (mainly used as fodder) also need to be harvested by hand. The pads are cut with a knife, detaching the pad from the plant in the joint. If Opuntia ficus-indica is cultivated for forage production, spineless cultivars are preferred. However, also wild types of the plants are used as fodder. In these cases, the spines need to be removed from the pads to avoid damage to the animals. Mostly, this is achieved by burning the spines off the pads. Nutrients and phytochemicals The coat of arms of Mexico depicts a Mexican golden eagle, perched upon an Opuntia cactus, holding a rattlesnake. Opuntia ficus-indica for human and animal consumption is valuable for its water content in an arid environment, containing about 85% water as a water source for wildlife. The seeds contain 3–10% of protein and 6–13% of fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid. As the fruit contains vitamin C (containing 25–30 mg per 100g), it was once used to mitigate scurvy. Opuntia contains selenium. The red color of the fruit and juice is due to betalains, (betanin and indicaxanthin). The plant also contains flavonoids, such as quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol. Biogeography DNA analysis indicated O. ficus-indica was domesticated from Opuntia species native to central Mexico. The Codex Mendoza, and other early sources, show Opuntia cladodes, as well as cochineal dye (which needs cultivated Opuntia), in Aztec tribute rolls. The plant spread to many parts of the Americas in pre-Columbian times, and since Columbus, has spread to many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean, where it has become naturalized.

Life Catroux was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne. He was the son of a career officer who had risen through the ranks. He was educated at the Prytanée National Militaire, and entered the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1896.Times obituary In the early years of his distinguished military career, Catroux moved from Algeria (where he met Charles de Foucauld and then Lyautey) to Indochina. In 1915, while commanding a battalion, he was taken prisoner by the Germans. During his time in captivity, Catroux met Charles de Gaulle, who was then a captain. After World War I, he became a member of the French military mission to Arabia, and then served in Morocco, Algeria and the Levant. In July 1939, Catroux was appointed Governor General of French Indochina, and in August 1939, one month before the declaration of war, took over from a senior civil servant, Jules Brévié. Paris wanted to send a strong signal to the Far East on the eve of hostilities. However, after the first Japanese ultimatum of 17 June 1940, and following disagreements with the new Vichy government, Catroux was ordered to hand over his post to Admiral Jean Decoux on 25 June. He initially ignored the order, and only resigned on 20 July. He then chose to join de Gaulle, who was by now leader of the Free France movement. As a five-star general,equivalent to an American four-star general Catroux was the most senior officer of the French Army to transfer allegiance. Damascus to the Allies, late June 1941. A car carrying the Free French commanders, General Georges Catroux and General Paul Louis Le Gentilhomme, enters the city. They are escorted by French Gardes Tcherkess (Circassian cavalry). De Gaulle appointed him High Commissioner to the Levant in 1941. He took control of Syria for the Free French after the defeat of Vichy General Henri Dentz and the Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre. Shortly after taking up the post, Catroux, in the name of the Free French movement, recognised the independence of Syria. De Gaulle subsequently appointed him Governor General of Algeria in 1943-44. Officially honored as a French liberation fighter, Catroux was Minister for North Africa in the first government of Charles de Gaulle from 9 September 1944 to 21 October 1945, and became ambassador to the USSR in 1945-48. After the unrest in Morocco, Catroux negotiated the return of the sultan Mohammed V in 1955. As Resident Minister in Algeria for the government of Guy Mollet in 1956, he was unable to take up his post because of demonstrations in Algiers by French residents on 6 February. Catroux presided over a board of inquiry, the Catroux Commission, that investigated the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. He was also the judge in the military tribunal which tried the generals involved in the Algiers putsch of 1961. He died in Paris in 1969.

It was built in 1970 in honour of Swami Vivekananda who is said to have attained enlightenment on the rock. According to local legends, it was on this rock that Goddess Kumari performed tapas in devotion of lord Shiva. A meditation hall known as Dhyana Mandapam is also attached to the memorial for visitors to meditate. The design of the mandapa incorporates different styles of temple architecture from all over India. The rocks are surrounded by the Laccadive Sea. The memorial consists of two main structures, the Vivekananda Mandapam and the Shripada Mandapam.  Initiation of the Memorial  In January 1962, on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda's birth centenary, a group of people formed the Kanyakumari Committee whose objective was to put up a memorial on the rock and a pedestrian bridge leading to the rock. Almost simultaneously, the Ramakrishna Mission in Madras planned about this memorial. Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Kanyakumari However, this news was not taken in good taste by a sizable population of the local Catholic fishermen. They put up a big Cross on the Rock, visible from the shore. This led to protests by the Hindu population who said the Rock was a place of worship for Hindus. A judicial probe ordered by the Madras (now Tamil Nadu) government stated in unequivocal terms that the rock was Vivekananda Rock, and that the Cross was a trespass. Amid all this acrimony, the Cross was removed secretly in the night. The situation turned volatile and the Rock was declared a prohibited area with armed guards patrolling it. The Government realised that the Rock was turning into an area of dispute with Hindus claiming it to be the Vivekananda Rock and Christians that it was St. Xavier's Rock. It decreed that although the rock was Vivekananda Rock, there would be no memorial constructed on it. The then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri M. Bhaktavatsalam, said that only a tablet declaring that the rock was associated with Swami Vivekananda could be put up, and nothing else. With government permission, the tablet was installed on the Rock on 17 January 1963.  Role of Eknath Ranade  The first step Eknath Ranade took on being asked to take charge of the Rock Memorial work, was to ascertain that this effort had the full support of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. He was made the Organising Secretary of the Vivekananda Rock Memorial Committee so that he was officially in charge of the Rock Memorial mission. The immediate obstacles were Bhaktavatsalam's stand that he would not allow the memorial to come up as Humayun Kabir, the Union Minister for Cultural Affairs, had said that the natural beauty of the Rock would be spoiled. Kabir's constituency was Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). When Ranade publicised in Kolkata, that it was Kabir who was against the creation of Memorial of one of the greatest sons of Bengal, there was such a hue and cry that Kabir had to do a volte-face. However, to prevail over Bhaktavatsalam, only Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's support would do. To that end, on Lal Bahadur Shastri's advice, Ranade camped in Delhi. In three days, he collected the signatures of 323 Members of Parliament in a show of all-round support for the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, which was presented to the Prime Minister. Bhaktavatsalam had no option now but to allow the construction of the Rock Memorial. Bhaktavatsalam had given permission only for a small 15’ x 15’ shrine. Knowing his reverence for the Paramacharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, Ranade approached the latter for suggesting the design of the Rock Memorial. Bhaktavatsalam unhesitatingly agreed to the larger design (130’-1½\\" x 56’)approved by the Paramacharya. Once all the political hurdles were removed, construction was underway. Ranade was in the forefront facing all the challenges that came his way: to establish scientifically that the Rock was structurally sound and could support such a huge structure on it; the logistics of quarrying and transporting large blocks of stone from great distances, and from the shore to the Rock; provision of water and power supplies; the growing demand for skilled artisans, craftsmen, and labor; building of jetty platforms on the rock and the shore (the pedestrian footbridge idea to the Rock was dropped); the de-silting around the jetty platform areas to enable bigger crafts to approach the shore, and so on. The biggest and ever-present challenge, however, was that of financing the whole operation. Ranade's belief in the success of the Rock Memorial mission was so strong, that he never slowed the pace of work when funds were in paucity. He brushed aside the discouragement of others whose belief was not as strong and started a fund-campaign. Ranade believed that as the Vivekananda Rock Memorial was a national monument, every Indian should be invited to contribute to its construction. He approached almost every State government and asked for their contribution, making a special effort to go to the north- eastern states of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh so that they could also feel a part of the national endeavor. But the bulk of the contributions came from the general public. Ranade launched the campaign of one-rupee folders throughout the nation, which was used to mobilize the donations of the common man, starting from as tiny an amount as a rupee. Thus so many people visiting the Rock Memorial could feel with justified pride that they too had contributed to that monument. Within the unbelievably short period of six years, the Vivekananda Rock Memorial was inaugurated in 1970 and dedicated to the nation. The Living Memorial Vivekananda Rock Memorial on a 1996 stamp of India The establishment of Vivekananda Kendra—the Living Memorial alongside the stone structure of the Rock Memorial—was mentioned in 1964. After the groundwork of about nine years, Vivekananda Kendra was officially founded on 7 January 1972 (the 108th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda by the Hindu calendar). On that day, as the sun rose, a saffron flag with Om inscribed on it was unfurled on the Vivekananda Rock Memorial to celebrate the founding of the Vivekananda Kendra: a spiritually oriented service mission of non-monastic order. The tradition of penance was to be continued by young men and women coming as Karyakartas of Vivekananda Kendra to spread the following message of Swami Vivekananda: The twin objectives of Vivekananda Kendra are man-making and nation-building. Shri Eknath Ranade decided that Vivekananda Kendra was to be a cadre-based organisation. Young men and women whose hearts long to serve the nation would be provided the opportunity and the right platform to serve God in man. When Swami Vivekananda Rock Memorial was blueprinted, it was modeled by E. Thanumalayan, a student of the S. T. Hindu College, Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu. He modeled it with paraffin wax. The Memorial is the fusion of West Bengal and Tamil Nadu architecture and the design of Ramakrishna Math, Belur, West Bengal. He was deeply appreciated by the then Madras Chief Minister Bhaktavatsalam for its aesthetic quality. Vivekananda Mandapam This Mandapam, which is erected in honour of Vivekananda consists of the following sections: *Dhyana Mandapam is the meditation Hall with six adjacent rooms. *Sabha Mandapam is the Assembly Hall consists Pralima Mandapam (statue section) two rooms, a corridor and an open prakaram(outer courtyard) round the Sabha Mandapam. *Mukha Mandapam *Namashtubhyam to the Son of jagadamba This is the place where he got his aim of life. *Mata Parvati called him to come there and to know the truth of India i.e., what was the glory of India, reasons for its downfall, and how it can be elevated. Shripada Mandapam This square hall consists of the following structures. *Garbha Graham *Inner Prakaram *Outer Prakaram *Outer Platform Both the Mandapams are so designed that the vision of Vivekananda in the statue would be seen direct towards the Shripadam. There is also Sri Padaparai Mandapam which is a shrine erected at the spot where the footprint of the Virgin Goddess is seen on the rock. The statue of Swami Vivekananda was sculpted by Narayanrao Sonawdekar, an emminent sculptor and a professor at the famed J. J. School of Arts, Mumbai.

Biography Giovanni Gaspare Lanfranco was born in Parma, the third son of Stefano and Cornelia Lanfranchi, and was placed as a page in the household of Count Orazio Scotti. His talent for drawing allowed him to begin an apprenticeship with the Bolognese artist Agostino Carracci, brother of Annibale Carracci, working alongside fellow Parmese Sisto Badalocchio in the local Farnese palaces. When Agostino died in 1602, both young artists moved to Annibale's large and prominent Roman workshop, which was then involved in working on the Galleria Farnese in the Palazzo Farnese gallery ceiling. Lanfranco is considered to have contributed to the panel of Polyphemus and Galatea (replica in Doria Gallery) and some minor works in the room. Afterwards, while still technically a member of the Carracci studio of Carracci, Lanfranco, along with Guido Reni and Francesco Albani, frescoed the Herrera (San Diego) Chapel in San Giacomo degli Spagnoli (1602–1607). He also participated in the fresco decoration of San Gregorio Magno and of the Cappella Paolina in Santa Maria Maggiore. Independent work Giovanni Lanfranco, Resurrection, 1622 Annunciation, between 1610 and 1630 (Hermitage Museum) By 1605, Lanfranco was obtaining some independent commissions; for example, he contributed paintings to the Camerino degli Eremiti in the Palazzetto Farnese (also known as Casino della Morte), once a low building on the Via Giulia, adjacent to the church of Santa Maria dell’Orazione e Morte. The camerino had been constructed by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, next to his palace and gardens, and was destroyed in 1734 to allow for the construction of the aforementioned church. Of the canvases and frescoes by Domenichino, Girolamo Pulzone, Paul Bril, and Lanfranco, some are conserved in the new church. Among other works, Lanfranco contributed to this series, the eccentric Translation of the Magdalen.Now in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples; see Smith & O'Neil p. 484-6 After the death of Annibale Carracci in 1609, and with the Emilian school of painting temporarily out of favor, Lanfranco returned to his native Parma for two years. There, he met Bartolomeo Schedoni and painted the altarpiece for the Ognissanti church. Lanfranco also produced paintings and altarpieces in Orvieto, Vallerano, Leonessa and Fermo. Return to Rome After his return to Rome by 1612, Lanfranco and competed with other Carracci students and assistants—including Reni, Albani, and Domenichino—for Roman patronage. Reni, however, was soon to depart for Naples and then Bologna. During the following decades in Rome, through the 1620s, Lanfranco and Domenichino engaged in a rivalry for the main fresco commissions. A measure of the competition can be gauged from Lanfranco's public accusation, not wholly without merit, that Domenichino had plagiarized Agostino Carracci in his painting of the Confession of St. Jerome, now in the Vatican. Unlike Domenichino, Lanfranco was fairly eclectic in terms of style but preferred a visionary, theatrical approach suitable for the ceiling paintings gaining currency in the early 17th century. His works suggest some influence from the late work of Ludovico Carracci, a cousin of Agostino and Annibale, and possibly from Caravaggio (as, for example, in the altarpiece depicting the Inspiration of Saint Luke at Piacenza(1611)), though the stylistic importance of Caravaggio to Lanfranco has been disputed. In other works, he assimilated and adapted the style of his compatriot and predecessor of the 16th century, Antonio Correggio, as in his Adoration of the Shepherds painted before 1608 for the Marchese Clemente Sannesi and his brother the Cardinal Jacopo. In the 'teens, Lanfranco's studio became quite active, painting frescoes in the Palazzo Mattei and decorating the Buongiovanni Chapel in Sant'Agostino (1616), which includes a Correggesque Assumption, along with easel paintings. His Annunciation (1615) in San Carlo ai Catinari in regarded as one of his best works. Soon, Lanfranco became the pre-eminent painter of circle of Pope Paul V. He painted frescoes for the Palazzo Costaguti and a large ceiling fresco in quadratura at the Villa Borghese, The Gods of Olympus or also called Council of the Gods. Giovane nudo sul letto con un gatto (Nude young man with a cat), between 1620 and 1622, private collection. In the following year, Lanfranco together with Agostino Tassi and Carlo Saraceni decorated the Sala de' Corazzieri and Sala Regia of the Palazzo del Quirinale. His formal Presentation at the Temple has the sunlit Carraci-like style. In 1622, he painted the Ectasy of Saint Margaret of Cortona (Galleria Platina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence) as an altarpiece for Santa Maria Nuova in Cortona, where Margaret lived and died. The painting could well have inspired the pose in Bernini's famous St Theresa in ecstasy. In 1623–1624, he decorated the Sacchetti Chapel in San Giovanni dei FiorentiniSmith & O'Neil p490-92 in Rome. While Paul V's successor, Gregory XV, preferred works by Guercino and Domenichino, Lanfranco won commissions for the Crucifix Chapel in Santa Maria in Vallicella. Lanfranco's crowning masterpiece, however, and one of the major church fresco decoration of the late 1620s, was his Assumption of the Virgin frescoed on the dome of Sant'Andrea della Valle. Completed in 1627 in sotto in su perspective, the crowded array of figures is a landmark in Baroque painting with bright golden coloration and energy. Lanfranco was influenced by Correggio's pioneering decoration of the Duomo di Parma. Council of the Gods, ceiling in Palazzo Barberini Frescoed Cupula of Sant'Andrea della Valle. Urban VIII commissioned him a large fresco portraying St. Peter Walking on Waters (1628, now fragmentary), for which Lanfranco gained the title of Knight of the Order of Christ. In 1631, Lanfranco was named Prince (Principe) of the Academy of Saint Luke, the artist's guild in Rome. There is also a fresco by Giovanni Lanfranco above the monument of Pope Clement VIII in Santa Maria Maggiore in (Rome). From 1634 to 1646, Lanfranco began decorating the dome and pendentives of the Jesuit church of the Gesù Nuovo in Naples in 1634–1637. In 1637–1638, he frescoed the nave and choir of the Certosa of San Martino. This was followed by the decoration of Santi Apostoli in 1638-1646 and the dome of the Cappella of San Gennaro in the Cathedral of Naples. These works would invigorate the efforts of the grand manner Napolitan painters of the second half of the 17th century: Preti, Giordano and Solimena.Wittkower p 357 He died in Rome in 1647, where his last work was apse of San Carlo ai Catinari. Legacy and critical assessment Lanfranco was a versatile and eclectic trainee of the Carracci, and continued their tradition with dramatic flair compared to the often restrained Domenichino, who mimicked mainly Annibale's grand manner. Lanfranco explored new styles, bridged traditions, painted in both mannerist and baroque styles, using a tenebrist and the colorist palette. Among his pupils was Giacinto Brandi.

Based in the Odin Teatret, Denmark, the organization has the nature of an itinerant university whose central field of study and research is theatre anthropology, the multi-cultural study of acting techniques. History Founded in 1979 by Eugenio Barba, the ISTA has functioned as a laboratory of theatre in the spirit of Grotowski theatre, though broader and more inclusive. ISTA researches the technical aspect of the performer's art by empirical methods to further the understanding of the fundamental principles which engender the performers' particular being and energy. This way of being, referred to as \\"presence\\" or \\"scenic life\\", is paradoxical. The 'daily' organic being is transmuted through often rigorous execution of techniques—which share a number of common features across a multitude of traditions—to come alive and new in the moment of performance once again, but at a higher level of energy. The study of the common features of theatrical tradition in different cultures can facilitate the performance of the actor or actress.  Principles  Considering acting techniques around the world, Barba observed that the 'extra-daily' life of the performers is the result of alterations in the performers' balance, producing the appearance of a separate, unconscious autonomy. Administration Eugenio Barba serves as the director of ISTA. Each session of the school focuses on a different aspect or theme, which is investigated by means of workshops and classes. Lectures and demonstrations are also used, as are theatrical performances. Before these sessions begin, the attendees are selected from applicants who have shown an interest to attend, participate, or simply observe. These applicants represent various fields and include choreographers, performers, directors, scholars and critics. The ISTA is essentially a network of contacts between interested parties with a permanent core of professors and performers from many universities in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. The work of the ISTA continues outside of the sessions in the form of research and continued contact, exchanges and initiatives among and between its members. The results of the work and study are collected, interpreted and disseminated by and within the framework of the University of Eurasian Theatre.

On 14 March 2010, Alpha TV ranked her the 13th top-certified female artist in the nation's phonographic era (since 1960).Chart Show: Your Countdown. Alpha TV. Airdate: 14 March 2010  Biography  Early years = Vicky Moscholiou was born during the German Occupation of Greece, a time of hardship and privation. Her family lived in one room. Her father worked in the vegetable market, and her mother suffered from consumption and received a small allowance. They managed to scrape together the money for a plot of land in Upper Agia Varvara and build a home there. Two more children followed, a brother and sister. > \\"Agia Varvara then, and especially where we lived, was empty.

Translated from the Greek by Pavlos Andronikos. Her grandfather and grandmother worked at the National Theatre of Greece. He did the lighting, she the costumes. Moscholiou would go with her grandfather and watch the shows. She dreamed of being an actress, but ended up a singer. Her first break came in 1962 through the intervention of her cousin Effie Linda. Grigoris Bithikotsis remembers how she came to him and asked him to audition Moscholiou when he was rehearsing for a season at Vasilis Cheilas’ club Triana. They arranged a time but Bithikotsis arrived late and nearly missed her. > \\"You know, if I’d been stopped by traffic lights that afternoon, Vicky > Moscholiou might not have become a singer.

Thanks to Bithikotsis, Moscholiou was hired to perform at the Triana. However this was only a small start. She was given a song to sing occasionally, and acknowledged that she learned much from Bithikotsis and Doukissa, with whom she worked. = Career and commercial success = She rose to fame in 1964 with Stavros Xarhakos' song \\"Hathike to feggari\\" (The Moon is Lost), which was composed for the movie Lola. According to Bithikotsis, the composer Xarhakos told Bithikotsis he needed a singer with a different kind of voice for a particular song. Bithikotsis suggested he try Moscholiou, and took her along to be auditioned. However, Giorgos Zampetas remembers things differently. > \\"One day Stavros Xarhakos came to the shop. Lambropoulos had instructed him > to get Moscholiou to sing a song in a film. He fancied her a lot. We > regarded her as just a 200 drachma singer. I took 850 drachmas and > Bithikotsis—I don’t know.

Moscholiou continued with collaborations with Giorgos Zambetas, Manos Eleutheriou, Giorgos Katsaros, Akis Panou, and Loukianos Kilaidonis, among other well-known composers and songwriters. Songs she was famous for include \\"Paei, paei\\", \\"Aliti\\", \\"Pou pas choris agapi\\", \\"Nautis bgike sti steria\\", \\"Ta deilina\\", \\"Oi metanastes\\", and \\"Anthropoi monachoi\\". Two of her hits gave their names to night clubs in Athens, \\"Deilina\\" (Dusks) and \\"Ximeromata\\" (Daybreaks). She was one of the first in Greece to sing both in night clubs and concerts, and she also sang in the royal courts of Greece, Persia and Jordan.

Originally on the A41 road, there is now a bypass. Bickleywood is a very small settlement about 1 km to the east. The settlement of No Man's Heath was, historically, largely within the boundaries of Macefen civil parish until 2015 boundary changes which created the civil parish of No Man's Heath and District.No Man's Heath & District, GENUKI There is no church in the village, due to the proximity of the church in Tushingham. However, there are The Wheatsheaf Inn, a disused non-conformist chapel and a small telephone exchange (which was called \\"Noman's Heath\\" in the days when exchanges had names) in close proximity to one another. The southern section of the 30-mile Sandstone Trail footpath passes just east of the village, while the 200-mile Marches Way footpath passes just south. The Sustrans Regional Route 70 cycleway passes through the village, running out from Malpas. Just over two miles east of the village is the 19th century Cholmondeley Castle and gardens. Just to the north is the well-preserved Iron Age hillfort of Maiden Castle, spectacularly sited above the Dee valley. The Whitchurch and Tattenhall Railway used to pass within a kilometre of the village but the nearest station was Malpas railway station which was nearly three kilometres away and actually in Hampton Heath.

Kelly featured for clubs Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers, Leicester City, Notts County, Bournemouth, Kettering Town and Torquay United. Club career Kelly was born in Glasgow and played for local side Possilpark Depot, before moving south to join English club Arsenal as an apprentice in July 1966; he turned professional 18 months later. A regular in the reserves and for Scotland U-23 side, he made his debut for Arsenal on 6 September 1969 against Sheffield Wednesday and quickly made a name for himself. He made 16 appearances in the 1969–70 season, including scoring a goal in the Gunners' 4–3 aggregate win over Anderlecht in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final. Better was to come the next season for the young central midfielder. Kelly made 34 appearances as Arsenal won the Double; he came on as a substitute in the FA Cup final against Liverpool, and scored the Gunners' equaliser in extra time in a goalmouth scramble. George Graham made a claim for the goal, but the replays show Kelly was the last Arsenal player to touch the ball. Kelly was thus the first substitute to score in an FA Cup final.Firsts, Lasts & Onlys - Paul Donnelley (Bounty Books, 2012) Charlie George scored soon after to win the match 2–1. Injury hampered Kelly's next two seasons at Arsenal, but he became a near-ever present in 1974–75. He was made club captain at the age of 23; only Tony Adams has captained Arsenal at a younger age. However, Kelly lost his place the following season and became quite unsettled. After making a transfer request, he joined Queens Park Rangers in September 1976, having played 222 times and scoring nine goals altogether for Arsenal. Kelly spent only a single season at QPR before being signed for Leicester City by former Arsenal and QPR teammate Frank McLintock in the summer of 1977. He spent three seasons at Filbert Street, playing 119 times and scoring 3 goals. Leicester were relegated to the Second Division in 1978 but then returned to the top flight as champions the following year. He went on to have short spells at Notts County, Bournemouth and Torquay United, before retiring. International career Kelly featured for Scotland's Under 19 and Under 23 teams.

Aloud's touring members and friends appeared as guests on several tracks, with Daskivich tackling the majority of the drumming on Exile. The group worked on the record song by song, often building instrumentation around an acoustic guitar. As a result, the record featured material that was sparser and far more experimental than previous albums. The songs loosely drew upon de la Osa and Beguiristain's respective experiences as US-born children of Cuban exiles. Further inspiration was taken from Reinaldo Arenas’ memoir, Before Night Falls.Two for the Road, Boston Globe, 2010-09-17 Aloud launched their first crowdfunding campaign on the Kickstarter platform to pay for manufacturing of the record and defray costs associated with the tour in support of the album.

The recording reunited de la Osa and Beguiristain with Ross Lohr in the studio. Aloud celebrated the single's release with a tour of the south and midwest, followed by a month-long residency in Boston. De la Osa and Beguiristain were approached earlier in the year by the Berklee College of Music to participate in BANDED, a documentary intended to become a part of the school's PULSE curriculum. The months-long project followed them and four other groups from the Boston area to document the life of a song, from its genesis to completion in the recording studio.Banded: Behind the Making of a Song, Berklee College of Music The project culminated with the recording of \\"You Will Know\\" at Mad Oak Studios with head engineer Benny Grotto. Grotto encouraged Aloud to record the song as live as possible in the studio.Aloud presents their 4th record, It's Got To Be Now, Kickstarter The band found the experience enjoyable and booked a second session with Grotto at Mad Oak to record \\"Such a Long Time\\" in the same manner. = 2012-2015: A rock n’ roll band making music live = De la Osa and Beguiristain spent January and February 2012 writing new material for a follow-up to Exile. They resumed their tour schedule in March and began road-testing material which would eventually make up It’s Got To Be Now. In March they performed at Boston to Austin, a SXSW party produced by DigBoston and sponsored by Converse. There, they shared the stage with other Boston-based acts OldJack, Lake Street Dive, Bad Rabbits, The Wandas, and Moe Pope & Quills. Aloud recording It's Got To Be Now at Mad Oak Studios. The majority of the album was recorded live in this configuration. To mark their tenth anniversary as a band, the Boston Phoenix released a 10th anniversary EP collecting songs which “define the band’s evolution over the past decade”. A retrospective film directed by Stephen LoVerme, titled Aloud: I Can’t Believe That Worked, began production. Though the film was indefinitely shelved, a trailer was included with the release of the Boston Phoenix EP. The group was nominated in the Boston Phoenix's Best Music Poll for Best Indie/Powerpop Act. Frank Hegyi joined as Aloud's permanent drummer in June 2012. Aloud continued touring throughout the summer and fall, debuting and refining songs. “You Will Know” was formally released as a 7-inch vinyl single in September, with “Such A Long Time” as its b-side.  It's Got To Be Now  Aloud returned to Mad Oak Studios with co- producer Benny Grotto in December 2012. In the same fashion as “Such A Long Time”, their performances were recorded live in the studio. To maintain the live element, percussionist Andy Wong was invited to record miscellaneous percussion with the band. Vocals were recorded at Serious Business in New York under the supervision of co-producer Charles Newman. Additional overdubs were tracked at Mad Oak Studios with Grotto in January 2013. In sum, the album took six days total to record. “This is what we’ve set out to make here,” the band wrote to fans at the time, “an album that sounds like a band playing music in a room together.” It’s Got To Be Now’s first single, “A Little Bit Low”, was released in December 2013. The release of “A Little Bit Low” launched a Kickstarter campaign to help bring the album to completion. It’s Got To Be Now was released on April 1, 2014, to positive reception. The band toured on the record throughout the east coast, releasing four singles through the life of the album. In February 2015, Aloud recorded a Converse Rubber Tracks session at Q Division Studios with Benny Grotto. The session yielded basic tracks for the songs “Empty House” and “Falling Out of Love”. Frank Hegyi departed the band in May 2015. His final appearance with the band was on an episode of The Steve Katsos Show. According to Beguiristain, Hegyi simply felt it was time for him to step away from the band. “Having [Frank] around was pretty vital to us feeling good about being band at a time when we needed it,” he wrote in a post on Aloud's website. “We owe him for that, and we’re very grateful he decided to stick around as long as he did.” = 2015-present: Virtual reality and \\"BOS to LOS\\" = Chuck Ferreira became Aloud's drummer after Hegyi's departure. The band maintained an active tour schedule while working on new music for their next record. In October, they returned to the CMJ Music Marathon. In January 2016, the band released a live video for the song \\"In Spite of Language\\" for NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest.  FOOL VR  In April 2016, Aloud announced they would collaborate on a virtual reality music video with director Skye Von, producer Tanya Leal-Soto, and Charles Newman. FOOL VR, as the collective was dubbed, partnered with the New York Institute of Technology, Evolving Technologies Corporation, and others to create a 360-degree video for the Aloud song \\"Falling Out of Love\\". A crowdfunding campaign was launched in April 2016 to help fund the production. Aloud toured and held events in New England, New York, and the west coast that spring to promote the project and demonstrate the technology using Mobile phones and Google Cardboard. Falling Out of Love: The VR Experience won Indiegogo and Independent film project's 2016 Fellowship. Falling Out of Love: The VR Experience is currently in post-production. A 360° music video for \\"The Wicked Kind\\", another FOOL VR project directed by Skye Von, debuted September 2016 as an official selection of the Kaleidoscope 2016 Summer Showcase. The video toured with the showcase through North America, Europe, and Asia.  Fifth Studio album and \\"Agua Mala\\"  Aloud began work on their fifth studio album at the rebuilt Mad Oak Studios in Allston in August 2016, with Benny Grotto producing again. The band posted realtime updates from the studio via their Instagram account. Their next album is set to feature a sound more heavily rooted in Memphis soul. The record is currently being mixed by Guy Massey, known for his work with The Libertines, Ray Davies, and The Beatles. In February 2017, Aloud released the charity single “Agua Mala”, recorded in conjunction with NYC-based group Cold Blood Club. All proceeds from sales of the single and the release show at the Knitting Factory were sent to the United Way of Genesee County's Flint Water Fund to aid their work in the Flint water crisis. \\"Almost three years later,\\" de la Osa remarked at the time, \\"and nothing significant has improved. Flint is still without clean drinking water and [there's] very little accountability. This shit makes you want to scream.\\"  Empty House tour and move to Los Angeles  Shortly after the release of “Agua Mala”, Aloud announced they were permanently relocating the band from Boston to Los Angeles. Their Boston-area send-off was on March 4, 2017 at the Plough and Stars, performing with Peter Buzzelle. \\"Boston is the only place which, for better or for worse, has ever truly felt like home to me,\\" Beguiristain wrote in a blog post, however adding that Boston had \\"become a tough place to live in, let alone maintain a functioning, working band.\\" A coast-to-coast US tour in support of the “Empty House”/”Falling Out of Love” double A-side vinyl single kicked off April 24, 2017 in New York. For the tour, Aloud partnered with the San Francisco-based Acid VR to document the tour with a Ricoh Theta 360° camera. A 360° video of Aloud rehearsing “Empty House” was released ahead of the Empty House tour. A 360° video for an acoustic version of “Falling Out of Love” performed at the Griffith Park Zoo was released at the tour's conclusion. A music video for \\"Falling Out of Love\\" was released on February 14, 2018, to coincide with the song's full release.

The duo consisted of Cyril Bodin and Gregory Louis. Paperwork submitted by Bodin and Louis to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (SN: 76580505) is open to the public and can be viewed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The main argument was in first use dates. Bodin and Louis listed September 23, 2003 as the date of first use. De la Osa and Beguiristain argued their first use in commerce of the name “Aloud” had been used prior (May, 2002). Bodin and Louis' application has remained in stasis January 21, 2005. However, Bodin and Louis broke the group up in 2005, making the point moot and clearing the way for the American 'Aloud' to use the name without any foreseeable hindrance.

It has about 2,800 inhabitants. It lies in the foothills of Golden Mountains. The centre of the town is historically significant and is protected by law as Urban monument zone. Administrative parts Villages of Bílý Potok, Horní Hoštice, Travná and Zálesí are administrative parts of Javorník. HistoryEarly history= Village of Javorník was first mentioned in a written document from 1290, however it was probably established before 1260. The medieval fortress, which would later become castle Jánský Vrch was built at the turn of the 13th and 14th century and was first mentioned in 1307. It belonged to the principality of Neisse-Grottkau, which was under the rule of the prince-bishops of Breslau. From 1428 to 1432, during the Hussite Wars, Javorník and its fort were under siege by the Hussites. They left the village and the fortress in ruins, and it was not until the early 16th century when Jan Thurzo, Prince-Bishop of Breslau, built the Jánský Vrch Castle on the remains of the old stronghold of Jauernig. During his reign Javorník gained importance as a mining settlement as several silver and iron ore mines were established in the area. In 1549 the village finally became a town and a first school was also established. Unfortunately, in 1576 the town’s growth was hampered as it was ravaged by a fire. The devastation was minor however, compare to the destruction Javorník experienced during the Thirty Years War, especially then in 1646. The settlement was nearly completely destroyed and it was not until eight years later that Javorník became once again a prosperous town, now with a church, school, town hall and a brewery. =Golden Age= After the Prussian victory in the First Silesian War in 1742, Austria lost nearly all of its Silesian possessions. However, Javorník together with the so-called Bohemian Silesia remained under Habsburg control. This was a prosperous period for the town. In 1748, Javorník became the seat of the Breslau diocese responsible for the administration of all its properties in the Freiwaldau region and since 1767 also the center of Habsburg government for the principality of Neisse-Grottkau. At the same time, Count Philipp Gotthard of Schaffgotsch, the prince-bishop of Breslau moved his court on the Jánský vrch and with him Javorník became also the cultural center of Upper Silesia. Among the most famous personalities living there was August Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, renowned Viennese composer and violinist. By 1804, Javorník had 419 homes and over 3100 citizens, more than any other urban area in the region. =19th and early 20th century= In 1825 a devastating fire once again ravaged the town, destroying 104 of its structures including the town hall, church and most of its industry. Although Javorník was rebuilt, it never regained the same importance in the region as it had during the golden age in the second half of the 18th century. Most of the textile, brewing and manufacturing industries never fully recovered and the town became once again dependent on forestry and mining, chiefly of silver, arsenic and iron. In 1897, Javorník was linked with the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by a local railway, but even that did not revitalize the town's industries or its overall growth. In 1880 Javorník had the population of 3,362 citizens, all were German-speaking. This number continued to decline throughout the first quarter of the 20th century. During WWII, approximately 30 French and Soviet POWs were interned at the old town prison in Javorník. Other and larger POW Camps were located in Zálesí, Travná, Račí údolí and the nearby Bernartice.1\\\\. Zuber, Rudolf: Zajatecké tábory na Jesenicku za druhé světové války.

According to the Austrian census of 1910 the town had 2,052 inhabitants, 1,956 of whom had permanent residence there. Census asked people for their native language, 1,956 (100%) were German-speaking. Most populous religious group were Roman Catholics with 2,019 (98.4%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volkszählung vom 31. Dezember 1910 in Schlesien, Troppau 1912. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. By 1938, local ethnic-German population became overwhelmingly pro-Nazi with many locals joining the Sudetendeutsches Freikorps, a para-military Nazi-Germany sponsored and trained organization that was conducting terrorist attacks against the Czechoslovak authorities. One of the most notable attacks of the Freikorps in the town took place on 22 September 1938. A group of 12 members of the Czechoslovak Border Guard was retreating through the town after being attacked from Germany when it was ambushed by over 100 local members of Freikorps. The Czechoslovak soldiers were disarmed and abducted to Germany where they were interned by local authorities in the concentration camp in Paczków. =Post-WWII years= After 1945, under the Beneš decrees most Sudeten Germans were forced to leave Czechoslovakia. Most citizens of Javorník were evicted from their homes and held at several internment camps in the Freiwaldau district. Many of them were also beaten and killed by numerous militias and paramilitary groups with strong ties to the Communist Party and the Red Army.Documents on the Expulsion of the Sudeten Germans: Survivors speak out However, scores of families from Javorník were able to leave with the assistance of Cardinal Adolf Bertram and the Wittelsbachs, a noble German family that owned several properties in the area. They worked tirelessly to save many ethnic German families; helping them to flee Czechoslovakia to the British and US Zones in Germany and Austria. The majority of the German population was expelled from Javorník by 1947. Their property was given or sold to the Czech and Slovak citizens under the repopulation programs of the Czechoslovak government. Following the Communist coup d'état of 1948, Czechoslovakian government confiscated most of the property which belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and the prince-bishops of Breslau, including their farmland and forest holdings. Most of the businesses closed and were moved to larger cities in the region. By the mid-1960s, the only major employers in Javorník were Jednotné zemědělské družstvo (agricultural cooperative), small manufacturer of metal furniture and a company producing stuffed toys. As the social conditions in the town continued to deteriorate, in the mid-1980s the Communist government decided to build a subsidiary of MEZ Postrelmov, one of the oldest companies in Northern Moravia, in Javornik. Unfortunately after the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the company found it hard to compete in the new economic environment and closed down in early 1990s. Present As of 2008, the town of Javorník had one primary school and two kindergartens, a health centre (with two general physicians) and several leisure facilities, including a movie theatre, library and a swimming pool.

It was the band's second studio album and the first to feature Damo Suzuki after the 1970 departure of previous vocalist Malcolm Mooney. Recorded in a rented castle near Cologne, the album features long-form experimental tracks blending funk rhythms, avant-garde noise, jazz improvisation, and electronic tape editing techniques. Tago Mago has been described as Can's best and most extreme record in sound and structure. The album has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists. Drowned in Sound called it \\"arguably the most influential rock album ever recorded.\\" Recording and production After Malcolm Mooney left Can in 1970 the remaining members were left without a vocalist.Stubbs, David. \\"CAN - Tago Mago\\". CAN remastered - Tago Mago (CD liner notes). September 2004. Bassist Holger Czukay happened to meet Kenji \\"Damo\\" Suzuki when the latter was busking outside a cafe in Munich. He introduced himself as a member of an experimental rock band and invited Suzuki to join them. That evening, Suzuki performed with the band at the \\"Blow Up Club\\" and subsequently became a member of Can. Tago Mago was recorded in 1971 by Czukay in Schloss Nörvenich, a castle near Cologne. Early in 1968 the band had been invited to stay there for a year without paying rent by the art collector Christoph Vohwinkel, who had rented the castle with the idea of transforming it into an art centre. Recording took three months to complete,Cope, p. 55 with sessions often lasting up to sixteen hours a day. Czukay would edit these long, disorganized jams into structured songs.Cope, p. 57 Czukay used only two two-track tape recorders to capture the sessions. Because of the limits of two-track recording the group favoured the castle's high-ceilinged entrance hall, an architectural reverb chamber, using the natural acoustics and placing the microphones optimally relative to their instruments. Due to the intense reverberation, Czukay took advantage of the sonic bleed and limited the band to three microphones, shared between vocalist Damo Suzuki and drummer Jaki Liebezeit. Keyboardist Irmin Schmidt experimented with sine-wave generators and oscillators in place of typical synthesizers on \\"Aumgn\\". This was the first of Can's albums to be made from not only regularly recorded music, but combined \\"in-between-recordings\\", where Czukay secretly recorded the musicians jamming during pre-production sessions. Additionally, Czukay captured in-between-recordings of the shouts of a child who mistakenly burst into the room during recording, as well as the howling from a dog belonging to Vohwinkel. According to Czukay, the album was named after Isla de Tagomago, an island off the east coast of Ibiza. It was originally released as a double LP in 1971 by United Artists. Music Schloss Nörvenich, where Tago Mago was recorded Julian Cope wrote in Krautrocksampler that Tago Mago \\"sounds only like itself, like no-one before or after\\", and described the lyrics as delving \\"below into the Unconscious\\". Dummy called it \\"a genre-defining work of psychedelic, experimental rock music.\\" Critic Simon Reynolds described the record's sound as \\"shamanic avant-funk.\\" Tago Mago finds Can changing to a jazzier and more experimental sound than previous recordings, with longer instrumental interludes and fewer vocals; this shift was caused by the dramatic difference between Suzuki and the band's more dominant ex-singer Mooney. On the album, Can took sonic inspiration from sources as diverse as jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and from electronic avant-garde music. The album was also inspired by the occultist Aleister Crowley, which is reflected through the dark sound of the album as well as being named after Illa de Tagomago, an island which features in the Crowley legend. Czukay reflects that the album was \\"an attempt in achieving a mystery musical world from light to darkness and return\\". The group has referred to the album as their \\"magic record\\". The tracks have been described as having an \\"air of mystery and forbidden secrets\\". Tago Mago is divided into two LPs, the first of which is more conventional and structured and the second more experimental and free- form. \\"Paperhouse\\", the opening track, is one of the shorter songs on the album. Allmusic critic Ned Raggett depicted the song as \\"beginning with a low- key chime and beat, before amping up into a rumbling roll in the midsection, then calming down again before one last blast.\\" \\"Mushroom\\" is the following track, which Leone noted as having a darker sound than the previous song. \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Halleluhwah\\" contain the elements that have been referred to as Can's \\"trademark\\" sound: \\"Damo Suzuki's vocals, which shift from soft mumbles to aggressive outbursts without warning; Jaki Liebezeit's manic drumming; Holger Czukay's production manipulations (e.g. the backwards vocals and opening sound effects on 'Oh Yeah').\\" Both \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Halleluhwah\\" use repetitive grooves. The second LP features Can's more avant-garde efforts, with Roni Sarig, author of The Secret History of Rock calling it \\"as close as it ever got to avant-garde noise music.\\" Featuring Holger Czukay’s tape and radio experiments, the tracks \\"Aumgn\\" and \\"Peking O\\" have led music critics to write that Tago Mago is Can's \\"most extreme record in terms of sound and structure.\\" \\"Peking O\\" made early use of a drum machine, an Ace Tone Rhythm Ace, combined with acoustic drumming.Rick Moody, On Celestial Music: And Other Adventures in Listening, page 202, Hachette \\"Aumgn\\" features keyboardist Irmin Schmidt chanting rather than Suzuki's vocals.Cope, p. 56 The closing track, \\"Bring Me Coffee or Tea\\", was described by Raggett as a \\"coda to a landmark record.\\" The side-long track \\"Halleluhwah\\" was shortened from 18½ to 3½ minutes for the B-side of the single \\"Turtles Have Short Legs\\", a novelty song recorded during the Tago Mago sessions and released by Liberty Records in 1971. A different, 5½-minute shortened version of \\"Halleluhwah\\" would later appear on the compilation Cannibalism in 1978 while the single's A-side remained out-of-print until its inclusion on 1992's Cannibalism 2. Reception, legacy and influence Tago Mago has been critically acclaimed and is credited with pioneering various modern musical styles. Raggett called Tago Mago a \\"rarity of the early '70s, a double album without a wasted note\\". In the book Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music, Pascal Bussy described the double LP as \\"hugely influential\\". The album is listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die in which it stated, \\"Even after 30 years Tago Mago sounds refreshingly contemporary and gloriously extreme.\\" Many critics, particularly in the UK, were eager to praise the album, and by the end of 1971 Can played their first show in the UK. Various artists have cited Tago Mago as an influence on their work. John Lydon of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd. called it \\"stunning\\" in his autobiography Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs. Bobby Gillespie of Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream said \\"The music was like nothing I'd ever heard before, not American, not rock & roll but mysterious and European.\\"Gillespie, Bobby. \\"CAN - Tago Mago\\". CAN remastered - Tago Mago (CD liner notes). September 2004. Mark Hollis of Talk Talk made reference to Tago Mago as \\"an extremely important album\\" and an inspiration to his own Laughing Stock.Stubbs, David (February 1998). \\"Talking Liberties\\". Vox. Marc Bolan listed Suzuki's freeform lyricism as an inspiration.Bolan, Marc. Interview by Russell Harty. London Weekend Television. 23 Jul. 1972 Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke of Radiohead cite the album as an early influence. There have been attempts by several artists to play cover versions of songs from Tago Mago. The Flaming Lips album In a Priest Driven Ambulance contains a song called \\"Take Meta Mars\\", which was an attempt at covering the song \\"Mushroom\\". However, the band members had only heard the song once and didn't have a copy of it at the time, so the song is only similar-sounding and not a proper cover.Coyne, Wayne (1990). Album notes for In a Priest Driven Ambulance by The Flaming Lips, [CD booklet]. Restless Records. The Jesus and Mary Chain have covered the song more faithfully to the original; it was performed live and included on the CD version of Barbed Wire Kisses. British band The Fall recorded a song indebted to the Tago Mago track \\"Oh Yeah\\" entitled \\"I Am Damo Suzuki\\", named after the Can singer, on their 1985 LP This Nation's Saving Grace. New York band The Mooney Suzuki were named after Can vocalists Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki. Artists Emily Zuzik, Tim Lefebvre and Gary Novak recorded a cover of \\"Oh Yeah\\" with LA-based KNOWER for Zuzik's ep ANGELENOS also produced by Lefebvre.

Naoomal Jeoomal scored 33 and 25 opening India's innings in their first ever Test at Lord's in 1932. He also shared stands of 39 and 41 with his opening partner Janardan Navle in the two innings. Naoomal was a diminutive, defensive batsman whose strong point was the cut. He made 1,297 runs in the tour, playing in all the 26 first class matches, a decent performance considering that he had played only on matting wickets till then. Wisden even commented on Jeoomal's fielding abilities. When England returned the visit in 1933–34, Jeoomal missed the first Test. He scored 2 and 43 at Calcutta, but in Madras, he was hit on the face by Nobby Clark. The ball left a half-inch cut across the left eye. The injury ended his innings and he did not play another Test. In his first match in the Ranji Trophy, for Sind against Western India in 1934–35, he scored 63 and 53, despite being hit by Amar Singh and Ladha Ramji, and took 5/78 and 3/52 in bowling. He played in the Sind Pentangular matches from 1922 till 1946, scoring 1,993 runs (average 47) with six hundreds. His highest score in first-class cricket was a 203* scored in four and a half hours for Sind against Nawanagar in 1938–39. The Sind total of 326 was at the time the second lowest completed first class innings to include a double hundred. He coached Pakistan in the late 1950s and became national selector from 1957. He moved to India in 1971. Jeoomal was the oldest Indian Test cricketer to attend the Golden Jubilee Test in 1980, which marked the fiftieth year of the founding of BCCI. The oldest living cricketer Cota Ramaswami was absent. Note : Jeoomal's obituaries in Wisden Almanack and Wisden Cricket Monthly both give his date of death as 18 July. Early life He was born on April 17, 1904 in Karachi, Sindh. He was the son of head clerk of a private company. He was a matriculation. He made his First-Class debut against Arthur Gilligan's MCC in 1926-27 for Hindus and The Rest at Karachi, scoring 16.

Its programming consisted of 24-hour non-stop rock/alternative music. Format and history The structure of the MTV Networks is different in Europe from in the US and so the role that MTV Two plays is somewhat different. The various nation MTV channels remain the flagship channels bringing a wide variety of popular music and many different show formats (including documentaries, reality TV, charts, text shows, and countdowns) however digital satellite in the UK has allowed MTV to operate subsidiary channels with their own specialist areas. So while in the US MTV2 was a varied, slightly alternative channel in the past, in Europe MTV Two was dedicated exclusively to alternative rock and indie, with the occasional alternative hip hop song; while other music output carried on MTV Base, MTV Dance, and MTV Hits covering urban music (hip hop, rap, R&B; and garage), electronic dance music, and chart music respectively. MTV Rocks initially began as M2 in October 1998: the channel had an interactive feel to it. Here viewers controlled the overall content of M2 in terms of its playlist and channel identity. The channel initially had limited availability only being available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Scandinavia, France, and Spain. In 2002, MTV Networks Europe expanded M2's availability across Europe and decided to rebrand M2 as MTV2 similar to the rebranding on its sister network in the United States. The structure of the MTV2 in the United States differed from its European counterpart. MTV2 Europe primarily focused on alternative indie themed shows and music videos, while MTV2 in the US focused on reality TV programming, alternative music videos and alternative hip-hop. The TV station was one of the first media outlets to lead with its website strategy and follow with the TV programming. Viewers could program an hour of television content via the website, designed by Bradley Smith and Mickey Stretton with the agency Digit, it broadcast later that month. The website won a number of awards including a BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award. In the late 2000s, MTV2 Europe began to air a range of reality programming, but music was still the main focus of the channel. In 2000, the channel developed the first example of 360-degree programming. Viewers could choose an hour's worth of music and idents using the BAFTA- winning website, which would then be broadcast usually throughout the night with little or no manipulation by the channel. Viewers would be emailed their transmission time, their selection and the option to forward to friends. It was one of the first 100% Adobe Flash websites). In September 2002, MTV2 Europe introduced its own on-screen presentation and graphics, and started to use much more original programming, the jewel in the station's crown being Gonzo, hosted by the then MTV UK & Ireland DJ and former BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe and regularly featuring interviews with bands along with contributions from members of the MTV2 Internet forums. It was relaunched in 2006, moving from an hour-long format broadcasting every weekday to a single two-hour show on a Friday. The show won the NME Award for Best TV Show in 2006. Unlike other MTV channels available in Europe which have regular commercial breaks, MTV 2 (as it was) ran without any advertising (apart from MTV promotions and idents) for large parts of the day, which was eventually reduced to midnight to 6 pm every day. Commercials shown were mainly for albums, DVDs, films and products that target the channel's main audience. However, from September 2005, MTV2 started to play these commercials during daytime, but still runs without interruptions throughout the night from 1 am. In 2007, following a rebranding of MTV's channels available in the United Kingdom, MTV2 Europe was briefly rebranded as MTV Two and the presentation was changed as part of MTV's wider efforts to amalgamate the five British MTV channels into a singular brand with a common identity: the new logo is similar to the other channels, with the channel's playlist represented by a South Park-esque character who plays a Flying V guitar. On 1 March 2010, MTV Two was rebranded as MTV Rocks. The channel now reflects a similar on-air identity as other MTV Networks International's channels. The channel has a similar playlist and schedule as MTV2 Europe for the time being. On 10 January 2011, MTV Rocks launched in Italy replacing MTV Brand New. MTV Rocks began broadcasting in widescreen on 6 March 2012. In 2018 and 2019, MTV Rocks was temporarily rebranded as VH1 Christmas, which played Christmas-themed music until Boxing Day. Unlike MTV Xmas, it also played regular pop/mixed hits until early January. VH1 Christmas was formerly aired on VH1 from 2017 and was moved to MTV Rocks due to the former now being an entertainment channel. However during HIV Awareness day, it used the MTV Rocks logo. Closure The channel, along with Club MTV and MTV OMG closed on 20 July 2020, with a chart based on the channel's former content moving to MTV Music. The final music video played on the channel was \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" by Oasis. European version In 2014, MTV Rocks, as well as MTV Hits and MTV Dance started broadcasting European versions, without commercials or teleshopping and without VH1 Christmas. The channels have a Czech license. Programming * Biggest! Hottest! Loudest! * Rock Solid Playlist * What's The Story?

She graduated from the University of Georgia where she was editor of the student newspaper, The Red and Black. She worked as a reporter covering police, fires, courts, and other general assignment beats for newspapers in Georgia, Florida and California before she turned to science writing. She was on the staffs of the Macon Telegraph, the St. Petersburg Times and the Fresno Bee, among other publications.  Environmental journalism  After earning a master's degree in environmental journalism from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Blum returned to the Fresno Bee, where she became an award-winning environmental reporter. She was the first to report on the startling incidence of severely deformed waterfowl at the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, where poor management of irrigation runoff had polluted the wetland with toxic levels of the element selenium. Her work for the Fresno Bee put the mid-sized paper ahead of much larger regional rivals, including the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times in covering this major environmental story.  Science writing and teaching  In 1984, Blum joined the staff of the Sacramento Bee, where she broadened her range, covering science subjects. Her series \\"California: The Weapons Master\\" was awarded the 1987 Livingston Award for National Reporting. In 1992 the American Association for the Advancement of Science awarded her its AAAS- Westinghouse Award for Science Journalism, also for the \\"Monkey Wars\\" series. Blum expanded the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper series into a book of the same title. Her second book, Sex on the Brain examines the biological differences between men and women. In Love at Goon Park, she explores the life and career of groundbreaking psychology researcher Harry Harlow, and in Ghost Hunters she follows a quest by 19th century psychologist-philosopher William James and colleagues to apply objective scientific methods to the study of paranormal phenomena.

A past president of the National Association of Science Writers, she has been a member of the governing board of the World Federation of Science Writers and has also served on such panels for the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing, the AAAS Committee on Public Understanding of Science and Technology, the National Research Council's Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Society for Science & the Public and a US Congress committee on science. Blum is co-editor (with Mary Knudson and Robin Marantz Henig) of the book A Field Guide for Science Writers. Tim Hunt controversy In 2015, after Nobel Prize winning biochemist Tim Hunt made a controversial speech about women in science, Blum was one of three journalists present who initially broke the story. Although acknowledging that parts of it praised women scientists, she wrote that she found Hunt's speech troubling even after she asked him for clarification. Reporting on accusations that Hunt had been taken out of context, conflicting recollections of the phrase \\"now seriously\\" became a focal point for many commentators. Blum stated that she did not remember whether or not he spoke these words. Former UK member of Parliament Louise Mensch has documented what she considers to be factual and ethical shortcomings in Blum's account of Hunt's remarks. These claims have been disputed by British journalist and author Dan Waddell, who argues that they are politically motivated.  Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT Blum became director of the Knight Science Journalism Program, a fellowship program endowed by the James S. and John L. Knight Foundation to encourage \\"a select breed of journalist\\", in July 2015. The following year, she expanded on the fellowship program by launching Undark, a digital science magazine. The magazine debuted in March 2016. The magazine's founding editor-in-chief was Tom Zeller, long time environment writer for The New York Times. In July 2016, David Corcoran, former editor of Science Times at The New York Times, joined the program as a senior editor at the magazine and associate director of the program.  Personal life  Blum is the eldest of four daughters born to entomologist Murray S. Blum and Nancy Ann Blum, an educator and writer. Blum and her husband have raised two sons.

Chemically it is a polyether, and, more generally speaking, it's a polyalkylene glycol (PAG). The term polypropylene glycol or PPG is reserved for low to medium range molar mass polymer when the nature of the end-group, which is usually a hydroxyl group, still matters. The term \\"oxide\\" is used for high molar mass polymer when end-groups no longer affect polymer properties. In 2003, 60% of the annual production of propylene oxide of 6.6×106 tonnes was converted into the polymer.A Highly Active, Isospecific Cobalt Catalyst for Propylene Oxide Polymerization Kathryn L.

Abstract  Polymerization  Polypropylene glycol is produced by ring-opening polymerization of propylene oxide. The initiator is an alcohol and the catalyst a base, usually potassium hydroxide. When the initiator is ethylene glycol or water the polymer is linear. With a multifunctional initiator like glycerine, pentaerythritol or sorbitol the polymer branches out. Polypropylene glycol Conventional polymerization of propylene oxide results in an atactic polymer. The isotactic polymer can be produced from optically active propylene oxide, but at a high cost. A salen cobalt catalyst was reported in 2005 to provide isotactic polymerization of the prochiral propylene oxideA Highly Active, Isospecific Cobalt Catalyst for Propylene Oxide Polymerization Kathryn L. Peretti, Hiroharu Ajiro, Claire T. Cohen, Emil B. Lobkovsky, and Geoffrey W. Coates J. Am. Chem. Soc., 127 (33), 11566 -11567, 2005. Abstract Cobalt catalyst for isotactic polypropylene oxide  Properties  PPG has many properties in common with polyethylene glycol. The polymer is a liquid at room temperature. Solubility in water decreases rapidly with increasing molar mass. Secondary hydroxyl groups in PPG are less reactive than primary hydroxyl groups in polyethylene glycol. PPG is less toxic than PEG, so biotechnologicals are now produced in PPG. Difference in water solubility of PPG4000 and PPG400  Uses  PPG is used in many formulations for polyurethanes. It is used as a rheology modifier. PPG is used as a surfactant, wetting agent, dispersant in leather finishing. PPG is also employed as a tuning reference and calibrant in mass spectrometry. PPG is used as a primary ingredient in the making of paintballs. PPG is used as a primary ingredient in the making of some laxativesMiralax label.

Biography Imamović was born into a Bosniak family in Mrkonjić Grad and after a year his family moved to Travnik and there he lived for fifteen years when, in 1936, he moved to Sarajevo. He lived in Sarajevo for the rest of his life occasionally vacationing in Počitelj where he had a cottage. In Sarajevo he attended textile school and was discovered by a choir leader Cvjetko Rihtman in the cultural society \\"Gajret\\" where his sister Đula and his brother Hadžo also sang. When Radio Sarajevo became operational following the liberation of Sarajevo in April 1945, he started performing on and became an employee of Radio Sarajevo, often sleeping under the piano overnight so not to miss the morning telecast. At that time he performed three sevdah songs: \\"Gledaj me draga\\", \\"Konja vodim, pješke hodim\\" and \\"Mujo kuje konja po mjesecu\\" and became very popular (the last of the three songs is one of the most popular sevdah songs ever). His popularity increased in time and he is said to be the best sevdalinka performer of his time and a reformer of the genre. Some of his most popular sevdalinkas are: \\"Haj, Moščanice vodo plemenita\\", \\"Od kako sam sevdah svezo\\", \\"Okreni se niz đul-bašču\\", \\"Haj, sadih almu na sred Atmejdana\\", \\"Ja zagrizoh šareniku jabuku\\", \\"Đul Fatima po đul-bašči šeće\\", \\"Kad puhnuše sabah-zorski vjetrovi\\"... Zaim Imamović was under influence of important sevdah singers of the time: Rešad Bešlagić, Sulejman Đakić, Ibrahim Ašćerić, and others. Together with them he developed an important new style of sevdah singing that was peculiar for radio performance. It was a sharp contrast to earlier singers influenced by bel canto traditions of the European discography market: Bora Janjić, Sofka Nikolić, and others... Zaim Imamović wrote some of the most popular sevdalinkas: \\"Sve behara i sve cvjeta\\", \\"O, jeseni, tugo moja\\", \\"Nesretan sam, majko moja mila\\", \\"Kono moja\\", \\"Što je lijepo vrelo Mošćanice\\", \\"Zašto si me majko rodila\\"... He was one of the founders of the Festival Ilidža in Sarajevo. After initial success of the festival, intending to stir up new trends in traditional music, Zaim Imamović retreated from the festival at the beginning of 1970s. Zaim Imamović died in Sarajevo during the Siege of Sarajevo, on 2 February 1994. References * Farah Tahirbegović and Damir Imamović, eds. Pjesma srca moga: stotinu najljepših pjesama Zaima Imamovića.

Early life Engelbert was born in 1185 or 1186 in Schloss Burg (present ), the younger son of Count Engelbert I of Berg and his wife Margarete of Guelders. He was educated at the cathedral school in Cologne. From 1198 (at the age of twelve or thirteen) he held the office of provost of St. George in Cologne and from 1199 to 1216 he also held the office of cathedral provost at Cologne Cathedral. He further acquired at various times a number of other provostships: in Cologne, Aachen, Deventer and Zutphen. He was elected Bishop of Münster in 1203 but he declined because of his age. Engelbert was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III in 1206, on account of his support for his cousin Adolf of Altena, archbishop of Cologne, in the interests of Philip of Swabia against Otto of Brunswick but was pardoned in 1208. In 1212, as an act of penance for his earlier rebellion, he took part in the Albigensian Crusade. He gave his allegiance to the future Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, after the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. Archbishop of Cologne and after Statue of Archbishop Engelbert at Schloss Burg (sculptor Paul Wynand) Engelbert was elected Archbishop of Cologne as Engelbert I on 29 February 1216 and was consecrated on 24 September 1217, in which office he remained until his violent death. Engelbert came to enjoy the trust of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, becoming imperial administrator (Reichsverweser) in 1220 and guardian of the Emperor's son Henry. In 1222, Engelbert crowned twelve-years-old Henry as King of the Romans in Aachen. Engelbert remained Henry's tutor and guardian until his death. It is not clear to what extent Engelbert was personally involved with the ', a treaty with the ecclesiastical princes, which Frederick signed on 26 April 1220, although as Administrator of the German Kingdom (') he must have had at least some input. Clearly, however, in the increased powers it gave to all ecclesiastical princes it was of benefit also to the archbishops of Cologne, and the establishment and development of the new powers was part of Engelbert's archiepiscopal strategy. When Engelbert succeeded, the rights and territories of the archdiocese were in bad order, following a long period of civil unrest in Germany. He engaged himself at once in a series of campaigns and strategies to win them back and safeguard them, principally against the Dukes of Limburg and their allies the County of Cleves. Engelbert in turn set up alliances with Brabant and Namur. Engelbert also defended his personal inheritance as Count of Berg against Duke Waleran III of Limburg. In 1218 Engelbert's elder brother Count Adolf VI of Berg died on the Fifth Crusade without a male heir. Waleran considered himself entitled to inherit the County of Berg because his son Henry was married to Irmgard of Berg, Adolf's only daughter. According to the Salic law, however, Engelbert was the heir. He won the dispute in two feuds. In 1220 a peace was concluded and Waleran's claim settled by the payment of a year's revenues. Engelbert granted town privileges to many places, including Wipperfürth, Attendorn, Brilon, Siegen, Werl and Herford, Vianden, Hamm, Neuerburg and Manderscheid. During his incumbency as archbishop, Engelbert continued to fight for the re-establishment and security of the Archdiocese of Cologne both as an ecclesiastical authority and also as a secular territory. (It was said of him that despite his personal piety he was more of a monarch than a churchman). Not only did he constantly battle, by all means necessary, for the secular well-being of the lands of the archdiocese, of which he may be counted the de facto founder as a significant state; he also took energetic measures for the effective regulation of the City of Cologne itself; and he was a zealous champion of the religious throughout his archdiocese. Death { align=\\"right\\" Memorial to the assassinated Archbishop in Gevelsberg } Engelbert earned the respect and affection of his subjects through his devotion to justice and his energy in maintaining law, and took great pains to ensure the well-being of the religious within his authority. However, his effectiveness in achieving his goals by all means necessary, including military action, his allegiance to the pope and the emperor, and his uncompromising defence of the law and the rights of religious persons and bodies, brought him into conflict with the nobility, including his own family, and this led to his death. His cousin Count Frederick of Isenberg was vogt of Essen Abbey, and abused his position by defrauding the nuns. Engelbert was determined to protect the nuns' interests and sought to bring Frederick to justice. On 7 November 1225 while they travelled together to Cologne from a judicial hearing in Soest, Engelbert was killed, possibly by Frederick, in a defile near present-day Gevelsberg near Schwelm. It seems probable that a group of disaffected nobility was behind the attack which may have been intended to take Engelbert captive rather than kill him. Engelbert's body was taken to Cologne on a dung-cart, and when examined, found to have forty-seven wounds. Veneration Engelbert's body was buried in Cologne Cathedral on 24 February 1226 by order of Cardinal Conrad of Urach, the papal legate, who declared him a martyr, though a formal canonization did not take place. His remains are preserved today in a Baroque shrine prepared on the authority of Ferdinand of Bavaria, archbishop of Cologne, who in 1618 also ordered the celebration of his feast on 7 November.

He was the inventor of the Berdan rifle, the Berdan centerfire primer and numerous other weapons and accessories. Early life Berdan was born in Phelps, a small town in Ontario County, New York. A mechanical engineer in New York City, he had been the top rifle shot in the country for fifteen years prior to the Civil War. He invented a repeating rifle and a patented musket ball before the war. He had also developed the first commercial gold amalgamation machine to separate gold from ore. He invented a reaper and a mechanical bakery.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 129 His inventions had brought him wealth and international fame. Civil War In the summer and fall of 1861, he was involved in the recruiting of eighteen companies, from eight states, which were formed into two sharpshooter regiments with the backing of General Winfield Scott and President Abraham Lincoln. Berdan was named as Colonel of the resultant 1st and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters on November 30, 1861. His men, who had to pass rigorous marksmanship tests, were dressed in distinctive green uniforms and equipped with the most advanced long-range rifles featuring telescopic sights. Even when assigned to a brigade, the regiments were usually detached for special assignments on the field of battle. They were frequently used for skirmish duty. Berdan fought at the Seven Days Battles and Second Battle of Bull Run. In September 1862, his sharpshooters were at the Battle of Shepherdstown. Berdan commanded the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, 3rd Corps, Army of the Potomac in February and March 1863, then he commanded the 3rd Brigade at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Although Berdan was an innovative officer, as a leader he proved unpopular with the officers and soldiers under his command. In 1862, several of the sharpshooters' officers formally complained to General Daniel Butterfield, Berdan's immediate commander, that Berdan was both dishonest and a coward. In July 1862, General Fitz John Porter condemned Berdan as incompetent.Joshua E. Kastenberg, The Blackstone of Military Law: Colonel William Winthrop (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2009), 110 =Gettysburg= At the Battle of Gettysburg, his two regiments of sharpshooters played an important role in delaying Confederate attacks on Devil's Den and the Peach Orchard. In a sharp encounter in Pitzer's Woods on Seminary Ridge, the 1st U.S. Sharpshooters stalled the advancing Alabama brigade of Cadmus Wilcox. Berdan assumed command of J. H. Hobart Ward's brigade when the latter became acting division commander (David B. Birney having become acting corps commander following the wounding of Daniel Sickles) and led the division throughout the rest of the campaign, as well as during the subsequent Bristoe and Mine Run campaigns. Post-war career Berdan resigned his commission January 2, 1864, and returned to his career as an engineer and inventor. On December 8, 1868, President Andrew Johnson nominated Berdan for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, for the Battle of Chancellorsville, at which he led a brigade, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 16, 1869.Eicher, 2001, p. 740.Hunt, Roger D. and Jack R. Brown, Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue. Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. . p. 51 Although President Johnson also nominated Berdan for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers to rank from the same date for his services at the Battle of Gettysburg, at which he also led a brigade, the U.S. Senate did not confirm that appointment. Despite the lack of necessary Senate confirmation of the appointment to make it official, many sources refer to Berdan as a brevet major general and even his grave stone in Arlington National Cemetery indicates he was a brevet major general. He was considered by many to be a crack marksman and innovator, but unfit for field command.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 51 Berdan subsequently invented numerous engines of war, including a twin-screw submarine gunboat, a torpedo boat for evading torpedo nets, a long-distance rangefinder and a distance fuse for shrapnel. Death Berdan died unexpectedly on March 31, 1893 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Fictional portrayals The part of Hiram Berdan was played by Kurtwood Smith in the 1986 ABC miniseries. A film created by Silver Domino Productions was based on Berdan and his men.

It has about 6,700 inhabitants. Etymology The roots of the name derive from the medieval German \\"Graz\\", meaning pine forest. Many variants were used throughout the town's history: Greselin, Zum Greselin, Gresslens, Gresslas, Gresslitz, Graeslitz and Graslitz. The Czech name is a transliteration of the last used German name. Geography The town is situated on the southern slopes of the eastern reaches of the Ore Mountains, some 5 km from the neighbouring German town of Klingenthal. It lies in an area known for swarm type seismic activity. The last strong earthquake swarm was in 1986. The city lies on railway line No 145 from Sokolov to Klingenthal. Passenger services are provided by the railway company of GW Train Regio. History German monks from Waldsassen Abbey in Bavaria were the first to settle the upper Svatava valley in the 12th century. The town was granted regal city status by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV in 1370. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. In 1944 a women's subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was established here. The German-speaking population was expelled in 1945 and the town was resettled with Czechs. Population Graslitz had 13,936 inhabitants on 1 December 1930, 6,294 inhabitants 22 May 1947 and currently has some 7,000 inhabitants - a significant decrease from the pre-Second World War population figure of around 20,000, due to the expulsion of the German-speaking population after that war.

Rajaram also claimed to have deciphered the Indus script which was rejected by scholars.  Personal life  Rajaram was born on 22 September 1943 into a Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family in Mysore. His grandfather Navaratna Rama Rao was a colonial scholar and vernacular author of regional fame. Rajaram held a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Indiana University and taught in American universities for over 20 years, including stints at Kent State University and Lockheed Corporation. He started his professional career as an engineer, in India. He died on 11 December 2019. Indology Rajaram extensively published on topics related to ancient Indian history and Indian archaeology, alleging a Eurocentric bias in Indology and Sanskrit scholarship and arguing within the realms of \\"Indigenous Aryans\\" theory instead. He criticized the process by which, he said, Eurocentric 19th century \\"Indologists / missionaries\\" arrived at many of their conclusions. Despite being dismissive of exploiting linguistics as a tool for historiography, Rajaram questioned how it was possible for 19th century European evangelical \\"Indologists / missionaries\\" to study and develop hypotheses on Indian history, claiming many of them were \\"functionally illiterate\\" in Indian languages, including even the fundamental classical language, Sanskrit. Rajaram suggests that: :\\"Ancient Indian history is ripe for a thorough revision [...] one can begin by clearing away the cobwebs cast by questionable linguistic theories, [...] using every available modern tool from archaeology to computer science.\\"Rajaram 1995, page 230, (cited in Bryant 2001 page 74 He advocated the Indigenous Aryans hypothesis and rejected Indo- Aryan migration theory as a fabricated version of history devised for missionary and colonial interests, and later propounded by left-liberals and Marxists. Dating the Vedas to circa 7000 BC, he also propounded that the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley corresponds with the end phase of the Vedic Age and thus hypothesized it to be a part of Vedic era. In Puratattva, the journal of the Indian Archaeological Society, Rajaram claimed that \\"Vedic Indians\\" taught the Pharaohs of Egypt to build the Pyramids. He also asserted that the concept of secularism being irrelevant to a pluralistic state and thus claimed that ancient Hindu India was a secular state. He also claimed to have deciphered the Indus script and of having equated it to late Vedic Sanskrit; both of which were later debunked. Criticism Rajaram's contributions have been characterized by physicist and noted skeptic Alan Sokal as pseudoscienceRajaram's claim that Many of the questions arising in Quantum Physics today had been anticipated by Swami Vivekananda heads the chapter on Hindu nationalism in Alan Sokal's 2004 essay on Pseudoscience and Postmodernism and by other reviewers as \\"trash\\" and \\"crude\\" or \\"nonsensical\\" propaganda.A. Parpola, Of Rajaram's 'Horses', 'decipherment' and civilisational issues, Frontline, November 2000 . Sudeshna Guha notes him to be a sectarian non-scholar. In 2000, Rajaram had flaunted a horse on an Indus seal as a path-breaking discovery that lends credence to the belief that Aryans were the actual inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization, until Michael Witzel and Steve Farmer exposed the fraud in the Frontline magazine later that year. Romila Thapar, a noted historian, supported the expose against (what she deemed as) Hindutva driven historical revisionism. Regarding the \\"Indus horse\\" hoax, Asko Parpola, professor of Indology at Helsinki University, stated that Rajaram's and Jha's claims of having deciphered the Indus script were universally rejected. Noted epigraphist and an expert in Indus scripts-- Iravatham Mahadevan dismissed Jha-Rajaram work as a \\"non- starter\\" and \\"completely invalid\\", that even mis-analysed the direction of reading. Speaking from the chair of the President, on the occasion of the 2001 session of Indian History Congress, as to the recent advances in the deciphering of the Indus Script, Mahadevan noted that there was hardly any significant progress in the last decade. Concerning Rajaram's works, he notes:\\\\- Thapar noted Rajaram's writings to resemble nineteenth century tracts that were evidently unfamiliar with tools of historiography but were sprinkled with programming references; so as to suggest scientific objectivity. She also noted that anybody who disagreed with him was branded a Marxist. K. N. Panikkar criticized his works to be a communal intervention in historiography that was not an academic exercise in quest of truth but rather a political project knowingly undertaken with a cavalier attitude to the established norms of the discipline, so as to hamper the secular fabric of the society and lead to the establishment of a Hindu state. Endowed with the support of the ruling party, this succeeded in floating an alternative narrative of history and turning history into a contentious issue in popular discourse. Cynthia Ann Humes criticized Rajaram's Politics of History as a polemic work whilst Suraj Bhan noted it to be a demonstration of historical revisionism. Michael Witzel noted him to be an autochthonous writer, whose books were a mythological rewrite of history and were designed for the expatriate Indians of the 21st century, who sought a \\" largely imagined, glorious but lost distant past\\".

Though a small company active only for a short period of time, it provided visual effects for a number of high- profile movies and the company received international recognition including two Best Visual Effects Oscars and one Academy Award for Technical Achievement. As the company that created bullet time for The Matrix their work has been highly influential.  History Founding and first works= In 1995 Cinergi Pictures acquired an effects company from visual effects pioneer Doug Trumbull. It was originally known as Cinergi F/X but was subsequently named Mass Illusions. Mass.Illusion operated as a special-effects house owned by Cinergy, an independent movie studio. By 1997, Cinergy needed to sell Mass.Illusion for financial reasons, and began looking for investors to buy the company. Mass.Illusion had $1 million in debt, but had assets including artists and a $7.5 million contract to produce What Dreams May Come special effects. It had also submitted well-received test shots for The Matrix. In 1997 Cinergi pulled out of Mass Illusions. The company was rescued from liquidation by the Columbus, Ohio based company Manchester Exchange & Investment Company Inc, or Manex, with Manex agreeing to assume the firm's debt. Robert Bobo began running the company in November 1997. In 1998 it was again renamed, this time to Manex Visual Effects, headed by managing director Robert Bobo. In August 1997, it was moved to Alameda Naval Air Station. In 1998 Manex completed work on the movie What Dreams May Come. This featured an extended sequence in which the character played by Robin Williams entered a painted world. Manex provided the visual effects for this sequence and partly as a result of this work the movie was awarded an Academy Award for Visual Effects. In 1999, Manex's creative director received an Oscar for What Dreams May Come. In 1999 Manex completed work on The Matrix which received an Academy Award. The team at Manex, led by John Gaeta, created the signature bullet time sequences from the movie. They also developed a system for image-based rendering allowing choreographed camera movements through computer graphic reconstructed sets (also known as Virtual Cinematography) for which Manex was awarded an Academy Award for Technical Achievement. In November 1998, investors sued Manex managing director Robert Bobo, arguing he had defrauded them and was using the company for personal gain. Plaintiffs included part owners of Manex: Michael Van Himbergen, Roger Davis, and Steven Gillam. Bobo settled the lawsuit with the three plaintiffs for an undisclosed sum in March 2000. Robert Bobo was free thereafter to try to sell Manex for about $20 million. Bobo stressed that the company was not being sold, and was instead upgrading and bringing in investors. =Expansion and acquisitions= In 1999 Manex expanded, acquiring the Los Angeles operations of the Computer Film Company. The company underwent reorganization including the formation on an interactive division headed by Bill Dawson, formerly of Softnet, Xoom.com and Apple. Dawson recruited Kawika Maszak, also from Softnet and formerly of Gannett, as the division's executive producer. Manex Interactive received a New York International Independent Film & Video Festival award for its experimental short film Seriality. Another division, Manex Studios, also converted thousands of square feet in old hangar space to film studios where dozens of commercials, special events and feature films were shot. The firm designed effects for the 2000 movies Romeo Must Die and Mission Impossible 2. Manex further developed their virtual cinematography work in movies such as Michael Jordan to the Max in 2000. In February 2000, the firm announced it had hired a veteran from Industrial Light & Magic as its president, and had garnered millions in investment capital. In May 2000, the United States Army announced that it was studying the feasibility of using Manex's \\"bullet-time\\" technology to build a \\"holodeck\\" for training and simulation. After late December 2000, Manex closed its Manex Interactive division, and a number of executives left the company, including Bobo. =Change of staff= In March 2001, it was reported that \\"financial woes\\" at Manex had prompted Warner Bros. to award the $30 million contract for the second Matrix film to ESC Entertainment. ESC Entertainment was a new company which had been founded by Manex effects employees who had worked on the first Matrix. Manex had already put in \\"extensive\\" pre-production work on the two sequels, and it was reported that the company was pursuing legal options to be involved in the project in some way. Manex were, however, credited on The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions for their work leading to the effects. By March 2001, Manex was still working on the Warner Bros. films 13 Ghosts and Queen of the Damned, and Warners was shooting part of both Matrix sequels at Alameda Naval Station, operated by Manex. It had also recently created visuals for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and worked on American Beauty. Manex subsequently moved to Trenton, New Jersey and in early 2002 became involved in a project to build movie production facilities in the city. The company intended to convert a 7-acre property into a film production and equipment rental facility for $35 million, with plans to employ several hundred people. Manex fell behind on payments to the county, and in 2006, a judge ruled that Manex had lost the rights to use the property, with Manex then losing an appeal in 2008. Subsequently to management and key staff leaving in 2001 there has been little or no creative output from Manex.

Heffron and written by Mayo Simon and George Schenck. It is a sequel to the 1973 Michael Crichton film Westworld, and is the second installment in the Westworld franchise. The film stars Peter Fonda, Blythe Danner, Arthur Hill, Stuart Margolin, John Ryan, and Yul Brynner, who makes an appearance in a dream sequence. No other cast member from the original film appears, its writer-director, Michael Crichton and original studio Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, were not involved in this production. The film attempted to take the plot in a different direction from Westworld, but it was not well received by critics. It was made by American International Pictures (its predecessor was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which later bought AIP's successor Orion Pictures). A short-lived television series titled Beyond Westworld followed. Plot Two years after the Westworld tragedy, the Delos corporation owners have reopened the park after spending $1.5 billion in safety improvements, and also shutting down Westworld. For publicity purposes, newspaper reporter Chuck Browning and TV reporter Tracy Ballard are invited to review the park. Just before the junket is announced, Browning arranges to meet with a Delos employee who promises he has dirt on the corporation. During the meeting, the tipster is shot in the back and dies after giving Browning an envelope. At the resort, guests choose from four theme parks: Spaworld (\\"where old age and pain have been eliminated\\"), Medievalworld, Romanworld and Futureworld. Browning and Ballard choose Futureworld, which simulates an orbiting space station. Robots are available for sex as well as amusements like boxing. They are guided through the resort by Dr. Duffy, who shows them the marvels of Delos, demonstrating that all the problems have been fixed. The reporters are stunned to find that the Control Center is staffed entirely by robots. That night, their dinners are drugged, and while they sleep, medical tests are conducted so Delos can make clones of them. A visiting Russian general and a Japanese politician are also tested for cloning. Back in her room a few hours later, Ballard wakes in a fright, remembering the experience as a nightmare. Ballard and Browning sneak out to explore the resort's underground areas. They end up triggering a cloning machine, which generates three samurai. Just as they are about to be captured by the samurai, a mechanic named Harry saves them. He takes them back to his quarters, where he cohabits with a mechanic robot he has named Clark after Superman's alter-ego. The reporters interview Harry, but they are interrupted and returned to their rooms. The following day, while Ballard is testing out a Delos dream-recording device (which includes a dream sequence of being saved by, dancing with and making love to Yul Brynner's Gunslinger), Browning slips out to see Harry. Harry takes him to a locked door that he has never been able to enter, although robots routinely enter. Realizing the key is in the robot's eyes, Harry destroys a robot and steals its face. They return with Ballard and open the door. Inside, they find clones of themselves, as well as clones of the Russian and Japanese leaders. The clones are instructed to always work for the good of Delos and to destroy their originals. Browning explains that his tipster's envelope was filled with clippings about leaders from around the world, realizing that Delos must be cloning the rich and powerful. The trio decides to flee the resort on the next plane. The reporters return to their apartment where Duffy is waiting for them; he explains that, by cloning world leaders, they can ensure that nothing harms Delos' interests, and that without \\"proper\\" guidance, humans will eventually destroy the planet. Cloning the reporters would ensure favorable coverage, letting people forget about the Westworld tragedy. Browning attacks Duffy but is easily overpowered with unnatural strength. Ballard shoots the doctor twice, and Browning peels back Duffy's face to reveal that he is a robot. As Harry races to meet up with the reporters, he runs into Browning's clone, who kills him. Ballard and Browning are then chased by their own duplicates, all the while taunting them with details about their lives. Eventually, one of each pair is killed, though which one is left unclear. When they find each other, Browning seizes and kisses Ballard. In the end, as they leave the resort with the other guests, Dr. Schneider meets them to make sure they are the clones. The reporters confirm that they will be writing positive reviews for Delos; but, just as they reach the exit, Ballard's badly injured clone stumbles towards him and Schneider realizes too late that he has been fooled. On the jetway, Browning tells Ballard that his editor is running the exposé on Delos, that the whole world will know what they are up to, and that kissing her was his idea to figure out whether or not she was a duplicate. Cast * Peter Fonda as Chuck Browning * Blythe Danner as Tracy Ballard * Arthur Hill as Dr. Duffy * Yul Brynner as the Gunslinger * John Ryan as Dr. Morton Schneider * Stuart Margolin as Harry Croft * James M. Connor as Clark the robot * Allen Ludden as game show host * Robert Cornthwaite as Mr. Reed * Angela Greene as Mrs. Reed * Darrell Larson as Eric * Nancy Bell as Erica * Bert Conroy as Mr. Karnovsky * Dorothy Konrad as Mrs. Karnovsky * Jim Antonio as Ron Thurlow Production The film was developed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had produced Westworld. Michael Crichton did not wish to be involved in a sequel, so they approached the original producer Paul Lazarus III. He developed an idea set in a successor world to Westworld where robots are cloning world leaders. He found a writer and developed a script; MGM decided to only make one science fiction film that year, Logan's Run. Futureworld was put into turnaround. Lazarus had trouble finding production and distribution for the film elsewhere, because other studios were confused and wary after MGM passed on it, especially since the original film had been a financial success for MGM. Lazarus was approached by former MGM president James T. Aubrey who said he could get the film made. He arranged financing from Samuel Z. Arkoff's American International Pictures. Futureworld was the first major feature film to use 3D computer-generated imagery (CGI). CGI was used for an animated hand and face. The animated hand was a digitized version of Edwin Catmull's left hand, taken from his 1972 experimental short subject A Computer Animated Hand. The animated face was taken from Fred Parke's 1974 experimental short subject Faces & Body Parts. The film also used the 2D technique of digital compositing to materialize characters over the background. Futureworld utilized the \\"Logan apartment set\\" from Logan's Run and redressed it to be the Futureworld bar. =Filming= Much of the film was shot in the greater Houston area, including Intercontinental Airport, Jones Hall, and the Johnson Space Center. The film includes a chase scene through the underground pedestrian Houston tunnel system running under the city. Release Lazarus admits the film \\"wasn't a very good picture\\" but put its poor commercial performance down to the fact that AIP were focusing on their prestige film A Matter of Time (1976). In 1979, Futureworld became the first modern American film to achieve general theatrical release in China. =Critical reception= Richard Eder panned the film in The New York Times, quoting Ballard's line from the movie, \\"This is about as exciting as a visit to the water works.\\" Coining his own variation on the phrase, Eder also claimed the film is \\"as much fun as running barefoot on Astroturf.\\" He added, \\"It is all the most ordinary kind of hardware science fiction, full of computers and empty of thought.\\" Writing that Danner and Fonda have \\"absolutely nothing to do\\" in the film, he concluded that \\"starring in Futureworld must be the actor's equivalent of going on welfare.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and criticized the \\"dumb story,\\" although he did think it had \\"some of the best gadgets since the early James Bond pictures ... Too bad 'Futureworld' didn't dream up more of these gizmos.\\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety wrote, \\"'Futureworld' shapes up a strong sequel to MGM's 'Westworld' of three years ago ... Richard T. Heffron, on his second feature directing work, keeps the personal drama moving smartly through the gadgetry montages.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"an extreme rarity, a sequel that's a decided improvement over the original.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Unlike 'Westworld' there's nothing shrewd or compelling behind the events in 'Futureworld,' where the big mystery is just an old wheeze—the managers of the park are power-hungry scientists who clone influential guests and order the clones to dispose of the originals.\\" John Pym of The Monthly Film Bulletin expressed disappointment that the scriptwriters neglected to explore the interesting implications of self-programming robots and instead \\"seem content to do little more than lead the players through the standard diversions of a caper movie.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 33% based on 12 reviews, with an average grade of 4.7 out of 10. =Alternative version= For its initial television broadcast, an alternative version of the scene where Browning gives the finger to Dr. Schneider was shot. Instead, he performs a bras d'honneur. Home media , Futureworld was released on VHS, CED, and LaserDisc in the United States, and on DVD from MGM in December 2010, as well as released in a number of foreign territories in the DVD format. On December 2, 2011, Futureworld was released in Germany on Blu-ray (German and English audio tracks). The digital release is in the widescreen format. Shout! Factory released Futureworld on Blu-ray on March 26, 2013. The film is also available to stream through multiple providers.

Solomon is a character in 3rd Rock from the Sun, played by French Stewart. He is the brother of Dick Solomon and Sally Solomon, and the uncle of Tommy Solomon. His middle initial is mentioned in the episode \\"Dick the Vote.\\" French Stewart said in a 1998 interview, \\"The way the character was originally described to me was he would be an idiot on any planet. So he's got to be the biggest idiot in the universe!\\"James Endrst. \\"Clueless, hapless Harry is 'Rock' solid sensation\\". The Commercial Appeal. 1998-01-02. Mission In the early episodes, Harry, unlike the rest of the \\"family,\\" didn't seem to have any definable role in the expedition. During the opening credits of the first season, James Earl Jones, acting as narrator, states that \\"well-- they had an extra seat\\" in reference to him. After the discovery that he has a \\"transmitter\\" implanted in his brain (which, apparently, takes up half the space in his head) for the purposes of communication with the home planet, he takes the title of \\"Communications Officer,\\" which the others agree to so he doesn't feel left out. According to an interview with French Stewart on the 3rd Rock from the Sun First Season DVD, Harry was related to/knew an important alien back on the homeworld, and that his position was a sinecure. Communication was usually initiated without warning, either from the Big Giant Head himself, or his office. Upon contact, Harry is \\"taken over\\" entirely. The first signs are always physical - he immediately shudders violently, garbles incoherently, then adopts a stance with bent knees and upraised arms, palms forward. The message itself is always preceded with \\"Incoming message from the Big Giant Head!\\" or \\"Transmission incoming from the Big Giant Head!\\", followed by the message, spoken in a voice unlike his usual one. When the message is completed, the exit statement is always \\"Resume normal functions in three ... two ... one ...\\", or later \\"transmission ending in three ... two ... one ...\\", after which he shudders, performs a dance-like movement, belches, or sneezes. Returning to normal he usually inquires \\"So what did I miss?...\\", indicating that he doesn't know what he had said. In the season 4 premiere, Harry opens a transmission line to the Big Giant Head in order to send an overdue status report. Love life In contrast to what would be expected of someone as weird and apparently unsophisticated as Harry, he seems a very adept lover and often has interludes with those that might be considered \\"out of his league,\\" though this did not stop him from maintaining a haphazard relationship with Mrs. Dubcek's daughter Vicki. The two often have conversations as if they were in a porno, similar to how Sally and Don often have conversations like an old crime drama. Their relationship was often interrupted; examples include Vicky's commitment to physical and spiritual purity to the point that she becomes celibate; and her pregnancy with the Big Giant Head's child. At one point (in part one of the series finale \\"The Thing That Wouldn't Die\\"), Harry arranges a date with a clerk, Sam, then sees her again as hostess at a restaurant and makes a date with her again, as \\"Samantha\\", which she feels more appropriate for the atmosphere. Harry, not realizing that this is the same person using her legal name, thinks he has made dates with twins. Other affairs have included a well-toned policewoman named Janice (played by Chyna), a woman at the laundromat, and Dick's office assistant Nina Campbell. In the series finale, Harry revealed that he had a long-lasting secret relationship with Mrs. Dubcek. Life as a human Harry in general serves as the slapstick comic foil for the show, even having an entire section of the clip show episode \\"7 Deadly Clips\\" dedicated to clips of him hurting himself or being hit. The typical \\"funny points\\" involve a great deal of running into things or being hit. In addition to the physical comedy that Harry brings to the show, his naivety and slow-wittedness are other sources of amusement, especially when his apparent stupidity gives way to absurdity, such as when Harry declares it is his mission to \\"bring electricity to the people of Earth.\\" Tommy informs him that humans have electricity, so Harry concludes that \\"my work here is done.\\" In contrast to the frequent exhibition of a total lack of intelligence, Harry at one point speaks fluent French to Dick, and has a natural talent for the arts. He also told Dr. Albright, while in art class, that his mother was \\"a cold receptacle,\\" and his father \\"a machine,\\" when she asked if his parents were artistic. He is always with his eyes half-opened. Despite his aptitude with the physical aspects of the opposite sex, Harry seems incapable of fully functioning in a common social situation. Often he will run off on a mission to right some irrelevant wrong and not realize the \\"offender\\" is conceding and will then proceed to take physical and occasionally violent action. Harry held several positions in the \\"working world.\\" Among them, he served as a representative for Orca Cosmetics for Men, worked in a movie rental store, and as a bartender. For all his haphazard antics, however, Harry (ironically) seems to be the only member of the team fully comfortable with life on earth. =Alternate universe= In the season six two-part episode \\"Dick'll Take Manhattan\\", in which Dick, Harry and Sally enter into an alternate universe, Harry is employed as the President of NBC, while Mrs. Dubcek is his secretary. Behind the scenes Harry's distinctive squint was invented by French Stewart as he auditioned for the role. The look soon became Harry's signature. \\"It's sort of the equivalent of your mother telling you not to make faces because they might stick that way forever. Well, I've now got a face that's stuck,\\" said Stewart in an interview. \\"But it's worth it. People respond to Harry, and the squint is probably a big part of his appeal. So, I'm just riding it for all it's worth.\\"Ian Spelling. \\"All eyes are on the star of \`Rock'\\". The Washington Times. 1997-01-12.

But sometimes you pay for it the next day. I do bits sometimes, and I wake up with bruises and huge rug burns all over my legs.\\" According to Stewart, one of his most difficult stunts was contorting his body to play as the communicator for the Big Giant Head. \\"I wasn't sure that I had nailed that until I realized how much pain I was in doing it.

The ship was designed by Gerard Dijkstra who modelled her after the mid-19th century frigate Amsterdam, but she is not a replica. A major difference is that the hull is made of steel. The owners call the ship a \\"modern extreme clipper in historical perspective\\", meaning that the construction method is a combination of the best qualities of clippers of the past, outfitted and built with modern techniques but with a classic \\"look and feel\\". She is a very fast ship, with 15 knots being a normal speed. She won the 2001 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race. She is rigged with double topsails on the fore and main mast and a single topsail on the mizzen. She has royals on all masts and a skysail on the main mast. The building of the hull in 1997/98 was used as a work experience project for the unemployed (e.g. metalworking and welding). The ship was first presented to the public at the 2000 edition of SAIL Amsterdam. During the 2005, 2010 and 2015 editions of the event she was the flagship. The Stad Amsterdam is used for training and as a charter-ship for guests. The crew are mainly from the Netherlands and Denmark and the official language on board is English. Her home port is Amsterdam. In September 2009 Stad Amsterdam was refitted to accommodate a televised research expedition, tracing the second voyage of HMS Beagle (1831–1836). The ship re-sailed the route of the Beagle in approximately 8 months while collecting information to allow comparison between Charles Darwin's Beagle observations and the current ones. The show was aired by the Dutch public broadcaster VPRO as Beagle: In Darwin's wake (Beagle: In het kielzog van Darwin). The Stad Amsterdam celebrated her 15th anniversary at the five-day SAIL Amsterdam 2015 tall ships festival in August 2015. The occasion was commemorated with the publication of a book about the ship, with contributions from Eberhard van der Laan - then the Mayor of Amsterdam - and the co-founder of the ship, Frits Goldschmeding. The book was co-created by former quartermaster Bart Huijs, and the sculptor and photographer, Anthony Smith.

It has approximately 13,500 inhabitants. History It was originally a Slavic settlement. Its name was derived from an old Slavic term \\"choda\\", which means a road. The Slavic colonisation was not successful and in the Middle Ages this part of Bohemia was colonised by Germans. In the 12th–13th century Chodau belongs to the monastery in Waldsassen and in the 14th-17th century is ruled locally from Loket (Elbogen). In 1894 Chodau is declared a town and gets the right to use its own coat of arms. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. Until the end of World War II the town was inhabited practically only by Germans, who were deported from Czechoslovakia after the war. In the '60s a big chemical factory was built 4 km from Chodov in Vřesová and then new districts were built for the Czech and Slovak workers who moved here. Sights Protestant church in Chodov The most significant is St. Lawrence Church, built by the constructor Brauenbock according to the plans of the architect Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. On the main altar there is a painting by the famous Czech-German artist Peter Johann Brandl. In front of the church we find a 17th-century statue of St. Sebastian and on the main square a statue of the Virgin Mary (1675).

As of 2010, it was the second-largest Jewish religious group in the United Kingdom, with 19.4% of synagogue-member households. Belief and practice The denomination shares the basic tenets of Reform Judaism (alternatively known also as Progressive or Liberal) worldwide: a theistic, personal God; an ongoing revelation, under the influence of which all scripture was written – but not dictated by providence – that enables contemporary Jews to reach new religious insights without necessarily being committed to the conventions of the past; regarding the ethical and moral values of Judaism as its true essence, while ritual and practical observance are means to achieve spiritual elation and not an end to themselves – and therefore, rejecting the binding nature of Jewish law; a belief in the coming of a Messianic era rather than a personal Messiah, and in immortality of the soul only, instead of bodily resurrection. Prayers referring to such concepts were omitted from the liturgy, and traditional practices abolished or altered considerably.Romain, Jonathan (2004). Reform Judaism and Modernity: A Reader, SCM Press. Respectively, for each sentence: pp. 145; 128; xviii, 222; 195; 9. See also: Romain, Jonathan, Reform Judaism, Religions, BBC website, 13 August 2009. Retrieved 6 December 2015. Although Reform Judaism in the UK does subscribe to these views, held also by Liberal Judaism and the American Union for Reform Judaism, several factors made it more moderate and less prone to modify old forms. Its constituency was socially conservative and it attempted to appeal to potential newcomers from the Centrist Orthodox majority in British Jewry; renewed traditionalism by all WUPJ members since the 1970s also motivated Reform Judaism in the UK to adopt once discarded elements. Though it does not consider itself halakhic, it has been sometimes compared to American Conservative Judaism – the sociological functions of which as an \\"intermediate\\" movement it indeed filled, especially since the \\"Assembly of Masorti Synagogues\\" was only established in 1985 and is very small – while Liberals are more reminiscent of US Reform.Romain, Reform Judaism and Modernity, p. 285. Reform liturgy had always contained a high proportion of Hebrew or Aramaic, while the Liberals and American Reform abridged theirs and introduced much English.Meyer, Michael A. (2001) Judaism Within Modernity: Essays on Jewish History and Religion, Wayne State University Press, p. 317. Since the 1970s, formerly excised blessings (like those on phylacteries) were returned. Reform Judaism in the UK observes dietary laws and the Sabbath to a considerable degree in the public sphere. It has a get-like divorce document issued by its rabbinic court, and conversion requires circumcision by males and ablution by both sexes.Parsons, Gerald (ed.) (1993) The Growth of Religious Diversity: Britain from 1945 – Volume I: Traditions: Traditions Vol 1, Psychology Press. pp. 110–113. ; Romain, Jonathan, 150 Years of Progressive Judaism in Britain: 1840–1990, London Museum of Jewish Life, 1990. pp. 39–45. Egalitarianism did not become prevalent in most synagogues until the 2000s, although the first female rabbi, Jackie Tabick, was ordained in 1975. Mixed seating was only accepted just before and during World War II.Romain, 150 Years, p. 44. Recognition of Jews by patrilineal descent was affirmed in 2015. Reform Judaism currently ordains female and LGBT clergy, conducts LGBT marriages and has egalitarian services, counting women for minyan and allowing them full participation. Girls have their bat mitzvah at 13, the same age as boys have their bar mitzvah. Reform Judaism is welcoming to non-Jewish spouses; while the Assembly maintains \\"clear opposition\\" to involvement in interfaith unions, since 2012 it allows rabbis to conduct celebratory events as long as the ceremony does not involve clergy or motifs from other religions, or conversely those of a Jewish wedding, like ritual canopy. Organisational structure As of 2017, Reform Judaism has 41 synagogues, of which 39 are located in England and 13 in Greater London. There is one congregation in Cardiff and one in Glasgow. As of 2010, Reform Judaism had 16,125 member households, accounting for 19.4% of synagogue-affiliated Jewish families in Britain and roughly 14% of the total Jewish population.Graham, David; Vulkan, Daniel (2010). Synagogue Membership in the United Kingdom in 2010, Board of Deputies of British Jews. All of the synagogues are autonomous, owned and financed by their members who also hire their own local rabbi independently. All clergy are members of the Assembly of Reform Rabbis, which publishes Reform prayerbooks and determines policy in religious matters. The denomination is led by the Senior Rabbi, while the Chair of the Assembly represents and organises the rabbis. It maintains a rabbinical court (Beth Din), located at the Sternberg Centre in London. The Reform Beth Din's decisions are recognised worldwide by all WUPJ affiliates. Alongside the clergy, lay leadership is provided by a board of delegates, the chair of which represents Reform Judaism in the Board of Deputies. Reform Judaism trains its clergy at the Leo Baeck College, London, which is shared with the Liberals and the Masorti Assembly. While British Reform Judaism and British Liberal Judaism are both WUPJ affiliates and cooperate in many fields, such as outreach to the religiously non-active and interfaith families, the two stress that they \\"retain their autonomy and distinct identities\\". Through its work for the welfare and development of young people, Reform Judaism is a member of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS). As of 2020, Reform Judaism is chaired by Geoffrey Marx. Rabbi Celia Surget is chair of the Assembly of Reform Rabbis and Rabbi Jackie Tabick is Convenor of the Beth Din. Sir Trevor Chinn is President. History In the 1820s and 1830s, a small intellectual current arose in English Jewry, influenced by the Anglican environment which laid great emphasis on the Bible alone and scorned the Jews for valuing the Talmud. Represented by such figures as Isaac D'Israeli, they were sometimes named \\"neo-Karaites\\", though their actual knowledge of Karaism was scant. This group rejected rabbinic authority and espoused a bibliocentric view. Concurrently, wealthy members of the Sephardi Mocatta and Ashkenazi Goldsmid families, who were related by marriage, were complaining about lack of decorum and rigid regulations in the Bevis Marks and Great Synagogue of London, respectively. The Mocattas were forced to walk miles on the Sabbath as an old communal ordinance banned forming prayer groups in a radius of ten miles from Bevis; Isaac Goldsmid vied for more clout with the wardens, and repeatedly protested against the protracted blessings for family members during services. They were also inclined to worship together. Eventually, a group of Mocattas, Goldsmids, Montefiores and other supporters withdrew from their two congregations on 15 April 1840, declaring their intention to found a house of worship for neither Sephardi nor Ashkenazi, but \\"British Jews\\". They appointed David Woolf Marks to lead services in their new West London Synagogue, dedicated on 27 January 1842. A former reader in Liverpool, he was deeply influenced by the \\"neo-Karaite\\" tendency and refused to cantillate the Torah on the second day of festivals, grounded only in rabbinic tradition. His stance suited the secessionists mainly on the practical level; Most never cared much for the bibliocentric issue but were content to abolish the second day. Although the term \\"Reform\\" was occasionally conferred on the congregation, Todd Endelman stressed that they were \\"unique and owed nothing\\" to the continental movement. Jakob Josef Petuchowski emphasised that Marks' philosophy was the polar opposite to that espoused by the German founding fathers of Reform Judaism. The latter regarded the Beatified Sages as geniuses and progressives who developed Rabbinic Law further. Marks granted the Written Torah alone divine status, refused to call himself rabbi but insisted on \\"reverend\\", and even translated the Kaddish into Hebrew, viewing Aramaic prayer as a later rabbinic corruption. In his new prayerbook and Passover Haggadah, he excised or reinstated various elements, always contrary to rabbinic tradition. Petitions for the Return to Zion under the Messiah and reinstitution of sacrifices, rejected by Continental Reform, did not concern the English at all.Endelman, Todd M., The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000, University of California Press, 2002. pp. 108–115; Petuchowski, J. J. Karaite Tendencies in an Early Reform Haggadah, HUC Annual, 1960. West London was subject to a harsh denunciation and de facto ex-communication by Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell in 1842. In 1856, tensions in Manchester were increasing, as many in the community sought greater autonomy from the authoritarian new Chief Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler and regarded local Rabbi Solomon Marcus Schiller- Szinessy with disfavour. On 25 March 1858 the dissident \\"Manchester Congregation of British Jews\\" was dedicated. They adopted Marks' prayerbook but retained the second day of festivals. Their motives were far more political than principally religious. In 1872, a third English synagogue withdrew from Adler's jurisdiction, the Bradford Jewish Association. Unlike the rest, Bradford was clearly influenced by continental developments: the founders were mostly German Jews, as was their first rabbi, Joseph Strauss. The three breakaway congregations were neither organised together nor had a consistent religious philosophy. Marks' \\"neo-Karaism\\", which was never very important to ordinary constituents in West London, virtually died with him. His successor, Rabbi Morris Joseph, was dismissed by the Orthodox in 1890 for evincing doubt about the prayers concerning the sacrifices but was of little conviction. His moderate style brought a rapprochement with the United Synagogue. At the turn of the century, Claude Montefiore emerged as the most important religious philosopher among Anglo-Jewry. Montefiore, whose mother attended West London, studied at the Berlin Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums and was a disciple of the teachings of German Reformers Abraham Geiger and Samuel Holdheim. His Jewish Religious Union (JRU), the antecedent of British Liberal Judaism, was as purist and radical as American Reform Judaism, if not exceeding it. He too emphasised the ethical aspects as the essence of religion, instituted drastic ritual reforms – over half of the Liberal liturgy was in English, men were bareheaded and sat together with women, the practical observance was not only ignored by the public (as was the case in the United Synagogue, too) but officially discarded. While the three nonconformist synagogues did not emulate the JRU, it did influence them toward greater modifications, albeit yet inconsistent. In 1919, the St. George synagogue, appealing for unaffiliated East End Jews, was opened by Basil Henriques. It was alternatively sponsored by both West London and the Liberals. The first of the three breakaway synagogues to adopt full-fledged Reform Judaism was West London. After the retirement of Rabbi Joseph in 1929, it hired Harold F Reinhart, a Hebrew Union College graduate who served as a rabbi in several congregations of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. Within a year, Reinhart brought the synagogue into the recently established World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ), albeit retaining a relatively conservative ritual, consistent with the congregation's sensibilities. Though both were WUPJ affiliates, cooperation and competition alike characterised relations with the Liberal ULPS as a growing interest in non-Orthodox forms emerged among the wider public. A Glasgow printer named Samuel Ginsberg was impressed with what he saw in West London and opened the Glasgow Progressive Synagogue in 1932. In 1933, Reinhart sponsored the establishment of the North Western Reform Synagogue at Golders Green. In 1935, a group at Edgware seceded from the United Synagogue and formed the Edgware & District Reform Synagogue, again under West London's guidance. A movement only arose with the arrival of some 40,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. While worldwide Reform Judaism originated there, the nature of German communities limited what was known as \\"Liberal Judaism\\" to the status of a tendency within unified congregations which had to accommodate traditionalist members. German Liberals were relatively conservative (for example, maintaining mainly-Hebrew liturgy, head coverings for men and separate seating), and found the British Liberal synagogues far too radical. The moderation of the independent nonconformist ones suited them better, and immigrants overwhelmed West London and the others. They also brought along a cadre of 35 Hochschule-trained rabbis, most prominently Ignaz Maybaum and Werner van der Zyl who were aided by Reinhart in finding new posts at Britain. Harmonising ritual and religious approach to a great measure, they made their loosely related communities quite uniform. One that remained independent and strongly clung to German Liberal worship was Belsize Square Synagogue. On 4 January 1942, representatives from the West London, North Western, St. George Settlement, Glasgow, Manchester and Bradford synagogues met at the Midland Hotel, Manchester and founded the Associated British Synagogues, later renamed Associated Synagogues of Great Britain. The ASGB joined the WUPJ as a whole in 1945. In 1956, it cooperated with the ULPS to establish the Leo Baeck College for training rabbis. In 1958, it adopted the name Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, which would last until 2005.

The founder of the system was Ernesto Amador Presas. The current head of the system is Ernesto Presas Jr. The style is known for its double stick techniques, but it features other stick and blade techniques, as well as empty-hand methods. Ernesto A. Presas Sr. was born in the coastal town of Hinigaran, Negros Occidental on 1945-05-20. At age 8 he began his martial arts training under his father, Jose Presas, a well known escrima practitioner at that time. He went on to be an athlete in his college years, participating in various sports. His training in the martial arts is eclectic, having studied judo, jujutsu, karate, and various forms of Filipino and Japanese weaponry. He was Lakan Sampu (10th Dan) in arnis and Mano Mano (hand-to-hand combat) and Lakan Walo (8th Dan) in Philippine Weaponry. Remy Presas recognized that the classical arts of their country were losing their appeal and therefore slowly dying. He modernized the native arts into an effective fighting system that would be appealing to martial arts students living in modern Filipino society and called it Modern Arnis. His dream to re-introduce the native arts led to the development of Modern Arnis. Ernesto Presas continued the work after his brother emigrated to the US in 1975. He changed his version of the art a lot in the nineties and then he re-christen his version of the art to the name of Kombatan. In 1970 he began to teach the Filipino martial arts in the University of the Philippines and Lyceum of the Philippines. Later other classes expanded to the University of Santo Tomas, Central Colleges of the Philippines, the Far Eastern Military Academy, Philippine National Police Academy, and the Philippines Air Force Officer's School. Also in 1970 he was invited to Japan at Expo '70' to demonstrate Arnis. He quickly earned the respect of many of the Japanese masters who called his Art Filipino Kendo. After returning home, with the help of his friend Frederico Lazo, he opened his first club. Later he formed the Modern Arnis Association of the Philippines International and the ARJUKEN (which stands for Arnis, Jujutsu, Kendo) Karate Association to formally spread the art within the Philippines. In 1975 he founded the International Philippine Martial Arts Federation (IPMAF) and began to spread the Filipino art to the outside world. In time his Arnis Presas Style and techniques became widely accepted and adopted by countries in Europe, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and Puerto Rico. He has also published numerous books and videos and has been featured on the cover of Inside Kung Fu magazine with the title \\"Ernesto Presas: The Father of Mano-Mano\\" (which art he created). Ernesto Presas traveled the world teaching seminars to spread his art. Many visited the Philippines to take lessons from him in Manila.

Commonly referred to as hirada bantagueña, after the Batangas province from which it originated, pinayong is Kombatan's \\"umbrella\\" block-and-counter pattern. It consists of an umbrella- like covering block/counter followed with any number of strikes; often an upward strike that can impact areas such as the groin, chin, or forearm.(Paman, 2007) *Sungkiti Tutsada - Sungkiti also called tutsada, tuslok, or salag tusok represents the deadly thrusting techniques that can devastate an opponent. It is especially effective for combat in places where lateral movement is restricted. Sungkiti aims to attack vulnerable areas like the eyes, throat, solar plexus, underarms, and groin. *Abaniko Largo / Corto *Doblada / Doblete *Banda y Banda *Ocho Ocho - Ocho ocho means \\"figure eight,\\" and this pattern of movement follows the path of the infinity symbol. Ocho ocho may be delivered in a wide or tight manner, depending on the situation. *Sinawali *Espada Y Daga - sword and dagger, or stick and dagger methods *Daga sa Daga *Dulo Dulo - The dulo dulo is a specialty weapon of Kombatan. It is simply a short stick, or horn, of about six inches with points at both ends. It is used in close quarters to attack sensitive areas of the body. It can be utilized to strike; to force your opponent to release you from a grabbing attack; or to magnify the effect of a joint lock by attacking the sensitive points you are controlling. *Dos Puntas *Tres Puntas *Bangkaw - The bangkaw is a staff, usually around six-feet in length, used to attack and defend. Kombatan features techniques for its use against another staff, as well as other weapons. Its primary advantage is its long reach. With it, one can counter an attack from an opponent armed with a bolo or knife without coming into close proximity. The bangkaw is a martial adaptation of the long stick that is used in rural areas of the Philippines to carry two large buckets of water on ones shoulder. *Sibat *Mano-Mano *Sipaan *Dumog  See also  * Modern Arnis * Arnis * Balintawak Eskrima * Doce Pares * Filipino Martial Arts  References  *Action Pursuit Group Media.

On the roof, there is another tower, a gift, a box full of books. Encased in the books a CD lies. The Martello Tower is like a giant Maypole, around its base Carolina the ice cream van circles around and around, in a clockwise direction. From the ice cream van, haunting music is heard. Hundreds of peoples voices, fragments of songs, lullabies float out into the sky. We all wait, watching. From some distance away the strange, yet beautiful melody is interrupted by the hum of a small plane. The plane flies into view and heads in the direction of the Tower, training a brightly coloured banner. As it approaches it begins to circle anticlockwise. Seven times it circumscribes the Tower. On its seventh circuit confetti falls from the plane showering the Tower and the ground below. The ribbons are released and flutter to the ground. The sound from Carolina grows in intensity.

It has about 5,500 inhabitants. 23% of the population are Poles. Geography Jablunkov lies between the Silesian and Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain ranges, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia, and is the easternmost town of the country. The Lomná River flows into the Olza River in the town. History According to historians, the beginnings of Jablunkov are to be found in the place where the present-day village of Hrádek is located. It was first mentioned in a written document in 1435. This settlement was primordially named Jablonka and as such it was mentioned as a seat of a Catholic parish in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery. In the same year Magyars completely destroyed the settlement. Politically it belonged to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia which was since 1526 a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1560 Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn, granted town rights to the town. It continuously developed and by the end of the 16th century it had a mayor and a town council. The town profited from its location in the Jablunkov Pass. It was located on an ancient trade route going from the Mediterranean Sea to the Baltic Sea. The route was used by merchants of ancient Rome; frequent discoveries of Roman coins confirm that. Important trading routes to Kraków (north) and to Upper Hungary (east) also run through the town. It became more and more important and also rich, as many citizens lived by trading. In the middle of the 17th century it had 750 inhabitants, together with a suburb and a village of Písečná. In the 18th century most of citizens worked in trade, craftsmanship and farming. At the end of the 19th century, many new buildings were built. A new Art Nouveau town hall was built in 1905. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The town became a seat of a legal district in the political district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 2,941 in 1880 to 3,289 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish-speakers (dropping from 89.4% in 1880 to 84.4% in 1910) accompanied by German-speaking minority (growing from 9.2% in 1880 to 14.1% in 1910) and Czech-speaking people (at most 57 or 1.5% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (88.5%), followed by Protestants (9.2%), Jews (90 or 2.3%) and 2 people adhering to another faiths. The town was also traditionally inhabited by a specific ethnographic group called Jacki, speaking Jablunkov dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. Landmarks The most important landmarks are the historic town square with a fountain and statue of the Virgin Mary from 1655, the Roman Catholic church built in 1620, and the Elizabethan Monastery. The latter was established by the priest Wawrzyniec Piontek, who wanted to improve medical treatment in the town: the nearest hospital was located in Ostrava. The Elizabethan hospital was built in 1856. It was located near the Olza River and was frequently flooded. A decision was taken to build a new one, which began operating in 1932. In 1948 the monastery and its properties were seized by the Communists, who forbade the further induction of new sisters. Former Elizabethan sisters were ordered to work in a state farm with cattle. In 1989, after the fall of communism, it was returned to the Elizabethan sisters. The monastery in Jablunkov is one of only three Elizabethan monasteries in the Czech Republic, the other two being in Prague and Brno. There is also a sanatorium in Jablunkov. It was built in 1933–1935 and is a valuable landmark of modern architecture. It is surrounded by a park planted in 1936–1938. There are more than 500 species of trees and shrubs in the park. Several sculptures are also located in the park. Culture The most popular cultural event is the annual Gorolski Święto (literally Gorals Festival), organized every year in August since 1948 by the Polish Cultural and Educational Union (PZKO). It is a showcase of local Polish folklore and traditions that attracts visitors from all of Zaolzie and also from foreign countries.

The surrounding villages include Garristown, Clonalvy, Duleek, Battramstown, Bellewstown and Stamullen. Ardcath means \\"height of the battle\\" in Irish, and refers to a battle (recorded in the Book of Howth) fought in Bardic history between the Kings of Ireland, and Fionn McCool and the Fianna. The Kings gathered on the hill of Garristown and the Fianna on the hill of Ardcath. History Four Knocks () is a passage tomb near Ardcath that was built around 5000 years ago. The graves are decorated and show the first artistic depiction of a human face in Ireland. Ardcath is historically part of the barony of Upper Duleek. In the early 19th century half of the parish was being cultivated (principally with wheat) while the other half was pasture land. Cotton was weaved in the area for Dublin and Drogheda manufacturers.Lewis Topographical Dictionary There are extensive ruins of a medieval church, surrounded by a cemetery that is still in use. Ardcath's church was dedicated to St Mary the Blessed Virgin as was a tradition of the Norman settlement with the tithe of the Church and Parish being directed to the Canons of Llananthony (prima and secunda) Wales from 1172 to 1541. The church also had an active 'confraternity' which was a body corporate dedicated to maintaining religious services within the Church. Such organisations were often established by Charter and survived the Reformation. There was a similar organisation at the Church in the then adjoining parish of Piercetown. Community There are several community groups in the area such as the Ardcath Macra and a guild of the Irish Countrywomen's Association. These have been around since 1952 and 1948 respectively, and include members from surrounding towns.Ardcath Macra History ICA-Ardcath's 60th Anniversary Ardcath has a local school that was built in 1950 and is currently attended by around 100 students. Prior to this the school was in the old Ardcath Penal Day Church building when it stopped being used in 1862.Ardcath cemetery inscriptions and information Every year there is a large festival organised by the Ardcath Parish Committee. The festival runs the course of a week in summer and every second year the Rose of Ardcath is contested in a local pub.Drogheda Independent - Full Swing Festival The building was originally built in 1859. The building is used for religious worship and is a single storey detached building. It was built because of the deteriorating condition of the old church built in 1690. The church cost 2600 pounds. It suffered storm damage on several occasions. In 1903 the sacristy roof was stripped and the nave damaged. The roof was stripped and re-slated in 1992. The building is gothic in style. In 1955, extensive renovation work was carried out on the church. The walls and floors were repaired and a sacred heart altar with marble rails was erected. Transportation The roads in Ardcath are all local roads - though there are some regional roads close by such as the R130 in Garristown. Safety concerns over the state of some of the roads around Ardcath have been raised at the meeting of the Slane Electoral Area Committee of Meath County Council,East Meath issues aired as Slane area council meets including concerns relating to inadequate signage notifying drivers on the approach to the local school.Ardcath and Clonalvy Action Group See also *List of towns in the Republic of Ireland ReferencesExternal links *Ardcath.com *Ardcath Macra *Ardcath Schools Project 1930's Category:Towns and villages in County Meath ","title":"Ardcath"},{"id":"2500017","text":"is a fantasy-themed shoot-'em-up game released by Capcom as a coin-operated video game in 1986. The player takes control of a young soldier equipped with magical wings who must save the world from a malfunctioning supercomputer. A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released exclusively in North America in 1988. The original coin-op version is included in Capcom Classics Collection for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and in Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for PlayStation Portable. Gameplay The coin-op version of Legendary Wings can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with a second player being allowed to join the game at any time or even continue after a game over. The game's controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons which changes depending on the context. The game consists of five areas with two different playing styles: the first segment in each stage is a top-view vertical scrolling segment in which the player flies across the sky, shooting at airborne enemies with their gun while dropping bombs at ground enemies, in order to reach the palace at the end of segment. When the player defeats the guardian and gains entrance to the palace, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective, in which the player moves towards their goal on foot (by walking, crouching, and climbing ladders, as well jumping) until reaching the boss at the end, in which the player character will begin to fly with their wings again. In addition to the regular levels there are two optional levels that are accessible from the vertical-scrolling segment: a trap level in which the player is forced to escape from if they're sucked by the giant mechanical face on each area; and a hidden bonus level where the player can obtain various treasure chests to increase their score. The player can improve their gun by destroying certain enemies or weapon capsules and picking up the \\"P\\" item stored inside. The player can power-up their character up to five levels; the first power-up will increase the player's speed; the second will change their gun to a twin shooter, as well as further increase their speed; the third power-up allows for continuous ground attacks; the fourth power-up improves the player's gun so that it shoots in three directions; and the fifth and final power-up will upgrade weapon to the \\"Psycho Flame\\" gun, which can destroy most enemies with a single shot. When the player is shot by an enemy, they will lose a life and revert to their initial power level. Plot Legendary Wings is set in a distant future where an alien supercomputer named \\"Dark\\", which has been helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, has suddenly rebelled against mankind. Two young warriors are given the Wings of Love and Courage by the God of War Ares in order to destroy Dark and ensure mankind's survival. VersionsArcade= The original Legendary Wings for the arcade was released in three different variations: a Japanese version (titled Ares no Tsubasa) and two overseas versions. The Japanese release features two different player characters whose names are shown on the game's attract sequence: \\"Michelle Heart\\", a young woman in a pink bikini-like outfit; and Kevin Walker, a young man in blue briefs. One of the two overseas versions replaces both characters with nameless male heroes, one in red trunks and the other in blue, which both wear golden wings instead of the regular white ones from the Japanese version. The second overseas version recovers the original characters, but it changes the color of Michelle's costume from pink to green. Arcade World Record After being uncontested for 33 years, Sam Griffith beat Quentin Balduc's world record for Legendary Wings. On January 20, 2020 Sam beat the game in approximately 1 hour and 7 minutes with a score of 694,000pts handily surpassing Balduc's long standing record of 612,500. =Nintendo Entertainment System= The NES version of Legendary Wings features several significant differences from its coin-op counterpart. While the basic premise and formula remains essentially the same, several changes were made to the gameplay, particularly in how the player's power-ups work in this version. Like in the arcade game, the player can upgrade their firepower- up by picking up \\"P\\" icons hidden inside certain containers. The player can improve their character's firepower to four levels: starting with the normal gun, the player can improve it to a twin laser, a penetration beam, and a three-way flame shot. Picking up the fourth power-up will turn the player character into a Turtle Dove,Conversation with Hiroshi Matsumoto, Tokyo, Japan, 12 June 2004. which can shoot wide shots that are four times as powerful as the default gun. If the player is shot during a power-up state, it will simply revert the player to their previous power level. If the player is in Turtle Dove mode, they can withstand up to two direct hits from enemies before getting the downgrade. To continue after a game over, the player must retrieve heart icons hidden within the game's bonus levels to gain continues (up to nine continues can be stocked). Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Legendary Wings on their December 15, 1986 issue as being the twelfth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy Michelle Heart makes an appearance in the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes as one of several support characters who assist the main fighters in combat. She also appears as a trading card in SNK's Card Fighters series. In the tactical role-playing game Namco x Capcom, the character of Sylphie (the shopkeeper from Forgotten Worlds) dresses up as Michelle Heart when she performs one of her special attacks. Michelle Heart is also featured in Project X Zone 2 as a cameo character in Captain Commando's Solo Unit attack.

The player controls Sareth, the apprentice of the wizard Phenrig, after he is sent to the city of Stonehelm to accompany an expedition trying to retrieve a powerful artifact known as \\"The Skull of Shadows\\". Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was released on 24 October 2006 on PC, and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic: Elements was released later on 12 February 2008 for the Xbox 360. It adds new levels in the single-player campaign, a revamped multiplayer mode, numerous bug-fixes, and adjustments for the console experience.Dark Messiah of Might & Magic Elements Hands-On - Xbox 360 News at GameSpot Gameplay The player attacks a Pao kai. Enemies are generally difficult to kill in straightforward combat, although characters developed for this purpose may have an easier time. Characters who develop their stealth skills can sneak up behind unaware enemies and perform a lethal backstab maneuver, while characters that have skill with a bow can use it to snipe enemies from a distance. Developing a character for resilience and strength for melee combat is still possible and completely viable, but even with proper specialization, successful close combat requires careful application of tactics, timing, accuracy, and properly using a range of close-quarters offensive techniques. Particularly, the player character's ability to kick enemies and knock them back is emphasized by environmental hazards such as spike racks, open fires, and pitfalls being in almost every combat area, which can often end a fight more efficiently than using only weapon attacks. For players who build their character to specialize in Magic, spells can be used to unleash offensive effects, heal the player character, or serve a number of utility purposes. Each use of a spell consumes varying amounts of the player's mana, which gradually regenerates over time, but can be replenished more quickly through consumption of mana potions. As the player completes objectives throughout the game, Dark Messiah awards experience points that can be used to buy skills in one of three skill trees: Combat, Magic, and Miscellaneous. The Combat tree improves the power and efficiency of physical attacks. The Magic tree grants access to new spells. The Miscellaneous tree contains general utility improvements, including Stealth. Although some enemies will drop usable items when killed, looting in Dark Messiah is mostly a fixed affair. Valuable items are placed in specific locations for the player to find. Each item has fixed stats, and the selection of items is also limited, with only a relatively small number of different weapons or armor in each category. Additionally, advanced items typically have a skill requirement, with the end result being that the character equips only a handful of different items over the course of the one play-through, depending on what skills they have chosen to develop on their character. =Multiplayer= Dark Messiah features a multiplayer mode where opposing teams battle each other and earn points by performing strategic maneuvers across a large map. There are two playable factions, consisting of humans and undead, along with five playable classes. A character customization system is present, with the limitation that players must select a predefined class and may only buy skills available for that class. There is also a Colosseum mode, in which players fight take turns to fight one-on-one duels, while the other players sit in the audience. When players are not battling in the current match, they can bet XP on the outcome of the current duel. PlotSetting= Nearly a thousand years ago the Wars of Fire raged across the face of Ashan. Men, Elves, Dwarves, and their allies pitted themselves against the hordes of Demons. Great devastation was wrought, but in the end the allied forces were victorious. Their victory was largely due to the heroic sacrifice of the wizard known as Sar-Elam, the Seventh Dragon. Using his almost god-like powers and supported by his fellow wizards, Sar-Elam cast the Demons out of the world into a limbo of eternal fire. From the essence of his spirit, Sar-Elam wove a prison to contain the Demons forever. Something went wrong during Sar-Elams ritual, however. The magic he summoned failed to create a complete prison; the tiniest of flaws remained in the otherwise impervious barrier, a weakness that allowed Demonic influence to seep into the world during times of a lunar eclipse. Angry but patient, the Demons lurked in their prison waiting ... and planning. All that remained of the Seventh Dragon was his skull. Now called the Skull of Shadows, it was spirited away by those loyal to the goddess Mother Asha, creator of the world and source of all magic. They hid it in an ancient temple on a deserted island, far from the machinations of Men, Elves, or Demons. There the Skull sits, awaiting the day when its powers might be needed again. 67 years after Sar-Elam's death, his disciple Sar-Shazzar prophesied that a half-demon, half- human child would one day be born; a walker between worlds who would-be known as the \\"Dark Messiah\\" and would use the relics of the Seventh Dragon to shatter the Demons prison forever. 969 years after Sar-Elam's death, after the young king Nicolai Griffin was killed by a demon renegade, the demon sovereign, Kha-Beleth impregnated Nicolai's former-fiancée, Isabel Greyhound, and before she could have been saved, she gave birth to the Dark Messiah. 20 years later, Sareth's story begins. =Story= The protagonist of Dark Messiah is a young man named Sareth, who is under the tutelage of the Wizard Phenrig. After years of studying the arts of magic and physical training in the arts of war, he is finally taken on an expedition to retrieve a rare artifact known as the Shantiri Crystal. After finding the Crystal and disposing of the would-be rival expedition, Sareth is tasked to bring the crystal to an associate of Phenrig's, the Wizard Menelag, who is also the lord of the city of Stonehelm. Menelag and Phenrig have certain \\"mutual interests\\" that involve finding an artifact called the Skull of Shadows. Menelag apparently is unable to continue his search without the Crystal. To guide him on his way, a spirit named Xana will reside in Sareth's mind. Shortly after arriving in Stonehelm, Sareth witnesses an undead cyclops and a small army of ghouls sent by the Necromancers breach Stonehelm's defenses and begin to overwhelm the guards. Sareth is recruited to help in the defense effort by taking control of a ballista. Using this, he manages to stun the undead cyclops long enough for a guard to stab it in the eye, thus killing it. Seeing their most valuable asset destroyed, the remnants of the invading force beat a hasty retreat. Sareth then resumes his search for Menelag. Upon reaching the front gate of Menelag's manor, Sareth is greeted by Leanna, the young niece and pupil of Menelag. That night, the three enjoy a small feast in Sareth's honor after which Menelag informs Sareth that they will set sail the following morning to resume the search for the Skull. In the middle of the night, the crystal is stolen by a ghoul, who murders Menelag in the process. Sareth then chases the ghoul to a warehouse, where he finds the necromancer Arantir using the crystal's power to open a portal to Nar-Heresh, the necromancer city. Sareth manages to steal the crystal back and escape to the docks, where he falls asleep. In a dream, he recalls his meeting with Phenrig, except that Phenrig is saying that he does not trust Sareth on this mission alone and says that he needs someone to \\"hold his leash\\" as he summons Xana. In the dream, Xana appears to be a demon and attacks Sareth. Sareth and Leanna leave Stonehelm by boat and travel to the island with the Skull of Shadows. While en route, Sareth has another dream in which he kills Leanna, and Arantir alludes that she is only the first of many victims. After arriving, they find the expedition destroyed, and most of the men dead, killed by Orc warriors. Sareth and Leanna are chased into the Temple of the Skull by a Pao kai which Sareth kills a little later with a gate, and Sareth proceeds alone to the top of the Temple, where he places the Shantiri Crystal, and defeats the Orc chief Aratok in a duel. Arantir then reveals himself and appears to kill Leanna. Sareth, however, escapes to the crypt below and retrieves the Skull of Shadows. Sareth then has a vision of the Demon Sovereign Kha-Beleth, who reveals himself to be Sareth's father. Kha-Beleth names Sareth the Dark Messiah, and then commands to be released using the power of the Skull. Sareth wakes up to see Arantir, who takes the skull and then impales Sareth on a spike. Fueled by Xana's demonic power, Sareth wakes up alive and gains the power to transform into a demon, which grants him uncanny strength at the cost of health. Stripped of all his belongings, Sareth uses the demon form to fight off the Orc guards as he recovers his items. He manages to leave the island and returns to Stonehelm. Once there, he takes the portal to Nar-Heresh. There, Sareth witnesses Leanna - who is still alive - being thrown into a spider pit. Saving Leanna is optional, but impacts the possible endings that the player may receive. Regardless of the player's choice, Sareth discovers Arantir's plans to sacrifice the entire population of Stonehelm in order to permanently seal Kha-Beleth's prison. Sareth then returns to a besieged Stonehelm, fighting alongside the remaining human resistance. If Leanna was rescued in the previous chapter, Sareth may visit the sanctuary in order to purge Xana from his body. If Sareth proceeds with the cleansing, he loses the ability to transform into a demon, but gains the ability to use powerful holy weapons. If Sareth is unable or unwilling to undergo the cleansing ritual, nothing will change. Whatever the case, the choice determines which endings the player may receive. In the ancient necropolis over which Stonehelm was built, Sareth is eventually reunited with Leanna. If the player left her behind in the spider pit, she appears as a Lich, who Sareth then destroys. If Sareth saved her, but did not cleanse himself, she will attack him. If Leanna was rescued and Sareth cleansed himself, she will join Sareth in the final chapter. Sareth then makes his way through the necropolis and eventually catches up with Arantir as he is about to perform the ritual. When Sareth attacks Arantir, he summons his Avatar of Death, also seen in Heroes V: Tribes of the East (the dragon in Dark Messiah does resemble a pao kai but it is still uncertain as to what the dragon really is). Sareth fights off the Dragon, which forces Arantir to perform a resummoning, during which Arantir is vulnerable. Eventually Arantir is defeated, leaving Sareth to make his final decision for the Skull. The player may use the Skull to lock his father away forever, or destroy the Skull and free his father. Each option offers a different ending. The ensuing cut scene will vary slightly depending on whether it is Leanna or Xana that accompanies Sareth at the end of the game, giving the game a total of four different endings. Development Critical praise of Arkane's previous game, Arx Fatalis, gave the opportunity for them to work with Valve to develop a new title on their Source engine, and Raphaël Colantonio opted to make a sequel, Arx Fatalis 2. However, the poor sales of the first game made it difficult to find a publisher. They were approached by Ubisoft and asked to apply the Arx Fatalis game engine to their Might and Magic. This became Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It refined the first-person melee combat of Arx Fatalis with a lesser emphasis on role-playing elements. =Versions= Despite having received a \\"not under 18\\" rating from the USK, Ubisoft announced that the two German versions of Dark Messiah will contain some changes from the internationally released version. Specifically, the German version does not allow for enemies' heads or limbs to be severed, enemies cannot be impaled after death, burning enemies will die immediately and their corpses cannot be mutilated further after death. Ubisoft separately released a limited edition \\"International Version\\" of the game (playable in English only) which is identical to the version of the game released in most other countries, and which was also released in Germany. However, since then the Bundesprüfstelle has declared, after an examination in February 2008, that the uncensored version of the game, though heavily relying on melee combat and displaying violent content, is not harmful to minors, as equal importance is laid on the setting in a fantasy world and the elaborated storyline. In a second attempt, the original version secured a \\"not under 18\\" rating with the USK, though this now rated version has yet to be released in Germany. Reception Critical reaction to Dark Messiah has been divided, particularly between the US and the rest of the world. IGN, for example, gave mixed reports with their Australian team awarding the game 8.8/10 and their American team awarding it 7.0/10. Praise for the game came from PC Zone (UK), PC Gamer (UK), and Game Informer (USA) which awarded the game 84%, 88% and 9.25 respectively, with praise going to the game's innovative and responsive melee combat. Game Informer, in particular, praised Dark Messiah for the sheer fun factor and beautiful graphics. In contrast, several publications from the US gave poor reviews. GameSpot gave the game a review score of 6.7/10 stating that it had many technical issues, repetitive gameplay, predictable story, and poor multiplayer. CNET and GameSpy each gave similar reviews with the latter giving it 3/5. 1UP.com gave the game only 4/10, criticising the over-reliance on using the kick as a weapon and dubbing it \\"The Adventures of Sir Kicksalot Deathboot in the Land of the Conspicuously Placed Spike Racks\\". The Australian video game talk show Good Game's two reviewers both gave the game an 8/10. Overall, Metacritic assigned the game an aggregate rating of 72/100 based on 44 reviews. On GameRankings, the game received a score of 74% based on 48 reviews. Elements on the Xbox 360 fared significantly worse, receiving an aggregate score of 54%. IGN noted that this version simplified the original game's role-playing element; players in Elements must choose one of four predetermined character classes that gain skills according to their specialty. GameSpot criticized the game's control problems and graphics, stating that it \\"may be the ugliest game powered by [the] Source engine\\".Dark Messiah of Might and Magic: Elements for Xbox 360 Review - Xbox 360 Dark Messiah of Might and Magic: Elements Review GameSpot nominated this version for the dubious award of Flat-Out Worst Game in its 2008 video game awards. Hyper commends the game for its \\"telekinesis, great combat\\" and being \\"lovely to look at\\". However, it criticized it for having \\"poor non-human combat\\" and \\"bugger all story\\". Sequel In an interview on August 15, 2012, with Dutch gamesite Gamer.nl, Might & Magic creative director Erwan le Breton mentioned they are discussing a possible sequel to Dark Messiah. However, Arkane Studios has left Ubisoft and the Might & Magic team is still searching for a new studio to take over the sequel.

It may also refer to a class of compounds, which are structurally related to the classical salen ligand, primarily bis-Schiff bases. Salen ligands are notable for coordinating a wide range of different metals, which they can often stabilise in various oxidation states. These metal salen complexes primarily find use as catalysts. Synthesis and properties H2salen may be synthesized by the condensation of ethylenediamine and salicylaldehyde. :450px Salcomine, a complex of salen with cobalt Jacobsen's salen-Mn catalyst Complexes of salen with metal cations may be made without isolating it from the reaction mixture. This is possible because the stability constant for the formation of the metal complexes are very high, due to the chelate effect. :H2L + Mn+ → ML(n−2)+ \\\\+ 2 H+ where L stands for the ligand. The pyridine adduct of the cobalt(II) complex Co(salen)(py) (salcomine) has a square-pyramidal structure; it can act as a dioxygen carrier by forming a labile, octahedral O2 complex. The name “salen ligands” is used for tetradentate ligands which have similar structures. For example, in salpn there is a methyl substituent on the bridge. It is used as a metal deactivation additive in fuels. The presence of bulky groups near the coordination site may enhance the catalytic activity of a metal complex and prevent its dimerization. Salen ligands derived from 3,5-di-tert- butylsalicylaldehyde fulfill these roles, and also increase the solubility of the complexes in non-polar solvents like pentane. Chiral “salen” ligands may be created by proper substitution of the diamine backbone, the phenyl ring, or both. An example is the ligand obtained by condensation of the C2-symmetric trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane with 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde. Chiral ligands may be used in asymmetric synthesis reactions, such as the Jacobsen epoxidation: Related ligands Synthesis and complexation of Jäger's ligand. A class of tetradentate ligands with the generic name acacen are obtained by the condensation of derivatives of acetylacetone and ethylenediamine. Cobalt complexes [Co(acacen)L2]+, selectively inhibit the activities of histidine- containing proteins through exchange of the axial ligands. These compounds show promise for the inhibition of oncogenesis. The salan and salalen ligands are similar in structure to salen ligands, but have one or two saturated nitrogen-aryl bonds (amines rather than imines). They tend to be less rigid and more electron rich at the metal center than the corresponding salen complexes. Salans can be synthesized by the alkylation of an appropriate amine with a phenolic alkyl halide. The “half-salen” ligands have only one salicylimine group. They are prepared from a salicylaldehyde and a monoamine. The name “salen” or “salen-type” may be used for other ligands that have similar environment around the chelating site, namely two acidic hydroxyls and two Schiff base (aryl-imine) groups. These include the ligands abbreviated as salph, from the condensation of 1,2-phenylenediamine and salicylaldehyde, and salqu, from the condensation of salicylaldehyde and 2-quinoxalinol.

Rezayee, along with her family, lived in Pakistan for eight years as a refugee, and studied martial arts and boxing there. After her return with her family to Afghanistan in 2002, she moved in boxing and was the first Afghan female boxer. But due to lack of other female boxers in her team, she then moved into judo, and began training for the Olympic Games at a girls judo club sponsored by Danish Refugee Council.

The siege took place between 31 October and 7 November 1914 against Imperial Germany. The siege was the first encounter between Japanese and German forces, the first Anglo-Japanese operation of the war, and the only major land battle in the Asian and Pacific theatre during World War I. Background British, Indian and Japanese soldiers in Tsingtao, 1914. Imperial Japanese Army uniform as worn on the expedition to Kiaochow Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germany joined other European powers (alongside the United States and Japan) in a scramble for colonial possessions. As with the other world powers, Germany began to interfere in Chinese local affairs. After two German missionaries were killed in the Juye Incident in 1897, China was forced to agree to the Kiautschou Bay concession in Shantung (now Shandong) to Germany in 1898 on a 99-year lease. Germany then began to assert its influence across the rest of the province and built the city and port of Tsingtao, which became the base of the German East Asiatic Squadron of the Kaiserliche Marine (German Navy), which operated in support of the German colonies in the Pacific. Britain viewed the German presence in China with suspicion and leased Weihaiwei, also in Shantung, as a naval port and coaling station. Russia leased its own station at Port Arthur (now Lüshunkou) and France at Kwang-Chou-Wan. Britain also began to forge close ties with Japan, and diplomatic relations became closer, with the Anglo- Japanese Alliance being signed on 30 January 1902. Japan saw the alliance as a necessary deterrent to its main rival, Russia. Japan demonstrated its potential by its victory in the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, and the alliance continued into World War I. When the war in Europe began in August 1914, Britain promptly requested Japanese assistance. On 15 August, Japan issued an ultimatum, stating that Germany must withdraw her warships from Chinese and Japanese waters and transfer control of its port of Tsingtao to Japan. The next day, Major-General Mitsuomi Kamio, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 18th Infantry Division, was ordered to prepare to take Tsingtao by force. The ultimatum expired on 23 August, and Japan declared war on Germany. At the beginning of hostilities, the ships of the East Asia Squadron under Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee were dispersed at various Pacific colonies on routine missions. Spee's ships rendezvoused in the Northern Mariana Islands for coaling. then headed for the Indian Ocean, while the rest of the squadron made their way to the west coast of South America. The squadron engaged and destroyed two obsolescent ships of a small Royal Navy squadron at the Battle of Coronel, before itself being destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. German defences The Boxer Rebellion at the beginning of the century had led Germany to consider the defense of Tsingtao. The port and town were divided from the rest of the peninsula by steep hills. The natural line of defense lay along the hills, from the Kaiserstuhl to Litsuner Heights. A second line of defense was set up along a closer line of steep hills. The final line of defense was along hills above the town. A network of trenches, batteries and other fortifications had been built in preparation for the coming siege. Germany had strengthened the defenses from the sea, laying mines in the approaches to the harbour and building four batteries and five redoubts. The fortifications were well equipped (though some with obsolete Chinese artillery) and were well manned. Prelude Suwo was the flagship of the Japanese expeditionary fleet during the Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese seaplane carrier conducted the world's first naval- launched air raids in September 1914 against German positions in Tsingtao. On 27 August, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) sent ships under Vice-Admiral Sadakichi Kato, flying his flag in the pre-dreadnought , to blockade the coast of Kiaochow. The British Royal Navy (RN) strengthened the Japanese fleet by sending the China Station's pre-dreadnought and the destroyer . On October 14th, the Triumph was slightly damaged by a German shore battery, killing one member of its crew and injuring two others. The blockading fleet consisted mainly of nearly obsolete warships, though it did at times include a few modern vessels. These included the dreadnoughts , , the battlecruiser , her sister Hiei, and the seaplane carrier , whose aircraft became the first of its kind in the world to attack land and sea targets. These Japanese aircraft would also take part in another military first, a night-time bombing raid. Japanese troops coming ashore near Tsingtao The 18th Infantry Division was the primary Japanese Army formation that took part in the initial landings, numbering some 23,000 soldiers with support from 142 artillery pieces. They began to land on 2 September at Lungkow, which was experiencing heavy floods at the time and later at Lau Schan Bay on 18 September, about east of Tsingtao. China protested against the Japanese violation of her neutrality but did not interfere in the operations. British troops arriving at Tsingtao in 1914 The British Government and the other European great powers were concerned about Japanese intentions in the region and decided to send a small symbolic British contingent from Tientsin in an effort to allay their fears. The 1,500-man contingent was commanded by Brigadier-General Nathaniel Walter Barnardiston and consisted of 1,000 soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, The South Wales Borderers; later followed by 500 soldiers of the 36th Sikhs. Following a friendly fire incident, British troops were given Japanese raincoats to wear so they would be more easily identifiable to the Japanese.The Great War, Episode 6. The Germans responded to the threat against Tsingtao by concentrating all of their available East Asian troops in the city. Kaiser Wilhelm II made the defense of Tsingtao a top priority, saying that \\"... it would shame me more to surrender Tsingtao to the Japanese than Berlin to the Russians\\". The German garrison, commanded by naval Captain and Governor Alfred Meyer-Waldeck, consisted of the marines of III Seebataillon, naval personnel, Chinese colonial troops and Austro-Hungarian sailors, for a total strength of 3,625 men. He also had a modest complement of vessels, including the torpedo boat S-90; four small gunboats: the Iltis, Jaguar, Tiger, and Luchs; and the Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser , whose crew was initially divided in two: half to man the ship, and half to fight with the German land forces. On 22 August of the China squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Commander F. A. Russell, while routinely monitoring the naval trade routes, encountered and was damaged in action by the German torpedo boat , the German gunboat SMS Lauting and a 4-inch shore battery off Tsingtao. She was hit twice from the retreating S90. Siege German gun in the Bismarck Fortress, Tsing-Tau, crumpled by Japanese naval bombardment.

German Marines in forward position during the siege German PoWs returning to Wilhelmshaven, Germany from Japan in February 1920 As the Japanese approached their positions, Meyer-Waldeck withdrew his forces from the two outer defensive lines and concentrated his troops on the innermost line of defense along the hills closest to the town. The Austro- Hungarian cruiser, SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth, was stationed in Tsingtao at the start of the war. On 2 September 1914 the German gunboat Jaguar sank the stranded Japanese destroyer Shirotaye. On 5 September a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft scouted the port and reported that the Asian German fleet had departed; the Japanese ordered the dreadnought, pre-dreadnought and cruiser to leave the blockade. The next day, the first air-sea battle in history took place when a Farman seaplane launched by the Wakamiya unsuccessfully attacked the Kaiserin Elisabeth and the Jaguar in Qiaozhou Bay with bombs.. Early in the siege, the Kaiserin Elisabeth and German gunboat Jaguar made an unsuccessful sortie against Japanese vessels blockading Tsingtao. Later, the cruiser's 15cm and 4.7cm guns were removed from the ship and mounted on shore, creating the Batterie Elisabeth. The ship's crew took part in the defense of Tsingtao. On 13 September, the Japanese land forces launched a cavalry raid on the German rear-guard at Tsimo, which the Germans gave up and retreated. Subsequently, the Japanese took control of Kiautschou and the Santung railway. Lt. Gen. Kamio considered this the point of no return for his land forces and as the weather became extremely harsh he took no risk and fortified the troops at the town, returned the reinforcements that were on the way, re-embarked and landed at Lau Schan Bay. As the siege progressed, the naval vessels trapped in the harbor, Cormoran, Iltis and Luchs, were scuttled on 28 September. On 17 October, the torpedo boat S-90 slipped out of Tsingtao harbor and fired a torpedo which sank the Japanese cruiser with the loss of 271 officers and men. S-90 was unable to run the blockade back to Tsingtao and was scuttled in Chinese waters when the ship ran low on fuel. Tiger was scuttled on 29 October, Kaiserin Elisabeth on 2 November, followed finally by Jaguar on 7 November, the day the fortress surrendered to the Japanese. The Japanese started shelling the fort and the city on 31 October and began digging parallel lines of trenches, just as they had done at the Siege of Port Arthur nine years earlier. Very large 11inch howitzers from land, in addition to the firing of the Japanese naval guns, brought the German defences under constant bombardment during the night, the Japanese moving their own trenches further forward under the cover of their artillery. The bombardment continued for seven days, employing around 100 siege guns with 1,200 shells each on the Japanese side. While the Germans were able to use the heavy guns of the port fortifications to bombard the landward positions of the Allies, they soon ran out of ammunition. When the artillery ran out of ammunition on 6 November, surrender was inevitable. The German garrison was able to field only a single Taube aircraft during the siege, flown by Lieutenant Gunther Plüschow. (A second Taube piloted by Lt. Friedrich Müllerskowsky crashed early in the campaign). The Taube was used for frequent reconnaissance flights and Plüschow made several nuisance attacks on the blockading squadron, dropping improvised munitions and other ordnance on them. Plüschow claimed the downing of a Japanese Farman MF.7 with his pistol, the first aerial victory in aviation history. Plüschow flew from Tsingtao on 6 November 1914 carrying the governor's last dispatches, which were forwarded to Berlin through neutral diplomatic channels. On the night of 6 November, waves of Japanese infantry attacked the third line of defence and overwhelmed the defenders. The next morning, the German forces, along with their Austro-Hungarian allies, asked for terms. The Allies took formal possession of the colony on 16 November 1914. Aftermath As the German garrison was able to hold out for nearly two months despite the naval blockade with sustained artillery bombardment and being outnumbered 6 to 1, the defeat nevertheless temporarily served as a morale booster. The German defenders watched the Japanese with curiosity as they marched into Tsingtao but turned their backs on the British when they entered into town.Adelaide Advertiser, Page 8, \\"The War\\" section, subparagraph \\"The China Fight – Australian who was wounded.\\" summary of interview with Captain M. J. G. Colyer, December 28, 1914 So deep was their anger that some German officers spat in the faces of their British counterparts. Japanese casualties numbered 733 killed and 1,282 wounded; the British had 12 killed and 53 wounded. The German defenders lost 199 dead and 504 wounded. The German dead were buried at Tsingtao, while the remaining soldiers were transported to prisoner of war camps in Japan. The 4,700 German prisoners were treated well and with respect in Japan, such as in Bandō prisoner-of-war camp. The German troops were interned in Japan until the formal signature of the Versailles peace treaty in 1919, but due to technical questions, the troops were not repatriated before 1920. 170 prisoners chose to remain in Japan after the end of the war.

Roboting gained fame after Michael Jackson used the dance when he performed \\"Dancing Machine\\" with his brothers,Mansour, David. From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century, p. 403 (2005) (\\"The Robot was a mimelike dance, popularized by The Jackson 5 and their Top Ten hit \\"Dancing Machine\\" (1974)\\") and later performed the dance during his solo career in songs such as \\"Smooth Criminal\\".  Description  The robot became a very big dig. It was popular in the 1960s, but goes back to the 1920s, when it was used theatrically in miming. It is a dance in which the dancer moves their limbs in a way that imitates the movements of a robot. Movements of the robot are normally started and finished with a dimestop (a very abrupt stop), to give the impression of motors starting and stopping, but poppers have also been known to do the robot with a pop to the beat. As long as the illusion of being a robot is maintained, it is considered the robot. Robot dancing is often considered a subsection of popping because poppers often include the robot in their routines, sometimes adding pops to the beat while maintaining the illusion of a robot. However, the robot also exists as its own dance and is sometimes considered a performance rather than a dance when the performer is imitating a robot without any music. When done without music, it is considered to be mime, instead of dance. Street theater often featured mimes who did a mechanical man or puppet style illusion, without music. In the late 1960s, the style was used while social dancing to funk or soul music. While not the first to imitate a robot as a mime, Charles \\"Robot\\" WashingtonHip-Hop and Urban Dance, p. 17 (2009) and his partner \\"Robot Ann\\" were the first to socially couple dance the style to music at parties and clubs. It was at this point it became a party dance and later combined with other illusion styles to form today's popping style. It is commonly known as \\"Robotics\\". Roboting has also been likened to the jazz-era folk dance of puppeting (a style also appreciated in some colors of experimental ballet), whereby the dancer would emulate the mechanical movements of a simple musical box doll.  Music  The Robot became popular around the world after Michael Jackson performed during a performance of the Jackson 5's \\"Dancing Machine\\" As with popping in general, the visual impact of the robot can be boosted by doing it in pace with music. The best effect is achieved with music that has very distinct beats such as electrofunk. It is nonetheless common to use music not particularly suited for the dance, but which has a \\"robot theme\\". In 1969 Jack Wild did the robot in the \\"Mechanical Boy\\" episode of H.R. Pufnstuf. The Jackson 5 first performed \\"Dancing Machine\\" on Soul Train in late October 1973, where Michael Jackson performed a robot dance during the song's musical break. The group again performed the routine on The Mike Douglas Show and the Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour in 1974.Lehman, Christopher P. A Critical History of Soul Train on Television, p. 84 (2008)McMillian, Stephen (22 October 2013). Soul Train History Book Presents: Michael Jackson Debuts the Robot, SoulTrain.com Unlike other dances, the robot may also be accompanied a cappella by making vocal impressions of beeps or boops and other electro-mechanical sounds. World record On September 29, 2009, the Guinness World Record for the Largest Robot Dance was broken by Robogals at the University of Melbourne, Australia. The previous record of 276 was broken when a Guinness World Record recognised 318 people were recorded as dancing in unison in approved robot style.

Their small size and high speed made them difficult targets for German E-boats, though, like these opponents, they were limited by heavy weather, when they did not provide a stable enough platform to aim the guns. The large number of guns meant the crew was relatively large, numbering as high as thirty men on the largest boats.  Description  MGBs were extremely heavily armed for vessels of their size. By 1945, MGB 658 carried two power- mounted QF 6-pounders in the A and Y turret positions, a twin 20 mm Oerlikon cannon in the X turret position, a single 20 mm Oerlikon on either side forward of the bridge and two twin .303 Vickers machine guns on the bridge wings. They were also equipped with smoke-making equipment, basic radar and depth charges.  Service  MGB 66 at speed with the crew at action stations, off the coast of Scotland In the early years of the war, they saw action defending shipping against enemy torpedo boats such as the German E-boats on the southern and eastern coasts of the UK. MGBs were also involved in the protection of shipping after D-Day. Robert Ryder used an MGB for command of the St Nazaire Raid. Ryder and William Savage, the gunner of the unprotected two pounder gun on MGB 314, received Victoria Crosses for their part in the raid. In the Mediterranean, they were used offensively to sink Italian and German shipping.

After this campaign, they moved northwards and assisted with the invasion of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and Elba. From island bases they patrolled along the western coast of Italy attacking small coastal ships and E-boats until mid-1944. As Italy was progressively liberated, certain flotillas, such as the 56th, were sent around to the Adriatic to assist partisans in the islands off Yugoslavia. They did not take the prefix HMS as they were boats, not ships, and instead used the prefix \\"HMMGB\\" on formal occasions. The crews generally referred to them by their numbers. In 1947, MGB 2009 was fitted with a Metrovick gas turbine, thereby becoming the world's first gas turbine powered naval vessel.

One of his children has autism. Hartman is an Eagle Scout. Career From 1984-87, he served as an intern and general assignment reporter for WTOL in Toledo, Ohio. From 1987 to 1991, he was a feature reporter for KSTP in Minneapolis and held the same post at WABC-TV in New York City from 1991-94. From 1994 to 1998, he served as a feature reporter for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, and hosted a segment called \\"The Stevening News\\". Hartman was also a correspondent for two CBS News magazines, Coast to Coast (1996–97) and Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel (1997–98).

It covers a total of in a figure-of-eight route, centred on Barnstaple. The section between Braunton and Meeth is car-free, level and mostly tarmacked, and is shared by pedestrians and cyclists, with horseriding also permitted on part of it.The Tarka Trail Guide There is a guidebook available for this section. There are 21 yellow-topped audio posts spread out along this section of the Trail. Each post has a different information plaque and QR code. Users scan the code with a smartphone and each sound recording corresponds to a particular place on the Tarka Trail where you can learn about the wildlife, history, and heritage of the Trail. The remainder of the route covers a wide variety of landscapes, including wooded river valleys, moorland, coastal cliffs and sandy beaches. Walking varies between easy through to moderate and strenuous, depending on the location, but, in general, it is comprehensively waymarked. The trails are a popular tourist destination and bicycle hire businesses are available for those who wish to cycle along suitable sections of the trail. A section of the Trail is part of National Cycle Network route number 27 and forms part of the route known as the Devon Coast to Coast Cycle Route a route of from Ilfracombe to Plymouth largely using former railway lines.The Tarka Trail crossing the River Torridge, just south of Bideford, utilising the former railway bridge.  History  The Tarka Trail was established in 1987 as the Taw/Torridge Country Park using the disused railway line between Barnstaple and Bideford. The railway line was purchased for £515,000 in 1986-87 from British Rail. In 1989, the remainder of the line between Bideford and Meeth was acquired in its entirety by Devon County Council for £1. Conversion of this section to a footpath was enabled by a £60,000 Derelict Land Grant from central government in 1989-90, plus a further £100,000 from Devon County Council and the Countryside Commission in 1990-91. A large proportion of the money was needed to adapt and repair bridges across the River Torridge. Parish councils, Dartmoor and Exmoor National Park Authorities and the National Trust played a part in the development of the rest of the Trail. Their consultation and co-operation ensured low environmental costs while retaining a large degree of accessibility to the Trail. Even the Otter Conservation Officer was involved to ensure there would be no disturbance to otters where the Trail followed water courses. The section between Barnstaple and Bideford was opened on 21 May 1991 and was made into a combined footpath and cyclepath. The section from Barnstaple to Meeth was named the Tarka Country Park. Once the southern circuit was also incorporated, the Trail spanned . It was opened by Prince Charles in May 1992. The Tarka Country Park identity was finally subsumed by the Tarka Trail in 1994. The route to Meeth was converted into a cycle/walkway in 1997. It was delayed by a quarry covering the line of the old railway.  Disused railways  Several sections of disused railway line have been used to create the trail. These have the benefit of being relatively flat, with only small uphill and downhill gradients. The paths also run across many former railway bridges, which command notable views over various rivers and valleys. A number of railway buildings have been restored on the route, in particular the station buildings at Bideford and Torrington and the signal box at Instow. Former railway sections include: * Ilfracombe Branch Line – between Braunton and Barnstaple * North Devon Railway (Torrington branch) – between Barnstaple, Bideford and Torrington * North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway - between Torrington and Meeth Halt Below Braunton, the path follows the western bank of the River Caen, which was straightened to become the Braunton Canal in the 1850s, before following the northern edge of Horsey Island, reclaimed from the estuary at the same time.Clare Manning, (2007), Braunton Marsh Management Scheme, Taw Torridge Estuary Forum The path then turns north along the eastern edge of Braunton Burrows, an extensive sand-dune system leased by the Ministry of Defence for army training.

He is known from his coins, often in the name of Azes II, and possibly from an inscription on the Mathura lion capital, although another satrap Kharaostes has been discovered in Mathura.Joe Cribb He was probably a successor of Azes II. Epigraphical evidence from inscribed reliquaries show for certain that he was already \\"Yabgu-King\\", when the Indravarman Silver Reliquary was dedicated, which is itself positioned with certainty before the 5-6 CE Bajaur casket.An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman, Richard Salomon, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 116, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1996), pp. 442 There is some dispute however about the exact meaning of Yabgu-King. For Richard Salomon, Yabgu means \\"tribal chief\\", in the manner of the Kushans, suggesting that Kharahostes was already fully king by the end of the 1st century BCE, supporting a 10 BCE- 10 CE date for his reign. For Joe Cribb, this is a misspelling by a careless scribe, and should be read \\"yuva-King\\" which means \\"Heir apparent\\", and therefore would push forward the years Kharahostes actually ruled to the first part of the 1st century CE.Joe Cribb, p.31 Coin finds suggest that Kharahostes ruled in the area of the Darunta district to the west of Jalalabad, probably based on the ancient city of Nagarahara, located to the west of Jalalabad. Son of Arta Kharahostes's own coins attest that he was the son of Arta, a brother of king Maues, and Satrap of Chukhsa.Taxila an illustrated account of archaeological excavations, CUP Archive According to F. W. Thomas and Hendrik Willem Obbink, his mother was Nada Diaka, who was the daughter of Ayasia Kamuia.F. W. Thomas, Epigraphia Indica, Vol IX, p 135, F. W. Thomas. However, according to Sten Konow, Ayasia Kamuia, the chief queen of Rajuvula, was the daughter of Kharahostes.Sten Konow, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, Part I, p 36 & xxxvi Dynastic mark of Kharahostes. Kharohostes' coinage bears a dynastic mark (a circle within three pellets), which is rather similar, although not identical, with the dynastic mark of the Kushan ruler Kujula Kadphises (three pellets joined together), which has led to suggestions that they may have been contemporary rulers. The Kharaosta of the Mathura lion capital inscriptions is usually identified with the Satrap Kharaostas or Kharahostes.Ahmad Hasan Dani et al., History of Civilizations of Central Asia, 1999, p 201, Unesco However, according to a recent study by Joe Cribb, the Kharaostes of Mathura should be considered as a different Indo-Scythian Northern Satrap, who ruled in Mathura with his own specific coinage and was probably a successor of Sodasa just before the conquest of Mathura by Kushan king Vima Takto. Kharaosta's known coins are of two types, presenting legends in Greek characters on the obverse and in Kharoshthi in the reverse: a round type in the name of Azes and three- pellet symbol, also recently attributed to his son Mujatria, and a square type without the three-pellet symbol in his own name, as son of Arta. The Greek and Kharoshthi legends in the square coins run thus: Some of his coins write \\"Ortas\\" in place of \\"Artas\\". Buddhist dedications Kharahostes is known for several Buddhist dedications. =Bimaran casket= Unworn coins of Kharahostes were found in the Bimaran casket, suggesting the dedication was made during his rule.\\"Dating and locating Mujatria and the two Kharahostes\\", by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27-28 Unworn coins of Kharahostes, or his son Mujatria, were found in the Bimaran casket, suggesting the dedication was made during his rule or that of his son, if not by them personally. =Indravarman's Silver Reliquary= Kharahostes is also known as one of the owners of the Indravarman's Silver Reliquary as described by the inscriptions in Kharoshthi on the reliquary.Inscription Nb II in Apracaraja Indravarman's Silver Reliquary He was probably the initial owner of the reliquary, which was then rededicated by Apraca ruler Indravarma. The Indravarman Silver Reliquary is dated with certainty before the Bajaur casket, meaning it must have been dedicated by Indravarman as a Prince in the end of the 1st century BCE, implying that Kharahostes, the previous owner of the Silver Reliquary (as shown by the inscriptions) was already king before that time (at the very least before 6 CE, date of the Bajaur casket).Richard Salomon, \\"An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 116, No. 3 (July - September 1996), pp. 418-452 A son: Mujatria According to Joe Cribb (2015), this coin type may belong to Kharaostes's son Mujatria. Some rare square coins, also displaying the three-pellet symbol, were struck in the name of Mujatria, who claims in the Kharoshthi legends of these coins that he is the \\"son of Kharahostes\\". A recent study (2015) by Joe Cribb suggests that the round debased silver coins with three-pellet symbols in the name of Azes, usually attributed to Kharahostes, should actually be attributed to Mujatria.Dating and Locating Mujatria and the two Kharaostes, Joe Cribb, 2015, p.43-44, type 11a See also *Parama-Kambojas *India and Central Asia References and notesExternal links *Mathura Lion Capital Inscriptions * The Early Kushan Kings: New Evidence for Chronology: Para (63) Category:Indo-Scythian kings Category:Indo-Scythian satraps Category:1st-century BC rulers in Asia Category:1st-century monarchs in Asia Category:1st-century BC Iranian people Category:1st-century Iranian people ","title":"Kharahostes"},{"id":"2500216","text":"Elaine Noble (born January 22, 1944) is an American politician and LGBT activist who served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives for two terms starting in January 1975.

Paul Shanley suggests he was part hero, part horror], The Boston Globe (2002), accessed 09 September 2018 In March 1977, she was part of the first delegation of gay men and lesbians invited to the White House under President Jimmy Carter to discuss issues important to the LGBT community. After two terms in the House of Representatives, Noble ran for the United States Senate in 1978. She was one of five Democrats who competed in the primary, finishing fifth with 52,464 votes (5.8%). She later went to work for Kevin White who was Boston mayor at the time. While working for White's office, Noble became involved in an FBI investigation in which she had to testify in front of a grand jury for nineteen hours. No charges were brought against Noble. In the 1990s she unsuccessfully ran for Cambridge, Massachusetts city council. In 1986 Noble and Ellen Ratner formed a LGBT alcohol and drug treatment center in Minneapolis called the Pride Institute. More recently she has worked as a healthcare administrator and a realtor. In 2009, she made a rare fundraising appearing at a Stonewall gala benefiting Palm Beach, Florida's LGBT center, Compass Community Center in Lake Worth, FL. Personal life Noble had a relationship with writer Rita Mae Brown in the 1970s and has since retained privacy regarding her personal life. She lives in Florida. Tributes In 2015, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.

History The first radio broadcast in Paris aimed at the general public took place on 24 December 1921. The next year, the French government allowed the establishment of the first private radio station in Paris: Radiola. After the Second World War, Parisian radio was nationalized, and it was not until 1981, following the election of François Mitterrand that private companies were able easily to broadcast in the Paris area. Mitterrand was attempting to permit the growth of radio stations through privatization and fewer regulations, following the Italian example (in 1977, the Italian government permitted the establishment of private stations, leading to a boom in the number of stations). In the early 1980s, there were more than 200 radio stations in Paris. These stations often overlapped, broadcast only sporadically and often low-quality content. This chaotic situation came to an end after the establishment of several regulatory agencies — first the Haute Autorité, then the CNCL, and finally the Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel which granted licences to operate on specific frequencies to certain companies. The first radio stations in Paris (chronological) * Radio Tour Eiffel (general interest; state radio) 24 December 1921-June 1940.

Radiola's first trials took place on 26 June 1922 and its first regular broadcasts began on 6 November 1922. Marcel Laporte provided the most- frequently-heard voice for the station. Its first news broadcasts took place on 6 January 1923. It became Radio Paris on 29 March 1924 (general interest ; private, then state-run on 17 December 1933) 29 March 1924–17 June 1940. It kept its name of Radio Paris from July 1940 until August 1944, but the station was then run by Nazis and French collaborators. * Radio PTT (general interest; state-run) 20 January 1923 until June 1940. * Poste Parisien (general interest; private) from 30 March 1924 to June 1940. * Radio LL (general interest; private) from March 1926 until 28 September 1935.

Schooner Fare performs primarily original maritime, socially conscious, and traditional folk music. They perform throughout Maine and North America, and their songs are played by radio stations and satellite radio worldwide. History Schooner Fare was formed in 1975. Chuck Romanoff, Steve Romanoff, and Tom Rowe were sitting around singing British folksinger, John Conolly's song, (\\"Fiddler's Green\\"), and enjoyed it to such an extent they began contemplating doing this for a living. Six months later, they had a Sunday booking in Portland for $150. They then got a steady job at a waterfront pub in Portland, Maine, The Holy Mackerel. Schooner Fare continued to play, primarily in New England and eventually expanded their audience to Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Calgary, Canada. The folk trio became regular performers at Alexandria, Virginia’s Birchmere. They became featured artists on Dick Cerri's \\"Music Americana\\" in Washington, D.C.. Schooner Fare was featured on CBS News' Sunday Morning with Charles Kuralt, CBS News Nightwatch with Charlie Rose, National Public Radio's Morning Edition and Weekend Edition with Scott Simon. They performed seven of their original songs with the Boston Pops Orchestra and have been described by New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts as \\"The premier performing group of original and traditional songs.\\" Schooner Fare emerged from their \\"parent\\" group, Devonsquare, co-founded by Steve in 1965 as a trio. Chuck joined Devonsquare in 1971 and Tom in 1975 as a six- piece group. In mid-1975, Steve, Chuck, and Tom left Devonsquare and later formed Schooner Fare. They performed weekly while holding other jobs. They were discovered by Tommy Makem, formerly of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, folk icons of the 1960s. Makem had partnered with Liam Clancy and the two recorded Steve's song, \\"Day of the Clipper.\\" Because the Makem and Clancy recording of \\"Clipper\\" established Schooner Fare as a de facto \\"Irish\\" band, this propelled them into larger venues, many of them famous Irish establishments in Boston (The Black Rose) and New York City (Tommy Makem's Irish Pavilion) and the Milwaukee Irish Fest. By 1981, Schooner Fare was a full-time performing ensemble performing throughout the U.S. mid-west and mid- Atlantic, and western and Atlantic Canada. Over the next several decades they recorded 15 albums, almost one-third being original songs. Schooner Fare has shared the stage and billings with most of the folk world's icons including Pete Seeger, Odetta, Tom Paxton, The Kingston Trio, Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow, Tom Rush, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The Limeliters, and The Highwaymen. Their original songs have been recorded by scores of other artists including Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy, Glenn Yarbrough, and The Fureys, A tape cassette of their songs traveled with astronaut Cpt. William F. Readdy aboard the NASA shuttle in 1992. Tom Rowe died in January 2004. Since then, the Romanoff brothers continue to perform as Schooner Fare, now as a duo.

Cowell (1785-1814). Cowell was launched 18 March 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Pedro, California, sponsored by Mrs. R. Hepburn; and commissioned 23 August 1943, Commander C. W. Parker in command.  Central Pacific campaigns  Sailing from San Pedro 28 October 1943, Cowell arrived at Pearl Harbor 2 November to join the Fast Carrier Task Force (then TF 58, later TF 38). From 10 November to 13 December she screened the carriers as they launched air attacks during the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, then sailed from Espiritu Santo for strikes on Kavieng, New Ireland at the turn of the year; and on Kwajalein, Ebeye, and Eniwetok Islands at the close of January. Returning to Majuro, she put to sea for the strike on Truk of 16 and 17 February 1944, then sailed to Pearl Harbor to replenish. Cowell returned to Majuro 22 March 1944 and rejoined TF 58 for the strikes on Palau, Yap and Ulithi of 30 March to 1 April; the invasion of Hollandia from 21 to 23 April; and the raids on Truk, Satawan and Ponape of 29 April to 1 May. After the air attacks on Marcus Island and Wake Island from 19 to 23 May, Cowell continued to screen the carriers during the Marianas operation. She sortied from her base at Majuro from 6 June to 14 July for strikes on Guam and Rota, raids to neutralize Japanese bases in the Bonins, and to give protective antiaircraft cover for the carriers in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. After an overhaul at Eniwetok, Cowell put to sea 29 August 1944 with Task Group 36.5 (TG 38.5) for air strikes on the western Carolines, the Philippines and the Palaus, and the Manila and Subic Bay area, as well as to support the landings on Morotai on 15 September. She arrived at Manus on 28 September to replenish, then sortied 2 October supporting air strikes on Okinawa, Luzon, and Formosa preparing for the Leyte assault. When and were torpedoed in heavy Japanese air attacks on 13 and 14 October, Cowell stood by to furnish light, power, and pumping facilities as the cripples slowly retired from the danger area. She rejoined her task force to sail for the far-flung Battle for Leyte Gulf, and aircraft from her carriers were in time to launch telling strikes against the retreating Japanese ships. Cowell returned to Ulithi 28 October for patrol and training duty until 26 December when she sailed for Seattle and an overhaul.  Battle of Okinawa  Returning to action, Cowell sailed from Saipan 27 March 1945 for the invasion of Okinawa. She covered the diversionary landings during the assault on 1 April, then took up the radar picket duty which was to bring her a Presidential Unit Citation (US). Until 20 June Cowell braved the hazards of the picket line to direct combat air patrol successfully and to shoot down her own share of Japanese aircraft with antiaircraft fire. On at least three occasions skillful maneuvering, accurate fire and courage saved Cowell from severe damage. On 4 May she shot down two planes within 50 feet of the ship, receiving a shower of gasoline and burning debris, then aided by firing on another kamikaze. On 13 May Cowell fired on several attacking planes, then brought firefighting and medical assistance to the stricken , screening her from further attack. In another attack on 25 May Cowell shot down a diving kamikaze which exploded in midair scattering shell fragments and its cockpit door on Cowell's deck and causing small fires. Relieved of picket duty 20 June, Cowell joined TG 32.15 to patrol off Okinawa in the East China Sea. On 22 July she sent rescue and fire-fighting parties to aid . Cowell sailed from Okinawa 20 September 1945 to support the occupation landings at Matsuyama. She cleared for home from Nagoya 31 October and arrived at San Diego 17 November, where Cowell was placed out of commission in reserve 22 July 1946.  1951 - 1960  Recommissioned 21 September 1951, Cowell was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, and sailed from San Diego 4 January 1952 to arrive at Norfolk, Virginia 19 January.

They follow the border with Klodzko Land in Poland for 25 miles (40 km). The mountains are mainly composed of crystalline rocks, consistent with the makeup of the northern rim of the highlands of Bohemia. The highest point in the range is Velká Deštná, at 1,115 m (3,658 ft).  Tourism  The entire region has maintained its original natural character over the centuries and so beech primeval forests, protected landscape areas or nature parks and reserves are interwoven with trails, right next to chateaux and town parks and groomed rural gardens. The gentle rolling hills interlaced with hiking trails, a dense network of cycle trails and routes leading along rivers are ideal for families with children, recreational tourists and seniors as well. Those who love excitement and sports will find plenty of adrenaline activities here. Romantics will find a corner for themselves not only in the higher parts of the mountains and dense forests but also at meandering rivers winding through valleys, during boat rides on ponds and dams or at old castle ruins. Princess Kačenka, the ruler of the Eagle Mountains, sometimes shows the way. Also, in winter, Rampušák helps out if there is an avalanche.

Their main devices are the Universal Nut Sheller (UNS) and the Rocker Water Pump. The first device they designed, the UNS, was a peanut sheller but farmers started using it for other crops. The UNS is now used for coffee, jatropha, neem, and shea in 35 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Since 2009, their research has been focused on designing a water pump. Universal Nut Sheller Their primary objective was to increase the cost effectiveness of peanut agriculture as a means of sustainable development in those countries, through the development of affordable appropriate technology. There are an estimated half billion people across the globe in over 100 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions and particularly in Africa, dependent upon peanuts as their primary source of protein. The major limiting factor for growing peanuts has always been the time- and labor-intensive process of hand-shelling peanuts, a job usually relegated to women and children. Overcoming this technical obstacle has been a goal of agricultural research for some years. When Dr. T. Williams, Senior Research Scientist at University of Georgia and an expert on all 15,000 cultivars of peanuts, was first approached by Jock Brandis, the project's engineer, he stated that an affordable peanut sheller is considered the \\"holy grail of sustainable development\\". The final design for the machine was completed in January 2005, and has come to be known as the Universal Nut Sheller. This relatively small, hand-powered device made from two pieces of concrete and a handful of metal pieces is able to shell at a rate of 50 kg of peanuts an hour. On average an individual woman or child can hand shell 1.5 kg of peanuts in a single hour. Furthermore, one set of fiberglass molds can reproduce an indefinite number of machines. Raw materials for the machine include only half a sack of concrete and a few metal parts, which cost less than $50 US per machine. Maintenance is nearly zero, and a machine's lifespan is estimated at twenty years. Other versions of the UNS have been designed: * A \\"electrical powered sheller\\" has been designed in 2008 after a request from an orphanage in Haiti and is also distributed in Guyana. * A \\"pedal powered sheller\\" was designed in 2009 to shell faster. It has been distributed in the Philippines, in Guyana and in Guatemala. Soap for Hope In keeping with their mission of changing the world for the “bottom billion” through production of self-sustainable technologies, the Full Belly Project and partners at Diversey introduced the soap press in 2013. Known as Soap for Hope, this project reuses a portion the millions of pounds of soap that are thrown away annually by local hotels and resorts. The soap press allows communities to produce and distribute recycled soap products to fend off disease, promote better health, and generate income for impoverished communities around the world. The Full Belly Project developed a “soap press in a box” micro-factory to ship abroad for assembly, granting entrepreneurial opportunity to those with less access to proper sanitation and resources. The soap press in now in 18 countries around the world providing over 41,000 people with soap. Distributing technology Presently the organization is collaborating with like-minded development organizations in an effort to target areas most in need of this sustainable technology. Since finishing the final design of the Universal Nut Sheller, The Full Belly Project has distributed machines in The Bahamas, Uganda, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Gambia, Zambia, the Philippines, Haiti, Guyana, India, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, Guatemala, Tajikistan, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. With a few manual adjustments the machine is also capable of shelling winged beans, neem seeds (from neem trees, also known as margosa), jatropha curcas, wet and dried coffee, and shea. All of these seeds/nuts are lucrative once they have been processed. Most cultivation of these crops occurs in developing countries. Machines like the Universal Nut Sheller add value to these crops and instantly improve the lives of those who use these labor-saving devices. Impact on women This technology is particularly empowering for women in that it relieves them of the burden of hand-shelling jatropha curcas, shea, coffee and peanuts. Women provide the majority of agricultural labor, and with the time saved by this machine, would have the opportunity to dedicate themselves to other obligations. Collection of firewood, a chore often left to children, can be greatly reduced by the simple processing of shelled peanut hulls into fuel briquette.

The album contains the single \\"Spoon\\", which charted in the Top 10 in Germany, largely because of its use as the theme of a German TV thriller mini-series called Das Messer (The Knife). The success of the single allowed Can to move to a better studio, in which they recorded Ege Bamyası. Ege Bamyası was remastered as a hybrid SACD in 2004, which includes a booklet with commentary on the album by former Melody Maker journalist David Stubbs, as well as previously unreleased photos of the band. The album has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists. Several artists have played cover versions of songs from Ege Bamyası. Remix versions of several tracks by various artists are included on the album Sacrilege. Production and release With the commercial success of their hit single \\"Spoon\\" (which reached #6 on the German charts and sold 300,000 copies), Can was able to hire a large ex-cinema in Weilerswist near Cologne, which they used as a part-working, part-living space, and which they named \\"Inner Space\\". However, things nearly didn't work out as guitarist Michael Karoli recalled that the sessions were \\"frustrated by keyboardist Irmin Schmidt and vocalist Damo Suzuki's playing chess obsessively day in, day out\\" and that \\"completing recording became a frantic process, with some tracks having to be recorded practically in real time and the single 'Spoon' added to make up for a shortfall in material.\\" Ege Bamyası was recorded by Czukay at Weilerswist and originally released in 1972 by United Artists. In September 2004, the album, along with the majority of Can's discography, was remastered and released as a hybrid SACD. The re-release includes a booklet with commentary on the album by David Stubbs, as well as previously unreleased photos of the band. The success of the song \\"Spoon\\" and sales from this album inspired Can to throw a free concert in an attempt to reach a wider audience. The Can Free Concert was filmed by Martin Schäfer, Robbie Müller and Egon Mann for director Peter Przygodda at the Cologne Sporthalle on 3 February 1972 and is included on the Can DVD.  Reception and influence  Ege Bamyası has received considerable critical acclaim since its release. Pitchfork Media featured the record at #19 on its \\"Top 100 Albums of the 1970s\\". British music weekly Melody Maker wrote: \\"Can are without doubt the most talented and most consistent experimental rock band in Europe, England included.\\" PopMatters characterized the album as \\"every bit as compact and tetchy as its predecessor was epic and spacey,\\" calling it \\"a masterful piece of psychedelic rock fused with tightly wound funk.\\" Various artists have cited Ege Bamyası as an influence. Stephen Malkmus of Pavement has been quoted as saying \\"I played Can's Ege Bamyası album every night before I went to sleep for about three years.\\" Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth recalls, \\"I found Ege Bamyası in the 49-cent bin at Woolworth's. I didn't see anything written about Can, I didn't know anything about them except this okra can on the cover, which seemed completely bizarre. I finally picked that record up, and I completely wore it out. It was so alluring. Something about it made Can seem to be playing outside of rock 'n' roll. It was unlike anything else I was hearing at the time.\\" Geoff Barrow of Portishead picked Ege Bamyası as one of their favourite 13 albums on The Quietus' Bakers Dozen series. The band Spoon takes its name from the eponymous track on this album, and cites the band as a major influence.Warren, Tamara. \\"Waxing Poetic\\", Anthem, Fall/Winter 2005, p. 54. There have been cover versions of songs from Ege Bamyası by various artists. \\"I'm So Green\\" was covered by Beck and was submitted for a planned Can tribute album produced by the Dust Brothers. Kanye West sampled \\"Sing Swan Song\\" for his song \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" on the album Graduation, and derives many of the song's lyrics from Damo Suzuki's vocals. Remix versions of several Ege Bamyası songs are included on the album Sacrilege. Minneapolis-based hip hop artist I Self Devine sampled from \\"Vitamin C\\" for the song \\"Overthrow\\" on his 2005 release Self Destruction.

Publication history Conduit first appeared in Superman: The Man of Steel #0 and was created by Dan Jurgens and Louise Simonson. In the 1995 story arc \\"Death of Clark Kent\\" spanning four Superman titles, Conduit tried to murder everyone important to Kent. Fictional character biography On the night Kenny's mother gave birth to him, a powerful snowstorm made the roads icy and slick. On the way to the hospital, the car Mr. Braverman was driving skidded on ice. Moments later, Kenny was born in the car, and infant Kal-El's starship passed over the Braverman's car. Kenny suffered a high level of radiation poisoning due to Kryptonite exposure from the Kryptonian ship, and during his childhood, his health failed from time to time, but he always managed to recover. Kenny even became a remarkable athlete at Smallville High School. However, he always came in second place to Clark Kent.Superman: The Man of Steel #0 In order to learn how to manage the changes his body went through, Kenny volunteered to be thoroughly examined by the CIA.Superman: The Man of Steel #38 Afterward, they recruited him to do a covert operation in France, but Clark ultimately thwarted Kenny's efforts. Thus, Kenny grew to despise Clark.Superman: The Man of Steel #39 Once he developed inherent superpowers due to the events of his birth, Kenny focused them through a special high-tech suit. He also wears metal gauntlets on each arm that can emit beams of Kryptonite radiation. Kenny then tried to kill Clark and Lois Lane. While he failed to kill them, he ended up dueling Superman.Superman: The Man of Steel #40 When Conduit discovered Superman was secretly Clark, he began to stalk Clark, sending Clark notes saying \\"I KNOW\\" and planting bombs intended to kill Clark's friends and co-workers. Kenny concluded that when they had competed as children, Clark had possessed all of the powers he possesses as Superman, and thus had cheated, refusing to believe Clark's insistence that his powers only fully developed when he was an adult. Seeing no other option, Superman attempted to forsake his identity as Clark Kent and go into hiding, but Kenny eventually tracked him down and knocked him unconscious.Superman: The Man of Steel #41 Kenny then proceeded to place Clark in a fake Smallville set twenty years in the past, filled with android versions of its citizens programmed to hate Superman and regard Kenny as a hero.Superman: The Man of Steel #42 Several of them attacked Superman, including imitations of Clark's parents, Jonathan and Martha. Conduit also added an android of Lois to the mix, although this one was the same age as the real Lois due to her not being part of the childhood Kenny was trying to duplicate. While Superman dealt with that, Conduit waited for him at a duplication of the Smallville High School football stadium, where the two agreed to fight one-on-one without their powers, making it \\"just Clark and Kenny.\\"Superman: The Man of Steel #43 However, Kenny eventually resorted to using his powers and the hand-to-hand combat escalated to an all-out brawl that heavily damaged the stadium. In a desperate attempt to defeat Clark, Kenny channeled electrical energy that was powering an audience of robots, all of which were built in the image of Kenny's father, into himself. As a result, Kenny overloaded and died, his last words being to say that this is all Clark's fault. Saddened by Kenny's death, Superman returned Kenny's body to his father. He also criticized the man for only focusing on Kenny's losses, rather than congratulating Kenny for his successes in life.Superman: The Man of Steel #46 Conduit has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. Powers and abilities Conduit wears body armor that provides some protection from energy and physical attacks. His body armor allows him to fly. He has two extendable cables with which he can ensnare an opponent. Conduit is able to fire blasts of Kryptonite radiation, and also learned how to channel this energy into his body to enhance his strength to a point where he could physically compete with Superman. In other media Kenny Braverman appears in the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"New Kids in Town\\" voiced by Scott Menville. He is depicted as a bully at Smallville High at the time when the Legion of Superheroes travel back to Clark Kent's high school days to prevent Brainiac from killing him as a teenager.http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/superman/reviews/newkids/ Ken Braverman is played by actor Rowen Kahn in the film Man of Steel. He is depicted as a high school-age athlete and a bully to Clark Kent (portrayed by young actor Dylan Sprayberry). After school, he and his gang somehow find Clark waiting for his father Jonathan Kent in the truck, which Ken forces him out of before shoving him to the ground. He taunts and tries to goad the quiet young boy until Pete Ross alerts Jonathan who is watching sternly from a distance and begins to advance the group.

However, other storylines, such as a storyline about a kidney transplant involving the Ferrieras, were not well received, and although Den Watts' return proved to be a ratings success, the British press branded the plot unrealistic and felt that it questioned the show's credibility.\\"'Dirty' Dirty Tactics; EastEnders defied belief by raising Den Watts\\", Sunday Herald via findarticles.com; accessed 26 September 2006. A severe press backlash followed after Den's actor, Leslie Grantham, was outed in an internet sex scandal, which coincided with a swift decline in viewer ratings. On 21 September 2004, Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders following continued criticism of the show. The same day the programme received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of its rival soap, Emmerdale, against it. Emmerdale was watched by 8.1 million people. Her immediate superior, Mal Young (at the time BBC Controller of Continuing Drama Series), said Berridge \\"will now be involved in a major new drama project.\\" Writing career Berridge writes full-time as A.L. Berridge. Honour and the Sword was her first novel, reflecting a lifelong passion for history. The first of 'Chevalier' series following the fictional life and adventures of André de Roland in seventeenth century France, it was published by Penguin Books in April 2010. Honour and the Sword became an instant Sunday Times bestseller. A sequel, In the Name of the King, was published August 2011. Her latest novel, Into the Valley of Death, begins a second series featuring Victorian military hero Harry Ryder. It is set in the Crimean War, and follows Ryder through the battles of Alma and Inkerman as well as the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava.

Set against the backdrop of the Indian Emergency, the movie tells the story of three young people in the 1970s, when India was undergoing massive social and political changes. The title is taken from a poem by Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib. It went to 12 film festivals in 6 months including Turkey, Estonia, River to River (Florence), Berlin, Edinburgh, Washington, Goa, Bite The Mango (Bradford), Commonwealth (Manchester), India (Los Angeles), Dallas, and Pacific Rim (California).  Plot  The film opens at Hindu College, Delhi with the story of three students, Siddharth Tyabji (Kay Kay Menon), Geeta Rao (Chitrangada Singh) and Vikram Malhotra (Shiney Ahuja). Siddharth is a driven revolutionary who dreams of bringing a revolution in the state of Bihar that will end the caste-based discrimination there, bring social justice, and improve society. Geeta is a London-returned, South Indian in love with the firebrand Siddharth. She has led a very sheltered life and is yet to explore the terrain of the Indian socio-political landscape. While she finds Siddharth's Naxalite rhetoric attractive, she is not sure if she can whole- heartedly subscribe to it. Every time they come to a choice, Siddharth chooses his ideology over his love for her thus breaking her heart time and again. Vikram is a middle-class boy who dreams of making it big, whatever the cost. He is particularly afflicted by his father's Gandhian ideas, but irritated and frustrated at the same time, seeing his father's way of life as ineffective in bringing about change. Siddharth leaves for Bihar to bring about a revolution; Geeta leaves for Oxford to get a degree; and Vikram sets up an office in Delhi. A few years later, Vikram is a fixer in the power corridors of government, Geeta is married to promising IAS Officer Arun Mehta (Ram Kapoor) who, as Geeta says \\"has it all\\", and Siddharth is still trying to foment a revolution. But all is not as it seems. Below the mask of happiness, each is quite unhappy. Vikram has 'made it' but he cannot get Geeta, the love of his life. Geeta is married, but she meets Siddharth on the sly, cheating on her husband. Geeta gets a divorce from her husband because of her love for Siddharth, even though she does not want to hurt her husband's feelings. Geeta joins Siddharth in the village and starts to teach the children, whilst the police repeatedly try to hunt down her now husband, Siddharth. She bears a child with Siddharth whom she sends to her parents in London since she believes he deserves more than to grow up in the remote village. Eventually the police round up the entire village, capturing Siddharth and Geeta for intent to cause unrest and brutally assaulting them – fabricating a story of a villagers' riot to explain their injuries. Geeta is bailed out of prison by her now influential ex-husband. Siddharth, on the run, is shot by the police, admitted to a local hospital, and placed under arrest while Geeta believes him to have been killed. Vikram, who has been consoling Geeta and taking care of her during the absences of her ex-husband and of Siddharth, is informed that Siddharth is alive. Vikram travels to meet Siddharth and release him using his influential contacts. However, he has an accident on the way and is admitted to the same hospital as Siddharth. During the night, local Naxalites break into the crude hospital and free Siddharth while Vikram lays there. The next morning, the policemen in charge of guarding Siddharth, frustrated, accuse Vikram of having conspiring to free Siddharth and beat him up. After discovering that he is a man of influence, they resolve to kill him and dump his body to make it unrecognisable. Vikram, terrified and injured, attempts to escape but is chased down. The policeman finds that the Naxalites have emptied his revolver and they beat Vikram with an iron rod. Soon, the police chief and a local politician come looking for Vikram and are able to stop the police from killing him. Vikram suffers heavy brain damage and is rendered handicapped, while Siddharth tells Geeta that he intends to leave. Geeta refuses to accompany him. Siddharth has moved beyond simply trying to foment a revolution. He is prepared to delay it because he feels that the people are not ready in spite of their saying otherwise. He goes to London to study medicine and, through a letter, voices his anguish and disillusion with the idea of revolution, writing \\"I hope the mysteries of the human body will be less confusing\\" (in reference to his studying medicine and quitting the revolution). The last scenes shows Geeta working in the village and taking care of the handicapped Vikram, who can no longer speak. The movie ends with Vikram writing \\"I love you Geeta\\" on a rock, as they sit by a placid lake and watch the sunset.

She was the second wife and widow of longtime U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was twenty-two years her senior. Early life and education The second of six children, Victoria Anne Reggie was born in Crowley in Acadia Parish in southwestern Louisiana. Her father, Edmund Reggie, was a Louisiana judge and banker; her mother, the former Doris Ann Boustany, was a Democratic National Committeewoman. Reggie is of Lebanese descent, as all of her grandparents were Maronites from Lebanon, who immigrated to the United States and later settled to Louisiana. Reggie's grandparents became important members of the local Roman Catholic church, and later their children became involved in business and politics. Reggie's immediate family was wealthy because of money from her maternal family's interest in the Bunny Bread baking concern in New Orleans. She was raised in a family that was constantly involved in politics and campaigns. At the 1956 Democratic National Convention, her father helped deliver his state for John F. Kennedy's unsuccessful bid for the vice- presidential nomination. Over time, John Kennedy developed a close social relationship with the Reggies. Her mother cast the only Louisiana delegate vote for Ted Kennedy at the 1980 Democratic National Convention,Adam Clymer (1999). Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography. William Morrow. pp. 492–493. . Victoria Reggie attended parochial schools growing up and was a straight-A student. She attended Newcomb College at Tulane University in New Orleans, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English, magna cum laude, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was president of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She then received her Juris Doctor degree, summa cum laude in 1979 from Tulane University Law School. There she was a member of Tulane Law Review. Her education at Tulane, along with twenty years of other Tulane tuition for her brothers and sisters, was paid for by scholarships awarded by a political ally of her father.  Early career and first marriage  After law school, Reggie clerked for Judge Robert Arthur Sprecher at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. As an attorney, she specialized in bank law. She met her first husband, Grier C. Raclin, a telecommunications attorney (who later became a senior executive at Charter Communications in St. Louis, Missouri),Staff writer (Undated). \\"Corporate Governance — Biography; Grier C. Raclin — Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer\\". Charter Communications. Accessed 2009-09-01. when they clerked together at the Everett McKinley Dirksen Federal Courthouse. Their 1981 church wedding was in Crowley and \\"feted four hundred guests with a week's worth of parties.\\" Following marriage, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., where she practiced banking and savings and loan law and restructuring and bankruptcy law for Keck, Mahin & Cate. She was made partner there, and was known to be \\"charismatic and hard- driving\\" and a tough negotiator in settlement talks and \\"as a real star\\" for her ability to work on complicated financial transactions. Reggie and Raclin had two children, Curran (born 1982) and Caroline (born 1985). They were divorced in 1990.Blumenfeld, Laura.

Upon her divorce, she was left to juggle her career as a lawyer with her role as a single mother of two young children. Marriage to Ted Kennedy While the Kennedy and Reggie families were friends for many years, Vicki remembers (but Senator Kennedy did not) their first meeting, when Vicki was a summer intern in his Senate office's mailroom, the year following her college graduation. They began dating after meeting again in June 1991Trueheart, Charles (1992-03-15, page A.05). \\"Kennedy Announces Plans to Wed Washington Lawyer.\\" The Washington Post. at a party celebrating her parents' 40th wedding anniversary. Ted Kennedy said of this meeting, \\"I had known Vicki before, but this was the first time I think I really saw her.\\" The relationship became serious in September 1991. They were engaged in March 1992, and married July 3, 1992, in a civil ceremony at his home in McLean, Virginia. His political career had suffered from a long period of womanizing, drinking, and adverse publicity, and she is credited with stabilizing his personal life and helping him resume a productive career in the Senate. Kennedy was devoted to her two children. In Ted Kennedy's 1994 senatorial re- election campaign against Moderate Republican Mitt Romney, she was credited by The New York Times with \\"giving him a political advantage in a difficult contest.\\" For a Boston, Massachusetts, reception she organized, 1,200 influential New England women met five of Kennedy's Senate colleagues. Victoria became Kennedy's principal assistant and closest political advisor. By 1997, she no longer practiced law. She came to the aid of the greater Kennedy family following the 1999 death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Kennedy in 2002 Gun advocacy Victoria is president and co-founder of Common Sense about Kids and Guns, an advocacy group begun in 1999 which seeks to reduce gun deaths and injuries to children in the U.S. She is a member of the board of trustees of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and has served on the board of Stop Handgun Violence in Boston. She is a board member of Catholic Democrats and authored the preface for their 2009 book, The Catholic Case for Obama. She was named a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on December 4, 2009.  Illness and death of Ted Kennedy Following Ted Kennedy's May 2008 diagnosis of brain cancer, Victoria became her husband's primary caregiver and dealt with the Kennedy clan along with Ted's political connections. She assisted with the planning of his course of treatment. Senator Kennedy died on August 25, 2009. Throughout four days of his lying in state, a funeral service and quiet burial, his widow maintained a public face of composure, dignity, and gratitude to staffers and citizens who lined the streets and waited at the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects. Recent activities Reports indicated that the Senator expressed the wish that his wife would succeed him in office, and speculation towards that possibility continued during his illness. Upon his death, some thought that she would be appointed by Governor Deval Patrick to take the Senator's seat until the special election could take place, but she declinedParnes, Amie (2009-08-29). \\"Next Step Not Clear for Vicki Kennedy\\".

Some Democratic officials hoped she would agree to run for Senate to finish out her husband's term, but she declined again and instead endorsed Martha Coakley for the special election to fill the vacant seat. Coakley was defeated by Scott Brown. A year later, speculation continued as some noted Democrats saw her as their best chance to take back Senator Kennedy's former seat from Brown and the Republicans in the 2012 election; however, she again declined, and the Democratic nomination was awarded to Elizabeth Warren, who went on to defeat Brown in November 2012. Since the Senator's death, Kennedy has spoken at graduation ceremonies and received honorary degrees from the University of Massachusetts at Boston, Lesley University, and the University of Maryland at College Park, Maryland, in the spring of 2010. She also surprised the 95 members of the graduating class of Harwich High School on Cape Cod by accepting their invitation to speak at their June 2010 graduation. Kennedy was invited to speak at the spring commencement of the Catholic Anna Maria College in Paxton, Massachusetts, but at the request of Bishop Robert McManus of the Diocese of Worcester, Kennedy was disinvited by the college. The bishop and other Catholic organizations had expressed reservations about a stalwart pro- choice advocate like Kennedy speaking at a Catholic university. On May 3, 2013, she received the \\"Woman of the 21st Century\\" award at the 2013 Annual Luncheon of the Women's Guild of Cedars-Sinai, presented by actress Morgan Fairchild.2013 Annual Luncheon—Honoring Victoria Reggie KennedyJoan Mangum, in the Beverly Hills Courier, August 30, 2013, Volume XXXXVIII, No. 34, p. 16 In February 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama nominated her to serve as a Governor of the United States Postal Service (a member of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service), for a term expiring December 8, 2016.

It is named after Victor von Richter, who discovered this reaction in year 1871. It is the reaction of aromatic nitro compounds with potassium cyanide in aqueous ethanol to give the product of cine substitution (ring substitution resulting in the entering group positioned adjacent to the previous location of the leaving group) by a carboxyl group. Although it is not generally synthetically useful due to the low chemical yield and formation of numerous side products, its mechanism was of considerable interest, eluding chemists for almost 100 years before the currently accepted one was proposed. General Reaction Scheme The reaction below shows the classic example of the conversion of p-bromonitrobenzene into m-bromobenzoic acid. Übersichtsreaktion der Von-Richter-Reaktion The reaction is a type of nucleophilic aromatic substitution.M. Smith, M.B. Smith, J. March: March's advanced organic chemistry: reactions, mechanisms, and structure, 6th edition, Wiley 2007, . Besides the bromo derivative, chlorine- and iodine-substituted nitroarenes, as well as more highly substituted derivatives, could also be used as substrates of this reaction. However, yields are generally poor to moderate, with reported percentage yields ranging from 1% to 50%. Reaction Mechanism Several reasonable mechanisms were proposed and refuted by mechanistic data before the currently accepted one, shown below, was proposed in 1960 by Rosenblum on the basis of 15N labeling experiments.400x400pxFirst, the cyanide attacks the carbon ortho to the nitro group. This is followed by ring closing via nucleophilic attack on the cyano group, after which the imidate intermediate is rearomatized. Ring opening via nitrogen–oxygen bond cleavage gives an ortho-nitroso benzamide, which recyclizes to give a compound containing a nitrogen–nitrogen bond. Elimination of water gives a cyclic azoketone, which undergoes nucleophilic attack by hydroxide to give a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate collapses with elimination of the azo group to yield an aryldiazene with an ortho carboxylate group, which extrudes nitrogen gas to afford the anionic form of the observed benzoic acid product, presumably through the generation and immediate protonation of an aryl anion intermediate. The product is isolated upon acidic workup. Subsequent mechanistic studies have shown that the subjection of independently prepared ortho-nitroso benzamide and azoketone intermediates to von Richter reaction conditions afforded the expected product, lending further support to this proposal.

The band's longest-lasting lineup has consisted of Larry Stewart (lead vocals), John Dittrich (drums, vocals), Paul Gregg (bass guitar, vocals), Dave Innis (piano, keyboards, guitar, vocals), and Greg Jennings (lead guitar, mandolin, vocals). Record producer Tim DuBois assembled the band to record demos and chose Verlon Thompson as the original lead singer, but he was replaced by Stewart in this role before the band had recorded any material. Between 1984 and 1998, Restless Heart recorded for RCA Records Nashville, releasing the albums Restless Heart, Wheels, Big Dreams in a Small Town, Fast Movin' Train, Big Iron Horses, and Matters of the Heart. Stewart left for a solo career before Big Iron Horses, which resulted in Dittrich, Innis, and Gregg alternating as lead vocalists; Innis also departed before Matters of the Heart, and the band ultimately went on hiatus from 1994 to 1998. During this time, Jennings became a member of Vince Gill's road band, and Dittrich recorded one album in The Buffalo Club. Outside a brief reunion for new tracks on a Greatest Hits album in 1998, the band remained inactive until 2002, when Dittrich, Gregg, Innis, Jennings, and Stewart resumed touring. Two years later, they issued Still Restless on Audium Entertainment. Overall, Restless Heart has released seven studio albums, two greatest-hits albums, and a live album which is only available on their website. Their second through fifth albums are all certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and 26 of their singles have entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including six that reached number one. Four of their country releases also crossed over to the Adult Contemporary chart, with two of those (\\"I'll Still Be Loving You\\" in 1986 and \\"When She Cries\\" in 1992) also reaching top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band also had a number one on Adult Contemporary in 1993 with \\"Tell Me What You Dream\\", a collaboration with smooth jazz saxophonist Warren Hill. History Larry Stewart, seen here in 2003, has been the lead singer of Restless Heart for the majority of the band's career. =Formation and early years= Nashville record producer Tim DuBois created the band in 1984 to record demos of songs that he had written. The members he chose were drummer John Dittrich (born April 7, 1951), bass guitarist Paul Gregg (born December 3, 1954), keyboardist Dave Innis (born April 9, 1959), lead guitarist Greg Jennings (born October 2, 1954), and lead singer Verlon Thompson (born January 5, 1954). Thompson left before the band had officially been named or released a single, because he did not feel comfortable with the country pop style that DuBois wanted the band to pursue. Replacing him on lead vocals was Larry Stewart (born March 2, 1959), who was also working as a demo vocalist at the time, and was a college friend of Innis's. After leaving the group, Thompson recorded both by himself and in collaboration with Guy Clark, in addition to writing several country hit singles in the 1990s. One of the demos that the band recorded was for \\"Love in the First Degree\\", later a hit for Alabama. Due to the success of the demos, the members chose to become an official band, and they were signed to RCA Records Nashville in 1984. =1984-1986: Restless Heart= After assuming the name Restless Heart, the band released its self-titled debut album on RCA in 1984. It charted four singles on Billboard Hot Country Songs: \\"Let the Heartache Ride\\", \\"I Want Everyone to Cry\\", \\"(Back to the) Heartbreak Kid\\" (previously recorded by Kathy Mattea on her self-titled debut album), and \\"Til I Loved You.\\" DuBois co-wrote \\"Let the Heartache Ride\\" and \\"Heartbreak Kid\\" with Van Stephenson, who would later become one-third of the country pop trio Blackhawk in the 1990s. After the success of \\"I Want Everyone to Cry\\", the band's first top-ten hit, DuBois and RCA promoted the band through radio showcases and music video rotation, including the video for \\"Heartbreak Kid\\", which aired on VH-1. DuBois felt that touring was not a financial necessity for the band at the time, due to all five members also being session musicians, and having songwriting contracts with Warner Music Group at the time. While under such a contract, Innis co-wrote \\"Dare Me\\", a hit single for The Pointer Sisters. =1986-1988: Wheels= Two years later came Wheels which produced four consecutive No. 1 hits on the country music charts: \\"That Rock Won't Roll\\", \\"I'll Still Be Loving You\\", \\"Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)\\", and the title track, written by Dave Loggins. \\"I'll Still Be Loving You\\" and \\"Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)\\" were both hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, as was \\"New York (Hold Her Tight)\\", which was released only to that format. Furthermore, \\"I'll Still Be Loving You\\" entered the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, which was particularly noteworthy during a time where country music's presence on the pop charts was waning considerably. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies. Another track from the album, \\"Hummingbird\\", was later recorded by Ricky Skaggs on his 1989 album Kentucky Thunder, and was a top 20 country hit for him in 1990.Whitburn, p. 307 Tom Roland of Allmusic wrote that \\"[t]he guys found their niche with this project. Big, overpowering sound, heavy backbeats, and very tight harmonies are here.\\" =1988-1989: Big Dreams in a Small Town= The band's third album, Big Dreams in a Small Town, came in 1988. From it came two more number ones: \\"The Bluest Eyes in Texas\\" and \\"A Tender Lie\\", as well as top-five hits in its title track and \\"Say What's in Your Heart\\". The latter of these was also a number one on the RPM country charts in Canada. This album was also the first to feature members other than Stewart on lead vocals: Gregg sang \\"El Dorado\\" and shared lead vocals with Stewart on \\"Carved in Stone\\", while Dittrich sang \\"Calm Before the Storm\\". The band members wrote some of the songs themselves, while others were co-written by outside writers, including \\"A Tender Lie\\", written by Randy Sharp. People gave the album a positive review, noting the band's musicianship and prominent vocal harmony, as well as the \\"considerable amount of passion\\" in their music relative to their contemporaries. =1990-1991: Fast Movin' Train= Restless Heart's fourth album, Fast Movin' Train, was released in 1990. Its title track (also written by Loggins) and \\"Dancy's Dream\\" were top-five hits, while \\"When Somebody Loves You\\" and \\"Long Lost Friend\\" were less successful. Robert K. Oermann of The Tennessean found this album superior to the ones before it, praising the \\"direct approach\\" of the singles' lyrics, while also noting a roots rock influence in the increased use of acoustic instruments over the preceding albums. Stewart also sang backing vocals on \\"They Just Don't Make 'em Like You Anymore\\", a track from Kenny Rogers' 1991 album Back Home Again. =1991-1992: The Best of Restless Heart and Larry Stewart's departure= A greatest hits package, The Best of Restless Heart, followed in 1991. It included two new recordings, both of which were released as singles: \\"You Can Depend on Me\\" at No. 3 and \\"Familiar Pain\\" at number 40. Larry Stewart left the band in 1992 to pursue a solo career, also on RCA. His solo debut single \\"Alright Already\\" reached No. 5 on the country music charts in 1993. He recorded one album for RCA and two for Columbia Records between then and 1997, and while these albums accounted for seven more charted singles, none were as successful.Whitburn, p. 323 =1992-1993: Big Iron Horses= Dittrich, Gregg, and Innis alternated as lead vocalists on the band's fifth studio release, 1992's Big Iron Horses. This album produced the band's biggest crossover hit in \\"When She Cries\\", which went to number 9 on the country charts, number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 (their highest entry on that chart), and number two on the Adult Contemporary charts. After it came \\"We Got the Love\\" (guest musician on banjo was original Eagles member Bernie Leadon) and \\"Mending Fences\\", which both fell short of the country top 10 and its title track, \\"Big Iron Horses\\", was far less successful, peaking at number 72. Keyboardist Dave Innis also left the band in 1993, reducing the band to a trio. That same year, the band reached the top of the Adult Contemporary charts as guest vocalists on jazz saxophonist Warren Hill's debut single \\"Tell Me What You Dream.\\" =1994–2015: Disbanding and reunion= The next album, 1994's Matters of the Heart, included only Gregg, Jennings and Dittrich, with studio musicians rounding out the roster. Its only single, \\"Baby Needs New Shoes\\", fell short of the top 40, and the remaining three members disbanded at the end of 1994. Jennings joined Vince Gill's band, while Dittrich founded a band called The Buffalo Club in 1997 with Charlie Kelly and lead singer Ron Hemby, formerly of The Imperials. The Buffalo Club recorded one album for Rising Tide Records and charted three singles, including the top-10 country hit \\"If She Don't Love You\\" (a song which had previously been turned down by Restless Heart), before the band split at the end of the year. The original Restless Heart members, except Innis, reunited to record three new tracks for their second greatest-hits compilation in 1998, Greatest Hits. This album produced their first top-40 country hit in five years, \\"No End to This Road\\". After a year-long tour with Vince Gill and another year of dates on their own, Restless Heart went on hiatus once more. In 2002, Gregg placed a phone call to Innis, with whom he had not had any contact in 10 years. That led to Restless Heart reuniting once again and returning the band to its complete classic lineup. They soon began touring and released a single called \\"Torch of Freedom\\" which did not chart. In 2004, the band signed to Koch Records, then went into a Muscle Shoals, Alabama, recording studio to record the first full- length album to feature the original lineup since 1990's Fast Movin' Train. The new album, entitled Still Restless, was co-produced by Mac McAnally and Kyle Lehning, with three of its songs having previously been recorded by McAnally himself. Its lead-off single, \\"Feel My Way to You\\", peaked at number 29 on the country music charts. However, Koch closed its Nashville division in early 2005, and the album did not produce any other singles. The band released a live album, 25 and Live, in 2007 through their website. To commemorate the band's 30th anniversary, Restless Heart began its 30 Years & Still Restless Tour. The band also announced plans to release new music in 2013, but no further details have been revealed. In 2015, Restless Heart was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. The band's Dave Innis, Paul Gregg, and Greg Jennings hail from the state. Musical stylings DuBois said that he conceived Restless Heart as \\"a hot, instrumental band that could really play well on stage—that had great harmony\\" and that he had given them songs that he felt were \\"natural\\" but had been rejected by other artists such as Alabama for being \\"too pop\\". He noted that during showcases for radio representatives early in the band's career, he was often questioned on the band's ability to \\"duplicate their records live\\" due to them having been assembled in a studio setting, but felt that live performances were not an issue due to the band having played and sung everything on their debut album without any additional musicians or vocalists. Restless Heart's sound draws influences from mainstream country music, as well as from pop and rock. Their use of layered harmonies and multiple Adult Contemporary crossover hits have drawn comparisons to the Eagles. A 1985 article in Billboard wrote that debut single \\"Let the Heartache Ride\\" \\"introduced the band's razor-edged vocal harmonies and scorching instrumentals.\\"  Band members  { class=\\"toccolours\\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\\"float: lleft; width: 475px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\\" - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1984  *Verlon Thompson – lead vocals, rhythm guitar *John Dittrich – drums, background vocals *Paul Gregg – bass guitar, background vocals *Dave Innis – piano, keyboards, background vocals *Greg Jennings \\\\- lead guitar, background vocals - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1984–1992  *Larry Stewart – lead vocals, rhythm guitar *John Dittrich – drums, background vocals *Paul Gregg – bass guitar, background vocals *Dave Innis – piano, keyboards, rhythm guitar, background vocals *Greg Jennings \\\\- lead guitar, background vocals - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1992–1993  *John Dittrich – drums, lead and background vocals *Paul Gregg – bass guitar, lead and background vocals *Dave Innis – piano, keyboards, rhythm guitar, lead and background vocals *Greg Jennings \\\\- lead guitar, background vocals - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1993–1994  *John Dittrich – drums, lead and background vocals *Paul Gregg – bass guitar, lead and background vocals *Greg Jennings \\\\- lead guitar, background vocals - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1995–1997  *Disbanded - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1998  *John Dittrich – drums, background vocals *Paul Gregg – bass guitar, background vocals *Greg Jennings \\\\- lead guitar, background vocals *Larry Stewart -lead vocals, rhythm guitar - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  1999–2002  *Disbanded - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  2002–present  *Larry Stewart – lead vocals, rhythm guitar *John Dittrich – drums, lead and background vocals *Paul Gregg – bass guitar, lead and background vocals *Dave Innis – piano, keyboards, background vocals *Greg Jennings \\\\- lead guitar, background vocals }  Discography  ;Albums *Restless Heart (1985) *Wheels (1986) *Big Dreams in a Small Town (1988) *Fast Movin' Train (1990) *The Best of Restless Heart (1991) *Big Iron Horses (1992) *Matters of the Heart (1994) *Greatest Hits (1998) *Still Restless (2004) References External links  * Category:American country music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:RCA Records Nashville artists Category:Musical groups from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Musical quintets Category:Entertainment One Music artists Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2002 ","title":"Restless Heart"},{"id":"2500439","text":"The Cocheco at Hanson Pines, Rochester, New Hampshire, 2016 The Cochecho River or Cocheco River is a tributary of the Piscataqua River, 38.3 miles (61.6 km) long,New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. It rises in northern Strafford County and runs southeastward, through the town of Farmington and the cities of Rochester and Dover, where it provides hydroelectric power.

A branch campus, PVCC at Black Mountain, opened in August 2009 in the far northern section of Scottsdale, Arizona to serve this rapidly growing area. It provides greater access for the communities of Cave Creek and Carefree. The college mascot is the puma and the colors are royal blue and white.  History  PVCC was founded by the Maricopa County Community College District as the Northeast Valley Education Center in 1985 with classes temporarily held at Paradise Valley High School. The district gave the college its present name and began campus construction in 1986 and inaugurated the permanent site during 1987. The college had operated as an extension of Scottsdale Community College and gained independent accreditation in 1990. Since then, PVCC has expanded in both campus size and enrollment along with the development of the Phoenix area. The campus includes the Q Building, which was formerly the George L. Campbell Branch Library. The campus also has a Learning Resource Center building which houses the library, computer labs, and tutoring center. Several art collections, such as the over 600 Western-themed pieces donated by faculty-emeritus member Dr. Warren Buxton, are on display near the college's library. The PVCC Center for the Performing Arts, containing stage facilities for drama and music performances, opened in 2005. A new building for the study of life sciences (anatomy, physiology, general biology, biotechnology, microbiology, marine biology and environmental biology programs) opened at the main campus in August 2009. It includes seven classrooms, six biology labs and two anatomy/physiology labs, one of which is a cadaver lab, plus lab support spaces and administrative offices.  Athletics  Athletics at PVCC is affiliated with the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). PVCC offers 12 intercollegiate athletics programs; Men's & Women's Soccer, Men's & Women's Cross Country, Baseball, Softball, Men's & Women's Indoor/Outdoor Track and Field, Men's & Women's Golf, and Men's & Women's Tennis. PVCC athletics mascot is the Pumas. The Pumas boast 11 NJCAA National Championships. Women’s Soccer - 2016, 2012, 2010 Men’s Cross Country - 2011, 2008, 2004 Women's Cross County - 2004, 2003, 2002, 1998, 1997 The Pumas are also extremely strong in the classroom. PVCC has been home to multiple NJCAA Academic Team of the Year awards and dozens of NJCAA Academic Award individuals. Athletic facilities include: Baseball and Softball fields, Track facility, Soccer game field and Soccer practice field, Tennis courts, Athletics Training Room and Athletics offices. All athletics facilities are located toward the south side of campus.  Transportation  The college is a short distance west of State Route 51 and south of the Loop 101 interchange. Valley Metro buses from routes 16 and 186 serve the campus. For many years, the campus was served by express route 500, but in 2003, this service was canceled and replaced with the RAPID service that departs from Bell Road and State Route 51 Park-and-Ride.

Cannabis tea is commonly recognized as an alternative form of preparation and consumption of the cannabis plant, more popularly known as marijuana, pot, or weed. This plant has long been recognized as an herbal medicine employed by health professionals worldwide to ease symptoms of disease, as well as a psychoactive drug used recreationally and in spiritual traditions. Though less commonly practiced than popular methods like smoking or consuming edibles, drinking cannabis tea can produce comparable physical and mental therapeutic effects. Such effects are largely attributed to the THC content of the tea, levels of which are drastically dependent on individual preparation techniques involving volume, amount of cannabis, and boiling time. Also in common with these administration forms of cannabis is the heating component performed before usage. Due to the rather uncommon nature of this particular practice of cannabis consumption in modern times (in contrast to historical use), the research available on the composition of cannabis tea is limited and based broadly around what is known of cannabis as it exists botanically.  Composition  According to a 2007 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, the composition of cannabis tea is affected by criterion including, but not limited to, the duration of time over which the cannabis is steeped, the volume of tea prepared, and the period of time for which the tea is stored before consumption. The study mentions the ways in which levels of THC and THCA impact variability of composition by changing the bioactivity of the beverage. Therefore, cannabis teas that include less bioactive cannabinoids, \\"based on HPLC peak area\\" will demonstrate varying compositions.  Preparation  According to a recent study on cannabinoid concentration and stability in preparations of cannabis oil and tea, a boiling period of fifteen minutes was found to be sufficient in order to reach the highest concentrations of cannabinoids in tea solutions. However, preparation of cannabis oil in the study was found to ensure a higher stability of cannabinoids than that which was found in preparation of cannabis tea. It is advisable to decarboxylate ones cannabis beforehand to ensure a sufficiently psychoactive tea. Using coconut milk instead of dairy milk is also an option. One can add spices such as cardamom, nutmeg, saffron, vanilla, almond and more. Let the tea simmer for 5-10 mins, longer if using non decarboxylated material.  Folk medicine  Cannabis tea was used for centuries in folk medicine as it was thought to be a treatment for rheumatism, cystitis, and various urinary diseases.  Legal status  Cannabis tea is controlled as a derivative of cannabis in most countries as is required of countries whose governments are party to the United Nations' Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, similar to the regulation surrounding alcohol content of kombucha, there are some forms of cannabis tea with cannabis levels considered to be highly undetectable. These variations of the drink do not contain the psychoactive cannabinoid known as THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and, instead, contain the non-psychoactive cannabinoids cannabidiol (CBD) or cannabinol (CBN)—both of which tend to go undetected in cannabis use/intoxication drug tests. As such, the legal status of cannabis tea is largely dependent on its composition and preparation. = United States = Cannabis tea is scheduled at the federal level in the United States by nature of being a derivative of Cannabis sativa, and it is therefore illegal to possess, buy, and sell.§1308.11 Schedule I. Due to variances in statewide laws, and the reluctance of the federal government to overrule the states, however, the federal legislation has little impact on nationwide use, and is \\"generally applied only against persons who possess, cultivate, or distribute large quantities of cannabis\\". As such, regulation of recreational and/or medicinal growth and use on an individual level is not the responsibility of the federal government.  Colorado law  In Colorado, for medical purposes, cannabis tea is a \\"Medical Marijuana Infused Product\\" which is \\"a product infused with medical marijuana that is intended for use or consumption other than by smoking, including edible products, ointments, and tinctures. These products, when manufactured or sold by a licensed medical marijuana center or a medical marijuana-infused product manufacturer, shall not be considered a food or drug for the purposes of the \\"Colorado Food and Drug Act\\", part 4 of article 5 of title 25, C.R.S.\\" Colorado currently stands as one of 33 states that have laws legalizing marijuana as of 2018.  Adverse effects  Although not as widely published as the beneficial, therapeutic effects of cannabis tea, adverse effects of consumption have been found to exist, in addition to known adverse effects of cannabis use in general. Based upon the findings of select studies, it appears as though such effects occur mainly as a result of unconventional methods or dosage used when interacting with the decoction. = Intravenous injection = Possible adverse effects of cannabis tea via intravenous injection have been published via a 1977 study by Dr. Robert B. Mims and Joel H. Lee. The administered solution was one prepared using cannabis seeds (as opposed to the more commonly used female flower head) boiled in tap water with no further filtration. The effects on the four Caucasian youths were said to be immediate and included \\"nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, [and] chills\\" among others. This event and the accompanying study is dated, and the adverse effects experienced were very likely only attained by blatant disregard for sanitation and quality of administration. = Ancient Childbirth = According to a short communication published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, based on the research of Zias et al. regarding cannabis use in ancient childbirth, cannabis is said to have been used to form a decoction with other specific medicinal herbs to terminate a pregnancy in its second to third month. The following is a list of plants used the specific decoction for the termination mentioned by the midwives interviewed for the study: \\"C. sativa L./Cannabaceae; Atropa baetica Wilk./Solanaceae; Nerium oleander L./Apocynaceae; Ruta montana L./Rutaceae; Peganum harmala L./Zygophyllaceae; Agave americana L./Amaryllidaceae and Urginea maritima L./Liliaceae)\\".

Directed by Ted Kotcheff, the film is caustically critical of the \\"anarchy\\" of the American way of life. The character names come from the Dick and Jane series of children's educational books, and the title is taken from the title of one of the books in the series. Plot Dick Harper is a successful aerospace engineer in Los Angeles, where he and wife Jane have a lovely house, with a swimming pool and new lawn under way. Jane (Jane Fonda) takes care of their son, Billy. Due to financial reversals at the business, however, Dick's boss, Charlie Blanchard, suddenly fires him. Dick and Jane owe more than $70,000 and abruptly find themselves with no income. Their attempts to find other gainful employment fail. Jane lands a fashion modeling appearance at a restaurant that becomes a fiasco. Dick ends up applying for unemployment and food stamps, while Jane's wealthy parents, rather than helping, advise them to use this experience positively as a life lesson. Unable to come up with any other solution to their problems, Dick and Jane turn to a life of crime. They make an effort to select their victims judiciously – robbing the telephone company, for example, which makes the customers in line cheer. In time, Dick and Jane weigh their guilty consciences against their needs, trying to get back their old lives and stay out of jail. They make the decision to \\"retire\\" from robbery. However, almost immediately they see Charlie Blanchard on television, testifying in front of a Congressional committee. After realizing that Charlie keeps two hundred thousand dollars in his office as a slush fund (used to pay off lawmakers), Dick and Jane decide to rob Charlie. At a gala at Dick's old firm, Dick and Jane are able to successfully break into Charlie's office, crack the safe, and steal the money. They are able to leave his office and make it to the main floor of the building, but the building's security guards are able to alert Charlie before the couple can leave. They are seen guarding all the exits. Dick admits to Charlie that he and Jane have stolen his money. However, they also explain that Jane has called the police about the theft. Knowing that the $200,000 would possibly be confiscated by the authorities and may lead to further unwanted investigations, Charlie tells the arriving police that no crime is committed and he walks the couple safely out of the building. The movie ends with a press release that states Dick has been hired to be the president of the firm after Charlie has resigned.

It borders the Catumbi, Estácio, Praça da Bandeira and Tijuca neighborhoods. Etymology The name Rio Comprido comes from the river passing through it. This river is currently canalized and completely degraded, and empties into Guanabara Bay. The name Rio Comprido means Long River. History In the 17th century the Rio Comprido valley produced sugarcane, flowed off by a warehouse in embarkations which conducted it to the bay. In the 19th century, the sugar farming was replaced by coffee farming. The neighborhood was settled by Englishmen, and was known until the beginning of the 20th century as Chácara dos Ingleses (Englishmen Small Ranch). When the Paulo de Frontin viaduct was opened, it created access to the Rebouças tunnel and to the city's southern zone, turning Rio Comprido into a passageway neighborhood, currently surrounded by lower income communities, such as Turano, Fogueteiro, Querosene, Fallet, Coroa, São Carlos and Mineira, which suffer from violence and social exclusion.

The storm moved northeastward across the Gulf of Mexico and intensified into a strong tropical storm. Around 23:00 UTC on June 15, the system made landfall southwest of Perry, Florida, with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). The cyclone weakened somewhat while moving over Florida and coastal portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. After emerging into the Atlantic near the North Carolina- Virginia state line early on June 17, the storm strengthened, reaching hurricane intensity later that day. On June 19, a ship located in the vicinity of the storm recorded a barometric pressure around - the lowest in relation to the cyclone. However, the system then became losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about south of Saint Pierre and Miquelon by 00:00 UTC on June 20\\\\. Several locations in the Southeastern United States observed tropical storm-force winds, with the strongest recorded sustained wind speed being in Charleston, South Carolina. =Hurricane Two= Observations of this storm began as early as July 4 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, with a ship encountering the cyclone about north-northeast of Colón, Panama. The system intensified steadily while moving northwestward, becoming a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on the following day. About six hours later, the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane and peaked with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). The hurricane then made landfall near the Nicaragua- Honduras border. The cyclone weakened back to a Category 1 before re-emerging into the Caribbean off the north coast of Honduras early on July 6\\\\. Continuing northwestward, the system then re-strengthened slightly, reaching winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) prior to making landfall in northern Belize around 00:00 UTC on July 7\\\\. The cyclone weakened rapidly over the Yucatán Peninsula and dissipated just offshore Tabasco several hours later. The storm sank several ships, including many steamers loaded with fruit in Honduras. About 6,000 bunches of bananas awaiting shipment were washed away at Bonito, while fruit plantations also experienced extensive damage. A number of homes on Roatán were also severely damaged. The hurricane reportedly caused a large loss of life. It has been paleotempestologically traced in sediment near Gales Point in Belize. =Hurricane Three= Hurricane San Roque of 1893 The third storm of the season formed on August 13 east of the Lesser Antilles. It steadily strengthened to a hurricane while moving over the Leeward Islands. While approaching Puerto Rico on August 16, its winds increased to major hurricane status before landfall at Patillas. It crossed the island and exited near Isabela. There were heavy rains over the island of Puerto Rico and damages to the agricultural crops, especially coffee. In San Juan 2.36 inches of rain were reported. The eye remained over Puerto Rico for a period of seven hours. The lowest barometric pressure reading recorded in San Juan was 29.17 inches. Four deaths were reported. This was the first hurricane in Puerto Rico where flags were used to alert the public about the danger of an approaching hurricane; they were flown from government buildings. Although landfall weakened the storm, the storm regained major hurricane status as it approached the Bahamas. It then re curved northward and on August 22, made landfall in St. Margaret's Bay near Halifax, Nova Scotia as a non-tropical category 1. The storm was known in Nova Scotia as \\"the second Great August Gale\\" and claimed 25 lives, including the sinking of the vessels \\"Dorcas\\" and \\"Etta Stewart.\\" This hurricane was one of four active hurricanes on August 22. =Hurricane Four= The New York Hurricane of 1893 =Hurricane FiveHurricane Six= The Sea Islands Hurricane of 1893 =Hurricane Seven= At least five lives were lost.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=LAH18930903.2.3 =Hurricane EightHurricane Nine= The Great Charleston Hurricane of 1893 =Hurricane Ten= The Cheniere Caminada Hurricane =Tropical Storm ElevenTropical Storm Twelve= See also  * List of tropical cyclones * Atlantic hurricane season ReferencesExternal links * Monthly Weather Review *HURDAT Data for the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines ","title":"1893 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"2500509","text":"The Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Clubs was a non-profit organization serving the community of the Bronx, in New York City.

September 2006. http://www.nyc.gov/html/doi/pdf/GW_Report.pdf The city has suspended further funding of the agency, and Boys and Girls Clubs of America has revoked the group's right to use their name, likeness or logo. At the time the funds were alleged to have been transferred, Evan Montvel Cohen, former chairman of the now-defunct Progress Media, was also Director of Development for Gloria Wise. This was apparently part of general misappropriation of funds by the board of directors, which saw several of them receiving money from the organization which was in turn used for personal expenditures. In response to this report, Air America Radio's new owners, Piquant LLC, issued a press release stating that the alleged \\"mismanagement and corruption at Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club\\" was \\"absolutely disgraceful.\\" In addition, the press release stated that although Piquant had \\"no obligation to Progress Media's business activities\\", Piquant had \\"agreed months ago to fully compensate the Gloria Wise Boys & Girls Club as a result of this transaction\\".

Inay (1944-2000) was the founder of the Filipino martial art of Inayan Eskrima. He studied privately under the tutelage of two great Eskrima masters, Max Sarmiento and Angel Cabales. It was Mike Inay who proposed to Angel Cabales the formation of an organization to preserve and promote the Cabales Serrada style of Eskrima. It was this and many other contributions that made Mangisursuro Mike Inay a prominent figure in the Stockton, California Eskrima scene. With Mr. Inay's help, Mr. Cabales formed the first Cabales Serrada association. Mr. Inay also developed a ranking structure for the system. He later co-founded the West Coast Eskrima Society with its first chairman, Max Sarmiento, in 1979. The West Coast Eskrima Society was formally inaugurated in Los Gatos, California in Mr. Inay's home. The West Coast Eskrima Society was founded in the hopes of preserving, propagating, and promoting the Filipino martial arts. The society was able to unite several Filipino masters under one organization. Among the notable Eskrima masters who joined it were: Max Sarmiento, Mike Inay, Jimmy Tacosa, Jeffrey Elliott, Sam Tendencia, Dentoy Revillar, Gilbert Tenio, Leo Giron, Narrie Babao, Dan Inosanto, and Richard Bustillo. Inay began teaching law enforcement throughout the United States and became known in the law enforcement community. He also traveled abroad to conduct seminars and clinics on his personal style, Inayan Eskrima, in England, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Canada and Australia. At the request of a large Midwest law enforcement organization, he developed a law enforcement knife defense program called \\"Spontaneous Knife Defense\\" or \\"Reactive Knife Defense\\". He also appeared on Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN). During this period, he also developed and refined the Inayan System of Eskrima. Inayan Eskrima comprises seven distinct styles of Eskrima. Each of these styles has a complete set of basic, intermediate, and advanced techniques and concepts that make them viable independent of one other. Inay placed a learning structure over these styles and a ranking system for grading. He elected to call all of the styles he teaches \\"Inayan\\" to avoid confusion with other teachers and styles that might have the same or similar names. This also reduced the amount of controversy and claims of validity others could or could not profess with regard to \\"Inayan\\" Eskrima. Inay developed several courses dealing with pressure-sensitive nerve areas, riot baton, and advanced knife training. He also developed the use of the knife as an alternative weapon for executive protection in instances where a firearm is not warranted or safe to use. Mike Inay died in 2000 teaching Inayan Eskrima. While alive and head of the system he was referred to by his unofficial title Suro; since his death he is referred to as Mangisursuro, his official title.

The festival in Cornwall is the liturgical feast day of St Allan (also spelled St Allen or St Arlan), who was the bishop of Quimper in the sixth century. As such, Allantide is also known as Allan Night and Allan Day. The origins of the name Allantide also probably stem from the same sources as Hollantide (Wales and the Isle of Man) and Hallowe'en itself. Traditional Cornish jack-o'-lantern made from a turnip. As with the start of the celebration of Allhallowtide in the rest of Christendom, church bells were rung in order to comfort Christian souls in the intermediate state. Another important part of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast. The following is a description of the festival as it was celebrated in Penzance at the turn of the 19th century: In his book Popular Romances of the West of England, Robert Hunt describes Allantide in St Ives: There are a number of divination games recorded including the throwing of walnuts in fires to predict the fidelity of partners, and the pouring of molten lead into cold water as a way of predicting the occupation of future husbands, the shape of the solidified lead somehow indicating this.*Simon Reed - The Cornish Traditional Year 2009 In some parts of Cornwall \\"Tindle\\" fires were lit similar in nature to the Coel Coth (Coel Certh) of Wales.

He was the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from November 8, 1990, to February 28, 1997. Background After graduating from Amherst College in 1973, Kessler studied medicine at Harvard University, graduating with an M.D. degree in 1979. While at Harvard, Kessler obtained a J.D. degree in 1977 from the University of Chicago Law School. While serving his residency in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, he worked as a consultant to Republican senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, particularly on issues relating to the safety of food additives, and on the regulation of cigarettes and tobacco. From 1984 to 1990, Kessler simultaneously ran a 431-bed teaching hospital in New York City and taught at the Columbia Law School and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. As FDA commissioner Although his appointment as FDA commissioner in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush won bipartisan approval, many of Kessler's actions were controversial, and he soon became more popular with Democrats than Republicans. He moved quickly to make the agency more efficient, cutting the time needed to approve or reject new drugs, including AIDS drugs, and more vigilant in protecting consumers against unsafe products and inflated label claims. It was also under his watch that FDA enacted regulations requiring standardized Nutrition Facts labels on food. In one memorable action, he had 24,000 gallons of Citrus Hill orange juice seized because although made from concentrate, it was labeled \\"fresh.\\" Kessler was reappointed to the post of FDA Commissioner during the administration of Bill Clinton. Kessler is also known for his role in the FDA's attempt to regulate cigarettes, which resulted in the FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. case. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the FDA did not have the power to enact and enforce the regulations in question. He was awarded the Public Health Hero award on April 2, 2008, by the UC Berkeley School of Public Health for his work in tobacco regulation. Kessler published a book entitled A Question of Intent, which gave his view of his time at the FDA, focussing on his attempts to change tobacco legislation and the interpretation of that legislation, and his battle with the then-illegal but still used Y1 strain of tobacco. Kessler also oversaw the FDA-directed moratorium on silicone breast implant devices in 1992. This moratorium led to a deluge of lawsuits in the following months, many of which were filed prior to the federal judiciary's adoption of the Daubert standard for expert testimony in 1993. These lawsuits ultimately led to perhaps the largest settlement in the history of medical devices, Dow Corning's declaration of bankruptcy, and ongoing payments to individuals for conditions that have nothing to do with silicone. Scientific panels funded by three different government agencies conducted comprehensive assessments and later arrived independently at the same conclusion: that there was no connection between silicone gel implants and systemic disease.Independent Review Group, Silicone Breast Implants: The Report of the Independent Review Group 8 (July 1998).Bondurant S., Ernster V., Herdman R, eds.; Institute of Medicine Committee on the Safety of Silicone Breast Implants.

After the FDA Kessler delivers a lecture at George Washington University in October 2013. Kessler left the FDA to join the Yale School of Medicine as dean from 1997 to 2003. He was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 2001. In 2003 he was recruited to a post as dean and vice-chancellor at the University of California, San Francisco Medical School. After his arrival at UCSF, Kessler uncovered multiple spreadsheets for the same closed fiscal year (a year prior to his recruitment), all showing different revenue and expense numbers, but indicating that the dean's office was in deficit and would continue to be so, in direct contravention of what had been reported to him during his recruitment, evidence of, at best, inadequate financial controls. J. Michael Bishop, Chancellor of UCSF, claimed UC audits found no evidence of financial irregularities and, in June 2007, Bishop demanded Kessler's resignation. On December 13, 2007, Kessler was formally dismissed. Then, Bishop acknowledged that the financial data presented to Kessler during his recruitment might have been misleading. Kessler alleged he was fired for whistleblowing. Subsequent to Kessler's firing, after UCSF was pressured to release one of the audits, by KPMG, it was revealed that Kessler had been correct. His 2009 book The End of Overeating (a New York Times best seller) highlights for the consumer the amount of fat, salt and sugar in their food intake. He asserts that this trio of elements in restaurant and processed foods conditions us to eat more in a manner that changes our brain circuitry and that children may develop a pattern of overeating and obesity that they might retain for life. He stresses that this outcome of lifelong obesity is not genetic but environmental and avoidable.

Their molecular and morphological plesiomorphy has long misled researchers about the pardalotes' affiliations. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy controversially redefines the families Acanthizidae (spinebills) and Dasyornithidae (bristlebirds) as subfamilies within the larger family Pardalotidae (pardalotes). However, later work indicated that the Pardalotidae are more closely related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and could be considered a subfamily within them. The Acanthizidae have also been traditionally considered aberrant honeyeaters, and could also be considered a subfamily of Meliphagidae; however, they seem to be very ancient members of Meliphagoidea and if the pardalotes are separated as a distinct family apart from Meliphagidae, the spinebills might be split off too. But some ornithologists maintain that separating the spinebills and pardalotes into separate families would mean creating two monotypic families with a mere six species in total, and so keeping the spinebills within the Meliphagidae and possibly merging the pardalotes therein as well seems to be a more sensible course of action.Jønsson, Knud A. & Fjeldså, Jon (2006): A phylogenetic supertree of oscine passerine birds (Aves: Passeri). Zoologica Scripta 35 (2): 149–186. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy also placed the Petroicidae (Australasian \\"robins\\") in the Meliphagoidea. This is now no longer favoured; as more recent work show that they form a distinct lineage of uncertain relationships; all that can be said at present with reasonable certainty is that the Petroicidae are neither Passerida (\\"advanced\\" songbirds) nor a very ancient songbird group.

Numerous members of the family have risen to prominence over the centuries as soldiers, churchmen, diplomats, and academics. Sometimes the name is gallicized as de Furstenberg or anglicized as Furstenberg. History Fürstenberg was a county of the Holy Roman Empire in Swabia, present-day southern Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The county emerged when count Egino IV of Urach by marriage inherited large parts of the Duchy of Zähringen upon the death of Duke Berthold V in 1218, and was originally called the county of Freiburg. Egino's grandson Count Henry started naming himself after his residence at Fürstenberg Castle around 1250. File:Burg Hohenurach gesehen vom Eppenzillfelsen.jpgUrach Castle File:01, Burg Fürstenberg (Hüfingen).JPGFürstenberg Castle The county was partitioned in 1284 between itself and the lower county of Dillingen, and then again in 1408 between Fürstenberg-Fürstenberg and Fürstenberg-Wolfach. Over the centuries, the various counts and Princes expanded their territories to include the Landgraviate of Baar, the Lordships of Gundelfingen, Hausen, Heiligenberg, Höwen, and Meßkirch, and the Landgraviate of Stühlingen in Germany; as well as estates around Křivoklát Castle (), Bohemia, Tavíkovice Castle (German: Taikowitz) in Moravia, and from 1733 Lány Palace in Bohemia. In 1607, Count Frederick IV of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg acquired the fief of Weitra in Lower Austria by marriage. The House of Fürstenberg held Weitra until the Revolutions of 1848. The members of the Fürstenberg-Weitra cadet branch built a Renaissance castle on medieval foundations. principality of Fürstenberg, composed of the counties of Baar, Stühlingen and Heiligenberg, c. 1800 In 1664, Count Hermann Egon of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg and his brothers, the bishops Franz Egon of Strasbourg and Cardinal William Egon of Furstenberg, became Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1667, the county of Fürstenberg- Heiligenberg was formally raised to a principality and received a vote in the Imperial Diet. After the Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg branch of the family became extinct in 1716, the counts Froben Ferdinand of Fürstenberg-Messkirch and Joseph Wilhelm Ernst of Fürstenberg-Stühlingen became princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1744, various Fürstenberg territories were reunified to the Principality of Fürstenberg-Fürstenberg, as all lines except one had become extinct. Between 1664 and 1716 the residence had been Heiligenberg. The residences of the two partial principalities between 1716 and 1723 were Stühlingen and Meßkirch. In 1723 Prince Joseph of Fürstenberg-Stühlingen built his new residence at Donaueschingen, being more centrally located, which remained the residence of the united principality after the Meßkirch branch of the family had become extinct. The Rheinbundakte of 1806 dissolved Fürstenberg. Most of its territory was given to the Grand Duchy of Baden; smaller parts were given to the Kingdom of Württemberg, the principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and the Kingdom of Bavaria. The princely family is still today residing at Donaueschingen, Heiligenberg and Weitra.

Lord Moynihan served as chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA) from 2005 to 2012. BiographyEarly life= Moynihan is the son of Patrick Moynihan, 2nd Baron Moynihan, by his second wife June Elizabeth Hopkins, daughter of Arthur Stanley Covacic Hopkins. He was educated in the state system, including at secondary level, but studied at Monmouth School with a Music Scholarship from 1968 to 1973. In 1974 he went up to University College, Oxford, graduating in 1977 with a BA in Politics, Philosophy and Economics (proceeding MA in 1982). He was a \\"double blue\\" coxing the victorious Oxford University crew in the 1977 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and boxing against Cambridge in the Bantamweight division. He beat Benazir Bhutto in the election for the Presidency of the Oxford Union in 1976 and won the Trans-Atlantic Universities Debating Competition the same year. In 1977, he was awarded the Fiddian Post- Graduate Research Scholarship in Politics at Brasenose College, Oxford, which he did not take up in favour of working at the Westburn sugar refinery in Greenock for Tate & Lyle. In 2007, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy by the London Metropolitan University. =Sport and the Olympics= In 1968 he won a gold medal in the Home Countries International Regatta, coxing the Welsh Senior Rowing IV. He was selected to tour the United States in 1973 as a member of the British Swifts Golf Team. In 1978 Moynihan won a gold medal coxing the British Lightweight VIII at the 1978 FISA Lightweight Championships held in Copenhagen. In the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, he ignored pressure to boycott for political reasons. He was cox for the Great Britain men's rowing VIII winning a silver medal; during the race, the steering cables to the rudder broke and Moynihan had to reach behind him to grasp the rudder bar. In this unorthodox manner, he steered the boat for most of the race. Most of the crew did not realise what had happened until after the race was over. In the 1981 Munich World Championships he coxed the British VIII to silver medal success. Since 1978 he has, at different times, been a Trustee of the Sports Aid Foundation, Governor of the Sports Aid Trust, Member of the Sports Council, Member of the Central Council for Physical Recreation's Enquiry into Sponsorship of Sport, a trustee of the Oxford University Boat Club, Member of the Major Spectator Sports Committee of the Central Council for Physical Recreation, a Steward of the British Boxing Board of Control, Patron of the Bath University Amateur Boxing Club, Patron of the Uphill Ski Club, President of the British Biathlon Union, President of the Welsh Amateur Rowing Association and Chairman of the Paralympic World Cup in 2005. As a celebrated former University College Boat Club (Oxford) cox, he was invited to open the new University College Boathouse in Oxford in 2007. =Political career= Following his appointment in 1981 as one of Whitehall's earliest Political Advisers (working in the Foreign Office for Francis Pym, then Foreign Secretary), Moynihan was elected in 1983 as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Lewisham East. After chairing the World Youth Summit in Hiroshima and being an Official Commonwealth Observer at the Kenyan elections he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Kenneth Clarke in a number of Departments. From 1987 to 1990 he served as Minister for Sport in Margaret Thatcher's government. He was in this post at the time of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 football fans were killed, and visited the scene with Margaret Thatcher to meet with senior South Yorkshire police officers on the day of the tragedy. Moynihan was at the centre of a government proposal to bring in an ID Card scheme for supporters of English Football League teams in the wake of repeated outbreaks of hooliganism in the late 1980s. However, these plans had to be abandoned following the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent Taylor Report, but he eventually piloted the Football Spectators Bill through Parliament to address football hooliganism which included the introduction of CCTV cameras in all 92 League Grounds and a range of other measures to tackle hooliganism. From 1987 to 1990, Moynihan was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of the Environment responsible for water privatisation, National Heritage, the National Rivers Authority, Inner City policy, planning and urban regeneration. During his time at the Department of the Environment he worked closely with Michael Howard who, when subsequently Leader of the Conservative Party, appointed Moynihan as his Special Adviser and Chairman of the Conservative Campaigning Board. From 1990–92 he was joint-Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy in both the Thatcher and Major governments responsible for oil, gas and renewable energy policy, a field in which he took a leading interest through the establishment of the first Government UK Renewable Energy Advisory Group which he chaired and the introduction of the first Non Fossil Fuel Obligation in Parliament which initiated Government support for renewable energy. During his time in the House of Commons, he chaired the All Party Parliamentary Group on Afghanistan, was Hon. Secretary of the Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee, the Parliamentary British Latin America Group and the Parliamentary Friends of the British Council. Whilst Moynihan's House of Commons seat was lost to Labour's Bridget Prentice in the General Election of 1992, his half-brother's death in 1991 opened the door to him for continuing his political career in the House of Lords, but he did not officially succeed to the title until 1997. From 1997 to 2000, Moynihan was a Shadow Senior Front Bench Foreign Affairs Spokesman for the Conservative Party and was elected as one of the hereditary peers to remain in the Upper House following the House of Lords Act 1999. He was Shadow Minister for Minister for Sport in the House of Lords from July 2003 to February 2005. =Business career= Moynihan started his business career working consecutively in Glasgow, Liverpool and the London docks with Tate & Lyle. He remained with the company for 10 years with his last assignment being Chief Executive of Ridgways Tea & Coffee Merchants. After 10 years in Parliament, Moynihan returned to the business world as executive chairman and chief executive of Consort Resources Ltd and then director of Clipper Windpower plc and executive chairman of Clipper Windpower Europe Ltd. He has held a series of non-executive directorships including Ranger Oil Ltd, in Canada and Rowan Companies Inc in the United States. From 2005 to 2011 he was Chairman of Pelamis Wave Power Ltd in Edinburgh. He was a non-executive director of the Rowan Companies plc, where he chaired Rowan's Health, Safety and Environment Committee. He was chairman of the clean energy company, Hydrodec Group plc from 2012-2019. He is currently chairman and Partner of the private equity group, Buckthorn Capital LLP. A Freeman of the City of London, he was later admitted as a Liveryman of the Haberdashers' Company in 1981 becoming a member of the Haberdashers' Court of Assistants in 2002, Third Warden from 2013–2014, chaired the Haberdashers' Education Foundation and was a member of the Haberdashers' Company Finance Committee. =Peerage= The House of Lords declared the Moynihan Barony dormant on the death of the Moynihan's older half-brother, Antony Moynihan in 1991. Colin Moynihan spent five years engaged in the complex claim to the title due to the number of the 3rd Baron's marriages and questions over the parentage and legitimacy of his sons. In 1997 the Committee for Privileges adjudicated: > ...that neither of the two sons purporting to be the sons of the Third Baron > can, in fact, be an heir to the peerage. In the case of the elder, Andrew, > the committee was shown overwhelming genetic evidence that he cannot be the > son of the late Lord Moynihan; and so far as the younger, Daniel, is > concerned, the evidence clearly shows that he is the child of a bigamous > marriage and is therefore illegitimate. In those circumstances, it is clear > beyond doubt that the petitioner, Colin Moynihan, must be the rightful heir > and that his Petitions must succeed.Lords Hansard text for 20 March 1997 > (170320-03) A writ of summons was issued on 30 May 1997 confirming Colin Moynihan in the title of Baron Moynihan. Lord Moynihan also succeeded as a baronet, a title granted to the first holder in 1922. =British Olympic Association= On 5 October 2005, Moynihan was elected Chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA), for the run-up to the 2012 London Olympic Games. He beat the 1968 Olympic hurdles champion, David Hemery, by a vote of 28 to 15.Moynihan named new BOA chairman, BBC News (5 October 2005) He was re-elected unopposed in 2008. He has served on a number of Committees and Commissions for the International Olympic Committee including the IOC International Relations Commission, the IOC 2009 Congress Editorial Committee and as an Executive Board member of the Association of National Olympic Committees from 2006–2011. He was elected to the European Olympic Committee Executive Board in 2009. In the context of the London 2012 Olympic Games, Lord Moynihan was a Director of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), where he also served on the LOCOG Audit Committee; a Trustee of International Inspiration and a member of the Olympic Board, which had oversight of the London 2012 Games. Chairmanship controversy and resignation In March 2011, it was reported that Moynihan's future as BOA chairman seemed in doubt, because of a dispute with the organisers of the London 2012 Olympics which revolved around the funding of the Paralympics. Moynihan led the BOA in challenging a \\"clear cut\\" International Olympic Committee rule that shares of any profit from the 2012 Games must take into account the costs of Paralympic games. His costly pursuit of this legal action was considered deeply embarrassing to BOA's National Olympic Committee members. In April 2011 the dispute with the London Organising Committee who were supported by the International Olympic Committee was resolved with the BOA, when the latter backed down from its demands. In April 2011 the dispute with the London Organising Committee who were supported by the International Olympic Committee was resolved with the BOA. During the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Lord Moynihan issued a rallying cry for British state schools to do more to foster sport.www.telegraph.co.uk The day after the Closing Ceremony, Lord Moynihan resigned,www.telegraph.co.uk quipping, \\"I notice politicians have enjoyed these Games – I understand why Roman Emperors were in favour of annual Games!\\"London 2012 Moynihan was awarded the Olympic Order by the President of the International Olympic Committee at the completion of the London Summer Games.http://www.olympic.org/news/thank-you-london/172879 =Personal life= Lord Moynihan married Gaynor-Louise in 1992.

He was noted for his measurements of crystals using a goniometer. Life Nikolai Koksharov was born in Ust-Kamenogorsk (today's Kazakhstan). He was educated at the military school of mines in St. Petersburg. At the age of twenty-two he was selected to accompany Roderick Murchison and Édouard de Verneuil, and afterwards Dr. Keyserling, in their geological survey of the Russian Empire. Subsequently, he devoted his attention mainly to the study of mineralogy and mining, and was appointed director of the Institute of Mines. In 1865, he became director of the Imperial Mineralogical Society of St.Petersburg.

When farm systems came into being in the 1930s, the Travelers were at different times affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, Boston Braves, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics, and Baltimore Orioles. After attracting fewer than 68,000 paying customers over a 77-game home schedule in 1958, the Travelers moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1959 as the Shreveport Sports. In 1959, however, the New Orleans Pelicans moved to Little Rock and took the Travelers name. But the Southern Association was in its death throes, and the Travelers went down with the entire league after the 1961 season. Little Rock did not field a team in 1962. In 1963, organized baseball returned to Little Rock with the Arkansas Travelers of the Triple-A International League. In both 1964 and 1965, the franchise played in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League before settling in the Double-A Texas League, where the Travelers have played since 1966. Currently, the Arkansas Travelers are the AA affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. The team's name derives from the old folk song, The Arkansas Traveler.

The intestine uses peristalsis to push its contents toward the anus; IND sufferers have a problem with the motor neurons that lead to the intestine, inhibiting this process and thus preventing digestion. It can often be confused for Hirschsprung's disease, as both have similar symptoms. Presentation IND can be grouped into NID A and NID B, with the \\"A\\" form affecting the sympathetic innervation, and the \\"B\\" version affecting the parasympathetic innervation. In 2002 Martucciello and colleagues published the first analysis of associated anomalies in IND population is an important clinical approach to investigate possible pathogenetic correlations. Two recessive syndromes were identified (3 families). The first was characterized by NID B, intestinal malrotation, and congenital short bowel, the second by NID B, short stature, mental retardation, and facial dysmorphism. In this study, gastrointestinal anomalies accounted for 67.4% of all associated disorders. These data suggest a strong correlation between IND and intestinal development. DiagnosisTreatment Conservative treatment involves the long term use of laxatives and enemas, and has limited success. Dietary changes in order to control the disease are ineffective and high fiber diets often worsen the symptoms in children. As a last resort, surgical treatment (internal sphincter myectomy or colon resection) is used. In extreme cases, the only effective cure is a complete transplant of the affected parts. Society A famous case of IND is that of Adele Chapman, who had a triple transplant of the small intestine, pancreas and liver, the first of its kind in the UK; therefore the official charity of IND is the Adele Chapman Foundation.

It has about 7,500 inhabitants. Administrative parts Villages of Albrechtice u Frýdlantu and Větrov are administrative parts of Frýdlant. Geography The town is located in the north of the historic Bohemia region, close to the border with Poland. It is situated in the northern foothills (Frýdlantská pahorkatina) of the Jizera Mountains, on the Smědá river. HistoryEarly history= The area was settled by Slavic (Sorbian) tribes from Lusatia from the 6th century onwards and in the 12th century was incorporated into the Upper Lusatian (Land Budissin) territory, then held by the Margraves of Meissen. It belonged to the Lordship of Seidenberg (Zawidów), which in 1158 passed to the Přemyslid king Vladislaus II of Bohemia. =Frýdlant Castle and the town= Frýdlant Castle and Château In the 13th century the castle was held by the Ronovec family (Ronovci) until the middle of the century when Častolov of Ronov was forced to return the castle and other property to King Ottokar II. Rulko of Birbstein, also called Rudolf of Bieberstein, purchased the castle and surrounding land from the king in 1278. The castle is situated near the center of town, above the Smědá river. Rulko held property in Silesia and Upper Lusatia and family members held court positions. There were important trade routes through the area, including to Görlitz and to Lusatia. From Görlitz, Via Regia provided routes to Russia, Spain, and throughout Europe. Perhaps as early as 1304, but by 1381, a moat and curtain walls were constructed to surround and protect the town, which were largely removed in 1774. The Birbsteins (Biebersteins) supported King Sigmund during the Hussite Wars (1419–1434). Frýdlant was apprehended by the Hussites in 1428. Between 1428 and 1433, the town was raided several times. Frydlant castle and town, also called Frydlant Manor went to Emperor Ferdinand I when Christopher, the last of the line of the Birbsteins, died in 1551. The castle went into the Redern family when Bedřich bought it in 1558. Since the ruler set the religion for an area at that time, Bedřich made Protestant churches and closed the Catholic church in Hejnice that had been the destination for religious pilgrimages. Several new villages were established and the production of linen cloth resulted in an economic boom during the initial years of the Redern family. Marco Spazzio di Lancio, an Italian architect hired by the family, expanded the castle in the 16th century. Christoph von Redern was considered a traitor when he opposed Emperor Ferdinand II and supported Frederick V of the Palatinate (also known as Fridrich Falcký) after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. All of his property was then taken from him. Frýdlant then went to Albrecht von Wallenstein, who became Duke of Frýdlant and lived at Jičín. Wallenstein returned Catholicism to the area and held the lands until 1634, when he was assassinated. Frýdlant then went to Matthias Gallas of Campo as a reward for his fight against Wallenstein in 1636 by Emperor Ferdinand II. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, the castle was possessed by the Swedes. They constructed fortified barbicans and strengthened the defensive walls. In 1639, Christoph von Redern returned to Frydlant after a period of exile. One year later, the Swedes left Bohemia entirely. Due to the loss of religious freedom and Protestants being forced to adopt the Catholic religion, many exiles did not return to the area. The area continued to suffer through 1642. The estates remained with Matthias Gallas and the Gallas line until 1757. When Earl Philip Joseph Galas died without children, the estate went to Christian Philip Clam, his nephew, under the stipulation that going forward the family would assume the Gallas coat-of-arms and the family surname would be changed to Clam- Gallas. In 1800 or 1801, the Clam-Gallas family opened the castle to the public as a museum. Napoleon and his troops were in the town in 1813, to the detriment of the citizens of the town. A textile industry developed in the town in the 19th century. In 1899, the Plague Column was constructed in the memory of the victims of five plague epidemics. The town also survived several significant fires. Until 1918, Friedland in Böhmen was part of the Austrian monarchy (Cisleithanian side after the Compromise of 1867). It was the head of a district with the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Bohemian crown land. It remained with the Clam-Gallas family until the last descendant Clotilda, who died in 1982, having moved to Vienna in April 1945. Now, the building complex consists of the Gothic castle with a high tower and a Renaissance château. Today it is one of the most visited sites in the Czech Republic. There are exhibits, such as of Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), and an armoury of 1,000 weapons used for military and hunting. The castle includes the St Ann's Chapel, the Knights' Hall, rooms for the count and countess, and a working kitchen. =Church of the Holy Cross= Church of the Holy Cross, or Church of the Finding of the True Cross The Church of the Holy Cross was built in the mid-16th century by Italian architects, which has a mixture of architectural styles due to construction over the years. A Renaissance style chapel for the Redern family tomb was built in 1566. A mausoleum was built for the Redern family in 1610. =Railway= In 1875, a railway line from Liberec via Frýdlant to Zawidów was put into operation. Lines to Mirsk (Friedberg) and the Frýdlant–Heřmanice Railway to Zittau followed soon. =Town hall and museum= Town Hall of Frýdlant, Masaryk Square In 1893, a new town hall was erected in the center of the town at Masaryk Square according to plans by Franz Neumann, a Viennese architect. Inside the town hall is a bust of Albrecht von Wallenstein, created by a sculptor from nearby Raspenava. The building has stained glass windows and the exterior has statues of Self-Sacrifice and Justice. Now, the town museum, Frýdlant City Museum, is located on the second floor with archaeological and historical exhibits. =Nazi Germany= Following the 1938 Munich Agreement, the town was occupied by Nazi Germany and incorporated as Friedland (Isergebirge), one of the municipalities in the Reichsgau Sudetenland. After World War II, it fell back to the Third Czechoslovak Republic and renamed Frýdlant v Čechách. The German-speaking population was expelled according to the Beneš decrees and replaced by Czech settlers. In 2016, Georg Mederer and Erich Stenz, German treasure hunters, claimed that trucks delivered items from the amber chamber of Saint Petersburg, Russia to the castle in the late period of the war. They state that the items previously owned by Peter the Great were stolen by the Nazis and stored in the castle cellars with contemporaneously constructed brick walls. The men further state that they have been unable to search for the stolen items due to the Czech government and the Czech National Heritage Institute. There is also a theory that the amber room, including decorative wall panels, were shipped to Konigsberg, now Kaliningrad, and the contents were destroyed during bombing of the town. In popular culture The town's castle is believed to be the source of inspiration for The Castle (1926) by Franz Kafka.

It is not approved for use in the United States, but is approved in other Western countries such as Canada, the UK and Australia (TGA approved in December 2000). It is produced by affiliates of the Hoffmann–La Roche pharmaceutical company. Initially, Aurorix was also marketed by Roche in South Africa, but was withdrawn after its patent rights expired and Cipla Medpro's Depnil and Pharma Dynamic's Clorix became available at half the cost. No significant rise in blood pressure occurs when moclobemide is combined with amines such as tyramine-containing foods or pressor amine drugs, unlike with the older irreversible and non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which cause a severe rise in blood pressure with such combination. Due to the lack of anticholinergic, cardiovascular, cognitive and psychomotor impairments moclobemide is advantageous in the elderly as well as those with cardiovascular disease. Medical uses Reversible selective MAOIs such as moclobemide are widely underprescribed due to the misconception that the side effect profiles are analogous to that of the irreversible and non- selective MAOIs. MAOIs such as moclobemide are reported to have a relatively fast onset of action compared to other antidepressant drug classes, and have good long-term tolerability in terms of side effects. Tolerance does not seem to occur; research has found that moclobemide retains its beneficial therapeutic properties in depression for at least a year. *Unipolar depression. Moclobemide has demonstrated effectiveness and efficacy in the treatment and management of major depressive disorder, with both endogenous and non-endogenous depression responding; in addition moclobemide has a fast onset of action compared to other antidepressants and is significantly more tolerable than the tricyclic antidepressants. Due to a very good safety profile and very low incidence of side effects moclobemide is likely to have a high level of acceptability by individuals suffering from depression. Higher doses (>450 mg/day) may be more effective in severe depression, while patients treated with a lower dose tend to respond less well than those treated with tricyclic antidepressants. : Psychotic depression, unipolar endogenous depression, melancholic depression, retarded depression, agitated depression and neurotic depression all respond to moclobemide. As does atypical depression. Unipolar endogenous depression is reported to have the best response to moclobemide therapy. Individuals suffering from depression who are given moclobemide are twice as likely to improve on moclobemide than on placebo. A concern of antidepressant adverse effects is sexual dysfunction; however, moclobemide has actually been found to increase the libido and also improve impaired erection, ejaculation and orgasm. Cardiovascular toxicity is a concern with antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants as well as the irreversible MAOIs; when cardiovascular toxicity is a concern, SSRIs or the reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide are an option as they lack or have a significantly reduced level of cardiovascular toxicity in terms of adverse effect as well as in overdose. :The effectiveness of moclobemide in agitated depression is equivalent to that of imipramine and sedative antidepressants such as amitriptyline, mianserin and maprotiline. The therapeutic response in agitated depressive individuals is similar to that seen in non-agitated depression; however, a past history of use of antidepressants reduces the chance of successful therapeutic response. The addition of a benzodiazepine to moclobemide therapy has not been found to be of benefit in this population group. Moclobemide cause less side effects than imipramine. and it has better tolerability compared to TCAs. * Bipolar depression. While not generally recommended as a monotherapy for bipolar depression (as with all antidepressants) in one clinical trial it appeared (although statistical significance at the p=0.05 was not reached) as though moclobemide was equally effective as imipramine at reducing depressive symptoms, but had a significantly lower risk of causing a manic switch. This is in line with recent findings that MAOIs as a class are superior to other antidepressants (in terms of both their relatively low rate of manic switching and their efficacy) in the treatment of bipolar depression. *Dysthymia; moclobemide has been found to be effective in the treatment and management of this depressive disorder. *Social phobia. Moclobemide has been found to be effective for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in both short and long-term placebo controlled clinical trials. Moclobemide is effective but not as effective as the irreversible MAOIs in the treatment of social phobia. Maximal benefits can take 8 – 12 weeks to manifest. There is a high risk of treatment failure if there is co-morbid alcohol abuse, however. The Australian Medicines Handbook lists social phobia as an accepted but not a licensed indication. The use of moclobemide in the treatment of social anxiety disorder has given mixed results with a tendency of response at higher doses (>300 mg/d) compared with placebo.Udo Bonnet. Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Essen, Essen, Germany. \\"Moclobemide: Therapeutic Use and Clinical Studies\\". 114-116. *Smoking cessation. Moclobemide has been tested in heavy dependent smokers against placebo based on the theory that tobacco smoking could be a form of self-medicating of major depression, and moclobemide could therefore help increase abstinence rates due to moclobemide mimicking the MAO-A inhibiting effects of tobacco smoke. Moclobemide was administered for 3 months and then stopped; at 6 months follow-up it was found those who had taken moclobemide for 3 months had a much higher successful quit rate than those in the placebo group. However, at 12-month follow-up the difference between the placebo group and the moclobemide group was no longer significant. *Panic disorder. Moclobemide is useful in the treatment and management of panic disorder. Panic disorder is mentioned as an accepted but unlicensed indication in the Australian Medicines Handbook. *ADHD. Two small studies assessing the benefit of moclobemide in people with attention deficit disorder found that moclobemide produced favourable results. *Fibromyalgia, moclobemide has been found to improve pain and functioning in this group of people. *Migraine. Moclobemide has been reported to be effective in the treatment of migraine and chronic tension headache. Similar to other MAOIs, reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide may also be effective in a range of other psychiatric disorders. Menopausal flushing may also respond to moclobemide. Moclobemide may also have benefit for some patients with Parkinson's Disease by extending and enhancing the effects of l-dopa. In efficacy studies for the treatment of major depressive disorder, moclobemide has been found to be significantly more effective than placebo, as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and somewhat less effective than the older, irreversible MAOIs phenelzine and tranylcypromine. In terms of tolerability, however, moclobemide was found to be comparable to the SSRIs and better tolerated than the TCAs and older MAOIs. There is some evidence that moclobemide on its own or in combination with other antidepressants such as SSRIs is also effective for treatment resistant depression and that the combination can be administered without the development of serotonin syndrome; however, further research is needed before such a combination can be recommended. Follow-up studies show that ongoing use of antidepressants leads to continuing improvement in depression over time; and also have demonstrated that moclobemide retains its therapeutic efficacy as an antidepressant for at least a year. This long-term efficacy is equivalent to that seen with other antidepressant classes. People on irreversible MAOIs have to discontinue these antidepressants two weeks before general anesthesia, however, the use of moclobemide due to its reversible nature, would allow such patients to possibly continue antidepressant therapy. A dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and plasma and urine methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) test can be used to estimate who is likely to respond to moclobemide antidepressant therapy. =Pregnancy and lactation= The doses of moclobemide in breast milk are very low (0.06% of moclobemide being recovered in breast milk) and therefore it has been concluded that moclobemide is unlikely to have any adverse effect on a suckling baby. =Children= Use in children is not recommended as there is insufficient data to assess their safety and efficacy in these patients. =Elderly= Reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide may have advantages in the treatment of depression associated with Alzheimer's disease due to its effect on noradrenaline. Cognitive impairments have been found to improve in people with dementia when depression is treated with moclobemide. Due to its superior safety profile, moclobemide has been recommended as a first line agent for the treatment of depression in the elderly. Due to the side effect profile of moclobemide, it may be a better option for this sub group of people than other antidepressants. Research has found evidence that moclobemide may be able to counter anti-cholinergic (Scopolamine) induced cognitive impairments thus making moclobemide a good choice in the depression in the elderly and those with dementia. Adverse effects The incidence of adverse events is not correlated with age; however, adverse events occur more often in females than in males. Moclobemide is regarded as a generally safe antidepressant and due to its favorable side effect profile, it can be considered a first-line therapeutic antidepressant. Side effects of moclobemide are exceptionally low, with insomnia, headache and dizziness being the most commonly reported side effects in the initial stages of therapy with moclobemide. Many antidepressants have an adverse effect on sexual function; however, treatment with moclobemide has actually been found to improve sexual function. Moclobemide does not have any adverse effect on cognitive abilities, thus there are no impairments of moclobemide therapy on memory, attention functions nor is ability to drive a motor vehicle affected adversely. Moclobemide, even at high doses of 600 mg, does not impair the ability to drive a motor vehicle. The tolerability of moclobemide is similar in women and men and it is also well tolerated in the elderly. Moclobemide has been found to be superior to tricyclic and irreversible MAOI antidepressants in terms of side effects, as it does not cause anticholinergic, sedative or cardiovascular adverse effects as well as not causing weight gain. Unlike the irreversible MAOIs there is no evidence of liver toxicity with moclobemide. Moclobemide has a similar efficacy profile compared to other antidepressants while being superior to the classic MAOIs and the tricyclics in terms of tolerance and safety profile. Moclobemide has little effect on psychomotor functions. Other side effects include nausea, insomnia, tremor and lightheadedness; orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing) is uncommon even among the elderly. Behavioural toxicity or other impairments relating to everyday living does not occur with moclobemide, except that in doses of 400 mg or higher peripheral reaction time may be impaired. Peripheral oedema has been associated with moclobemide. Most of the side effects are transient and disappear within 2 weeks of treatment. Serious fatigue, headache, restlessness, nervousness and sleep disturbances have been described as side effects from moclobemide therapy. A paradoxical worsening of depression has been reported in some individuals in several studies, and reports of suicide or suicidal ideation have been reported as a rare adverse effect of moclobemide. Overall, antidepressants decrease the risk of suicide. Moclobemide is believed to have only small proconvulsant effects; however, rarely seizures may occur. Hypertension has been reported to occur very rarely with moclobemide therapy. Moclobemide is relatively well tolerated. The following are the potential adverse effects and their respective incidences: ;Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects * Nausea * Dry mouth * Constipation * Diarrhoea * Insomnia * Dizziness * Anxiety * Restlessness ;Uncommon/Rare (<1%) adverse effects * Difficulties falling asleep * Nightmares/dreams * Hallucinations * Memory disturbances * Confusion * Disorientation * Delusions * Increased depression * Excitation/irritability * Hypomania * Mania * Aggressive behaviour * Apathy * Tension * Suicidal ideation * Suicidal behaviour * Migraine * Extrapyramidal effects * Tinnitus * Paraesthesia * Dysarthria * Heartburn * Gastritis * Meteorism * Indigestion * Hypertension * Bradycardia * Extrasystoles * Angina/chest pain * Phlebetic symptoms * Flushing * Exanthema/rash * Allergic skin reaction * Itching * Gingivitis * Stomatitis * Dry skin * Conjunctivitis * Pruritus * Urticaria * Disturbances of micturition (dysuria, polyuria, tenesmus) * Metrorrhagia * Prolonged menstruation * General malaise * Skeletal/muscular pain * Altered taste sensations * Hot flushes/cold sensation * Photopsia * Dyspnoea * Visual disturbances * Increased hepatic enzymes without associated clinical sequelae. =Contraindications= Avoid use in: * Confusional states * Bipolar disorder (although it seems less likely than imipramine to cause a manic switch) * Phaeochromocytoma and caution is recommended in: * Agitated/excited patients * Thyrotoxicosis =Interactions= ;Drug Moclobemide has fewer interactions than irreversible MAOIs. Cimetidine, however, causes a significant rise in moclobemide levels and therefore if the combination is used, lower doses of moclobemide have been recommended. There is little increase in the effects of alcohol when combined with moclobemide and, in fact, moclobemide causes a reduction in alcohol-related impairments. Moclobemide also interacts with pethidine/meperidine, and dextropropoxyphene. Ephedrine in combination with moclobemide increases the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects. Moclobemide is also likely to interact with warfarin. The combination of moclobemide with prescription or over the counter sympathomimetic drugs is not recommended due to the potential of significant drug interactions. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when moclobemide has been taken in combination with other serotonin enhancing drugs; however, due to moclobemide's reversible MAO inhibition, serotonin syndrome is significantly less likely to occur with moclobemide than with older irreversible MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when trazodone was abruptly replaced with moclobemide. Taking at the same time or starting moclobemide too soon after discontinuing clomipramine, or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as SSRIs may result in the development of a serotonin syndrome. SNRIs, such as venlafaxine in combination with moclobemide have also been associated with serotonin syndrome. Cimetidine, causes a doubling of the blood plasma levels of moclobemide. Blood plasma levels of trimipramine and maprotiline and possibly other tricyclic antidepressants increase when used in combination with moclobemide and may require dosage adjustments if the combination is used for treatment resistant depression. The elimination of zolmitriptan is reduced by moclobemide and if the combination is used, a dosage reduction of zolmitriptan is recommended. Moclobemide reduces the metabolism of dextromethorphan. Moclobemide may decrease metabolism of diazepam, omeprazole, proguanil, propranolol, and others due to inhibition of CYP2C19.https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01171 ;Dietary Irreversible MAOIs can cause unpleasant and occasionally dangerous side effects such as a hypertensive crises after intake of food or drink containing indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines such as tyramine. This is sometimes referred to as the 'cheese effect'. These side effects are due to irreversible inhibition of MAO in the gut and vasomotor neurones. However, the reversible MAOI antidepressants such as moclobemide have a very different side effect profile in this regard. The reversible binding to MAO-A by moclobemide allows amines such as tyramine to displace moclobemide from MAO-A allowing its metabolism and removing the risk of a hypertensive crisis that occurs with irreversible MAO inhibition. Of 2300 people in multiple clinical trials who were treated with moclobemide in doses up to 600 mg with no dietary restrictions, none experienced a tyramine-mediated hypertensive reaction. As the pressor effect of moclobemide is so low, dietary restrictions are not necessary in people eating a normal diet, in contrast to irreversible MAOIs. However, some rare cheeses that have a high tyramine level may possibly cause a pressor effect and require caution. The potentiation of the pressor effect of tyramine by moclobemide is only one seventh to one tenth of that of irreversible MAOIs. In order to minimize this potentiation, postprandial administration (taken after meals) of moclobemide is recommended. The combined use of moclobemide and selegiline requires dietary restrictions as the combination can lead to increased sensitivity to the pressor effect of foods containing tyramine. While moclobemide or the irreversible MAO-B selective inhibitor selegiline taken alone has very little pressor effect, and requires no dietary restriction, the combination of seligiline with moclobemide leads to a significant enhancement of the pressor effect and such a combination requires dietary restriction of foods containing high amounts of tyramine. The combination of moclobemide and a reversible MAO-B inhibitor requires tyramine dietary restrictions. =Overdose= Moclobemide is considered to be less toxic in overdose compared to older antidepressants, such as the tricyclic antidepressants and the irreversible and non-selective MAOIs, making it a safer antidepressant in the elderly or people with physical disorders. Of 18 people who overdosed on moclobemide during clinical trials, all recovered fully and moclobemide was judged to be safe for inpatient as well as outpatient use. Intoxications with moclobemide as single agent are usually mild; however, when combined with tricyclic or SSRI antidepressants the overdose is much more toxic and potentially fatal. Moclobemide, is preferred by doctors for patients who are at risk of suicide, due to moclobemide's low toxicity in overdose. Patients with mixed intoxications (e.g. with other CNS active drugs) may show severe or life-threatening symptoms and should be hospitalized. Treatment is largely symptomatic and should be aimed at maintenance of the vital functions. =Withdrawal and tolerance= Withdrawal symptoms appear to be very rare with moclobemide compared to other antidepressants; a single report of relatively mild flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 days after rapid reduction of high dose moclobemide therapy has been reported in one patient. Withdrawal of moclobemide causes a rebound in REM sleep. Moclobemide does not seem to prevent withdrawal symptoms from serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Discontinuation of moclobemide is recommended to be done gradually to minimise side effects (e.g. rapid return of condition being treated and/or the appearance of withdrawal symptoms). Tolerance to the therapeutic effects has been reported in a small number of users of MAOIs including moclobemide. Pharmacology A picture of 150 mg tablets of the reversible MAOI drug moclobemide, brand name Aurorix. Moclobemide is a benzamide, derivative of morpholine, which acts pharmacologically as a selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (RIMA), a type of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and increases levels of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), dopamine, and especially serotonin in neuronal cells as well as in synaptic vesicles; extracellular levels also increase which results in increased monoamine receptor stimulation and suppression of REM sleep, down regulation of Beta-3 adrenergic receptors. A single 300 mg dose of moclobemide inhibits 80% of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and 30% of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), blocking the decomposition of norepinephrine, serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. There is also some evidence of moclobemide possessing neuroprotective properties in rodent models. There is no cumulative effect of moclobemide centrally when taken long-term. With long-term use of moclobemide, there is a significant down-regulation of B-adrenoceptors. Single or repeated dosing with 100–300 mg of moclobemide leads to a reduction in deaminated metabolites of amines such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylglycol as well as 5-HIAA. Excretion of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid via urine is also reduced. There is also a temporary increase in prolactin during initial intake of 100–300 mg of moclobemide. L-dihydroxyphenylalanine is also reduced. Inhibition of the serotonin metabolite is less pronounced than the norepinephrine metabolite which suggests there are other major metabolic pathways for serotonin other than MAO-A. It has been described as a 'slow binding inhibitor', whereby conformational changes to either moclobemide or the enzyme to MAO-A slowly form a more tightly bound complex, resulting in the non-competitive MAO inhibition by moclobemide. With three times daily dosing the inhibition on MAO-A was relatively constant with moclobemide. The MAO inhibition of moclobemide lasts about 8–10 hours and wears off completely by 24 hours after dosing. The inhibition of MAO-A by moclobemide is 10 times more potent than the irreversible MAOIs phenelzine and approximately equivalent to tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid. Moclobemide increases levels of extracellular monoamines and decreases levels of their metabolites in rat brains; tolerance to these effects does not seem to occur with chronic use of moclobemide. Moclobemide lacks anticholinergic effects and cognitive impairments can be improved by moclobemide. Moclobemide suppresses the unstimulated release of certain proinflammatory cytokines which are believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and stimulates the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Long-term treatment with moclobemide leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binding to cAMP- dependent protein kinase (PKA). Moclobemide is chemically unrelated to irreversible MAOI antidepressants and only has a very weak pressor effect of orally administered tyramine. In humans, the n-oxide metabolites of moclobemide and moclobemide itself are the compounds that produce most of the inhibition of MAO-A; other metabolites are significantly less potent than the parent compound. In healthy people moclobemide has a relatively small suppressing effect on REM sleep; in contrast, depressed people who have been treated with moclobemide, progressively show improved sleep over a 4-week period, with an increase in stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. There have been conflicting findings with regard to moclobemide altering cortisol levels and whether moclobemide increases growth hormone levels. Testosterone levels increase significantly with long-term use of moclobemide in depressed males. Moclobemide also has neuroprotective properties in its demonstrated anti-hypoxia or anti-ischemia effects; there is a possibility that moclobemide may possess similar neuro- rescuing properties, similar to selegiline, however, research is required to determine this. Moclobemide has also been demonstrated in a single dose research study to possess antinociceptive properties. Platelet MAO is of the MAO-B and this is inhibited only to a small degree in humans; the inhibition is due to low levels of metabolites of moclobemide that have MAO-B inhibiting properties. Moclobemide has been reported to be a mixed MAO-A/MAO-B inhibitor in rats but in man, it has been reported to be a pure MAO-A inhibitor, blocking the decomposition of norepinephrine, serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. No reuptake inhibition of any of the neurotransmitters occurs. The pharmacodynamic action encompasses activation, elevation of mood, and improvement of symptoms like dysphoria, fatigue, and difficulties in concentration. The duration and quality of sleep may be improved. In the treatment of depression the antidepressant effect often becomes evident in the first week of therapy (earlier than typically noted with TCAs/SSRIs). MAO inhibition returns completely back to normal after 24 hours, which allows for changing to another antidepressant within 24 hours of the last dose taken of moclobemide. Pharmacokinetics In humans moclobemide is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and totally metabolised via the liver. Peak plasma levels occur 0.3 to 2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability increases during the first week of therapy from 60% to 80% and more. The elimination half-life is around 2 hours. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. However, the short disposition half life somewhat increases after repeated dosing; moclobemide has an intermediate elimination half life for systemic clearance and an intermediate volume of distribution. Despite its short half-life the pharmacodynamic action of a single dose persists for approximately 16 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver; it is a substrate of CYP2C19 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 1 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged; 92 percent of the metabolised drug is excreted within the first 12 hours. The main metabolites are the N-oxide Ro 12-5637 formed via morpholine N-oxidation and lactam derivative Ro 12-8095 formed via morpholine C-oxidation; active metabolites are found only in trace amounts. The unchanged drug (less than 1%) as well as the metabolites are excreted renally (in urine). The main degradation pathway of moclobemide is oxidation. About 44 percent of the drug is lost due to the first pass effect through the liver. Age and renal function do not affect the pharmacokinetics of moclobemide. However, patients with significantly reduced liver function require dose reductions due to the significant slowing of metabolism of moclobemide. Food slows the absorption but does not affect the bioavailability of moclobemide. Steady state concentrations are established after one week. It has been suggested that changes in dose should not be made with a gap of less than a week. Moclobemide has good penetration across the blood brain barrier with peak plasma levels within the central nervous system occurring 2 hours after administration. Animal toxicology * Acute toxicity: The oral values in mouse and rat are quite high, indicating a wide therapeutic index. LD50 for mice is 730 mg/kg and for rats 1,300 mg/kg. In dogs doses in excess of 300 mg/kg led to vomiting, salivation, ataxia, and drowsiness. * Chronic toxicity: In an 18-months-study in rats with 10 mg/kg no signs of chronic toxicity were noted, with 50 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg only a slight loss of weight, and with 250 mg/kg mildly elevated Alkaline phosphatase and Gamma-GT. Studies in dogs revealed no toxicity relevant for humans. No evidence for a possible hepatic or cardiovascular toxicity was found. History Irreversible MAOI antidepressants were discovered accidentally in the 1950s but their popularity declined as their toxicity especially their dangerous food interactions became apparent and rival tricyclic antidepressants were discovered. Reversible MAOIs were developed in the hope that they would exert efficacy in depressive disorders but with less of the toxicity of the older irreversible compounds; moclobemide's discovery and marketing brought the renewed interest in MAOIs due to an absence of dangerous tyramine food interactions and potent antidepressant effects. In 1992 moclobemide was launched onto the world markets. Moclobemide was the first reversible MAO-A inhibitor to be widely marketed Moclobemide as well as other newer antidepressants such as the SSRIs lead to changes in prescribing patterns and broadened the treatment options for the management of depressive disorders. When moclobemide was discovered in 1972 in Switzerland, it was first hypothesized as being an antilipaemic or antibiotic, but the screenings were negative. The search for its antidepressant qualities, based on anticholinergic tests, also proved negative and moclobemide was then suspected of being an antipsychotic before its specific and reversible MAO-A inhibition qualities were detected. After the establishment of its lack of relevant interference with tyramine pressure response, clinical trials were launched in 1977 and further trials confirmed the broad antidepressant activity of RIMAs. It was first approved in the UK and Europe as the first reversible and selective inhibitor of MAO-A and is now approved in over 50 countries worldwide. Subsequent research found that moclobemide is well tolerated in elderly patients and far superior to tricyclic antidepressants in terms of side effects, tolerability and overdose. With regard to effectiveness in the treatment of depression, moclobemide was determined to be as effective as all major antidepressant drug classes. There is no need for dietary restrictions in contrast to people on irreversible MAOIs and apart from an important interaction with other serotonergic enhancing agents such as SSRIs and pethidine, there are few serious drug interactions and because of these benefits, moclobemide became regarded as a beneficial addition to medical 'prescribing arsenal'. Additionally moclobemide was found, unlike most other antidepressants on the market, to actually improve all aspects of sexual function. It is the only reversible MAOI in use in clinical practice. The fact that moclobemide's pharmacokinetic properties are unaltered by age, that cognition is improved in the elderly, and moclobemide has low potential for food and drug interactions opened up a new avenue for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Due to a lack of financial incentive, such as the costs of conducting the necessary trials to gain approval, moclobemide is unavailable in the USA pharmaceutical market. In 2016 moclobemide was discontinued in Brazil for commercial reasons. Society and culture Brands = It is sold under many trade names worldwide.

The treaty was made in 1613. Andy Mager, Hickory Edwards, Netherlands Consul Rob de Vos, Chief Jake Edwards and Faithkeeper Oren Lyons reaffirm the Two Row treaty The Two Row Wampum Treaty, also known as Guswenta or Kaswentha and as the Tawagonshi Agreement of 1613 or the Tawagonshi Treaty, is a mutual treaty agreement, made in 1613 between representatives of the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee (or Iroquois) and representatives of the Dutch government in what is now upstate New York. The agreement is considered by the Haudenosaunee to be the basis of all of their subsequent treaties with European and North American governments, and the citizens of those nations, including the Covenant Chain treaty with the British in 1677 and the Treaty of Canandaigua with the United States in 1794. The treaty is spiritually and culturally revered and widely accepted among the Indigenous peoples in the relevant territories, and documented by the wampum belts and oral tradition. However, in more recent years the authenticity of the later, written versions of the agreement have been a source of debate, with some scholarly sources maintaining that a treaty between the Dutch and the Mohawk nations did not take place or took place at a later date. In August 2013, the Journal of Early American History published a special issue dedicated to exploring the Two Row Tradition. Background At the start of the 17th century, the Iroquois Mohawk and the Mahican territory abutted in what is now known as the mid- Hudson Valley. Soon after Henry Hudson's 1609 exploration of what is now known as the Hudson River and its estuary, traders from the United Provinces of the Netherlands set up factorijs (trading posts) to engage in the fur trade, exploiting for extractive purposes the trade networks that had existed for millennia. The Dutch traded with the indigenous populations to supply fur pelts particularly from beaver, which were abundant in the region. By 1614, the New Netherland Company was established and Fort Nassau was built, setting the stage for the development of the colony of New Netherland. Kaswentha According to Jon Parmenter:Jon Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha and the Two Row Wampum Belt in Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) History: Can Indigenous Oral Tradition be Reconciled with the Documentary Record?\\". Journal of Early American History 3, 82–109, at p. 83–84. http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18770703-00301005. > Kaswentha may best be understood as a Haudenosaunee term embodying the > ongoing negotiation of their relationship to European colonizers and their > descendants; the underlying concept of kaswentha emphasizes the distinct > identity of the two peoples and a mutual engagement to coexist in peace > without interference in the affairs of the other.

The treaty \\"Contemporary Haudenosaunee oral tradition identifies the original elaboration of kaswentha relations between Iroquois nations and Europeans with a circa 1613 agreement negotiated between Mohawks and a Dutch trader named Jacob Eelckens at Tawagonshi, as a precursor to the formal establishment of Dutch Fort Nassau at nearby Normans Kill.\\"Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 84. According to Parmenter, \\"Dating of the original agreement prior to circa 1620 finds support in [a] 1701 recitation, in which Haudenosaunee delegates described their original agreement with the Dutch occurring 'above eighty years' prior to that date, and in 1744 Onondaga headman Canasatego dated the origin of the relationship to \\"above One Hundred Years Ago'.\\"Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 89. Parmenter has investigated the extent to which Haudenosaunee oral tradition is corroborated by surviving documentary (written) records and found that \\"the documentary evidence, considered in the aggregate, reveals a striking degree of consistency over time in the expression of fundamental principles of the kaswentha tradition by Haudenosaunee speakers\\", with \\"the fullest single written source that corroborates the early seventeenth-century origins of a kaswentha relationship between Iroquois nations and the Dutch appear[ing] in [...] 1689\\".Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", pp. 88–89. And the earliest record of Haudenosaunee speakers explicitly mentioning or reciting the kaswentha tradition before Anglo-American and French colonial audiences dates to more than 30 years before this, in 1656 (43 years after the putative origin of the treaty in 1613).Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 88. While the evidence that the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch entered into some kind of political or economic agreement in the early seventeenth century is overwhelming, some historians have found reasons to be cautious about assuming the nature of that agreement was formal and treaty-like. The Dutch, for example, may not have recognized their agreement with the Haudenosaunee as a \\"treaty\\" in the way that Haudenosaunee tradition remembers it, and may instead have seen their agreement as something less official and more contingent. Mark Meuwese has examined the history of Dutch-Indigenous relations in Africa and Brazil and found that, before 1621, \\"Dutch traders did not conclude treaties with Native peoples in the Atlantic world. Various agreements and alliances were made, but these took place only when specific factors were involved — the threat of Iberian intervention and the presence of centralized political orders among Indigenous peoples, factors that were not present in North America.\\"Mark Meuwese (2013), \\"The States General and the Stadholder: Dutch Diplomatic Practices in the Atlantic World before the West India Company Author\\", Journal of Early American History 3(1), 43–58; quotation from Paul Otto and Jaap Jacobs (2013), \\"Introduction: Historians and the public debate about the past\\", Journal of Early American History 3(1), 1–8, at p. 5.

On the other hand, there is good reason to believe that Dutch traders and local Native people would have made some sort of agreement as indicated by the Dutch building of the Fort Nassau on native lands and the Kleyntjen affair.\\"Jaap Jacobs (2013), \\"Early Dutch Explorations in North America, Journal of Early American History 3(1), 59–81; quotation from Otto and Jacobs (2013), \\"Introduction\\", p. 5. Jacobs concludes (along with Paul Otto) thatOtto and Jacobs (2013), \\"Introduction\\", p. 6. > whatever agreements or negotiations traders such as Jacob Eelkens and > Hendrick Christiansen may have made with Native peoples, these could not be > construed, at least in European terms, as diplomatic treaties between > sovereign nations. [... This] does not, however, discredit the tradition of > an agreement between Dutch and Iroquois representatives that would later > became the basis for Anglo-British and then American negotiations with the > Iroquois.

The claim that 2013 is the four-hundredth > anniversary of a first covenant is therefore not corroborated by historical > research. However, after the 1621 establishment of the West India Company > and particularly after the end of the Mohawk-Mahican War four years later, > the context for such an enduring agreement is far more probable. Nevertheless, Haudenosaunee tradition records not only the existence of a treaty, but its specific meaning, in the form of a Haudenosaunee reply to the initial Dutch treaty proposal: > You say that you are our Father and I am your Son. We say 'We will not be > like Father and Son, but like Brothers.' This wampum belt confirms our > words. [...] Neither of us will make compulsory laws or interfere in the > internal affairs of the other. Neither of us will try to steer the other's > vessel. The treaty is considered by Haudenosaunee people to still be in effect. The Haudenosaunee tradition states: > As long as the Sun shines upon this Earth, that is how long our Agreement > will stand; Second, as long as the Water still flows; and Third, as long as > the Grass Grows Green at a certain time of the year. Now we have Symbolized > this Agreement and it shall be binding forever as long as Mother Earth is > still in motion. The Wampum Belt(s) Wampum belts of the two-row style are merely one of many methods of representing in physical form the diplomatic and economic agreements implicit in the kaswentha relationship. There is clear evidence of Haudenosaunee use of wampum for diplomatic functions during the pre-contact period,Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 92 with n. 19. while the post-contact period saw \\"increasing significance of wampum as a material form to facilitate communication across cultural boundaries\\".Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 93. Early evidence for wampum in the region indicates that the dominant style was a relatively simple, monochrome design, often with discoidal beads strung together (rather than tubular beads woven together). Historians debate whether or not the technology required to construct the sophisticated two-row style wampum belt (including, most importantly, tubular purple beads) was available to communities in the region prior to 1613;Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 92. however, Parmenter indicates that archeological evidence does not rule out the possibility that two-row wampum belts may have featured in the initial treaty negotiations between the Dutch and the Haudenosaunee.Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", pp. 92–93. The significance of the two-row style of wampum, according to Parmenter, is that it captures the original \\"ship and canoe\\" metaphor present in the Haudenosaunee understanding of the kaswentha relationship. Parmenter explains how this \\"ship and canoe\\" metaphor is one of many \\"media\\" by which the Haudenosaunee have represented pictorially their relationship to European newcomers over the centuries, with other media including \\"a piece of tree bark or rope\\" and (later) images of an iron chain and, eventually, a burnished silver and/or covenant chain.Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 89; Parmenter here suggesting there has been an evolution in representation from bark/rope > chain > burnished silver covenant chain, doubtless in part as a consequence of European participation in the practice of commodified representation of the Kaswentha relationship. But of these, it is the \\"ship and canoe\\" conception of the kaswentha relationship that is the deepest and most significant, and it is the two-row wampum that is understood to represent this conception most powerfully, with two rows of purple wampum beads against a background of white beads, each row representing a parallel river, down which the respective vessels of each people travel, independently but in mutual support of each other. The question of what materials — wampum or otherwise — were exchanged at the initial negotiations of the treaty cannot be answered definitively. While it is possible that a two-row wampum belt featured in the initial treaty negotiations, there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. There is, however, evidence in the form of Haudenosaunee oral tradition that wampum belts featured, if not in the original negotiations, then at least in the earliest rituals of renewal (of which there were many) between the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch (later the British). According to Parmenter:Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 90. > Three of the Haudenosaunee recitations (1656, 1722, and 1744) associate the > agreement directly with wampum belts, and Johnson punctuated his 1748 > recitation with a \\"large Belt of Wampum\\". Exchanges of wampum belts also > occurred commonly in association with renewals of the alliance at treaty > negotiations in which neither Iroquois nor New York authorities were > recorded making explicit recitations of the kaswentha tradition. On two such > occasions the sources refer to a \\"Chain Belt,\\" but no documented example > provides a specific correlation with a Two Row-patterned belt. While most of the earliest recorded recitations of the kaswentha relationship between the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch do not mention wampum belts specifically, descriptions \\"of wampum belts in documentary sources, particularly from the early period of contact, are notoriously vague.\\" Moreover, as artifacts wampum belts were extremely prone to deterioration and disassembly,Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 91. so there is no expectation that early belts should have survived had they in fact been exchanged in the early seventeenth century. In any event, by 1870 the image of the two-row wampum belt had come to symbolize for the Haudenosaunee their ongoing treaty and kaswentha relationship with the Dutch crown.Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", p. 94. > Beyond the direct evidence represented by the recitations, additional > documentary sources amplify our confidence in the deep roots of the > fundamental concepts of the kaswentha relationship: its beginnings in the > early decades of the seventeenth century, its rhetorical framing in terms of > an \\"iron chain\\" forged and renewed with the Dutch prior to 1664, and its > early association with the \\"ship and canoe\\" discourse present in the > explicit \\"Two Row\\" articulations of the tradition that appear after circa > 1870. It is important to point out that the while the language of the > \\"chain\\" connecting the two peoples persisted in recitations of the tradition > over time, it never supplanted the \\"ship and canoe\\" language characteristic > of Haudenosaunee understandings of kaswentha. As illustrated in the > recitations [...], the idea of a rope, and later a \\"chain\\" of iron, then > silver represented a critical component of the tradition that bound the two > peoples together in friendship as a necessary precursor to the kind of > relationship embodied by two vessels travelling along a parallel route. The > latter idea, in other words, related to the former concept – the two were > neither incompatible nor mutually exclusive. Diana Muir Appelbaum has written that: > there is no evidence that such a thing as an \\"original\\" two-row wampum belt > ever existed. Nor is there any evidence of the existence of a 1613 treaty > beyond a claim traceable to a document forged in the 1960s by a historian > who collected and wrote about old manuscripts. Indeed, no documentary evidence (including wampum, which is very fragile) survive from the original treaty negotiations of 1613. But, as Parmenter points out:Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha\\", pp. 93, 98. > Evidence of Haudenosaunee and European recitations of the kaswentha > tradition indicates clearly that the remarkable durability over time of > ideas associated with a Two Row relationship does not depend on the > legitimacy of a single document and that Haudenosaunee and contemporary > Europeans \\"verbalized\\" these ideas long before the late nineteenth century. > [...] Kaswentha relations were not static – they evolved over time as ties > between the Iroquois and the Dutch (and the latter's English and American > successors) deepened and sociopolitical circumstances grew more complex – > but they did exist.

Oral tradition Onondaga leaders state that the oral tradition which accompanies the wampum belts is evidence that an agreement was made in 1613. Andy Mager of the Syracuse Peace Council was quoted in The Post-Standard as saying “We believe the Haudenosaunee oral history of the treaty...We believe the basic outlines of a treaty and that a treaty was negotiated between representatives of the Dutch and the Haudenosaunee in or around 1613.” Interpretations of the treaty Oren Lyons describes the Two Row Treaty at the United Nations, August 9, 2013 The Netherlands have been called upon as allies by Haudenosaunee in international affairs, notably at the League of Nations in 1923 in a conflict with Canada over membership and at the United Nations in 1977, requesting the Haudenosaunee passport to be honored internationally. The Dutch government honored the passport until 2010. It remains unclear if the policy will be changed in recognition of the 400th anniversary of the treaty. In September 2013, three Haudenosaunee leaders traveled to the Netherlands for an official visit in recognition of the anniversary, traveling on Haudenosaunee passports.\\"Netherlands celebrates ties with Iroquois\\" Two Row Times, November 2, 2013Deer, Kenneth \\"Haudenosaunee Renew Two Row Wampum With Dutch\\" Indian Country Today, October 6, 2013 The Two Row Wampum continues to play a role in defining the relationship between citizens of New York State and Haudenosaunee residents of the region. In 2006, a dispute over whether Onondaga Nation students could be permitted to wear native regalia at their graduation ceremony at Lafayette High School in LaFayette, New York, was resolved in part through the school board's consideration and application of the principles of the Two Row Wampum. Larger disputes concerning extant treaties based on the Two Row Wampum, such as the Treaty of Canandaigua, remain unresolved through litigation and pending land claims. The Two Row Treaty contradicts the 15th Century Doctrine of Discovery, which decreed that Christian European nations could seize lands of non- Christian peoples whom they encountered in the New World. Modern legal rulings, including a 2005 decision by the US Supreme Court against Haudenosaunee plaintiffs, continue to hinge on that doctrine, and Two Row Treaty supporters promote the treaty as a legal standard to replace it.Brown, Stephen Rex \\"Native Americans to new Pope: Recant the ‘Discovery Doctrine,’ which gave Catholics dominion over New World\\", New York Daily News, March 13, 2013Venables, Robert, \\"An Analysis of the 1613 Tawagonshi Treaty\\", 2012. Supporters of the Two Row Wampum Treaty note that it conveys a respect for the laws of nature and thus an obligation for ecological stewardship. The treaty has been cited as an inspiration to clean up polluted waters such as Onondaga Lake and the Mohawk River. “Water is sacred, like all parts of creation,” said Freida Jacques, an Onondaga Clanmother. “All life relies on it. It has a sacred duty, given to it by the Creator, to give all creation clean, fresh water.” Gadoua, Renee K. \\"Anniversary recalls water as sacred source of life\\" Washington Post, July 31, 2013 Tawagonshi document The Tawagonshi document. New York State Library/Manuscripts and Special Collections, L.G. van Loon Collection (SC16677) The existence of an alleged written version of the treaty was first made public in an article in 1968 by documents collector L.G. van Loon. He claimed to have acquired it from an unnamed person on the Mississaugua reserve in Canada. In 1987, academics Charles Gehring, William Starna, and William Fenton published an article in the New York History journal entitled “The Tawagonshi Treaty of 1613: The Final Chapter.\\" Their theory is that this written version is a forgery because it contains what they argue are grammatical anachronisms; that a blend of handwriting styles from the 17th and 20th centuries is used; that the names of villages and not chiefs are used; and that the writing is \\"too smooth\\" to be made by a 17th-century quill pen. Herkens writes that the document contains c. 40 grammatical anachronisms, and that on grammatical grounds it is likely that the text was written in the 20th century. Given that Van Loon forged other pieces from the same period, they point to him as the most probable forger.Sijs, Nicolien van der (2009) Cookies, coleslaw, and Stoops. The influence of Dutch on the North American languages Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, pp.22-23 In 2013, linguistic experts Harrie Hermkens, Jan Noordegraaf, and Nicoline van der Sijs submitted the document to further linguistic and historical analysis, including its provenance and connection to Lawrence G. Van Loon. They also found the document to contain \\"a significant number of anachronisms making it impossible for the text to have originated in 1613. Nor is it possible that it is a later copy of a document since lost.\\"Harrie Hermkens, Jan Noordegraaf, and Nicoline van der Sijs (2013), The Tawagonshi Tale: Can Linguistic Analysis Prove the Tawagonshi Treaty to be a Forgery? Journal of Early American History 3(1), 9–42; quotation from Otto and Jacobs (2013), \\"Introduction\\", p. 4. Robert Venables, a retired Cornell University professor, is among those who remain convinced that the document version is also valid, and concurs with other scholars who point out that any inconsistencies in language and pen strokes can be explained by the fact that it was copied by hand years after 1613. The document was given to the Onondagas and remains near Syracuse, New York. 400th Anniversary Celebration First paddlers arrive at Kanatsiohareke, with Sakokwenionkwas Tom Porter, July 2013 In July and August 2013, hundreds of Native Americans and their allies took part in a river journey to recognize and renew the Two Row Wampum Treaty. Canoeing and kayaking across New York State, the participants called attention to the treaty and its significance for native land rights and environmental protection. The paddlers traveled from Onondaga, birthplace of the Haudenosaunee league, along the Mohawk and Hudson rivers to New York City, ending at a special session at the United Nations. The anniversary journey brought world attention to the Two Row Treaty.\\"Indianen vieren 400-jarig verdrag met Nederlanders\\" RTL News, AmsterdamTaub, Julian \\"The Iroquois are not Giving Up\\" Atlantic Magazine, August 13, 2013 Organized by the Onondaga Nation and Neighbors of the Onondaga Nation (NOON), the renewal journey covered over 300 miles, with public events at sites including Kanatsiohareke Mohawk Community, Albany, Poughkeepsie, and Beacon NY, where Native leaders and public officials discussed the treaty and its bearing on current issues. On August 9, the paddlers arrived in New York City to attend a UN session for Indigenous Peoples Day with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and member state representatives. At the session, UN officials underscored the UN’s role as a peacemaker, negotiator, and advocate for treaty rights. Oren Lyons, a diplomat from the Onondaga Turtle Clan, described the Two Row Treaty as the foundation for all Haudenosaunee treaties, many since broken by New York State, the US and Canada. UN representatives from Panama and Bolivia described their work to restore land to native ownership and protection. The UN Secretary for Human Rights outlined the UN’s goal to redress treaty violations, treat them as human rights violations, and help enforce treaties like the Two Row in the future.Fox, Katsitsionni \\"Two Row Wampum Renewal Campaign Completes Journey to United Nations\\" Indian Time, August 22, 2013Gorgen, Paul \\"Canoe Journey helps Renew the Two Row Wampum Treaty\\" Vassar Miscellany News, February 14, 2014\\"Indigenous canoe trip celebrating 400-year-old peace treaty culminates with UN event\\" United Nations News Centre, August 9, 2013 See also *Ganienkeh *Hendrick Christiaensen *Mohawk Dutch *Normans Kill *Sewant ReferencesFurther reading *Jon Parmenter (2013). \\"The Meaning of Kaswentha and the Two Row Wampum Belt in Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) History: Can Indigenous Oral Tradition be Reconciled with the Documentary Record?\\".

Pugh (1981) Concept selection: a method that works. In: Hubka, V. (ed.), Review of design methodology. Proceedings international conference on engineering design, March 1981, Rome. Zürich: Heurista, 1981, blz. 497 – 506., is a qualitative technique used to rank the multi-dimensional options of an option set. It is frequently used in engineering for making design decisions but can also be used to rank investment options, vendor options, product options or any other set of multidimensional entities. A basic decision matrix consists of establishing a set of criteria options which are scored and summed to gain a total score which can then be ranked. Importantly, it is not weighted to allow a quick selection process. A weighted decision matrix operates in the same way as the basic decision matrix but introduces the concept of weighting the criteria in order of importance. The resultant scores better reflect the importance to the decision maker of the criteria involved. The more important the criteria the higher the weighting it should be given. Each of the potential options are scored and also multiplied by the weighting given to each of the criteria in order to produce a result. The advantage of the decision-making matrix is that subjective opinions about one alternative versus another can be made more objective. Another advantage of this method is that sensitivity studies can be performed. An example of this might be to see how much your opinion would have to change in order for a lower ranked alternative to outrank a competing alternative. However, there are some important disadvantages of the Decision-matrix method: * The list of criteria options is arbitrary. There is no way to know a priori if the list is complete; it is likely that important criteria are missing. * Conversely, it is possible that less important criteria are included, causing decision makers to be distracted and biased in their choice of options. * Scoring methods, even with weighting, tend to equalize all the requirements. But a few requirements are \\"must haves\\". If enough minor criteria are listed, it is possible for them to add up and select an option that misses a \\"must have\\" requirement. * The values assigned to each option are guesses, not based on any quantitative measurements. In fact the entire decision matrix can create the impression of being scientific, even though it requires no quantitative measurements of anything at all. Morphological analysis is another form of a decision matrix employing a multi-dimensional configuration space linked by way of logical relationships.

Its state-level conservation status is \\"Species of Special Concern\\".This article has been taken directly from a 2003 public domain report published by the California Department of Fish and Game. Description A medium-sized (53–108 cm total length) snake with a distinctive sequence of red, black, and white rings (tricolor dyads: Savage and Slowinski 1990; these are similar, but yet different from the triads of Zweifel 1952b) in which relatively narrow white rings are always bordered by black rings, and red coloration, which can occur as rings or bands, borders alternate black rings (Zweifel 1952b; pers. observ.). Occasional aberrant patterns can be found in which rings are lacking (see Figure 2 in McGurty 1988). The number of tricolor dyads on the body (except the tail) ranges from 27 to 38, and between 15% and 100% of the red rings between body dyads are complete (Zweifel 1952b). The snout is jet black and the iris is very dark brown (B. McGurty, pers. comm.). Citations in this page need to be referenced in the Source list below. Taxonomic remarks The taxonomic remarks made for Lampropeltis zonata parvirubra also apply to this taxon, namely: \\"This taxon has not been reexamined since Zweifel (1952b) described the races of Lampropeltis zonata. Diagnosis of L. zonata parvirubra is problematic because allocation of individuals to this taxon requires using a combination of several characters simultaneously that individually overlap considerably in variation with other races of L. zonata. Biochemical analyses coupled to more extensive morphological analyses are needed to better understand the systematic status of this taxon. Since individuals of L. z. parvirubra are difficult to obtain (captive snakes notwithstanding), novel techniques such as DNA extraction from preserved specimens will almost certainly be needed to help resolve this problem. DNA analysis was performed on this taxon in 1999 (Rodriguez-Robles, Javier, et al. 1999) and the interpretation of the authors suggests that L. z. pulchra and L. z. parvirubra belong within the same subspecies, and merely represent a clinal variation in pattern from south to north within the range. Interpretation of this taxon as a full species (Collins 1991) is unjustified and awaits the aforementioned analyses.\\" Distribution This California endemic occurs in the Santa Monica Mountains (Los Angeles County); Santa Ana Mountains (Orange and Riverside Counties); Santa Rosa Mountains (Riverside County); and Corte Madera, Cuyamaca, Hot Springs, Laguna, and Palomar Mountain (San Diego County)(McGurty 1988; Figure 44). In reality, this snake is probably present on all mountains in San Diego County above 4,000 feet elevation, or which support proper habitat (Hubbs, 2004). Its elevation range extends from near sea level to ca. 1800 m (Palomar Mountain, San Diego County). Two early specimens (SDSNH 9930, USNM 13889) and three post-1960 records (B. McGurty, pers. comm.) from western San Diego County suggest the possibility of native populations of this taxon near the coast. However, the latter records have remained unverified and the former may represent mislabeled specimens or escaped or released pets (B. McGurty, pers. comm.). Life history Lampropeltis zonata pulchra is an infrequently observed, secretive, cryptozooic snake, the life history of which is still only partly understood. The San Diego mountain kingsnake typically emerges from overwintering sites in March and may remain near-surface active through November, but it is particularly conspicuous near the surface from roughly mid-March to mid-May (Klauber 1931, McGurty 1988, Hubbs 2004), during which time it is active during the warmer daylight hours (pers. observ.). Later in the season, it may be active after dark, which is probably related to the fact that, like most snakes, it has a relatively low temperature preferendum and a relatively low critical thermal maximum (42.5 °C: data provided for L. zonata, subspecies not specified; Brattstrom 1965). Based on wild-caught captive individuals, mating probably takes place in May and eggs are usually laid in June or early July (McGurty 1988; pers. observ.). Females lay 4-9 moderate-sized (averages 36 mm long x 16 mm wide), bone white, leathery-shelled eggs that if similar to eggs incubated in captivity, require at least 2 months to develop before hatching (McGurty 1988). Hatchlings are usually first observed between late August and early October (pers. observ.). The time required to reach reproductive maturity in the field is unknown, but captive L. z. pulchra required 4–5 years to reach sexual maturity (McGurty 1988). If captive longevity records for other races of this species are any indication (see Bowler 1977), San Diego mountain kingsnakes may be relatively long-lived. Indications exist that L. z. pulchra may be highly philopatric, consistently using local patches of suitable habitat (McGurty 1988), but the movement patterns of this taxon are largely unknown. In most areas this snake is much more extant than previously believed, and not restricted to rock outcrops. It lives underground, and has been found in rock-less areas utilizing stumps, logs, and artificial cover, such as old boards, tins, concrete, asphalt chunks, and even trash. The only ingredients needed to sustain a population of L. z. pulchra are prey and shelter (Hubbs, 2004). This taxon is also probably primarily saurophagous, and only western fence lizards and Western Skinks have been recorded as having been eaten by San Diego mountain kingsnakes, but prey similar to other subspecies of L. zonata are probably also taken (Newton and Smith 1975, McGurty 1988). Habitat In the interior mountain ranges, Lampropeltis zonata pulchra occurs primarily in associations of ponderosa, Jeffrey, and Coulter pine, and black oak, and is infrequently found below the coniferous forest associations (Zweifel 1952b, McGurty 1988; pers. observ.), however, the snakes will also follow riparian corridors to lower elevations, such as Oak Grove campground in San Diego County (Hubbs, 2004). At lower elevations and in coastal ranges, it occurs below the edge of mixed oak-coniferous forest in riparian woodlands, usually in canyon bottoms, that have western sycamore (Platanus racemosa), Fremont's cottonwood, coast live oak, willows, wild rose (Rosa spp.), and blackberries. It may be found in narrow riparian woodlands in association with chaparral and coastal sage vegetation types (pers. observ.; see McGurty 1988). Rocks or rocky outcrops appear to be only one element of L. z. pulchra habitat (Hubbs, 2004), probably because they provide suitable refuge sites and they harbor the necessary food resources. Such locations may also provide overwintering sites, however, L. z. pulchra can also be found on chaparral covered hillsides in the Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Ana Mountains, and all other mountainous habitat they occupy, far from any rock. The snakes live underground in all areas, and those lacking rocky cover simply utilize rodent burrows for refuge (Hubbs, 2004). Status California state status: \\"Special Concern\\" This snake continues to be highly prized among collectors (S. Barry, R. Fisher, and B. McGurty, pers. comm.) despite prohibitions on collecting or selling it in California (Nicola 1981, California Fish and Game Commission 1990). The only individuals that can be possessed are those that were in possession of their owners prior to when the prohibition on collection regulations were implemented. Currently, this taxon is mentioned for sale in some reptile fancier lists at $250.00 per snake (pers. observ.); such a demand undoubtedly fuels a black market trade for this taxon among collectors. In addition, McGurty (1988) provided data for a single locality in San Diego County suggesting a local decline in L. z. pulchra that he attributes to overcollecting of this taxon. Since no obvious habitat change has occurred at this site (B. McGurty, pers. comm.), the interpretation McGurty provided may be correct. McGurty (1988) also cites the destruction of local habitat by overzealous collectors (the dismantling of outcrops and the shredding of logs and stumps), especially in San Diego County, as reasons for this taxon's decline (see also Newton and Smith 1975). Rock-chipping for this taxon as well as for selected lizards was a problem that was recognized over 15 years ago, and continues to be a problem in certain local areas despite the fact that altering habitat in this way is prohibited under current regulations by both State and Federal land management and resource agencies. Illegal fuelwood harvesting also adds to the problem of habitat alteration (McGurty 1988). While McGurty (1988) pointed out a problem with caprock removal and other forms of \\"rock-chipping,\\" it is now known that those alterations did not affect the survival of the snakes. Currently, L. z. pulchra continues to be found in those areas of alteration, even utilizing the disturbed rocks, which now lie on the ground and create additional (if different) places for thermo- regulation (Hubbs, 2004). Today, McGurty (pers. comm.) admits that the rocks are not central to the survival of the species, but merely a convenient place for thermo-regulation. When small rock structure is absent, the snakes simply thermo-regulate in burrows or under rocks that are too large to move. Despite the illegal collection of up to a hundred individuals of this taxon in San Diego County each year, the sheer abundance of this snake in that area (Hubbs, 2004 estimates 15,000 individuals within the favored collecting area alone) and the small number of optimum days for such collection (approximately 10 - 15 per year) has allowed for a continued population to exist and thrive. Those who have monitored the area for over 20 years (since the original commercial collection took place in the 1970s) have seen no significant depletion in snakes, however there has actually been a small increase in numbers (Hubbs, 2004). While certain, easily collected sites exist in San Diego County, the vast majority of this snake's range and habitat are unaffected by collectors due to different habitat makeup (i.e. chaparral, coastal sage, sandstone, oak- woodland, and large riparian zones with little searchable habitat). The current estimate is that nearly 2,000,000 of these snakes exist within all the habitat they occupy in southern California, and in light of the DNA analysis by Rodriguez-Robles (1999) which lumps L. z. pulchra with L. z. parvirubra, the probable population exceeds 5 million snakes. Most of those serpents live within terrain that is roadless and inaccessible to collectors. Therefore, the protection of this taxon based on fears of over-collection is unfounded (Hubbs, 2004). A better system would be to protect the two populations in San Diego County that are at greatest risk from over-collection, or place a small bag-limit on the subspecies and encourage captive-breeding by hobbyists to supply those who wish to own L. z. pulchra. This would remove the need for illegal collection of wild snakes, and quickly reduce the value of the serpents as more and more become available in the form of captive-bred offspring. That program has worked well for the Rosy Boa and California Kingsnake (Hubbs, 2004).

He was the oldest of four children born to Plumie and Rethie Rudolph. His siblings included Lewis Rudolph, who would later help found Krispy Kreme. As he grew older, Vernon Rudolph began to help in the general store that his uncle owned. =Career= When he graduated high school, he went to Paducah, Kentucky with his uncle. In 1933, Rudolph's uncle bought a doughnut shop and recipe for yeast-raised donuts from a French federal employee and chef named Joe LeBeau. This all occurred during the middle of the Great Depression, so they moved to Nashville, Tennessee to see if they could get better business there and secure their financial future. Things did not work out for them in Nashville, so they moved back to Kentucky where Rudolph's uncle sold his business to his brother, Rudolph's father. His son, Lewis, started working for the shop. In 1936. his father opened another shop in Charleston, West Virginia and a few years later, a third shop in Atlanta, Georgia. In the summer of 1937, determined to own his own Krispy Kreme shop, Rudolph decided to move to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, home to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, as he was smoking a Camel cigarette. He rented a building across from Salem College and Academy, and on July 13, 1937, using that original recipe. His first customers were local grocery stores, but people began to stop by the store asking if they could buy hot doughnuts. In the 1940s, he sold franchises and in 1947, he founded the Krispy Kreme Corporation, becoming Chairman and President. =Personal life= In 1939, he married Ruth Ayers, who was from Atlanta, Georgia. They adopted a baby girl, Patricia Ann, in 1943. In 1944, his wife died in a car accident in Orangeburg, South Carolina. In 1946, he got married again, to Lorraine Flynt of Winston- Salem, NC. They had four children, Vernon Carver Jr., Sanford, Curtis, and Beverly.

Population: 81,000 (1972); 8,076 (1897). History Kolpino was founded in 1722 and was granted town status in 1912. It was one of the chief ironworks of the crown in Russia. Kolpino was also home to an iron foundry of the Russian Admiralty. A sacred image of St. Nicholas in the Trinity Church is visited by numerous pilgrims on May 22 every year. With the onset of the Great Patriotic War, Kolpino factory workers formed Izhora Battalion, part of the militia, August 24 – September 4, 1941. The front line was held in the immediate vicinity of the plant, which was subjected to heavy enemy shelling. By 1944, only 327 of Kolpino's 2183 houses remained intact. 140,939 shells and 436 aerial bombs fell in Kolpino's neighborhoods and boulevards. According to incomplete data for the war, shelling and starvation in the Kolpino district killed 4,600 people, not counting the dead on the front. By January 1, 1944 Kolpino had only 2196 inhabitants. After the lifting of the siege, people gradually came back from the evacuation and from the army. On January 1, 1945 population was 7404, the beginning of next year – 8914 people. During the construction of a new residential building, a mass grave was discovered in Kolpino. 888 soldiers and officers of the Red Army were buried in the mass grave in that cemetery.

He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1745. The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Kamchatka is named in his honour.  Early life  Krasheninnikov was educated in the Slavic Greek Latin Academy of Moscow (1724–32), where Lomonosov was his class-mate. As part of Vitus Bering’s extensive preparations for the Second Kamchatka Expedition, 12 students from the academy were selected as potential student interns or assistants for the professors – Krasheninnikov being one of them. Thus, he furthered his education in St Petersburg before embarking upon the Second Kamchatka Expedition (1731-42).  The Second Kamchatka Expedition  Krasheninnikov was to study plants, animals and minerals, but in addition he developed a strong interest in Siberian history and geography. During the early part of the expedition, he accompanied professor Gmelin on the travel through the Urals and western Siberia to Yeniseysk. He made numerous observations of natural history, ethnology and linguistics, e.g. records of Evenki (tungus) and Buryat vocabulary. From Bering’s headquarters at Yakutsk, the expedition professors Gmelin and Gerhard Friedrich Müller sent Krasheninnikov ahead to Okhotsk and Kamchatka to build house and make preliminary observations. Thus, he became the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the peninsula. He published his observations in 1755 (\\"Описание земли Камчатки\\"; English translation by James Grieve (1764) as History of Kamtschatka). However, he drew extensively on the manuscripts of the deceased Georg Wilhelm Steller. Apart from detailed accounts of the plants and animals of the region, there also were reports on the language and culture of the indigenous Itelmen and Koryak peoples, with whom he is said to have got along extremely well. \\"Volcanoes on Kamtchatka. From: Описание земли Камчатки, St Petersburg 1755.\\"  Later life  Krasheninnikov spent ten years on the Second Kamchatka Expedition. On his return to St Petersburg, he wrote and defended his doctoral thesis on ichthyology in 1745. He was appointed adjunct at the Academy of Sciences, and later head of the Academy's Botanic Garden and professor of natural history at the university. He was one of only 26 Russians to become Academy members in the 18th century. In 1752, Krasheninnikov went on his last expedition to the tracts of Lake Ladoga and Novgorod to investigate the flora. He died before being able to publish his observations, which instead were published by David de Gorter. \\"Stepan Krasheninnikov, St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, Professor of botany and natural history.\\"  Plant species named for S.

The programme was produced for Granada Television and ran from September 1988 until December 1992 on ITV's Night Network. Background The programme presented a taste of late-night clubbing, with long segments showing crowds dancing to popular hits, occasional celebrity performances, and party games, with Waterman and Strachan acting as masters of ceremony. The show toured various nightclubs. The first show came from Mr Smiths in Warrington on 3 September 1988, and the final show aired on 5 December 1992 from The Discothèque Royale in Manchester. The programme was often recorded on a Saturday night, edited on-the-fly, and shown a few hours later in the early hours of Sunday morning, the second half of the Saturday/Sunday version being repeated during the following night. The earlier shows were split into two halves: the first at 1am and the second at 4am, with the LWT's Night Network magazine show sandwiched in between. During 1988, The Hitman and Her was moved to 2am in some areas, while London still broadcast the show at 4am. The Hitman and Her remained at the 2am slot from April 1989 until its very last broadcast. A special edition of The Hitman and Her was broadcast as part of the ITV Telethon in 1992. Clubbers would arrive at the featured club hoping to appear on television. Often members of the crowd would be plucked out to participate in games such as \\"Pass The Mic!\\", \\"Showing Out\\", and \\"Clothes Swap\\". It was produced for Granada Television at first by Music Box Productions, then by Granada TV itself, and later by Clear Idea Productions through to the final edition. In I Love 1988, Pete Waterman said that the idea for The Hitman and Her came to him when he turned on the TV late one night and the only TV station still on-air was featuring guest Elvis Costello talking about Irish politics. Music The theme tune, \\"Cocoon\\", was performed by Timerider, a pseudonym of the German singer Fancy. The track also appeared in the film The Fruit Machine, and Waterman also used it as the signature tune for his Saturday morning Radio City show. It is still today used as the theme tune for Barnsley F.C. and is played as the team comes out onto the pitch at every home game. Latterly, the show's theme tune changed to \\"Rofo's theme\\" by Rofo. The show acted as both an outlet to showcase artists from the PWL stable – such as Kylie Minogue, 2 Unlimited, Anticapella, and Opus III, as well as featuring the key club tunes from the day – largely as a result of Waterman's interest in the fledgling acid house scene. Speaking to The Guardian in November 2013, Waterman explained \\"I loved acid house and trance. I just absolutely adored it.\\" One track the show championed in particular was Stakker Humanoid by Brian Dougans, which Waterman described as \\"a Hitman and Her tune\\". In April 1992, The Hitman and Her hosted a special show at the rave night Energy from The Eclipse, Coventry. Strachan would memorably comment that \\"It's too hot ... they've all got eyes like saucers...\\". Stage dancers Clive Donaldson was the resident dancer. Jason Orange was invited to join Take That after appearing as a regular dancer, and former dancers Jimmy Constable and Spike Dawbarn would go on to be members of the boy band 911.

The apparent power equals the product of root-mean-square (RMS) voltage and RMS current.Ciletti, M. D., Irwin, J. D., Kraus, A. D., Balabanian, N., Bickard, T. A., and Chan, S. P. (1993).

Volt-amperes are useful only in the context of alternating current (AC) circuits. The volt- ampere is dimensionally equivalent to the watt (in SI units, 1 V⋅A = 1 N⋅m⋅A−1⋅s−1⋅A = 1 N⋅m⋅s−1 = 1 J⋅s−1 = 1 W). VA rating is most useful in rating wires and switches (and other power handling equipment) for inductive loads. Unit With a purely resistive load, the apparent power is equal to the real power. Where a reactive (capacitive or inductive) component is present in the load, the apparent power is greater than the real power as voltage and current are no longer in phase. In the limiting case of a purely reactive load, current is drawn but no power is dissipated in the load. Some devices, including uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), have ratings both for maximum volt-amperes and maximum watts. The VA rating is limited by the maximum permissible current, and the watt rating by the power-handling capacity of the device. When a UPS powers equipment which presents a reactive load with a low power factor, neither limit may safely be exceeded.Watt Ratings Differs From Volt Amp Ratings APC For example, a (large) UPS system rated to deliver 400,000 volt-amperes at 220 volts can deliver a current of 1818 amperes. VA ratings are also often used for transformers; maximum output current is then VA rating divided by nominal output voltage. Transformers with the same sized core usually have the same VA rating. The convention of using the volt-ampere to distinguish apparent power from real power is allowed by the SI standard.  Volt-ampere reactive  In electric power transmission and distribution, volt-ampere reactive (var) is a unit of measurement of reactive power. Reactive power exists in an AC circuit when the current and voltage are not in phase. The term var was proposed by the Romanian electrical engineer Constantin Budeanu and introduced in 1930 by the IEC in Stockholm, which has adopted it as the unit for reactive power. Special instruments called varmeters are available to measure the reactive power in a circuit. The unit \\"var\\" is allowed by the International System of Units (SI) even though the unit var is representative of a form of power.SI Brochure, 8th ed.

At the time PNC acquired RBC, it had a total of 5,000 employees with 500 located in the Raleigh area. =Dunmore Homes controversy= In November 2007, RBC Centura was involved in the \\"Dunmore Homes\\" project in Sacramento, California, that stopped all construction on August 8, 2007, due to liquidity issues with the home builder. The company was subsequently sold to a mortgage loan officer for $500 and quickly incorporated in New York. The company filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan. After details of the sale became known to RBC Centura Bank, a major Dunmore Homes creditor, the bank sued on November 7. The company alleged in a lawsuit filed in Fresno County that the sale of all the assets for a mere $500 was not adequate and was done to \\"hinder, delay and defraud the creditors,\\" including RBC. RBC financed four Dunmore projects from Bakersfield to Yuba City. It loaned Dunmore Homes a total of $105 million and, according to an affidavit by a Dunmore Homes official, is still owed $39 million. As collateral, it has secured claims against those projects. But the company says the value of a Fresno project is less than the outstanding loan balance. Nine major lenders, including RBC, are owed a combined total of $196 million on Dunmore Homes' 26 new-home communities, according to the builder. =Sale to PNC = On June 19, 2011, PNC Financial Services agreed to buy RBC Bank USA from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion. The sale of RBC Bank closed in March 2012. Upon acquisition, all RBC Bank branches were rebranded as PNC branches and the RBC Bank brand became dormant for US customers. RBC Insurance, RBC Wealth Management and RBC Investing remained subsidiaries of RBC. RBC later returned to offering retail banking services to American customers with its acquisition of Los Angeles-based City National Bank in 2015.

The team began racing in the ARCA RE/MAX Series in 2000 before moving to NASCAR in 2001. They sat out 2009 due to the recession, and have not raced since. Sprint Cup SeriesCar No. 49 history= BAM Racing attempted its first Cup race at the Talladega 500 in 2001 with Andy Hillenburg, but failed to qualify. They also attempted the Pepsi 400, Pennsylvania 500 and the Brickyard 400 with Hillenburg, as well as the Pennzoil Freedom 400 with Rich Bickle, but did not qualify for any of those races. BAM switched to Dodge for 2002, and acquired equipment from American Equipment Racing owner Buz McCall, who also provided the shop for use. The team qualified for the 2002 Daytona 500 with Shawna Robinson as its driver, who was scheduled to compete in 24 races. However, she struggled and her last race for the season was at the second Daytona race where she would finish 40th. Kevin Lepage, Stuart Kirby, Ron Hornaday, Stacy Compton and Derrike Cope would finish out the season with a best finish of 22nd at Talladega. For the 2003 season it was announced that Ken Schrader would drive the No. 49. The team was forced to run with multiple sponsors throughout the year but most of the year the car was sponsored by AT&T; through its 1-800-CALL-ATT collect call service. The team qualified for 32 races and had a best finish of 8th at Michigan. In 2004, it was announced BAM Racing had secured a deal with Schwan Food Company for multiple years. They were able to achieve a best finish of 6th during the season, had three less DNF's, and improved their average finish by two places. Schwan's and Schrader again returned for the 2005 season and BAM had its best season to date with three top tens and an average finish of 25th place. After the conclusion of the 2005 season, Ken Schrader left to join Wood Brothers/JTG Racing. For 2006, Schrader was replaced by Brent Sherman who brought along sponsorship from Serta Mattresses. Sherman was to run for the Rookie of the Year award. However, after struggling through the start of the season he was released in favor of veteran Jimmy Spencer. Spencer was also be an advisor for BAM and was a mentor for Sherman during his time there. However, Sherman's departure from the team left it unsponsored, as Serta had followed Sherman from ARCA racing to Busch Series and Cup series racing. Spencer raced from the spring Martinsville race until the spring Richmond race, when Mike Wallace took over. In May 2006, Kevin Lepage left Front Row Motorsports to take over the No. 49, before he was replaced by Mike Bliss in October. Chris Cook was hired to drive for the team to run the road course events, but failed to qualify for both events. In 2007, BAM Racing was to race with Mike Bliss as the driver, using Evernham engines, but Bliss failed to qualify for 11 out of 15 attempts, and resigned midway through the season. Chad Chaffin was the team's interim driver at Loudon and Chicagoland, and Larry Foyt racing at Daytona. In the team's first attempt to qualify after Bliss' resignation at Loudon, Chaffin made the race after Brian Vickers and the No. 83 Team Red Bull Toyota were disqualified after failing post-qualifying inspection. Journeyman road racer Klaus Graf attempted several races in the No. 49, but didn't qualify for any of them due to engine blowups and a rain shower cancelling qualifying. Bliss briefly returned for a few races, before journeyman John Andretti was hired to complete the rest of the season for BAM. John Andretti was signed to drive the full 2008 season, but the contract was nullified just days before 2008 Daytona testing to put Ken Schrader in the seat in hopes of attracting more sponsorship.Ken Schrader and the BAM team failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 and the following race at California Speedway. Schrader drove in the Budweiser Shootout, but failed to qualify for the first two races of the season.2008 Daytona 500. The team switched from Dodge to Toyota before the Goody's Cool Orange 500, along with announcing Microsoft's Small Business division as their sponsor. BAM promptly announced that they would be withdrawing from the next two races at Texas and Phoenix to refocus the team's efforts. Both the expenses of switching manufacturers and the pullout of Microsoft to Michael Waltrip Racing have forced BAM Racing to push their scheduled return further back, with NASCAR.com reporting on April 15, 2008, that the team may not return to racing until the fall. However, BAM made a minor attempt at a comeback in the Sprint All-Star Race. BAM fielded a ride for Petty Enterprises developmental driver Chad McCumbee, the car was a Dodge with sponsorship from Marathon Oil. McCumbee finished 13th. On July 11, 2008, Sports Illustrated reported that BAM Racing was in talks with Barack Obama regarding a one-race sponsorship at Pocono, through BAM spokesman Rhett Vandiver. However, Obama spokesman Bill Burton told Yahoo! Sports that the sponsorship would not happen. The team took the 2009 season off due to the economy and its unwillingness to be a start and park operation. Warner Music Nashville announced a strategic marketing alliance that gave WMN exclusive promotional opportunities with the NASCAR Sprint Cup racing team. Under the agreement, WMN artists had the opportunity to participate in branding and promotional programs at NASCAR events. The team planned to attempt a full schedule in 2010 with the new partnership and to run Toyotas. Larry the Cable Guy was to be featured on the car for the Daytona 500, with WMN artists Blake Shelton, Whitney Duncan, Gloriana, Jessica Harp, Jason Jones and James Otto joining the team for later races.http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/cup/01/07/bam.racing.vip.artists/ BAM announces additional VIP artists On January 8, the team announced it would align with Robby Gordon and his self-owned team for the 2010 season. The join contract stated that RGM/BAM would have at least one car present at each race and would jointly field Gordon's No. 7 Toyota at certain races with sponsorship from WMN. However BAM had not been seen on track since the Daytona 500, and it was later announced that the RGM/BAM partnership had dissolved and that RGM is exploring taking legal action against BAM Racing and Warner Music Nashville. The team has not been heard from since. =Car Nos. 59 and 70 history= The team fielded a second car for Klaus Graf at Infineon in 2004, the No. 59 SEM Products/Color Horizons Dodge. He finished 17th. The team attempted a number of races later in the year, but failed to qualify for all of them. Larry Foyt also attempted a number of races late in the 2004 season, instead running the No. 70 due to the system of the 2004 provisional points. The team shut down at the conclusion of the 2004 season. Before shutting down, the team was looking to run a second or even a third car in 2005 but sponsorship never materialized. =Cup Series driver history= * Andy Hillenburg (2001; DNQ for 4 races) * Rich Bickle (2001; DNQ at Homestead) * Shawna Robinson (2002; limited schedule) * Ron Hornaday (2002 Coca-Cola 600 only) * Derrike Cope (2002) * Kevin Lepage (2002 at New Hampshire in September; 2006) * Stuart Kirby (2002; Kansas only) * Stacy Compton (2002) * Ken Schrader (2003–2005; occasional starts in 2007 & 2008) * Klaus Graf (2004; Sonoma only) * Brent Sherman (2006; replaced in May) * Mike Wallace (2006; Richmond only) * Chris Cook (2006 road races) * Mike Bliss (late 2006-mid-2007) * Larry Foyt (2007) * Chad Chaffin (2007) * John Andretti (2007) * Chad McCumbee (2008 Sprint Showdown only) * David Gilliland (2010 Daytona 500 only) ARCA Re/Max SeriesCar No. 49 history= The team was created in 2000 from the remnants of the ISM Racing that was not being used by Tyler Jet Motorsports.

Merrie Melodies animated short, directed by Friz Freleng and written by Warren Foster. The short was released on August 10, 1957, and stars Tweety and Sylvester.  Plot  Sylvester is once again attempting to catch and eat Tweety, this time very nearly succeeding, only to be stopped by an erudite, mild-mannered cat (retroactively named Clarence in modern Looney Tunes comics), who explains that Sylvester's constant cravings for birds can only lead to self-destruction, and knows that the only way to overcome this weakness is to kick the bird habit for good. Clarence invites Sylvester to a meeting of \\"Birds Anonymous\\" (\\"B.A.\\"), a support group of cats, who have resolved to help one another overcome their bird addictions. Sylvester agrees to attend and hears other cats briefly tell of their own struggles and that B.A. was able to help them. Empowered by their stories, Sylvester adopts a new motto for himself: \\"Birds is strictly for the birds!\\" Back at home, it does not take long for Sylvester's new-found will power to falter, due in large part to ubiquitous temptation as he and Tweety live together. Sylvester's temptations are only exacerbated after watching a TV chef preparing a turkey, and then hearing a disc jockey on the radio mention bird-themed songs. Sylvester valiantly makes many attempts to control his urges, even handcuffing himself to an iron radiator out of the reach of Tweety, but when Tweety asks him, \\"Don't you like me anymore?\\", Sylvester finally caves, and makes another grab for the bird, but is stopped again by Clarence, who reluctantly shoots a plunger at Sylvester's mouth. When he has expressed the fear that Sylvester might be weakening, he gratefully confirms Clarence's suspicion. That night, Sylvester tries to sleep, but is tormented by insomnia and withdrawal symptoms before completely succumbs to his basic instincts, reasoning that he can quit after just \\"one little bird\\" and that \\"no one will know the difference\\", and ends up being stopped yet again when Clarence arrives and pours alum in his mouth causing it to shrink, after which Sylvester attempts to literally suck Tweety into his mouth through a straw to no avail. Sylvester collapses into sobs on the floor tearfully admitting weakness, and that since he is a pussycat he doesn't care and that it can't be helped, but is told by Clarence, who orders him to cheer up, and tells Sylvester to have no need for this illustration, and consoles him saying that birds and cats can coexist peacefully. To prove his point, Clarence asks Tweety to come here, and as Tweety does so and flies into Clarence's hand, Clarence looks at Sylvester, and tells him that he really loves birds, before he kisses Tweety's head. Unfortunately, yielding to his own long-suppressed temptation, he changes his expression, backslides, and attempts to devour Tweety himself, but misses, and goes in hot pursuit of Tweety, who flies away from him. Clarence starts laughing uncontrolably, much to Sylvester's nasty surprise. Sylvester is angry with Clarence asking him to let him go and trying to have Tweety and having to restrain him and telling him to stop it and control himself. The cartoon ends with Tweety telling the audience \\"Like I said before, once a bad ol' puddy tat, always a bad ol' puddy tat.\\"  Production notes  Birds Anonymous is a reference of 1950s melodramas about the sufferings of substance abuse and drug recovery groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. UC Berkeley Library The voice of the B.A. cat is similar to that of Marvin the Martian, the creation of Chuck Jones. The voice of the second B.A. Cat was used by Blanc for the love-bird in Life With Feathers, among other places. The premise was later adapted into The Last Hungry Cat, again with Sylvester struggling against his conscience over Tweety.  Honors  Birds Anonymous won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1958,BCDB beating Tabasco Road starring Speedy Gonzales;Short Subject Winners: 1958 Oscars both shorts were eventually given Blue Ribbon reissues in 1961. When Eddie Selzer died, the statuette was passed on to Mel Blanc, who said that this was his favorite cartoon to do voices for, especially when it came to Sylvester.

Samoan Americans are Pacific Islanders in the United States Census, and are the second largest Pacific Islander group in the U.S., after Native Hawaiians. American Samoa has been an unincorporated territory of the United States since 1900, and Samoa, formally known as the Independent State of Samoa and known as Western Samoa until 1997, is an independent nation that gained its independence from New Zealand in 1962. American Samoa (which is under the jurisdiction of the United States of America) and Samoa together make up the Samoan Islands, an archipelago that covers 1,170 sq mi (3,030 km2). Like Hawaiian Americans, the Samoans arrived in the mainland in the 19th century as fishermen and later worked as agricultural laborers and factory workers. As per 2019 U.S. Census estimates, there are over 200,000 people of Samoan descent living in the United States, including those of partial ancestry, which is roughly the population of the Independent State of Samoa, as of 2019. Honolulu, Hawaii, has the largest Samoan population, while Long Beach, California, has the largest Samoan population in the mainland United States: one percent of the city's population, or 4,513 people, as of 2010. There are also Samoan communities throughout the state of California. Other states with significant Samoan communities are Washington, Utah, Alaska, Nevada, and Oregon. History Migration from Samoan Islands to the USA began in the 19th century. The Samoans were part of the first Mormon Polynesian colony in the USA, which was founded in Utah in 1889 and consisted of Samoans, Hawaiian natives, Tahitians, and Maori people. Page 116. American Samoa officially became a U.S. territory in 1900 with the Treaty of Cession of Tutuila and in 1904 with the Treaty of Cession of Manu'a. In the 1920s a small group of mormons from American Samoa emigrated to the modern United States. They were brought by American mormons to Laie, Hawaii to assist in building the Mormon Temple of this place.. Page 22. Chapter: Pacific Islander and Pacific Islander Americans, 1940-present, written by Matthew Kester. Page 1177. The community grew over the decade and in 1929 there were already 125 American Samoans living in Laie, but the Samoan migration to Hawaii fell in the following years. It was probably due to the crash of 29, the loss of an important rice field for the community, and the Second World War. In the second half of the 1940s another many American Samoans emigrated in the USA. Over 330 of them, mostly mormons, moved to Hawaii. From work Samoan Saints: the Samoans in the mormon village of Laie, Hawaii. In 1951, nearly 1,000 American Samoans linked with the army (i.e. military personnel and their relatives. Chapter 7. From Village to City: Samoan migration to California, written by Graig R. James. Pages 120-121.) migrated to the Honolulu's American bases by accepting an invitation from the US Navy (which had left its bases in the Pago Pago city, as American Samoa began to be administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior) so that the Marines could continue working for the Navy. However, many of them later migrated to California (in 1952). In 1952 the natives of American Samoan become U.S. nationals, although not American citizens, through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.American Samoa and the Citizenship Clause: A Study in Insular Cases Revisionism. Chapter 3. Harvard Law Review. Retrieved October 10, 2018. This encouraged Samoan emigration to the United States and during the rest of the decade nearly four thousand Samoan mormons migrated to the USA, mostly to California and Hawaii. Many more Samoans migrated to the USA in the 1960s, surpassing those who emigrated in the previous decade. In fact, the largest Samoan migration to the US occurred at this time (mainly at the beginning of the decade). After 1965 increased migration from Samoa republic. At this time, many Samoans emigrated to Hawaii attracted by the presence of the Polynesian Cultural Center in this state. In 1970s over 7,540 Western Samoans emigrated to the United States, although the number of people from American Samoa who emigrated to the USA is unknown. In 1972 the number of American Samoans living in the USA exceeded the Samoan population in American Samoa, and California took the place of Tutuila as the main Samoan-populated region. Page 25. In 1980 over 22,000 Samoa-born lived in the USA, mostly of Western Samoa (more than 13,200), while 9,300 were from American Samoa. Demographics In the 2010 U.S Census, there were 184,440 Samoan people in the United States stateside population, including those who have partial Samoan ancestry. The Samoan American community consists in Americans of both American Samoan and Samoan descent. According to Unicef, 12,354 people from independent Samoa lived in the USA in 2013.

From there, many of the Samoan churches branched from the First Samoan Congregational Christian Church of San Diego. Garden Grove in Orange County has a Samoan community, as well as a church located off Century Boulevard. In Northern California, the housing project neighborhoods of Bayview-Hunters Point and Potrero Hill neighborhoods in San Francisco are home to much of the city’s Samoan community.

There is a sizable Samoan community in Provo, which is at least 0.3% Samoan. Utah is 0.3% Samoan, and has a history of Samoan immigration dating back to the late 1800s, due to many Samoans taking up Mormonism preaced by missionairies who had came to Polynesian islands. Utah's Mormon community had housing and services for some Polynesian immigrants, which also included Tongans and Maoris. There is a Samoan community in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Lawton, Oklahoma, in which Comanche County, Oklahoma is at least 0.6% Pacific Islander (2010), mainly Samoan. =Alaska and Hawaii= Outside the mainland U.S., many Samoan Americans have settled in Hawaii and Alaska. About 2.8% of Hawaiian residents are of Samoan descent, with 1.3% having full Samoan ancestry. Many live on the island of Oahu.

Life Born in Florence to a family of weavers, Penni entered Raphael's workshop very early in his life, and collaborated with him on several works, including the famous Rooms of the Vatican Palace, as well as the frescoes of Villa Farnesina, both in Rome. Heinrich Wölfflin and some other writers credited him with the entire execution of the Raphael Cartoons, with Raphael only creating the initial design, though more recent writers believe Raphael did much of the work himself. After the premature death of Raphael, Penni collaborated with Giulio Romano to the completion of works such as the Hall of Constantine, the Transfiguration, the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin (1525) in Monteluce, and the Palazzo Te of Mantua. Penni also provided designs for the tapestries of the life of Christ for Clement VII for the decoration of the Sala del Concistoro in the Vatican. In 1526, he left Rome and joined back up with Giulio Romano, who had arrived in Mantua in 1524. According to Vasari, he was not well received in Mantua (though he did work with Romano on the frescoes at the Palazzo Te) and so soon began a long journey to Naples via Lombardy and Rome. He died in Naples in 1528. His pupils included Leonardo da Pistoia (Grazia). Notes ;Attribution * References * * Freedberg, S. J. (1993). Painting in Italy, 1500–1600. The Pelican History of Art.

Beginning in 1933, she published Britain's Saturday Review, which was best known for its attacks on what the paper labelled the \\"unpatriotic\\" National Governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin. She has been acknowledged as an aviation pioneer, \\"the saviour of the Spitfire\\". Early life Fanny Lucy Radmall was the daughter of Thomas Radmall, a woollen warehouseman and draper, and Maria Isabella Clark. She was born at 13 Lower Kennington Green, Lambeth, the ninth child of ten children. As a young woman, she was a professional dancer, a chorus girl known as \\"Poppy\\". At the age of sixteen, she took up with a wealthy man twice her age, Frederick \\"Freddy\\" Gretton, whose family were part-owners of the Bass Brewery. She was his mistress for ten years. Gretton was a keen supporter of the Turf and owner of celebrated racehorses (such as Isonomy, winning the Stayers' Triple Crown). Gretton died in 1882 and left her a legacy of £6,000 per year, much to the disgust of his family. First two marriages Now set up in life, she wanted a stage career. However, only three weeks in to her first stage role in a production by the Drury Lane Theatre, she eloped with Theodore Francis Brinckman, son of the 2nd Baronet (1862–1937). On 3 September 1883 they married but the relationship did not flourish and the couple divorced in 1895 after a long separation. After a dramatic proposal on her part, she remarried in 1901, to the retiring and previously confirmed bachelor, George Frederick William Byron, 9th Baron Byron. During their marriage, as Lady Byron she was an active suffragette who used her wealth to support the cause, standing bail for Emmeline Pankhurst. During the First World War she strongly supported the war effort, for example by sending matches to soldiers serving overseas, the boxes labelled 'A Match for Our Matchless Troops from Lady Byron', and her 'Give Him Socks' campaign. Byron died in 1917, the same year that Lucy was appointed Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her creation of the 'Bluebird's Nest,' a rest home in Hampstead for nurses serving in the First World War. Marriage to Sir Robert Houston Her third and final marriage was to Sir Robert Houston, 1st Baronet, Member of Parliament for West Toxteth, and a shipping magnate. Houston is described in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as \\"a hard, ruthless, unpleasant bachelor.\\" Nevertheless Lucy Byron chased him for seven years, seeing off his old friend F.E. Smith, who opposed the marriage. Lucy got her way and finally they married on 12 December 1924. Houston established residence on the island of Jersey for the purposes of tax avoidance, and the couple divided their time between England, Jersey, and cruises on Houston's luxurious yacht, the Liberty. When Sir Robert showed her his will, Lady Houston reportedly tore it up, telling him that £1,000,000 was insufficient. By the time of their marriage Sir Robert was an invalid who suffered from bouts of depression and believed that he was being poisoned. He died aboard his yacht SY Liberty on 14 April 1926, leaving his widow roughly £5.5 million. Lady Houston was now England's second richest woman. Although not liable to pay death duties on Houston's estate she negotiated personally with Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, to pay £1.5m as an 'act of grace', as she put it. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"she paid for nine by-election meetings by the British National Government to be disrupted.\\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004 edition), volume 28, p. 299 The Schneider Trophy Supermarine, Winner of the Schneider Trophy, 1931 Lady Houston gave generously to British aviation. In 1931, she donated £100,000 to Supermarine, allowing them to win the Schneider Trophy in that year. The Royal Air Force's entry for the 1931 race for the trophy was hindered by political opposition. On 15 January 1931, the Air Ministry refused a last-minute request by the Royal Aero Club for funds for an entry. The Ministry forbade the use of the aircraft that competed in the 1929 race; forbade RAF pilots of the High Speed Flight who were trained to fly these seaplanes, to take part; and said that it would not police the race course in 1931 in the busy shipping lanes in the Solent. The Royal Aero Club sent a statement to the Cabinet on 22 January 1931, offering to raise £100,000, if the Government would rescind the Air Ministry's decrees on planes, pilots and policing. Many newspapers backing the opposition Conservative Party wanted to put pressure on Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government. One newspaper sent a telegram to MacDonald stating that, \\"To prevent the socialist government from being spoilsports, Lady Houston will be responsible for all extra expenses beyond what Sir Philip Sassoon (President of the Royal Aero Club) says can be found, so that Great Britain can take part in the race for the Schneider trophy.\\" The gift gave Lady Houston an opportunity to attack the Labour government, with the declaration \\"Every true Briton would rather sell his last shirt than admit that England could not afford to defend herself.\\" Later life In 1932, she offered to give £200,000 to strengthen the British army and navy. The National Government refused. She hung a huge electric sign, \\"DOWN WITH MACDONALD THE TRAITOR\\", in the rigging of Liberty and sailed round Great Britain. In a telegram to the Prime Minister, she wrote: In 1933, she financed the Houston-Mount Everest Flight Expedition, in which aircraft flew over the summit of Everest for the first time. This was to show opposition to granting independence to India. In October 1934, Lady Houston sent a cable to the winners of the MacRobertson England to Melbourne Air Race, Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott: \\"Your achievement has thrilled me through, oh brave men of my heart... If this does not make the Government sit up, nothing will ... Sleep well and feel proud of yourselves, as we all are ... Rule Britannia. God bless you both.\\"Transcript from The Daily Mirror newspaper, Wednesday, 24 October 1934, p. 3. \\"Brave Men Of My Heart\\" telegram by Lady Houston to Mr CWA Scott. Following her purchase of the Saturday Review in 1933 at the age of 76 she threw herself in a frenzy of activity as a newspaper proprietor determined to alert Britain to the weakness of its political leaders and the dangers of Communist infiltration of Britain. Frustrated by what she saw as the weakness of Ramsay MacDonald and then Stanley Baldwin as Prime Ministers she tried to push Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, and ultimately from 1935 the new king, her friend Edward VIII, into the role of virtual dictator of the country. In that she believed that Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler were strong leaders who pulled their countries, Italy and Germany, round from a state of decay, she wanted a strong British leader to emulate them. She admired the stance of both Hitler and Mussolini against Soviet Russia, believing that its political ambitions presented the greatest threat to the power of Britain and its Empire. She also considered funding Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists with the £200,000 rejected by the Government. However, just at that crucial moment Mosley's publication The Blackshirt printed what she thought were insulting references to her, and she kept the money. Death By the time of the Abdication Crisis of 1936 she was a semi-invalid who spent most of her time in bed, from where she edited and ran the Saturday Review. However, she was so distraught by the abdication, which she believed was the result of sinister forces coming from Moscow, that she stopped eating and died of a heart attack on 29 December 1936, aged 79, at her home, Byron Cottage, Highgate, north London. She had no children and left no will.

Valenki are made of wool felt. They are not water-resistant, and are often worn with galoshes to keep water out and protect the soles from wear and tear. Valenki were once the footwear of choice for many Russians, but in the second half of the 20th century they lost most of their appeal in cities, due to their association with rustic dress. Description Valenki (synonymic and semantic related expressions which mean the same – vа́lenukhi (pl.), vа́lezhki, vа́leni, vа́lentsi, kа́tanki) – warm felted highboots made from dried sheep’s wool; they are usually hard by their form, but there are soft types which are made for a corresponding footwear. Valenki are a kind of traditional Russian footwear which is usually worn for walking on dry snow when the weather is frosty. Valenki wear out most quickly from the bottom and very often are soled with leather or other durable material to prevent this, so they are often worn with galoshes. Also, to protect from getting wet – they use a rubber sole, and there are valenki with glue-sew and molded soles. Traditionally, valenki come in brown, black, gray and white, but the last few years, consumers have been able to order these boots in a variety of colors (red, blue, purple, green, yellow, orange). Valenki are included in standard of supplying officers and the ranks of the internal military service of the Russian army with warm clothes and gear.Russian Federation Government Resolution of 17 July 1995 N 720 \\"On Approval of the glove providing law for enforcement officers of the Russian Federation and norms of supply of glove property for commanding and enlisted personnel of the Interior of the Russian Federation, with the special title of the internal service Russian soldier on skis wearing valenki boots Valenki stem from the traditional felt boots worn by nomads of the Great Steppe (including Southern Rus'), whose history goes back over 1500 years. However, as it’s supposed, the boots appeared at the beginning of the 18th century. Valenki became widespread only in the first half of the 19th century, when they started being manufactured by industrial methods. Before this, they were quite expensive and only wealthy people could afford to have them. The increasing complexity of needs, the growing influence of the urban mores to the village caused the change of bast shoes with felt boots, and with it, the broad development of fulling production. Valenki became less popular in the urban life in recent decades because winters in Central Russia turned to be more soft and slushy, and as result, lighter and waterproof footwear gradually won popularity and replaced valenki. Valenki are associated with a traditional rustic style of clothing; in cities they are usually worn by small children, or they are worn by one and all in a severe frost, when other shoes don’t protect from the cold. Before the revolution, the production of valenki was concentrated in the Semenov district of Nizhny Novgorod province, in the Kineshma District of Kostroma province, and in the Kukmor in Kazan province. In 1900, contemporary jackboot fulling factories of Russia produced 1.4 million pairs of valenki in the amount of 2.1 million rubles.Statistical Yearbook for 1912, ed. V. Sharago, St. Petersburg, 1912. In 1900, a pair of valenki cost 1.5 rubles, in 1912 - 2 rubles, at the end of 1916 the speculative price reached up to 12-18 rubles per pair.

Naval career  Milne was the son of distinguished admiral, Sir Alexander Milne, 1st Baronet, and grandson of Vice- Admiral Sir David Milne. In 1879 he became aide-de-camp to Lord Chelmsford during the Zulu Wars, being fortunate enough to have been separated from the main army at the time of the massacre of British forces at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879. In 1891 with the rank of captain he accepted command of HMY Osborne, despite the normal rank for the officer in charge of such a ship being only 'commander'. While some officers only accepted short postings to royal yachts, fearing the effect on their careers of sinecure postings, Milne regarded it as a career path to flag rank. After a regular command of the cruiser Venus, which served on the Mediterranean Station, he was in December 1900 appointed in command of the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Jupiter, of the Channel Fleet. In October 1902, he was appointed a Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King. He was back in royal service when he became flag officer commanding H. M. Yachts from April 1903 to 1905, being promoted to rear admiral in 1904. During this time, he became a friend of King Edward VII and of Queen Alexandra, who called him \\"Arky-Barky\\". His hobbies were described as collecting rare orchids and entertaining royal ladies. Milne enjoyed the formal atmosphere of service in the royal squadron, with its emphasis on ceremony, spit and polish.Gordon p.237 His next posting was as second in command of the Atlantic Fleet until 1906. From 1908 to 1910 Milne commanded the 2nd Division of the Home Fleets. Milne was made a full Admiral in 1911 and made Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet in November 1912. The appointment was made by Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, taking into consideration the views of the King George V. Admiral Fisher, former First Sea Lord deplored Milne's appointment to such an important post, accusing Churchill of having betrayed the navy.'Castles' p.32 At the outset of the First World War, the Mediterranean Fleet consisted of three dreadnought battle cruisers, four large armoured cruisers, four light cruisers and 16 destroyers.  The pursuit of Goeben and Breslau  On 4 August 1914, after Germany had declared war on Russia and France but before Great Britain had declared war on Germany, Milne sent his two strongest battlecruisers, and , to seek out (as ordered) Germany's only two ships in the Mediterranean, and , under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. The ships met as the Germans were steaming back to Messina, Italy, to refuel after bombarding the French colonial ports of Philippeville and Bône, Algeria. The German ships steamed out of Messina harbour at midnight, 5 August, precisely as Britain officially went to war with Germany. They were headed for Turkey, to attempt to convince it to enter the war on Germany's side, by force if necessary. The heading surprised Admiral Milne who had expected them to steam west to the Straits of Gibraltar. He had only one ship, the light cruiser , in a position to follow them. The next morning (7 August), Gloucester closed in and opened fire on Breslau, which returned fire.Paul Chrastina, Trenches on the Web - The Pursuit of the Goeben and the Breslau, Originally in Old News , Vol 7, No 4, Dec-1995 under the title German Warships Flee British Fleet Breslau was slightly damaged in the exchange receiving one hit at the waterline. Near the western coast of Greece, the pursuit of Goeben and Breslau was taken up by four more British ships, led by Milne's second-in-command, Rear-Admiral Sir Ernest Charles Thomas Troubridge. Troubridge's ships (the cruisers , , and ) were smaller and slower than Goeben; they were also substantially outgunned, and much less well-armoured. Troubridge and his gunnery officer determined they could not intercept the German ships before daylight. They concluded that the enemy battlecruiser's superior speed and range would allow it to maintain enough distance to pick off Troubridge's ships at leisure before they could ever get close enough to engage effectively. Souchon's ships made it to Constantinople and were admitted into the harbour by the Turks. The German diplomats reminded the Turks that Great Britain had recently broken a contract to supply two new battleships to the Turkish government (which the British Admiralty had decided to keep for its own use as war loomed), and offered to sell them Goeben and Breslau. The Turks agreed on 16 August and eventually joined Germany's side on 30 October 1914. The ships were renamed Yavuz Sultan Selim and Midili, retaining their German crews; Souchon was made commander-in- chief of the Turkish Navy. Afterwards, Milne served out the rest of the war on half-pay. He was offered the three-year command at the Nore encompassing the ports of Chatham and Sheerness in 1916, but the position eventually went to another officer due to \\"other exigencies\\". The Admiralty repeatedly emphasised that Milne had been exonerated of all blame in the affair, most significantly when announcing Milne's retirement at his own request in 1919, so as to further the promotion of other officers. In 1920 the official naval history of the war by Sir Julian Corbett was critical of Milne's handling of the affair; Milne claimed that \\"the book contained serious inaccuracies\\". Milne requested the Admiralty to act which they declined to do so, and in 1921 Milne wrote The Flight of the Goeben and the Breslau in an attempt to clear his name, which \\"justified the official approbation\\".

He was the father of American Civil War Colonel William Crooks who served in the 6th Minnesota Regiment. In 1803 Ramsay worked in a trading post on the Great Lakes. He helped W. Price Hunt to organize and lead an overland trip to Astoria in the Oregon Country for John Jacob Astor in 1809 through 1813, as a partner in the Pacific Fur Company. He became general manager of the American Fur Company in 1817 and was president of the company from 1834–1839. While traveling for the fur trade company he dealt with many Native American tribes. He married Abanokue, the daughter of an Ojibwa Chieftain. They had a daughter together, Hester Crooks. Abanokue died around 1825. Crooks then married Emilie Pratte and had nine children. He spent his final days in New York. Early life and career In 1803, when Ramsay was 16 years old he arrived in Montreal, Quebec, with his family. He stayed in Montreal while his mother and the rest of the family went on to Newark. It has been reported that he was a clerk with Maitland, Garden and Auldjo, a Montreal mercantile firm that supplied dry goods and hardware to the Indians. Later it was said that he was in Niagara with fur traders and then was a clerk for fur trader Robert Dickson at Michilimackinac on Lake Huron. Today it is known as Mackinaw Island or Mackinac in Michigan. Ramsay was with George Gillespie (employed by Dickson) in 1805 and was in St Louis, Louisiana, for him from 1805 to 1807 learning the fur trade. By 1807, Ramsay had enough funds, supplemented by the fur trading Choteau Family, to form a partnership with Robert McClellan with the aim of trading with the Indians on the Missouri River. McClellan was described as “a man of many perilous exploits and hairbreadth escapes, a sure shot, and one of the most romantic characters in the annals of the Western fur trade”. They formed an expedition of 40 men and went as far as South Dakota on the Missouri, but were forced back to Council Bluffs, Iowa, by about 600 Sioux. They erected a trading post at Council Bluffs. Ramsay and McClellan believed the Sioux were spurred on by Manuel Lisa, a Spanish trader of the Missouri Fur Company, and McClellan swore if he ever met Lisa he would kill him. Later, with the Astor Expedition, he met Lisa on the Missouri, but, with difficulty, he was restrained from carrying out his threat. In 1809 Ramsay and McClellan dissolved the partnership, and Ramsay went to Mackinac to work for the Northwest Company (fur traders) where William Price Hunt, the organizer of the Astor expedition, signed Ramsey as a partner in the Astor group to take part in the expedition.

Barbara Marx was the first of four children of Irene (née Saltzman) and Louis Marx, a toy maker. In her youth she attended the Dalton School in New York City. She studied at L'Ecole des Sciences Politiques at La Sorbonne in Paris during her junior year of college, and received a B.A. cum laude in Political Science from Bryn Mawr College in 1951. Career As an author, speaker, and co- founder and president of the Foundation for Conscious Evolution, Hubbard posited that humanity was on the threshold of a quantum leap if newly emergent scientific, social, and spiritual capacities were integrated to address global crises. She was the author of seven books on social and planetary evolution. In conjunction with the Shift Network, Barbara co-produced the worldwide \\"Birth 2012\\" multimedia event.

Throughout her life, she had questioned what would make life easier as well as make people happy. For Hubbard, she did not like the molds that were expected out of herself as well as others, and in the 1970s she started speaking at futurist conferences about her findings. Those aided in her interest to the movement and resulted in her attending, speaking at, and creating conferences. With that, she dedicated her life to sharing the potential today's modern world has in achieving a better society and came up with the idea of \\"birthing\\" humanity.

During his childhood, he discovered the paintings of his grandfather Roger Chastel (professor in the Beaux-Arts of Paris). He studied philosophy in the University Paris VIIIUniversité Paris 8 and followed the lessons of Gilles Deleuze. He attended École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-ArtsÉcole nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in the atelier of Gustave Singier.Gustave Singier on artnet In 1970, he met Andy WarholPhoto of Warhol : http://homepage.mac.com/msaloff/.Pictures/VEP%20LAQUE/SALOFFCOSTE0161.JPG in New York. His photography can be categorised as of the pop art movement and is noted for coloring on a series of portraits of Deleuze and self-portraits. Work experience Saloff Coste worked as a consultant in communication, strategy and management, and eventually became involved in more fundamental research on these topics. From 1985 to 1987 he directed a permanent multidisciplinary workshop at the Ministry of Research in FranceAccueil - MESR : enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr on the topic of societal change. In 1991, Saloff Coste joined Bossard Consultants, a leading European consulting firm, as head of R&D; within the 'Bossard Institute', and in 1993 created his own research and consultancy firm MSC ET ASSOCIESMSC ET ASSOCIES  Management Strategy Communication (Management, Strategy, and Communication), which specialised in global governance, Information Society and sustainable development. He is a co-founder of \\"New Cap Invest\\", a venture capital company dedicated to promoting highly innovative companies. Research focus and contributions Michel Saloff-Coste's research focuses on the paradigm shift within the Information society that he defines as a 'Creation-Communication society'. He elaborated a structural grid which classifies the evolution of civilization in four waves: 'hunting & gathering', 'agriculture & breeding,' 'industry & commerce,' and 'creation & communication'.https://www.youtube.com/user/michelsaloffcoste He then analysed the interaction between different 'reality fields'. Developing his framework further with Carine Dartiguepeyrou, they articulated together ten long-term visions of the future called 'horizons'. This collaborative work was set out in their co-authored book Les horizons du futur. Following Coste's suggestion, the French executive committee of the Club of Budapest developed quarterly one-day seminars which explore the main ideas, places and people that were linked historically to the integral movement.Université Integralé: PROGRAMME UNIVERSITE INTEGRALE 16 OCTOBRE 2008 AVEC VIDEO ET PHOTO The first day of those “inaugurals days” was dedicated to explaining in general the integral approach,Université Integralé: Programme de la 1ère journée de l’Université intégrale le 29 février 2008 the second day looked at the issue of the integration of the integral approach and philosophy in real life. The third day concerned itself with integral education, exploring the theoretical and practical epistemological question connected with the specificity of the wish to build an integral university.Université Integralé In the fourth day, integral thinking was applied to the analysis of the contemporary, sociological, economical and ecological crises, for which potential solutions were explored. The fifth day looked at sustainable development and what the integral approach can bring in terms of integral ecology, society and economy. The sixth day, continuing the cycle, was more connected with future studies and futurology. It was entitled “Civilization of the future and future of the civilizations”, underlining the necessity to think not only in terms of cultural unity but also of diversity. The Integral University (Université Intégrale in French) in Paris, which is still in its development stages, follows this cycle of conferences. The idea is to organize one-day seminars on various themes in cooperation with speakers, theoreticians and practitioners. The use of the word integral puts a consistent emphasis on the common desire of being integral, and with this aim in view, the systemic and transdisciplinary approaches are also considered as part of the same quest for integrality.Integral Leadership Review Exhibitions Saloff Coste's first exhibition, in 1978, was in the Gallery Maître Alber.

(RWI) was a NASCAR racing team based in Mooresville, North Carolina, near Charlotte. Owned by former NASCAR Winston Cup champion and commentator Rusty Wallace, the team competed primarily in the Xfinity Series (formerly the Busch and Nationwide Series) with Wallace's younger brother Kenny Wallace and son Steve Wallace. On January 6, 2012, Rusty Wallace that the team would go on a temporary hiatus after being unable to find sponsorship. The team returned to the Nationwide Series with Steven Wallace in 2012 at Richmond for a single race. The team made its final Nationwide Series start in 2013 with Steve Wallace behind the wheel. Rusty Wallace Racing continues to operate, fielding super late models for Steve Wallace in the CARS series and NASCAR Whelen All- American Series. Team history RWI was founded in 1984 as Rusty Wallace's marketing firm. It began fielding racecars in 1985, with Wallace driving the No. 66 Oldsmobile. He won a pole in his first race at Daytona International Speedway, and ran three more races that season, which included two consecutive top-fives. He ran three races in 1986 and 1988, and had four top-tens with sponsorship from Alugard and Kodiak. Beginning with the 1989 season, Wallace began fielding the No. 36 Cox Treated Lumber Pontiac for his youngest brother Kenny. He would win three poles and had sixteen top-ten finishes, and was named Rookie of the Year in addition to his sixth-place points finish. After a winless 1990, he earned his first career victory at Volusia County Speedway, followed by another win later in the year at New Hampshire International Speedway, allowing him to finish a career-best 2nd in points. In 1992, Dirt Devil became the team's new sponsor, and Wallace had just one win and fell to sixth in points. After Kenny's promotion to the Winston Cup series, the team shut down. RWI returned to competition in 2004, operating as many as three teams out of its headquarters in Mooresville, North Carolina. Following the 2011 season, the team ceased operations due to lack of sponsorship to run competitively, laying off many employees and selling half of its equipment. The downsized team returned part-time for 2012 and 2013, with equipment purchased from Roush Fenway Racing. Nationwide SeriesCar No. 62 history= Brendan Gaughan in 2010. The No. 62 debuted in 2006 as the No. 61 Dodge. It was driven by Steve Wallace, Rusty's youngest son, at Dover International Speedway and finished 21st. It ran another race at Phoenix with Wallace finishing 16th. The renumbered 64 ran only one race in 2007, with Chase Austin finishing 41st at Memphis Motorsports Park. The No. 62 driven by Michael Annett in 2011 The team would run full-time in 2008 with the ride originally to be shared between Austin, Penske Racing test driver David Stremme, and road racer Max Papis, but Stremme's consistent top-10 runs put him in the seat full-time, with the exception of road courses, with 5 top- fives and 16 top-10s leading to an 11th-place points finish for him. Atreus Homes and Communities began the season as the sponsor, but soon left. Penske sponsors AVIS and Penske Trucking, and Loan Star Title Loans shared the sponsorship duties for the rest of the season. Stremme's return to the Sprint Cup Series left the seat open, and former Truck Series driver Brendan Gaughan drove the renumbered 62 in 2009 with sponsorship from South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa, before U.S. Fidelis and 5-hour Energy came over to share sponsorship with the No. 66. Michael Annett, along with sponsor Pilot Flying J, drove the car in 2011, with Gaughan returning to the Camping World Truck Series with Germain Racing. After an arrest for a DUI prior to Daytona, Annett rebounded and finished 9th in points. Following the shutdown of RWR, Annett was released and moved to Richard Petty Motorsports, while the No. 62 team's owners points were given to JD Motorsports. =Car No. 64 history= No. 64 in 2011 The No. 64 made a return in 2011 with David Reutimann running 5 races and Jason Bowles driving the car at Michigan, Road America and Watkins Glen. =Car No. 66 history= Steve Wallace in 2009. RWI returned to competition in 2004 with late model racer Billy Parker (son of Hank Parker and brother of Hank Parker, Jr.) as the driver of the No. 66 Dodge Intrepid in NASCAR's Busch Series, with primary sponsor Duraflame. Parker was scheduled to drive in 17 races, but after finishing only 4 of 8 races he was released. He was replaced by Jamie McMurray, who won the team's first pole on New Hampshire and later won the team's first race at Darlington Raceway. Rusty Wallace drove in two races as well, finishing in the top-ten both times. In 2005, RWI ran a full 35 race schedule in the NASCAR Busch Series. At the request of Duraflame, who switched to sponsor a Brewco Motorsports entry, RWI's 66 was renumbered No. 64. McMurray shared driving duties with Wallace's former Penske Racing South teammate Jeremy Mayfield, Bill Elliott, and Wallace. Miller High Life Light and Top-Flite Golf shared sponsorship. The next season, McMurray and Steve Wallace split driver duties in the No. 64 Dodge Charger. Top-Flite Golf remained the primary sponsor during McMurray's 20 races, while the Jackson Roscoe Foundation was primary sponsor for most of Wallace's 17 races. No. 66 in 2011 driven by Steve Wallace In 2007, Steve Wallace was named the full-time driver of the newly renumbered 66, with Homelife Communities becoming a primary sponsor. Wallace won two poles but finished 19th in points. Reed Sorenson drove the 66 in one race as well. Atreus Homes and Jimmy John's sponsored Wallace in 2008, who had seven top-ten finishes. US Fidelis and 5-Hour Energy sponsored Wallace's full-time run in 2009, with one top five and nine top tens with a respectable 7th-place points finish. After US Fidelis ran into financial trouble, 5-Hour Energy sponsored the team in 2010 and 2011, finishing 10th in points in both seasons respectively. After 5-hour Energy left RWR to sponsor Clint Bowyer at Michael Waltrip Racing in the Cup Series, team owner Rusty Wallace was forced to suspend the Nationwide Series operations and handed the No. 66 owners points to MAKE Motorsports. In 2012, the team ran a single race with Steve Wallace in No. 4 LoanMax Ford Mustang at the Virginia 529 College Savings 250 at Richmond, using the owners points of Jay Robinson Racing. Wallace started and finished in 11th place. For 2013, RWR and Wallace planned to run 10 to 15 races with sponsorship from Richard Tocado Companies, and equipment purchased from Roush Fenway Racing. The team ended up only running one race, the History 300 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, with the Steven Wallace driving the No. 66. Wallace started 40th and finished 25th. Sprint Cup Series In 2011, Rusty Wallace Racing acquired the owner's points of the No. 77 Penske Racing team, guaranteeing Steve Wallace a start in the 2011 Daytona 500. Wallace drove the No. 77 car, which was sponsored by 5-hour Energy, to a 20th-place finish.

Although connected with Dale Earnhardt, Inc., the race team founded by Dale Earnhardt Sr. and run by Teresa Earnhardt after his death, the two were separate operations. The team ran in the NASCAR Busch Series for the three years it was in operation. The team fielded the No. 8 Bass Pro Shops/Yum! Brands Chevrolet for Martin Truex Jr. and the No. 81 under various sponsorships and for various drivers including Earnhardt Jr., Truex, and Tony Stewart. Truex scored 2 Busch Series championships and 12 wins for the company in its 3-year existence. Between 2004 and 2005, Earnhardt Jr. also won 2 races for Chance 2. History Chance 2 was founded in 2003 by Teresa Earnhardt, widow of Dale Earnhardt, and Earnhardt's son Dale Earnhardt Jr. The team name originates from Chance Racing, the team Earnhardt Sr. founded for his children Kerry, Kelley, and Dale Jr. which was the precursor to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. Busch SeriesCar No. 8 history= The 2004 season saw the first full-time season for Chance 2 as Martin Truex Jr. was to run the full season and was considered one of the favorites. Truex had run several races for Chance 2 the year before in the No. 81 and had made fourteen previous starts in the Busch Series prior to 2004, driving one race for Phoenix Racing in the No. 1 Yellow Transportation Chevrolet, driving several for his father, Marty Truex, and one race for Stanton Barrett's race team. Truex was expected to wage a spirited battle with Kyle Busch, who was racing his first full season since the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement had taken away his Truck Series ride at Roush Racing when he was 16, for the points championship; Busch was driving the No. 5 Lowe's Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports, the team that had won the series points championship in 2003 with Brian Vickers driving. Truex's car was to carry sponsorship from Bass Pro Shops for a majority of the races, with Yum! Brands sponsoring for 14 races. Truex's first victory in the No. 8 came in the Sharpie Professional 250 at Bristol in March. He followed it up with three additional victories in the next seven races. He won the Aaron's 312 at Talladega, the Charter 250 at Gateway, and the Goulds Pumps/ITT Industries 200 at Nazareth. Truex's victory at Nazareth was the final race held at the speedway. Truex claimed the points lead after Nazareth but quickly lost it to Busch. However, Truex put together a string of top 10 finishes that not only regained him the lead but also put distance between him and Busch. Truex won his fifth and sixth races of the season in the second half of the year, the Stacker 2 Hundred at Dover and the Sam's Town 250 at Memphis, and clinched the series points championship with one race to spare. Truex's 2005 season saw him claim a victory at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, the first NASCAR race held in Mexico. He won at Talladega for the second consecutive year and also won at Dover in the spring. Truex's summer got off to a strong start as he won three times in six races, winning at Daytona, New Hampshire, and IRP. This duplicated his 2004 season total of six victories, and Truex won his second consecutive points championship by 68 points over Clint Bowyer. After the season, Chance 2 folded its operations and Truex joined DEI full-time as the driver of the No. 1 car.

Originally launched in 1934 by the San Francisco-based General Brewing Company, Lucky Lager grew to be one of the prominent beers of the West during the 1950s and 1960s. In 2019, Pabst announced that the beer brand would be revived and would be brewed by 21st Amendment Brewery, a brewery based in San Leandro.  History  Origins = The General Brewing Company was founded in San Francisco, California by Eugene Selvage (who would remain owner and CEO until 1961). Eugene teamed up with Paul C. von Gontard, a grandson of Aldophus Busch, and German brewmaster Julius Kerber, to launch a state of the art brewery that could brew beer that rivalled those made in Europe. Lucky Lager, the first beer of General Brewing Company, was commercially introduced in 1934. That same year, General Brewing Company also formed a strategic partnership with Coast Breweries in Vancouver Island, British Columbia as part of a consortium of several Canadian breweries. The General Brewing company expanded and opened Lucky Lager Brewing Company, a second brewery in Azusa, California in 1949. Later in the 50s and 60s, the expansion also reached Vancouver (WA) and Salt Lake City (UT). = \\"One of the World’s Finest Beers\\" = Lucky Lager was launched in San Francisco via a series of newspaper ads, billboards, and advertisements on street cars. The ads announced Lucky would be a beer of high quality and would follow the tradition of German beers - being made with high-quality ingredients, in a high-quality brewery, and with thorough aging. It was launched to significant fanfare and grew steadily, becoming the #2 selling beer in California by 1937. Starting in 1935, Lucky encouraged people to take the taste test and that they would choose Lucky. The General Brewing Company invested $1,000,000 to open its first brewery in San Francisco. It was planned and designed by Frederick H. Meyer, San Francisco architect, in partnership with George L. Lehle, a brewery engineer from Chicago. This construction was the most modern brewery of its time, with a capacity of 100,000 barrels per year and capabilities of doubling production. By brewing just Lucky Lager, the General Brewing Company achieved a record of selling its entire daily production since the beginning of operations. The main reason for its success with consumers was the high beer quality, which came from the aging the beer adequately unlike many of its post-Prohibition competitors of the time. Moreover, the production was set up in a way that no hands touched the beer or its container until the final step (bottling). In that sense, General Brewing Company posted a bond of $1,000 as a guarantee that the age-date of the beer was authentic. After WWII, General Brewing began rapid expansion to meet increasing demand. This included expanding into Azusa, California in 1949, Vancouver, Washington in 1950, and Salt Lake City, Utah in 1960. = 1950s – 1960s heydays = The following decade, from 1950-1960 saw Lucky Lager grow to be the sales leader in the entire West. This was coupled with continued distribution expansion in an effort to saturate the western market. By 1962, Lucky Lager was producing and selling over two million barrels of beer per year. In 1958, Coast Breweries was purchased by Labatt Brewery, which continued to brew Lucky Lager. Lucky Lager Brewing Company changed its name back to General Brewing between 1963 and 1969, and then changed its name to Lucky Breweries, Inc. in 1969. As the national brands moved into California in the early 1960s, Lucky Lager's sales began to falter. In an effort to increase sales with younger drinkers, this led to the ill-fated introduction of King Snedley's Beer, an alternate brand in addition to Lucky. According to some accounts, King Snedley's was just Lucky Lager repackaged with a different brand and marketed toward counterculture consumers. The new brand flopped and was withdrawn from the market, though it would reappear briefly in 1975. As sales continued to decline, the Salt Lake City brewery was closed in 1967. = 1970s and beyond = In 1971, millionaire beer baron Paul Kalmanovitz bought Lucky Lager Brewing and merged it with Maier Brewing Company to form the General Brewing Company with S&P; Corporation as its parent. The Azusa, CA brewery was closed immediately. The San Francisco brewery was closed in 1978. This left Vancouver, WA and Cranston, RI as the only locations where Lucky Lager was brewed. In the late 1970s, General Brewing took advantage of the \\"generic brand\\" marketing craze in the US by producing beer with plain white labels emblazoned with the word BEER. Rumors surfaced that BEER was simply repackaged Lucky Lager. When the generic craze died, and the microbrewery movement took off, General had difficulty maintaining profitability as a brewer of inexpensive beers. The fact that Lucky Lager tasted no worse than expensively-advertised \\"premium\\" brands such as Budweiser or Miller did not impress a market of drinkers where image was frequently more important than taste. The brewery's fortunes began to decline. After the Vancouver, WA brewery shut down in July 1985, the Olympia Brewing Company in Tumwater, WA began to produce Lucky Lager in the US. In July 2003, this brewery was also closed. Lucky Lager continued to be sold in its original Northern California range at Lucky Stores supermarkets, which although not affiliated, sold Lucky Lager as an unofficial value store brand, until Lucky Stores supermarkets were bought out by Albertson's and the name of the supermarkets was changed around 2000. = Canadian presence = Lucky was actually brewed on Vancouver Island in Victoria until 1982, when Labatt Breweries of Canada moved off the Island and demolished the brewery to prevent any competition on the Island. Labatt now brews Lucky out of Edmonton, Alberta in the same brewery where they produce Budweiser for all of Western Canada. In 1995, Labatt was purchased by Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew was then purchased by Brazilian brewing giant AmBev in 2004 and the company became Inbev. On 13 July 2008, Inbev merged with Anheuser-Busch, making AB InBev the current owners of the Lucky Lager brand in Canada. Brewing and distribution rights in the United States are owned by the Pabst Brewing Company Lucky is commonly found all across British Columbia. Labatt markets Lucky Lager as a budget brand in Manitoba, Alberta and Ontario.  Packaging  Stubby bottles = Lucky Lager was once famous for its 11 oz stubby bottles featuring a rebus under the cap. Since the closure of the Tumwater brewery, this famous bottle has been discontinued. = Rebus caps = Rebus puzzles use pictures to represent words or parts of words within a phrase. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lucky Lager, along with other brands controlled by beer magnate, Paul Kalmanovitz, featured rebus puzzles on the underside of their bottle caps to engage consumers. = Label = Lucky Lager's marketing strategy also relied strongly on its packaging and label. In 1939, the Pacific Advertising Club Association granted Lucky Lager the highest award for the most distinctive beer package. The history of the label started with the design of the very distinctive red cross, with a circle in the center with the printed date of the beer, and the words \\"Lucky Lager\\" printed on both arms of the cross. The label was distinctive from traditional beer brands because of its simplicity and how easy it was to remember. It covered the whole surface of the can and, when piled, the combination of the crosses culminated in a sophisticated design. This design by Charles Stafford Duncan, the art director of the McCann Erickson advertising agency in San Francisco, also won the Altman Prize of the National Academy of Design. The original label for Lucky Lager has seen many changes. The large red cross was made less prominent in the 1950s, but it remained on the labels and on advertising. The label was redesigned and the cross was again made smaller in 1962, although it was still the design's focus. A subsequent design in the late 60s got rid of the cross entirely and replaced it with a large cursive \\"L\\". With the rise of premium beer, lead by Coors and Millers, Lucky Lager changed the logo in an attempt to maintain itself relevant in the beer market. With the subsequent decline and end of Lucky Lager in the US, the beer continues to operate with an ever-changing identity under the control of Labatt, owners of the brand rights in Canada.  Advertising  Original Branding = The original advertising for the Lucky Lager brand centered on the large X emblem present on packaging and other marketing material, including the \\"Bonded Beer\\" slogan and age-dated beer canning. Lucky Lager was the first beer to include the date the beer was brewed on the can. This remained a central tenet of its advertising through the 1970s. One of the more unusual promotions was the \\"Talking Package\\". It was a robot made of Lucky Beer containers: its body was a beer barrel, the neck, arms and legs were made of beer cans, and the head and feet were large bottles. One hand held a beer bottle as well. Inside was a microphone and a speaker. An operator hid nearby where he could see the people in front of the robot. Spectators could go up to the \\"talking package\\" and ask him questions about Lucky Lager and the Lucky robot would respond. = \\"It’s Lucky when you live in...\\" = During the early 1950s, one of the key brand slogans was \\"It's Lucky when you live in California.\\" It was seen on many billboards throughout California. As its distribution area grew, it became \\"It's Lucky when you live in America\\". Labatt Brewing Company declared Cumberland, BC to be the \\"Luckiest Town in Canada\\" in early 2002 due to its incredible rate of consumption. = Partnerships, sponsorships, and endorsers = Lucky Lager provided endorsements and advertising for the San Francisco Seals throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 1950s. It garnered endorsements from Boston Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler and tennis star Jack Kramer during the 1950s. Lucky also sponsored a well-loved popular music radio show called \\"Lucky Lager Dance Time\\". It ran with local DJs but the same playlist across California, so people could listen to the same music while they were driving. It also sponsored various sports recaps and other programs. In the 1960s, Lucky Lager Brewing Company sponsored the Lucky International Open. Lucky's 1963 McCann Erickson ad campaign included the song \\"Go Lively: Get Lucky\\", by Richard Adler.[4] = Jingles, commercials, and print ads = Lucky, like most other beer brands at the time, was present both on the radio, in print, and on TV. Early commercials for Lucky featured a vaudeville song and dance number and labeled Lucky as \\"Aged Just Right\\". Other ads featured cartoons detailing the improvements of Lucky Draft over other light beers and emphasizing the aging and superior quality of Lucky. Most of their ads before 1965 featured imagery that is iconic with the West (beaches, ranches, and mountains). Much of this imagery was echoed in their print advertising.  In popular culture  In the 1956 film \\"Please Murder Me\\", a Lucky Lager billboard is in the background in one scene. In the 1961 film The Exiles, the characters are drinking Lucky Lager and local liquor stores are advertising the sale of Lucky Lager. The brand also appears in the bar room brawl scene in the 1968 movie The Devil's Brigade. In the 1965 film, A Patch of Blue, a Lucky beer truck appears in one scene. In the 1968 film \\"Vixen!\\", Lucky Lager is being consumed in the backwoods of British Columbia. Jack Nicholson's character drinks Lucky Lager during the 1970 movie Five Easy Pieces. In the film The Bad News Bears (1976), the Walter Matthau character gives the team Lucky Lagers to celebrate a win. Lucky Lager is featured in the 1982 Black Flag video \\"TV Party\\". In the television show Greg the Bunny, a Lucky Lager sign appears in the 'Rabbit Redux' episode. Cans of Lucky Lager appear in the film The Van, being sold out of a cooler at a van show. In the 1993 film Kalifornia, Lucky Lager is the favorite drink of the Brad Pitt character \\"Early Grace\\".

It is situated on the northern tip of the island of Andøya. The airport is the civilian sector of Andøya Air Station and is operated by the state-owned Avinor. The airport consists of two runways, long, and served 48,254 passengers in 2012. Widerøe operates public service obligation (PSO) flights to Bodø, Tromsø, Stokmarknes and Harstad/Narvik, while Norwegian Air Shuttle operates seasonal flights to Oslo. Construction of the air station started in 1952 to host the 333 Squadron. Civilian operations started in 1964, when Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) started flights to Oslo. Widerøe started serving the airport as part of the regional network in 1972, with SAS withdrawing four years later. Widerøe originally used the Twin Otter, replacing it with the Dash 7 from 1981 and the Dash 8 between 1993 and 1995. Routes have been subject to PSO flights since 1997; these have been operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle for part of 2003 and by Coast Air for part of 2006 og 2007, and otherwise by Widerøe. History Andøya Air Station was built with North Atlantic Treaty Organization funds as a combined Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic project as a base for maritime surveillance. Construction started in 1952 and all installations not required to be physically located at the air station were placed at Skarsteindalen, away. Andøya became the base for the 333 Squadron, which initially operated the Grumman HU-16 Albatross. These were replaced by the Lockheed P-3 Orion in 1969.Arheim: 219 Construction and further expansion of the air station resulted in the villages of Haugnes being expropriated. Construction was prohibited from 1953, but the expropriation was not carried out until 1971. Soldiers in front of a hangar of Andøya Air Station With the establishment of the air station, plans arose to take advantage of the infrastructure for civilian flights. The airport's location made it suitable to serve Vesterålen, although it was located at the northern tip of the archipelago. SAS started serving Andenes from 1964 with their 56-seat Convair Metropolitans, which consisted of three night flights with intermediate stops at Bodø Airport and Bardufoss Airport before continuing to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The night flights caused difficulties corresponding with the flights as there was a limited ferry and bus service during night.Svanberg: 662 The Sud Aviation Caravelle was introduced on Northern Norway flights from 1965 and later these were replaced with the Douglas DC-9.Svanberg: 663 It soon proved difficult to provide sufficient patronage to keep operations profitable. With the opening of a network of short take-off and landing airports elsewhere in Central Hålogaland in 1972, Widerøe started serving the airport using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. SAS retained a small number of Oslo flights until 1976, when they withdrew from the service. At the time the military chartered aircraft for their own needs, so Andøy Mayor Johan Kleppe took initiative to coordinate the civilian and military routes, without the military supporting the proposal.Svanberg: 675 Parliament decided in 1982 that Andenes would be the base for operating helicopters offshore to oil installations off Troms. However, when operations commenced operations flew out of Tromsø Airport because of the difficult weather conditions at Andenes. Operations were moved to Hammerfest Airport following the discovery of Snøhvit. Widerøe introduced the larger, 50-seat de Havilland Canada Dash 7 in 1981,Svanberg: 677 followed by the Dash 8 between 1993 and 1995. The routes were made subject to public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications from 1 April 1997. Widerøe won the initial tender. A proposal to make Andenes an international airport was launched in 2000, which also proposed that the airport change its name to Lofoten Airport. Unlike the two airports in Lofoten, Leknes Airport and Svolvær Airport, Helle, Andenes is able to handle jetliners. The name change was rejected by interests in Lofoten, which accused Vesterålen of stealing the more well-known Lofoten name. From 1 April 2003 Norwegian Air Shuttle took over the route from Andenes to Bodø and Tromsø. However, they decided to terminate their operations with the Fokker 50, and thus also serving Andenes, to concentrate their efforts on becoming a low-cost carrier. From 1 January 2004 the route was served by Widerøe, who won the extraordinary tender. The state paid NOK 68 million for 27 months, up 25 percent from the Norwegian bid, including a service from Tromsø to Lakselv Airport, Banak. The tender for the three years starting on 1 April 2006 was won by Coast Air, which used an ATR-42 on the route. Coast Air was not able to make money on the route and abandoned the PSO contract from 1 April 2007. Widerøe won the subsequent tender and started flights from that date. Norwegian started irregular scheduled flights to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, using the Boeing 737-800 from June 2012. Facilities Snowplow The airport is located at an elevation of 13 meters (43 ft). It has two asphalt runways: the main runway is and aligned 14–32, but only has a declared length of ; the other is and aligned 03–21. Runways 14 and 32 are equipped with instrument landing system category I. The airport is located two minutes' drive from Andenes. Taxis, car rental and 40 paid parking spaces are available at the airport. The airport had an operating deficit of 34 million Norwegian krone in 2012. Airlines and destinations Widerøe serves Andenes with Dash 8 aircraft on public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. These routes are mixed with commercial services and operate to Bodø, Harstad-Narvik, Svolvær and Tromsø. Norwegian Air Shuttle flies irregularly to Oslo, typically during holidays and summer. The airport handled 48,625 passengers, 3,208 aircraft movements and 1 tonne of cargo in 2014. Accidents and incidents All four people on board were killed when a private Cessna 172 crashed west of the airport just after take-off on 31 July 1988. The accident took place west of the airport in a cliff, altitude.

Early life Wavel Ramkalawan was born in Mahé, the principal island of Seychelles. He was born into a modest family, the youngest of three children. His grand father was from Gopalganj, Bihar. His father was a metalworker and his mother a teacher. Ramkalawan's primary and secondary education were at Seychelles College, the elite boys' school of the country. Ramkalawan was ordained priest in 1985 following theological studies at St Paul's Theological College in Mauritius, and thereafter followed further studies in theology at Birmingham University. Returning to Seychelles, he worked in several parishes in Seychelles, rising to become priest-in-charge of the parish of Holy Saviour. Entry into politics It was his work as a priest that led Ramkalawan to politics. Through his pastoral work, he came into contact with many people who had been the subject of repression and abuses of human and civil liberties by the government. At that time, the church was the only institution which could speak out on these issues. In 1990, Ramkalawan preached a landmark sermon, broadcast to the nation on the national radio station, in which he questioned the practices of the one-party government and gave voice to the desire of the people for greater freedom, respect for human rights and observance of the rule of law in the country. The sermon was an inspiration for the movement for political liberty and democracy in Seychelles. It drew Ramkalawan closer into politics. In 1991, still a priest, he joined others who had been active in opposing the government, such as Roger Mancienne and Jean-François Ferrari, to form Parti Seselwa, initially an underground organization, and became its leader. Opposition leader When the government, under pressure both internally and from abroad, returned the country to multi-party democracy in 1992, Parti Seselwa was the first political party to register and join the ranks of others in opposition to the government. It immediately set to work and participated in elections for representation on the 1992 constitutional commission, polling only 4% of the national vote and not qualifying for representation on the commission. Subsequently to the coming into force of the new constitution in 1993, two other opposition parties joined Parti Seselwa to form The United Opposition (UO) and to contest the 1993 general elections. The party won 9% of the vote, enabling it to appoint one member (Ramkalawan) to the National Assembly. In 1998, Ramkalawan led his party into the second multi-party general elections. The party polled 27% of the national vote and increased its National Assembly representation to three, beating the Democratic Party of former President James Mancham into third place. Ramkalawan became the first directly elected member of the party in the Assembly, winning his home constituency of St Louis, which he has represented continuously since. In addition, he was elected Leader of the Opposition, a post he continues to hold. In the 2001 presidential elections, Ramkalawan polled 45% of the vote, thus losing to the 54% vote won by President René. The next year, Ramkalawan led his party, now renamed the Seychelles National Party (SNP), into the National Assembly elections. The party increased its parliamentary representation from one directly elected member to seven and from two proportionally elected members to four. Since 1998, Ramkalawan has been Leader of the Opposition. In 2005, Ramkalawan took a sabbatical from his clerical duties in order to devote himself fully to his political life at a crucial and important point in the country's affairs. In the 2006 presidential elections, however, Ramkalawan lost to James Michel.

The No. 11 car ended 21st in owner points, with Bodine finishing 29th in points. = Car No. 22 history = Navy would extend its partnership with NASCAR and FitzBradshaw for the 2005 season. In 2002, the newly formed FitzBradshaw Racing signed Supercuts, 10-10-220, Hot Tamales, and Jani-King as sponsors and Kerry Earnhardt as the driver of the team's No. 12 Chevrolet. The team also formed a technical alliance with Dale Earnhardt, Inc., receiving engines and engineering support from DEI. Earnhardt had two top-fives and finished 22nd in points. Earnhardt did not have a top-ten finish in 2003, and was released after the Tropicana Twister 300. Tim Fedewa, who had been Earnhardt's spotter since 2002, and crew chief for a single race, replaced him for the balance of the season. Fedewa finished in the top-20 eight times. Fedewa had five top-tens in 2004, and finished sixteenth in points. Fedewa struggled in 2005, and did not finish in the top-ten, causing him to be released after Pikes Peak. Joel Kauffman, Paul Wolfe, Carlos Contreras, Kertus Davis, Sterling Marlin, and Steadman Marlin all shared the ride for the rest of the season. In 2006, the No. 12 car has seen several different drivers through the first 25 races of the season. Joel Kauffman was slated to run the full schedule for the team this year, however after struggling the team scaled back his schedule. David Reutimann ran the car at Daytona because Kauffman had not received approval for superspeedway racing. Tracy Hines and Mike Skinner drove the car in multiple races. For the 2007 season, Fitz Motorsports switched to the No. 22 and signed David Stremme and Mike Bliss as their principal drivers. Both drivers had great success in the No. 22, with Bliss scoring the team's best finish of second at Memphis. When the team came to Montreal for the inaugural NAPA Auto Parts 200, the team - in a last-second decision - placed Canadian CART regular Patrick Carpentier in the car. Carpentier won the pole position for the race and charged from 6th with less than 2 laps to go to finish second to Kevin Harvick. Bliss returned in 2008 to drive full-time, but left for Phoenix Racing after six races, and was replaced by various Cup drivers including Robby Gordon and Reed Sorenson. Michael Waltrip Racing development driver Josh Wise became the new driver for thirteen races with one top-five finish. Of note, Fitz switched temporarily to Toyota during Wise's runs with the team. A wide variety of drivers including ex-Champ Car driver Andrew Ranger, 2008 Daytona 500 winner Ryan Newman, Jarit Johnson, and Joe Gibbs Racing development driver Marc Davis, took over for the rest of the season. This team shut down in early 2009. = Car No. 36 history = David Stremme pitting the No. 14 during the 2005 Kroger 200. The team expanded to two cars in 2003 halfway through the season as the United States Navy came aboard to sponsor the No. 14 for nine races. Casey Atwood debuted the car at Kentucky Speedway, bringing it home in 9th place. Atwood ran 11 races that year, posting four top-ten finishes. Atwood came back in 2004, and had seven top-tens, when he was dismissed after Lowe's. His immediate replacement was Dave Blaney for one race, with Braun Racing's David Stremme named as his permanent replacement. As part of the arrangement to bring Stremme to the team, FitzBradshaw agreed to align themselves with Chip Ganassi Racing, who had him under contract as part of a driver development deal. This would allow the team to finish the season as a Chevrolet team, but beginning the next year both the No. 12 and the No. 14 would switch to Dodge as Ganassi's team was fielding the vehicles at the time. Stremme ran the No. 14 full-time in 2005, and had ten top-tens, finishing 13th in points, before moving up to compete in the NEXTEL Cup series. Tracy Hines was hired to run in the No. 14 Dodge for the 2006 season, however sponsorship issues forced the team to compete on a limited basis. Steadman Marlin competed for the team in two races and A. J. Foyt IV competed in one race for the team. It was announced in July 2006 that Family Dollar would sponsor the car for nine races and the team would feature Ricky Craven, Carlos Contreras, and Mike Skinner as drivers. Fitz Motorsports changed the car number to No. 44 for 2007 and Rubén Pardo qualified for the team's first race at the Telcel-Motorola México 200, followed up by another start at Nashville Superspeedway. Mike Bliss also drove the No. 44 with Family Dollar sponsorship at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 2007. For 2008, Kenny Wallace was signed to drive the No. 36 with sponsorship from Shark Energy Drink. Although Wallace missed the season opener at Daytona, he ran all following races until owner Armando Fitz announced on March 17 that the No. 36 team would only run part-time due to a lack of product distribution, and the owner points of the 36 were switched the No. 28 of Wallace's new team. The No. 36 began running part-time with Pardo and Charles Lewandoski driving midway through the season. = Car No. 40 history = Casey Atwood in the 82 in 2003 The third FitzBradshaw car made its debut in 2003, with Jimmy Spencer driving the No. 82 Jani-King Chevrolet at Texas, finishing sixth. Casey Atwood attempted the Charlotte spring race in the No. 82 NAVY Chevrolet, failing to qualify. Atwood later drove the car at the Tropicana Twister 300 sponsored by Jani-King, finishing 21st. Randy LaJoie drove the car again at Phoenix, finishing 14th. LaJoie continued to run the car part-time in 2004 with sponsorship from Jani-King and Goulds Pumps, his best finish being 13th at Las Vegas. Dave Blaney also ran two races in the car. In 2005, the team became a driver development team for Chip Ganassi Racing, and switched to Ganassi's No. 40 with sponsorship from Jani-King and Cottman Transmission. Sterling Marlin began the season with the team, with Carlos Contreras and Ganassi development driver Scott Lagasse Jr. filling in. Towards the end of the season, Contreras, Paul Wolfe, and Erin Crocker got majority of the starts in the car. Reed Sorenson ran the Aaron's 312 at Atlanta in March in the car after the transmission on his regular No. 41 Discount Tire car mysteriously locked up during qualifying for the race. For 2006, Michael Waltrip purchased the team's owners points and began a partnership with FBR to run the No. 99 Aaron's Dodge.  Other series  In addition to the Busch Series, Fitz Motorsports operated race teams in other series as well. In 2007, they fielded entries in the NASCAR Busch East Series with Ruben Pardo as the team's driver, with Pierre Borque racing on a part-time basis, and the NASCAR Mexico Series, where Carlos Pardo drove the team's FitzContreras Racing entry, along with development driver Maxime Dumarey. In 2007, the team partnered with Hyper Sport to race in the Grand-Am Road Racing series. Ruben Pardo raced in 2008 in the East Series for Fitz. For 2009, former Rusty Wallace Racing driver Chase Austin was to drive the No. 32 Chevrolet in the Camping World Truck Series and Jarit Johnson, younger brother of five time Sprint Cup champion Jimmie Johnson was to drive in the Camping World East Series. However, the team shut down before their plans could come to fruition.

History  Although possibly dating back as far as the middle of the Nara period, the name, meaning \\"bath spread\\", derives from the Edo period practice of using them to bundle clothes while at the sentō (public baths; public furo) to prevent a mix-up of the bathers' clothes. Before becoming associated with public baths, furoshiki were known as hirazutsumi (平包), or flat folded bundle. Eventually, the furoshiki’s usage extended to serve as a means for merchants to transport their wares or to protect and decorate a gift. This art of wrapping was founded by Minoro Takohama somewhere around 1935 or 1936 depending if it is a leap year on that year. A historical example during World War II is a personal map printed on cloth captured from a Japanese soldier. The map was obtained by an Australian soldier, E. J. Knight, from a Japanese soldier captured on South Bougainville of the Bougainville Campaign in 1945. It is a synthetic fabric furoshiki. The cloth is printed in blue, grey, brown, mauve and orange with a map of South East Asia, and with an aeroplane, a ship and a printed patriotic marching song. The song translates as > \\"Both in defence and offence, we can depend on our floating castle of black > steel (i.e. Japan). We must defend to the end all sides of the Japanese > empire, which is our floating castle.\\" There is also a short hand written poem indicating that Tsuchiya is the writer's third son to enlist, \\"I have seen my sons leave for the battlefields three times on a fine day of play\\". Also on the cloth is \\"To Tsuchiya Akira from all the staff of the Minenobu office.\\"Unknown. n.d. Autographed furoshiki (wrapping cloth) carried by Japanese soldier Tsuchiya Akira, South Bougainville, 1945. Modern furoshiki can be made of a variety of cloth, including silk, chirimen, cotton, rayon, and nylon. Furoshiki are often decorated with traditional designs or by shibori. There is no one set size for furoshiki, they can range from hand sized to larger than bed-sheets. The most common sizes are 45 cm (17.7 inch) and 68–72 cm (26.7-28.3 inch). Although there are still furoshiki users in Japan, their numbers declined in the post- war period, in large part due to the proliferation of the plastic shopping bag. In recent years, it has seen a renewed interest as environmental protection became a concern. Furoshiki are, however, commonly used to wrap and transport lunch boxes (bento) and often double as a table mat for the lunch. On March 6, 2006, the Japanese Minister of the Environment, Yuriko Koike, created a furoshiki cloth to promote its use in the modern world.Minister Koike created the \\"Mottainai Furoshiki\\" as a symbol of Japanese culture to reduce wastes, Ministry of the Environment A research group in Argentina promotes the use of furoshiki through the investigation of techniques and ways to adapt to Argentine customs. In 2010 in Venezuela, ethical brand led by Maki Caballero de Criscaut created the project EcoSchool / ECOlegio. An environmentally conscious program educating kids kindergarten and up, about their impact in the World. Specifically the impact of the use of plastic bags. Promoting the Furoshiki as the ultimate reusable bag.  Design  The design of the print can vary. The Nihonga painter Inshō Dōmoto designed fabrics. Initially they were of designs that did not use much colour, but as the colour dyeing techniques evolved, towards the end of his life he designed more colourful designs.http://page8.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/h228855709 The Austrian painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser also made some designs.http://www.hundertwasser.com/apa/view-26  See also  * Fukusa, a type of Japanese textile * Bojagi, a similar square cloth in Korea * Gift wrapping, the act of enclosing a gift in some sort of material * Tenugui, a thin Japanese hand towel made of cotton * Yukata, a Japanese summer garment ReferencesExternal links * Some common furoshiki folding patterns * Youtube: Kakefuda, Kyoto (Another tutorial videoclip).

Battles have taken place at wide range of locations and events around the country. During the period 1984-1999 it shared many members in common with the Clan's political wing, the better- known McGillicuddy Serious Party. Image:McGillicuddies at Battle of Wellington St Beach Hamilton NZ October 2002.jpgMcGillicuddies at the Battle of Wellington St Beach, Hamilton, New Zealand, October 2002. Origins The McGillicuddy Highland Army (McGHA) was established in Hamilton, New Zealand, in 1978 as the McGillicuddy Highland Regiment, the battling wing of the Clan McGillicuddy. Its foundation was inspired by a pacifist battle that Clan leader Graeme Cairns, the Laird of Hamilton, had taken part in Dunedin earlier that year involving Alf's Imperial Army (Alf's). Weapons As required by the rules of pacifist warfare, the McGHA fights its battles using strictly non-harmful weapons, such as newspaper swords and cardboard shields for personal duelling. 'Mass effect' weapons such as water bombs, flour bombs, porridge bombs, funnelators (huge slingshots), and meths mortars armed with soft or rotten fruit are also used (though water and flour bombs are the most common). 'Psychological Weapons' such as the Can-Can charge, heavy duty assault poetry, mass singing and vicious taunting are also permissible. Uniforms The basic uniform of the McGHA regiments was a white shirt, kilt, and bonnet with a white cockade, with a doublet faced in the regiment's colour. How strongly military the uniform looked varied depending upon the individuals in a regiment; whilst there were very strong variations between the regiments themselves. Appearances ranged from 17th century Scottish Jacobites to 19th century Victorian British Scots, to South American Presidential Guard, to hippies or anarchists, with the only article in common being a kilt. One regiment even wore tartan trousers combined with Russian- style jackets and fur hats. Enemies The Clan McGillicuddy being a Jacobite Clan, its Army naturally fought for the restoration of the Stuarts to the throne of New Zealand and Scotland. A strong rivalry with Alf's Imperial Army\\"Angry Clan Wages War on Alf's Army\\" Evening Post (Wellington)3 June 1988 soon developed, as the McGHA evolved their own idiosyncratic interpretation of pacifist warfare.

Hutt News 20 March 1987 Brief history The 1st Flying Claymores were the first company in the regiment, quickly followed by the 2nd McBormann Fusiliers, both based in Hamilton. The name was changed to the McGillicuddy Highland Army in 1985, shortly after the Wellington-based 3rd Laird's Own Borderers (established in March 1984 Salient, Magazine of Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association 9 April 1984 ) was officially incorporated into the Army, and its members welcomed into the Clan. The success of the Clan's political wing, the McGillicuddy Serious Party in the 1987 and 1990 NZ General Elections saw a rapid growth in McGHA membership, with new regiments founded in Auckland (The 5th Thane of Gordonton's Own Islemonn), Christchurch (The 6th Jahkirk Highland Tossers), and Dunedin (The Blues and Greys). At its peak in late 1992, the McGHA consisted of some eight uniformed regiments boasting a combined membership of over 100 pacifist warfarers. Current status As of 2009, the Clan McGillicuddy has no 'standing' uniformed regiments, although the Army has never been formally demobbed. Many Clan members still answer the Laird's calls to arms, and the Clan will still happily meet in battle any opponents who wish to challenge them.

Friedrich (June 30, 1891 – August 8, 1966), better known by the ring name Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis, was an American professional wrestler and trainer. During his wrestling career, which spanned four decades, Lewis was a four-time World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion and overall recognised officially as a five-time world champion. Considered to be one of the most iconic and recognizable sports stars of the 1920s, often alongside boxer Jack Dempsey and baseball player Babe Ruth, Lewis notably wrestled in over 6,000 matches (many of which were real contests) and lost only 32 of them. He was posthumously inducted as a charter member into the following hall of fames: Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Professional Wrestling, George Tragos/Lou Thesz and WWE's Legacy Wing. One of the most legitimately feared grapplers of all time, Lewis was known for his catch wrestling prowess and trained many future champions, most notably Lou Thesz, Danny Hodge and Gene LeBell.  Professional wrestling career  Lewis pins an opponent in 1929 Born in Nekoosa, Wisconsin to German parents, Friedrich was an active youngster, participating in amateur wrestling, basketball and track. Friedrich would end up solely focusing on wrestling, finding success competing in local competitions staged as entertainment against other farmers. Friedrich began wrestling professionally at the age of 14, using the ring name Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis, first in Louisville, Kentucky, partly in tribute of 1890s star Evan \\"Strangler\\" Lewis and so his parents wouldn't discover it was him.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 61, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . It was also stated in the A&E; documentary The Unreal Story of Professional Wrestling that he was dubbed the Strangler after a match in France where he applied a sleeper hold, and the French, who were unfamiliar with the hold, thought he was strangling his opponent. He was the pivotal figure in the \\"Gold Dust Trio\\", along with promoters Toots Mondt and Big Billy Sandow, a travelling road show that was the precursor to wrestling tours, and which revolutionized professional wrestling by creating undercards, promoting full events instead of one match shows. They also developed the first professional wrestling storylines, creating worked feuds between wrestlers. Because of the legit skills Lewis possessed, the Trio could put the title on who ever they wanted, because Lewis had the ability to defeat anyone who would not follow the script. Lewis captured his first recognized World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship on December 13, 1920, defeating Joe Stecher. Stecher would prove to be Lewis' biggest rival, both in and out of the ring, with Stecher running his own shows against the Gold Dust Trio, beginning quite possibly the first promotional rivalry. Lewis and Stecher wrestled one of the longest matches in professional wrestling history, where they battled for five and a half hours, ending in a draw. The climax of their feud came on April 15, 1925, when Gold Dust Trio star and former champion Stanislaus Zbyszko was asked to lose to the Gold Dust Trio's own handpicked champion, Wayne Munn, a former football star, in an effort to give Munn credibility. Zbyszko balked at the idea of losing to an unskilled wrestler, and secretly jumped to the Joe Stecher camp. Zbyszko double-crossed the Gold Dust Trio, using his knowledge of holds to legit defeat and, in the process, humiliate Munn. Eventually, Lewis and Stecher settled their differences, and agreed to do business with each other, with Stecher dropping the world title back to Lewis on February 20, 1928. In 1931, Lewis and partner, Billy Sandow, signed former Notre Dame All-American running back \\"Jumping Joe\\" Savoldi to his first professional wrestling contract. Lewis was credited with training Savoldi in Los Angeles during the first half of 1931. After winning the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in April 1931, he faced Henri Deglane in May for a title defense in Montreal in a two-out-of-three falls match. After two falls, Deglane had feigned being bitten by Lewis, when in reality he had been bitten in the locker room. This led to Deglane being awarded the title via disqualification and a dispute over who was actually acknowledged as champion over the next two years. In 1933, one of the Strangler's most infamous matches took place in Madison Square Garden. He was fighting Ray Steele for the title. The two men began circling each other, but no fighting happened, which made the fans bored. Steele finally ended the match by punching Lewis, causing the referee to disqualify him twenty minutes into the match. On September 20, 1934, Lewis wrestled Jim Londos in front of an audience of 35,275 at Wrigley Field, and drawing a record gate of $96,302, which would stand until 1952.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 73, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . In 1937, the Strangler had six contests in New Zealand. He beat Floyd Marshall, John Spellman, Glen Wade, and Rusty Wescoatt, and lost twice to the Canadian champion Earl McCready, who was then established as the top wrestler in New Zealand. In 1936, he also competed in one of the last known legitimate contests in professional wrestling, where wrestled Lee Wykoff. Lewis separated a clavicle during training but decided to go ahead with the contest. The match ended a draw.  Post wrestling  Lewis managing Lou Thesz in the 1950s Lewis went into semi-retirement in 1935, but came out of retirement in 1942, at the age of 51, despite being legally blind. He retired from professional wrestling for good in 1948, at 57 years old. At the November 1949 NWA Convention in St. Louis, Lewis was named the ambassador of good will for the NWA.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 75, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . In later years, he would become the manager of his good friend and reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Lou Thesz. Lewis went blind from trachoma.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 76, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, . He was destitute and relied on his wife and acquaintances to survive. He died in Oklahoma on August 8, 1966 at the age of 75. In 1999, Lewis was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Hall of Fame. Today, a Wisconsin state historical marker commemorates his achievements in his hometown of Nekoosa on Prospect Avenue. In 2002, Lewis was voted in by professional wrestlers, historians and writers and inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Amsterdam, New York.

The team was owned by Greg Pollex. ppc Racing came about from a merger of Pollex's Busch Series team with a car owned by Steve DeSouza and Ted Campbell in 1999. The team won the 2000 Busch Series championship with driver Jeff Green and they finished second in the standings four times. The team shut down during the 2007 NASCAR Busch Series season due to a lack of funding. Pollex later joined CJM Racing as a shop foreman before departing late in the season. Winston Cup Series ppc made its Winston Cup Series racing debut in 1993 at the Mello Yello 500. Chad Little was the driver of the No. 19 Kleenex Ford, and finished 33rd. They would also run the 1994 Daytona 500 in the No. 97 Ford with sponsorship from Tracy Lawrence, where they finished 29th. In 1995, they had their best finish at Talladega Superspeedway, their second of two races. After making five 1996 races in the Sterling Cowboy Pontiac Grand Prix, ppc moved to the Cup Series full-time with Little in the John Deere car. Despite an eighth-place finish at Bristol Motor Speedway, the team had trouble qualifying for races, and Pollex would sell the operation to Jack Roush in the final weeks of the season. (The team would eventually become Kurt Busch's 2004 Nextel Cup winning team, only to be sold to Latitude 43 Motorsports six years later and then folded.) In 2005, ppc Racing returned to the Nextel Cup series with John Andretti driving the No. 14 VB Tobacco Products Ford. The team made the first three races at Daytona, Fontana, and Las Vegas. After two DNQ's in a row at Atlanta and Bristol, VB Brand shut down. The team did not make it through the season, as there was no other sponsorship to be found. Busch Series Car No. 10 History = ppc debuted at Darlington Speedway in 1993. It was No. 23 Ford sponsored by If Its Paper and driven by Chad Little. At the time, Pollex co-owned the team with NFL quarterback Mark Rypien. Little competed in 12 races with the team that season, posting three top-ten finishes. Going full-time with Bayer Select sponsoring in 1994, Little finished third in the Busch Series points, finishing in the top-ten in half of the races run that season. The next season was even better, as Little collected six victories and a runner-up finish in the points. When Pollex moved Little and the team up to the Cup Series in 1997, the team did not run the Busch Series. Pollex returned in 1999 with a new operation. This time it was the No. 32 Kleenex Chevy driven by Jeff Green. Despite failing to qualify for the spring Rockingham race, Green won three races and finished second in the points in what was a comeback season for both Green and the team. For 2000, the team underwent some changes, as it bought the No. 57 car driven by Jason Keller, and Green's car was now No. 10 and sponsored by NesQuik. Green won six races and the championship by a then-record 616 points over Keller. After yet another successful 2001 season where Green visited Victory Lane four times and wound up second in the points in the team's new Fords, he departed for Richard Childress Racing's Winston Cup team. His replacement was Scott Riggs, an up-and-coming driver from the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. Riggs won twice and finished 10th on his way to winning the Busch Series Rookie of the Year standings. After two more wins and a sixth-place finish in points, Riggs left for MB2/MBV Motorsports, and the team disappeared briefly, before coming back in 2005. Rookie driver Michel Jourdain Jr. was tabbed the car's pilot, and he posted one-top ten finish before being replaced by Brent Sherman with sponsor Serta Mattresses midway through the season. In 2006, Sherman left ppc and went to the Nextel Cup Series with BAM Racing, being replaced by John Andretti. Andretti had limited success in his rookie season and came into the season finale tied with Danny O'Quinn in rookie points. Although Andretti finished 16th and O'Quinn 36th, O'Quinn still edged Andretti by 1 point to win Rookie of the Year. For the 2007 season, ppc Racing announced an alliance with Biagi Brothers Racing and Braun Racing. The No. 10 would become part of the Braun stable keeping the No. 10's owner points and running equipment from the recently shut down Biagi Brothers team, switching from Ford to Toyota. The sponsorship, number, and driver were to remain the same however Andretti was released following the first race of the 2007 season. Dave Blaney's No. 32 team for Braun would switch to the number No. 10 that following week at Fontana. = Car No. 22 History = The No. 22 car debuted in 1991 as the No. 14 at Lanier Speedway as the No. 54 Air Products Buick owned by driver Jason Keller and his father. Keller started eighth but finished 29th after a crash. The next year, Keller ran five races, but only finished one. In 1993, the team switched to No. 57 and ran 12 races. Despite the abbreviated schedule, Keller had one top-ten finish and finished 33rd in points. In 1994, Keller and his team signed Budget Gourmet to sponsor his Chevrolets, and posted three poles and had a seventeenth-place finish in the points. In 1995, Keller won his first race at the Kroger 200 and finished fourth in points. Despite not visiting victory lane again in 1996, Keller drove his Slim Jim-sponsored Chevy into a sixth-place points finish. Keller struggled the next two seasons, as he did not finish in the top-ten in points, and was forced to run 1998 without major sponsorship. After that year, owner Steve DeSouza bought his operation, and signed IGA as sponsor. It was the right combination, as Keller won at Bristol and IRP, and climbed to eighth in points. In 2000, the team merged with ppc and got new sponsorship from Excedrin. While Keller's teammate Jeff Green dominated the Busch Series that year, Keller quietly had a strong season, winning one race and finishing a career-best second in points. Albertsons was the next sponsor to climb on board, and Keller won another race and finished third in points while switching to Fords, before winning four more races and returning to second in points in 2002. After a respectable 2003 season, the team switched to No. 22 and brought Miller High Life on board to sponsor. Keller went winless for the first time since 1998, and departed for Team Rensi Motorsports at the end of the year. He was replaced by Kenny Wallace and sponsor Stacker 2. Wallace had five top-fives and finished seventh in points. He continued to run with ppc with Autozone backing the car in 2006, but Autozone departed at the end of the season and Wallace took a full-time Cup ride with Furniture Row Racing. After a number switch with Fitz Motorsports, the team was merged with Carl A. Haas Motorsports in order to run Kyle Krisiloff in the No. 14 Clabber Girl car. Craftsman Truck Series The No. 10 Ford Power Stroke Diesel by International truck is driven by Terry Cook in the Craftsman Truck Series. Cook joined the team in 2003 leaving K Automotive Racing with 4 wins, 9 top 5s, 17 top 10s, and an 8th-place points finish. During the first 3 years with ppc, Cook would go on a winless slump, like the one he suffered from 1998 to 2002. Between the 2003 and 2005 seasons, Cook would amass a total of 3 poles, 4 top 5s, and 28 top 10s. Although the 10 team's first year together was slightly successful, 2004 and 2005 would be complete disasters for the team, with 2 consecutive years finishing outside the top 10 in points. In 2006, Cook would receive his first victory in 4 years at Kansas Speedway and finish 8th in the points. He would leave for HT Motorsports at season's end. The following year, ppc's truck equipment was purchased by Circle Bar Racing with International's Maxx Diesel sponsoring David Starr in the No. 10 truck.

One of the main dealers in virtual economy services, members of the gaming community were often critical of IGE, as its services may allow players to break rules in online games. During its peak time, it had offices in Los Angeles, Shanghai, and headquarters and customer service center in Hong Kong.. It was reformed in 2007 by Jonathan Yantis.  History  IGE was founded in 2001 by Brock Pierce, a former child movie star,Brock Pierce and Alan Debonneville. They met each other while playing Everquest and decided to form IGE. Pierce was the main investor in the company while Debonneville was managing the operations. Brock Pierce was also the co- founder of the controversial failed dot-com Digital Entertainment Network (DEN).Digital Entertainment Network: Startup or Non-Starter? Media reports claim that Marc Collins-Rector is a silent partner in IGE. IGE initially used an address in the city of Marbella, Spain, where Collins-Rector and Pierce shared a villa until it was raided by Interpol in 2002. In January 2004, IGE acquired its major competitor, Yantis Enterprises, then run by another secondary market figure, Jonathan Yantis,IGE - About Us for $2.4 million and 37% share of the company. Yantis later sold his shares back to IGE in exchange for 22 monthly payments of $1 million due to conflicts and disagreement.

Later Debonneville sued Pierce for various reasons related to an investment made by Goldman Sachs a year earlier, which Debonneville ended winning in a settlement. IGE tried to restructure its upper management team by recruiting new executives. IGE began to lose revenue due to the frequent deletion of accounts involved in trading. In May 2007, a lawsuit was filed against IGE by Antonio Hernandez for \\"substantially impairing and diminishing [player's] collective enjoyment of the game.\\" In June 2007, Pierce was replaced as CEO by Steve Bannon, who had been placed on the board following the Goldman Sachs investment. During the final months of IGE leading to its reformation, the board of directors decided to sell the company to their former partner Jonathan Yantis. IGE's parent company was then renamed Atlas Technology Group Inc,We could view the owner domain via domaintools. which is owned by Yantis, while Brock went with Affinity Media. Affinity Media was said to be one of the parent companies of IGE, though the company no longer has any ownership stake. Affinity Media's senior vice president of business development John Maffei, noted that \\"we’re no longer in that business.\\" Affinity retains control of Allakhazam.com, Thottbot.com, and has since purchased Wowhead.com. In April 2014, IGE announced a formal service agreement with virtual currency provider EpicToon.com, who confirmed they will be handling IGE's virtual currency line of business.  Revenue  Like all the other in-game currency traders, the vast majority of IGE's revenue comes from buying/selling World of Warcraft gold. Its website traffic, and allegedly its revenues, have been declining since 2006 due to the increased competition from the in-game currency traders based in China and the constant bombardment of anti-real-money trading measures by Blizzard Entertainment, the publisher of World of Warcraft.

He is perhaps best known for writing the narration in Alain Resnais's 1955 documentary film, Night and Fog. He was a major contributor to the subversive, philosophical French publication Tel Quel. In 1941, during the Nazi occupation of France, Cayrol joined the French Resistance, but he was subsequently betrayed, arrested, and sent to the Gusen concentration camp in 1943. He was one of the youngest French inmates at that camp, and consequently was made to do some of the hardest work along with the construction of roads and railways. When Cayrol wanted to die by refusing any further food, his life was saved by Dr. Johann Gruber, the \\"Saint of Gusen.\\" Gruber gave Cayrol some \\"Gruber soup\\" in the washroom of barrack No. 20, and intervened for Cayrol to get him transferred to an easier job. Cayrol thereafter worked at the final-inspection of Steyr- Daimler-Puch at KL Gusen I (the \\"Georgenmuehle\\" command), where he was able to write literature during breaks. Between February 1944 and April 1945, Cayrol created a large volume of poetry at Gusen I. One of his poems from this era is the text for \\"Chant d' Espoir\\", which was set to music by a fellow Gusen I inmate, Remy Gillis, in 1944. Alerte aux ombres 1944–1945, a collection of Cayrol's Gusen texts, was published in 1997.Cayrol, Jean. Alerte aux ombres 1944-1945. Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1997.
