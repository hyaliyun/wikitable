It is, in part, a coming of age story set in the World War II Siege of Leningrad. It follows the adventures of two youths as they desperately search for a dozen eggs at the behest of a Soviet NKVD officer, a task which takes them far behind enemy lines. Plot The story is introduced as the recollections of the narrator's grandfather Lev Beniov, a contemporary Russian Jewish √©migr√©. It is set in the first week of 1942, with the 17-years-old Lev trying to survive the Siege of Leningrad after his father is \\"disappeared\\" by the NKVD and his mother and sister flee the city. Lev is arrested for looting the corpse of a Luftwaffe pilot. Thrown in prison, he meets Kolya Vlasov, a young Cossack soldier arrested for deserting his unit. The two are brought to Colonel Grechko of the NKVD who barters with them: if they are able to obtain a dozen eggs so the colonel's wife can bake their daughter's wedding cake, Lev and Kolya will be given their freedom. If they are unable to find the eggs (a luxury in the starving Leningrad), both will be executed. During Lev and Kolya's search for the eggs, they encounter a pair of cannibals and a boy in the black market selling \\"library candy\\", food made from the bindings of books. They leave the city and go behind enemy lines. At the brink of death, Lev and Kolya encounter a small cottage hosting four young women, who are kept there by the German soldiers to rape at night. Lev and Kolya plot to attack the next Germans to come, but then a group of Soviet partisans launches their own attack. After a German counter-strike, only Lev, Kolya, and Vika, a female sniper, remain alive. They intersect with a German convoy shepherding Russian prisoners for 'processing' by the Einsatzgruppen, to which they attach themselves. To gain the coveted dozen eggs, Lev must defeat an Einsatzgruppen commander in a chess match. Lev wins the game and, in a subsequent scuffle, kills the commander with a knife he has hidden in his boot, while losing his index finger. He, Kolya, and Vika kill the other guards and escape with the eggs. Vika leaves to find another partisan group, but promises to find Lev after the war. As Lev and Kolya approach Leningrad on their way back, Kolya is shot by a Soviet soldier. He is taken to hospital but bleeds to death en route, while Lev discovers that the colonel had three dozen eggs airlifted in. The epilogue is set three years later. Lev is in his apartment when Vika turns up, bringing him, as a joke, a carton of twelve eggs. She warns him that she does not cook, suggesting they later married, as at the start Lev's grandson says his grandmother would never cook.  Release  City of Thieves was released by Plume on May 15, 2008. The audiobook, narrated by Ron Perlman, was released by Penguin Audio on January 8, 2009. Reception The book was well received by most critics, including Jesse Berrett of San Francisco Gate and Boris Fishman of The New York Times.Wartime Rations - Book Review - 'City of Thieves,' by David Benioff, NYTimes.com, July 6, 2008. According to Jennifer Reese of Entertainment Weekly, \\"Benioff has produced a funny, sad, and thrilling novel. A-\\". However, Donna Rifkind of Los Angeles Times wrote that while the book \\"features a snappy plot, a buoyant friendship, a quirky courtship, an assortment of menacing bad guys, an atmosphere that flickers between grainy realism and fairy-tale grotesquerie and a grim but irrepressible sense of humor,\\" it left her \\"thoroughly and discouragingly unmoved.\\"\\"'City of Thieves' by David Benioff  A teen fights for survival during the Siege of Leningrad\\", latimes.com, May 11, 2008.

It is now a popular hiking trail, extending 4.5 miles along the North Fork of the American River. Iowa Hill (formerly, Iowa City) is an unincorporated community in Placer County, California, United States. The town is located 6.5 miles northwest of Foresthill 9 miles east of Colfax and 58 miles northeast of Sacramento. It lies at an elevation of 2861 feet. The community relies completely upon solar panels and generators for power. Population is around 200 people. Iowa Hill Road claims a small handful of lives every decade, and along with the community's \\"off grid\\" status, prevents the town from growing in population. The community boasts many hardcore cyclists and is appealing to visitors due to the abundance of recreational opportunities. Iowa Hill Road is a very steep, one-lane, winding road embedded within the mountains. There are no safety guardrails. Since ambulance service from Colfax takes a long time, emergency medical transport is supplemented by CALSTAR, the area's air rescue helicopter. A landing pad is located next to the town fire house. Culture Locals are regularly spotted out and about the town and North Fork of the American River. Popular activities are hiking, cycling, swimming, whitewater rafting, kayaking, gold panning/mining and fishing. About 50% of the town's homes are vacation homes. The community relies solely on solar panels and generators for power since Iowa Hill is not connected to the electrical grid. Mail service is three times per week. The Iowa Hill Store acts as a restaurant, bar, post office and ultra mini-market. Tourism Iowa Hill enjoys a small but significant cult following of outdoor enthusiasts. Within five miles of town is the North Fork of the American River and the Mineral Bar Campground, Sugar Pine Reservoir recreation area, and numerous trails including the famous Stevens Trail between Colfax and Iowa Hill. The Mineral Bar Campground is part of the Auburn State Recreation Area, a State Park managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, which began charging for parking in 2013. Stevens Trailhead remains free to park. It begins adjacent the Iowa Hill Store spanning all the way to Colfax, crossing the North Fork in between. History In 1851 or 1852, miners from Iowa discovered gold here. The Iowa City post office opened in 1854. Stores, breweries, saloons, fraternal lodges, homes, a church, school, and Temperance Hall are examples of businesses thriving in Iowa Hill in the mid-1850s. In 1857, a fire destroyed about one hundred buildings in the central business district of the town, but no fatalities were recorded. The town was producing about one hundred thousand dollars per week in gold in 1867. In 1901, the post office changed its name to Iowa Hill. In 1920 a fire took hold that virtually destroyed the town. What remains is an old Wells Fargo vault, the old fire house, a couple of other old buildings, and two cemeteries. Iowa Hill is now registered as California Historical Landmark #401. Telephone service In 1955, the first dial telephone service was installed running between Iowa Hill and Colfax, California, it was one line put in by local residents led by Robert F. Yonash.Colfax Record Newspaper, Colfax, CaliforniaPersonal memories of the daughter of Robert Yonash The single landline was in operation for over ten years, but eventually became nonoperational due to the lack of maintenance. The long line was suspended from the town of Colfax over the American River Canyon where it would occasionally snap apart. The community did not have landline telephone service again until 2011, relying instead on radio communications and spotty mobile/cell phones. In October 2011, landline service again became available, paid for in part by a grant from the California Public Utilities Commission. This service uses microwave towers to the Foresthill Telephone Company in Foresthill, California. Mining There are dozens of famous gold mines in the area, including \\"Big Dipper\\" and \\"Gleeson\\" Frank Norris wrote a short story in 1903 titled The Wife of Chino about local miners who went into town to use the Iowa Hill Post Office. Climate This region experiences significant variation in weather. Winter generally produces as much as 1‚Äì2 feet of snow with temperatures as low as 15 degrees. Summers vary between 87-104 degrees. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Iowa Hill has a hot summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csa\\" on climate maps.

In 1990, she co-founded the Ostkreuz photographers agency. She is remembered for documenting developments in East Berlin during the Communist era and for her international assignments for Stern and later for Geo. Early life Bergemann completed clerical training in East Berlin between 1958 and 1960. She developed an interest in photography while working on the editorial staff of the East German entertainment periodical Das Magazin. In 1966 she began to study photography under the photographer and university teacher Arno Fischer, who became lifelong partner. Career as photographer After first contributing to leading East German periodicals of the time, Das Magazin and Sonntag, in the early 1970s, her photographs started to appear in the women's fashion magazine Sibylle where she soon developed her own style. Her portraits were not analytical but rather descriptive, showing people as they appeared in real life.\\"Sibylle Bergemann: Eine leise K√ºnstlerin\\" , Zeit Online, 5 November 2010. Retrieved 8 November 2010. She moved on from fashion to photograph first her own country, East Germany, and later the rest of the world. In 1990, together with Ute Mahler and Harald Hauswald, she founded the Ostkreuz agency, which now represents a score of photographers. Perhaps Bergemann's most important legacy is the series of black-and-white photographs she took of everyday life in East Germany as it evolved over the years. Later, she compiled photographic reportages about New York City, Tokyo, Paris and S√£o Paulo; and even more recently, turning from black and white to colour, she travelled through Africa and Asia on assignments for Geo.\\"Muere la fot√≥grafa alemana Sibylle Bergemann que document√≥ la vida en la RDA\\", ABC.es, 3 November 2010.

It was held by Henry de la Charite in the thirteenth century, so 'Charity' is thus a family name.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.445. In 904, Edward the Elder probably granted the area of the present parish to Hyde Abbey as part of the manor of Micheldever. The Church of England parish church of St Mary and St Michael dates mainly from the 12th and 13th centuries. According to the church's guidebook, the Norman nave and chancel may have been added to a small Saxon church to form the north aisle of an enlarged church. The church stands in a field just to the east of the village. Stoke Charity also had a manor house and home farm, which employed most of the population as farm labourers up until the late 19th century.

She was thought to be a sickly child and was sent to Florida to study for a time, before returning to Simmons College as a social work student. She also worked part-time in Italian and Irish immigrant communities in the South End of Boston, and in the mid-1930s received an M.A. degree from the University of Chicago. Lloyd Morain, Memorial address for Mary Morain, 2000 In 1938, she moved to Hollywood to work with Donald McLean as one of his staff of therapists working under the principles of General Semantics. While there she met Lloyd Morain. During World War II she worked as a teacher and social worker in New York City, and they married after Lloyd's return from service in Europe in 1946. After working part-time for the New England Home for Little Wanderers, an institution that cared for vulnerable mothers, she became a volunteer for Planned Parenthood, later becoming president of the Planned Parenthood Association in Boston, as well as the League of Women Voters. She became a leading member of Planned Parenthood, touring and lecturing on birth control around the world, often in the company of Margaret Sanger. She and her husband were also founding Directors of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, established in 1952. International Humanist and Ethical Union: Lloyd and Mary Morain The couple returned to California, to live in San Francisco, and co-wrote Humanism As The Next Step (1954).

Work  Since the early 1980s his interest has shifted to political psychology. First, he was interested in shared beliefs in groups and societies, in general studying their formation, function and change. Later he directed most of his attention to the study of the socio-psychological foundations of intractable conflicts and peace building, including reconciliation. = Socio-psychological infrastructure in times of intractable conflict = In the latter area, he studied how socio-psychological infrastructure evolve in times of intractable conflict. This infrastructure was found to consist of shared societal beliefs of the ethos of the conflict, Bar-Tal. D. (2004). Ethos of Conflict, The Beyond Intractability Project, The Conflict Information Consortium, University of Colorado collective memory, and emotional collective orientations. Bar-Tal has examined the contents, acquisition, functions, of societal mechanisms, as well as their contribution to the crystallization of social identity and development of the culture of a society in conflict during the conflict. Kershner, I. (2013). Academic Study Weakens Israeli Claim That Palestinian School Texts Teach Hate, The New York Times = Socio-psychological barriers to peacemaking = Bar-Tal has also studied socio-psychological barriers to peacemaking and ways to overcome them. He also examined the required changes in this socio-psychological repertoire for conflict resolution and reconciliation. Specifically, he proposed a conceptual framework allowing for reconciliation, peace education and eventually peace culture to evolve. In addition, in order to understand maintenance of conflicts Bar-Tal studied acquisition of the conflict repertoire of children and adolescents. Bar-Tal developed with his collaborators theoretical frameworks for concepts like siege mentality, intractable conflict, security, patriotism, delegitimization, ethos of conflict, changing collective memory, collective emotional orientation, socio-psychological infrastructure, culture of conflict, coping psychologically with occupation, acquisition of intergroup psychological repertoire, political socialization of young children in intractable conflict, transitional context, collective identity, process of peace building, reconciliation, ethos of peace, culture of peace, barriers to peace making and ways to overcome them, peace education, struggle of narratives, routinization and self-censorship. Eldar, A. (2011). Electricity in the air, Ha'aretz = Research of conflicts and their resolution = In 1999 Bar-Tal has founded a learning community dedicated to the research of conflicts and their resolution. The community consists of ten to fifteen graduate and post- graduate students, mostly for doctoral degree, who have excelled in their studies. The students, arrive from leading universities in and outside Israel and study for various related degrees, carry their studies regarding conflicts and their resolution. The learning community serves as a framework for learning, reflecting, debating, and developing; carrying conceptual and empirical studies; socialization for academic career and societal involvement; and for social support.

This means the coverage of the 80-40-30-20-15-17-12 and 10 meter HF bands. Its construction is based on a metal-cased transceiver with a polymer front. In its standard configuration the rig is very basic ‚Äì even without a standard mike - with marginal control features and can handle the AM, CW and SSB modes on the above-mentioned bands. A 25 kHz frequency marker unit, a print to operate in FM mode and 1 fixed crystal operation mode are available as internal options. General frequency receiving coverage is impossible. Its frequency readout is available in digital display mode only. Intended to offer only the most essential operating features the FT-77 was released in 1982 by the Japanese Yaesu Musen Corporation for appx $ 250 as an economic and compact rig very suitable for mobile use. The set was in production until 1986 in both FT-77 and FT-77S versions (S version was the 10W output QRP type). Technical description Incoming rx signals are fed to one of 5 Low Pass filters and continues to the RF unit. Via several bandpass filters the signal goes through RF amplifier and mixer unit before being delivered to the IF unit and AF amplifier. The receiver front end uses Schottky barrier diodes which results in good performance in the presence of strong signals. The lownoise premix local oscillator optimizes its receiving performance. A 5 pole IF filter allows a variable IF bandwidth and an optional filter may be put in place for demanding operators. Rx is single conversion superheterodyne functioning in AM/CW/SSB mode and in double conversion mode when the FM print is installed. A variable 5-100W transmitter output is being generated by a combination of protected 2SC1589 (predriver), 2SD235Y (bias), 2SC2395 (driver) and 2SC2290 (final) transistors.

The Montmeneu, an isolated hill in the western area of the Central Depression. The Catalan Central Depression () is a natural depression between the Pre-Pyrenees and the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range in Spain. It widens towards the west, linking with the Ebro Depression, , of which it could be considered an eastern extension. The Catalan Central Depression is about 180 km long with an average width of 50 km. Description The Catalan Central Depression consists of a succession of high plateaus between 800 and 1,000 metres in altitude that gradually lose height westwards until the Ebro Depression. There are eroded river basins limiting these heights wherever the ground is made up of clay or marlstone. The Pla de Bages and the Conca de Barber√† are examples of these higher regions. The limits of the Central Depression are different whether considered from the point of view of their origin or their actual relief. Some mountain ranges outside of the depression, like Montserrat and Sant Lloren√ß del Munt, are formed by the same geologic materials that make up the Central Depression, even though geographically they are situated in the Pre-Coastal Range. These materials were piled up over the more ancient rocks of the Catalan Mediterranean System.Patronat de la Muntanya de Montserrat - Hist√≤ria i or√≠gens The Central Depression formed in the Tertiary, when a great gulf, that later became a sea, had its boundaries in the Pyrenees and the Catalan- Balearic Massif.M.

Marine sedimentation formed clay, and other limestone materials, like bluish marl where the sedimentation had been part of a quiet and slow process, as well as conglomerate in the areas of the mouths of ancient rivers coming down from the Pyrenees and the former Catalan- Balearic Massif.

History The family's ancestor was Peter, a Norman from Alifa, who first came to the Byzantine Empire during the Norman invasion of Robert Guiscard, but later entered the service of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118)... The earliest member of the family recorded was Alexios Petraliphas, according to John Kinnamos a general in charge of a military force sent by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì80) to his ally Kilij Arslan II, Sultan of R√ªm. According to The Byzantine Family of Raoul-Ral(l)es (1973) by Sterios Fassoulakis, Alexios Petraliphas married Anna Raoul, a daughter of John Roger Dalassenos (Raoul) and Maria Komnene. However, Kinnamos records that Anna was a daughter of John II Komnenos (r. 1118‚Äì43) and Piroska of Hungary. A son of Alexios Petraliphas and Anna Raoul reportedly married Helena of Bohemia. Helena was a daughter of Frederick of Bohemia and Elizabeth of Hungary; Elizabeth was a daughter of G√©za II of Hungary and Euphrosyne of Kiev. During the reign of Manuel I Komnenos, alongside Alexios, a Nikephoros Petraliphas is recorded as a distinguished general. Although the relation between them is unknown, perhaps they were among the four Petraliphas brothers from Didymoteichon recorded by Niketas Choniates. A Theodora Antiochitissa Petraliphaina is mentioned on a seal dated to c. 1200. Antiochitissa means \\"woman from Antioch\\". The family became prominent in the late 12th and the first half of the 13th century: the sebastokrator John Petraliphas was governor of Thessaly and Macedonia, and played a leading role in the deposition of Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185‚Äì1195 and 1203‚Äì1204) in 1195. Another sebastokrator Nikephoros Komnenos Petraliphas is also attested circa 1200.. The sebastokrator John's sister Maria Petraliphaina married the ruler of Epirus and Thessalonica Theodore Komnenos Doukas (r. 1215‚Äì1230), while John's daughter Theodora Petraliphaina married Michael II Komnenos Doukas (r. 1231‚Äì1266/1268). John's son Theodore was married to a daughter of Demetrios Tornikes, one of the leading ministers of John III Vatatzes (r. 1221‚Äì1254), and played a prominent role in the Nicaean-Epirote conflicts of the 1250s, first defecting to Nicaea and then back to his brother-in-law.. A marriage to Alexios the Slav, a vassal of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders (r. 1206‚Äì1216) by an unidentified Petraliphaina, possibly John's other daughter Maria, is also reported by George Akropolites.. A different branch of the family is attested in the Empire of Nicaea, where another John was megas chartoularios and military commander in the late 1230s..

Biography According to an official biography, Wirkus was born in 1896 in Rypin, a small town located in eastern Prussia, now in Poland, however, numerous ship passenger lists (records of the U.S. Customs Service) show his correct birth place as Pittston, Pennsylvania. He and his parents settled in Dupont, Pennsylvania, a coal mining community northwest of Wilkes-Barre, where he was raised. Location of the island of La Gon√¢ve, west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti Wirkus enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 1915 and served in the 1st Advance Base Brigade in Haiti and rose to the rank of Corporal in 1918 then to Gunnery Sergeant in 1920. During his service in the United States Marine Corps, he was promoted to a lieutenant in the Garde d'Haiti, commanding a squad of native troops on La Gon√¢ve. After rescuing a young woman in trouble, he found out that she was Queen Timemenne of La Gon√¢ve. He was welcomed by the population as Timemenne had told them how kind he was to her, and in part, due to the unusual circumstance that he had the same first name as the former Emperor of Haiti, Faustin Soulouque, later known as Faustin I (\\"Faustin the First\\"), who died in 1867. Somewhat bizarrely, the natives proclaimed him Faustin II in a Voodoo ritual and he ruled jointly with Queen Timemenne for three years.Department of the Navy -Naval Historical Society He became known for dispensing ready but gentle justice.Haiti; the politics of squalor, Robert I.

The dhunachi has a flared shape and is held by a stem with a large cavity at the top, and is traditionally made of earthenware. When made of brass or silver, it needs a longer handle because of the heat. It is lit by placing burning coal at the bottom, which ignites a layer of slow-burning coconut husk, on which incense (usually resin like Indian Frankincense or \\"Dhuno\\" (\\"‡§ß‡•Ç‡§®‡§æ\\")(\\"‡¶ß‡ßÅ‡¶®‡ßã\\")) is sprinkled.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History There is evidence that an earlier church was on the site dating from the 12th century, but the present church was built in 1692 by Bernard Whalley. Alterations were made to it in the 18th century. The church served the village of Billesley until its population declined in the 15th century, and also served the occupants of the nearby Billesley Hall. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in blue lias stone, and it has a tiled roof. Its architectural style is Georgian. The plan consists of a two-bay nave with an apse at the east end, a west porch and a south transept, which was initially a family pew and was later used as a vestry. At the west end is a bellcote. The apse contains a round-headed window, and there are two similar windows on both the north and south sides. Between the windows on the north is a blocked doorway, and on the south side the windows flank the transept. The transept has a gable decorated with urns and a finial, and it contains an oculus. At the west end the porch is also gabled, and this carries an urn finial and a ball finial. Above the porch is a smaller round-headed window. The bellcote is louvred and has a cornice, an ogival cupola, and a weathervane. =Interior= The interior of the church contains some re-used 12th-century masonry. In the transept is a fireplace with a bolection-moulded surround. There is a gallery at the west end. On the north side of the church are stalls, on the south side is a priest's desk and pews, and at the west end are box pews. The octagonal font is simple in design. In the transept are two pieces of carved stone. One is a tympanum dating from about 1140 that depicts a man being attacked by a snake and a dragon, and being defended by a dove. The other stone is carved on three sides. It dates from about 1150 and it contains a figure of Christ holding a cross shaft. It is probably part of a Harrowing of Hell. The single bell was cast in 1721 by Richard Sanders. When the church was active in 1945, its communion plate included a cup and cover dated 1634, and an alms plate inscribed 1700. Investigators looking through the church floor have found a crypt and have seen inside two sarcophagi and a chest; the crypt has not been opened in recent history but plans are underway to open it in 2011 as part of an inspection of the state of the church floor. Tradition There is a tradition that William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway in the earlier church on the site, and also that Shakespeare's granddaughter Elizabeth Barnard was married there. However, as the parish registers have not survived, this cannot be confirmed.

His nightly appearances as a weather forecasting official from the government's Meteorology and Hydrology Department usually right before the evening movie was due to start‚Äîused to annoy many viewers across Myanmar. Early life and education Tun Lwin was born in 17 January 1948 in Kula Village, Ngazun, British Burma, to parents Theing Maung and Aye Gyi. He is the eldest of two siblings, having a younger brother. He grew up in Mandalay and attended Lafom Memorial High School in Mandalay. He received a master's degree in meteorology from Florida State University in the US, and a PhD from Yangon University in July 2018. Career Tun has worked in Burma's Department of Meteorology and Hydrology since 1965 when he was 17 years old in 1965. He then served as Deputy-Director in the Ministry of Meteorology and Hydrology till 2003 when he was promoted to Director General of Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. One of the most notable occurrences during his appointment was Cyclone Nargis, the worst natural disaster to hit Myanmar in recorded history. Despite the high number of casualties and devastation, he was commended after initial criticism for his prediction and speedy warning of the Cyclone especially considering the limited resources and political bureaucracy of Burma at the time. After 44 years in total at the DMH, he retired in 2009. After his retirement, he actively engaged in raising awareness about the need to adequately prepare for natural disasters. He was a well-known, active \\"netizen\\" in Myanmar who operated a free, non-profit service as Myanmar Climate Change Watch (MCCW). In addition to giving talks and appearing on various media such as newspapers, journals, magazines, television and radio channels to educate the public on weather and climate, he also provided free weather updates through Facebook where he also sometimes posted updates and anecdotes about his own personal life and opinions. He has written numerous successful books on weather in Myanmar, worked with local radio stations on weather-related segments and regularly wrote articles on various topics not limited to just weather updates in Burmese magazines and newspaper journals. His book, The Girl Called La Ni√±a and Articles about Natural Disasters, won the Science Knowledge Prize in the Thuta Swesone literary award in 2007. Many of his presentations were at talks and seminars relating to climate change frequently both locally and internationally, in cities and villages in rural areas. Since his resignation from the DMH in 2009, Tun Lwin has served as a technical adviser to the Regional Integrated Multi-hazard Early Warning System (RIMES) at the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand. He also served as a consultant to the Myanmar Red Cross Society, CARE Myanmar, Action Aid Myanmar and Myanmar Egress's Network Activities Group. He has also been involved with the International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM), Myanmar Egress, World Vision Myanmar, Global Green and other organizations, focusing primarily on climate change and how to minimize damage caused by natural disasters. On December 10‚Äì11, 2009, Lwin presented his 30-page paper at a seminar hosted by the International Centre for Water Hazard (ICHARM) in Tsukuba, Japan, stressing the importance of awareness of storms, tsunamis and flooding in delta regions and potential natural disaster preparedness strategies in the region. In October 2010 he spoke to the Burmese media about the expected path of Cyclone Giri. In 2011, he founded Tun Lwin Foundation. On the environmental conservation front, he was seriously opposed to the Myitsone Dam project slated for construction at the confluence of two rivers that gives rise to the Irrawaddy River. Though his health was already in decline, he showed up at an anti-dam event in Yangon in 2017 to deliver a strong statement, insisting, \\"I cannot accept any dam project on the Irrawaddy River\\". In 2017, he received the 7Day Heroes award for his non-profit work for the country in his field of meteorology, weather and climate. Personal life He resided in Yangon, Myanmar with his wife, Mu Mu Than, and three children, two daughters and one son, of which the eldest is married with three children of her own. Tun Lwin died on November 4, 2019, in Yangon at the age of 71.

Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011), is a legal dispute that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. On April 27, 2011, the Court ruled, by a 5‚Äì4 margin, that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that prohibit contracts from disallowing class-wide arbitration, such as the law previously upheld by the California Supreme Court in the case of Discover Bank v. Superior Court. As a result, businesses that include arbitration agreements with class action waivers can require consumers to bring claims only in individual arbitrations, rather than in court as part of a class action. The decision was described by Jean Sternlight as a \\"tsunami that is wiping out existing and potential consumer and employment class actions\\" and by law professor Myriam Gilles as \\"the real game-changer for class action litigation\\". By April 2012, Concepcion was cited in at least 76 decisions sending putative class actions to individual arbitration. After the decision, several major businesses introduced or changed arbitration terms in their consumer contracts (some of which were based on the consumer-friendly terms found in the AT&T; Mobility agreement), although the hypothesis of massive adoption of consumer arbitration clauses following the decision has been disputed. Facts In 2006, Vincent and Liza Concepcion sued AT&T; Mobility over contract, contending that the cell phone company had engaged in deceptive advertising by falsely claiming that their wireless plan included free cell phones. Their suit became a class action. AT&T; asked the U.S. District Court for Southern California to dismiss the suit, because AT&T;'s contract required the Concepcions to submit any disputes to individual arbitration rather than filing any class action lawsuits. Unlike other arbitration agreements, AT&T; Mobility's arbitration agreement was designed to facilitate the pursuit of small claims in arbitration. The arbitration agreement provided that AT&T; Mobility would pay the entire cost of arbitration (unless the claim was determined to be frivolous). The arbitration would take place in the county where the consumer was located, by telephone, or through document submission, and forms for the arbitration were made available on AT&T; Mobility's website. The arbitrator was not limited in the damages it could award to a consumer, and if the consumer received an award greater than AT&T; Mobility's last written settlement offer, the award would be increased to $7,500, and the consumer would be entitled to double attorney's fees. This led the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to state that arbitration under AT&T; Mobility's agreement was \\"quick, easy to use, and prompts full or, as described by Plaintiffs, even excess payment to the customer without the need to arbitrate or litigate.\\" Nevertheless, the district court declined to dismiss the suit, ruling that California law prohibits contracts that unfairly exculpate one party from its wrongdoing, such as clauses that do not allow class action lawsuits alleging fraud in consumer adhesion contracts where the individual damages are small. AT&T; appealed the case, saying that the Federal Arbitration Act should preempt state law. On October 27, 2009, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court decision. AT&T;, represented by Andrew J. Pincus of Mayer Brown, then appealed to the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court granted review, appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta of Washington, D.C. was brought in to help represent the Concepcions and to argue the case in the Supreme Court on their behalf. The Court heard oral arguments on November 9, 2010. Justices Scalia and Sotomayor questioned Pincus (attorney for AT&T; Mobility) about when unconscionability doctrines are made under state law. Pincus argued that the California law was not being applied uniformly. Scalia challenged that assertion when he asked, \\"Are we going to tell the State of California what it has to consider unconscionable?\\". Other justices questioned different procedural issues arising from the unconscionability discussion and the scope of the rule AT&T; was proposing. Deepak Gupta, representing the Concepcions, argued that the contract AT&T; imposed on Respondents was clearly unfair. He asserted that state law should be a guidepost in these questions. Some of his arguments drew criticism from Chief Justice John Roberts. Gupta concluded by arguing that California \\"has made a judgment that if you preclude class-wide relief... that will gut the State's substantive consumer protection laws...\\" Judgment The majority opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. \\"Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration,\\" Scalia wrote. \\"We find it hard to believe that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision.\\" Justice Scalia focused on the impact California's unconscionability law was having on arbitration clauses - since the rule was invalidating a large proportion of arbitration agreements, the rule must violate the policy in favor of arbitration. Therefore, it was preempted by the FAA. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Breyer stated that class arbitrations are appropriate ways to resolve claims that are minor individually but significant in the aggregate. \\"Where does the majority get its contrary idea ‚Äî that individual, rather than class, arbitration is a fundamental attribute of arbitration?\\" He said that without class actions, minor frauds would not be remedied. \\"What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?\\" Significance Concepcion has been widely criticized in academic literature,See E McGaughey, 'Fascism-Lite in America (or the social idea of Donald Trump)' (2018) British Journal of American Legal Studies (arguing that like the Lochner era made social rights void, a new Concepcion era put rights up \\"for sale\\") and M Finkin, 'Workplace Justice: Does Private Judging Matter?' (2014) Zeitschrift f√ºr Vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft 2/2014 and calls for its reversal through an Arbitration Fairness Act have been made. Following Concepcion, many businesses introduced or renewed motions to move pending lawsuits to arbitration. In September 2011, J. Russell Jackson described the Supreme Court's ruling in Concepcion as \\"the decision that has launched a thousand motions\\", as defendants sought to compel arbitration of cases that had been pending \\"for some time\\", especially in California. In April 2012, Public Citizen published a list of 76 putative class actions where a court cited Concepcion in granting a motion to compel individual arbitration. University of Kansas law professor Christopher Drahozal wrote that the Public Citizen statistic overstated the impact of Concepcion, as several decisions applied state law that permitted class action waivers prior to Concepcion. Cardozo law professor Myriam Gilles wrote that the Concepcion decision had a greater impact on class actions than Wal-Mart v. Dukes, since Concepcion allowed businesses to avoid class actions by including arbitration clauses in boilerplate terms. The Concepcion decision also impacted the usage of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, including the usage of \\"consumer-friendly\\" arbitration terms like the ones in AT&T;'s agreement. Jean Sternlight said that the Concepcion decision would cause businesses to include arbitration clauses with class action waivers, saying that the Concepcion decision removed the possibility of \\"costly litigation\\" over whether such terms are enforceable. In a 2012 research paper, Gilles wrote that the majority opinion in Concepcion led to a \\"race to the top\\" in implementing arbitration procedures that are more friendly to consumer claims and more likely to allow their vindication. Gilles wrote that corporate lawyers encouraged companies to implement terms similar to the ones used by AT&T; Mobility and upheld in Concepcion. According to Gilles, many large consumer-oriented businesses changed their arbitration provisions in 2011 and 2012. However, Gilles noted that only 6 out of the 37 companies she examined had arbitration clauses that \\"offered anything close to AT&T;'s set of incentives, and none were quite as generous\\". Ann Marie Tracey and Shelley McGill wrote that businesses would introduce more consumer-unfriendly terms in their arbitration clauses since unconscionability \\"provided strong motivation for business to draft agreements fairly in the pre-Concepcion environment; that motivation does not exist in the post-Concepcion era.\\" Suzanna Sherry said that the broad holding of the decision would make harsh arbitration clauses, similar to the earliest consumer arbitration clauses, enforceable, since the unconscionability doctrine that had been used to strike down those harsh clauses could be found preempted based on Concepcion. Several large businesses introduced arbitration provisions after Concepcion, and several companies' addition of arbitration clauses was reported by the media to have been prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling in Concepcion. According to a September 2011 CNN article, a Sony spokesperson said that Sony added an arbitration clause to its PlayStation Network terms of service because \\"[t]he Supreme Court recently ruled in the AT&T; case that language like this is enforceable\\". PCWorld writer Jared Newman cited Sony and Microsoft as examples of companies that took advantage of Concepcion to add arbitration agreements with class action waivers. Drahozal and University of Georgia law professor Peter B. Rutledge wrote that Sony and Netflix added arbitration provisions following data breach class action litigation. Other companies reported to have added arbitration provisions to their consumer contracts after Concepcion include Umpqua Bank, Valve, eBay, PayPal, Instagram, and StubHub. American Arbitration Association Senior Vice President Richard Naimark said that a number of companies increased their usage of consumer arbitration after Concepcion, while before Concepcion, the number of consumer arbitrations administered by the AAA had been declining. Rutledge and Drahozal wrote that the adoption of arbitration in franchise contracts did not significantly increase after Concepcion or Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., a case decided in 2013 that closely followed Concepcion, casting doubt on the hypothesis that Concepcion would cause businesses to adopt arbitration en masse. In November 2015, Stephen L. Carter wrote that although he and other critics had predicted that businesses would introduce \\"increasingly burdensome and one-sided arbitration clauses\\", \\"this hasn't happened\\". Concepcion's prohibition on class actions has not necessarily led to a proportionate increase in individual claims filed through the arbitration system. AT&T;, for instance, saw only 204 complaints resolved through the arbitration system in 2018, compared to AT&T;'s customer base of over 150 million subscribers.

He is the author of over 500 publications and is one of the world's most cited diabetes researchers. Atkinson currently conducts research at the University of Florida College of Medicine, where he is Director for the Diabetes Institute at UF Health. He also is the Executive Director of the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) program. Atkinson has also been widely cited for his humanitarian contributions, particularly his efforts to improve diabetes care, management, and access to medications and supplies in developing nations. Background and education Mark Atkinson was born and raised in southeastern Michigan. He attended the University of Michigan ‚Äì Dearborn where he received a bachelor of Science in microbiology in 1983. Atkinson next received a Ph.D. from the Department of Pathology at the University of Florida in 1987. While at the University of Florida, Atkinson studied under diabetes researcher Dr. Noel Maclaren, who became his mentor and fostered Atkinson's interest in type 1 diabetes research. His work with Maclaren led Atkinson to develop his three goals of determining what causes type 1 diabetes, identifying a means to predict T1D, and developing a way to prevent and cure the disease. Academic career Atkinson has been teaching and conducting research in the Departments of Pathology and Pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine since 1988. He is currently the American Diabetes Association Eminent Scholar for Diabetes Research and the Jeffrey Keene Family Professor at the University of Florida, as well as the Director for the Diabetes Institute at that institution. Type 1 diabetes research Atkinson's research activities have a broad scope, but most fall under the umbrella of preventing and curing type 1 diabetes. Specific areas of focus include disease prediction, the role of environment in the initiation of type 1 diabetes, stem cells and beta cell regeneration, pancreatic pathology, clinical trials seeking to prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes, the identification of markers of immunological tolerance, and devising ways to instill proper immunoregulation. Atkinson has been the recipient of funding awards from entities such as the National Institutes of Health, JDRF, the American Diabetes Association, and the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. =Research approaches= Atkinson has conducted numerous studies that take different approaches to predicting, preventing, and curing type 1 diabetes. His earliest efforts focused on the use of autoantibodies, both anti-insulin and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), for that purpose. He was also amongst the first to describe cellular immune responses against GAD in both humans and the NOD mouse model of type 1 diabetes. He has extensively utilized NOD mice as a means to identify agents that could be translated to studies seeking to prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes but at the same time, has stated that such efforts need be approached with caution. His publication in the journal Nature Medicine noting the nearly 200 ways to prevent diabetes in that animal model elicited mixed responses from the research community. Atkinson was one of the first to propose ‚Äúcombination therapies‚Äù to prevent or reverse the disease, as well as the repurposing of existing treatments and agents already approved for other diseases and conditions. Atkinson has led or contributed to clinical trials utilizing several types of interventions to stop the progression of or reverse type 1 diabetes, including prophylactic insulin, GAD, cord blood, cord blood plus Omega-3 FA, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus GCSF. Atkinson is currently leading an NIH funded clinical research trial aiming to assess immune function during different stages of type 1 diabetes. The goal is to learn more about the genetics and immune function of blood cells, diet, and viruses and how they relate to the progression of T1D. Atkinson is also active in studies assessing the human intestinal microbiome, pancreatic pathology, human pancreatic weight and beta cell development, as well as improving methods of data management. =nPOD= Atkinson is the Executive Director for the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) program, the world's largest \\"open access\\" biobank of human tissues from persons with or at varying levels of risk for type 1 diabetes. nPOD is funded by JDRF and The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. Through nPOD, Atkinson and other collaborators support research utilizing transplant-grade human tissues obtained from organ donors, including pancreas, spleen, whole blood, serum, lymph nodes, pancreatic lymph nodes, thymus, skin and bone marrow. The goal is to better understand the causes of type 1 diabetes and identify potential approaches to curing the disease. Atkinson has directed nPOD since its founding in 2007, it has and continued to support over 250 different investigators in some 200 research projects in 20 countries worldwide. =Research collaborations= In addition to nPOD, Atkinson participates in a number of other collaborative research efforts. He is one of ten members of the Brehm Coalition for Type 1 Diabetes Research, and one of four initial members of the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust's Type 1 Diabetes Research Initiative. Atkinson also collaborates on a number of research initiatives with investigators around the globe as well as with his colleagues at the University of Florida's Diabetes Institute. Atkinson also serves as Director of the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) at the University of Florida. HuBMAP's mission is to develop a 3-D map of the human body at a single-cell level. Leadership and influence in the field Atkinson is the author of over 425 peer-reviewed publications as well as several book chapters. Expertscape ranks Atkinson as one of the ten most published diabetes researchers in the world, and with an all time h-index of 91, he is one of the most highly cited diabetes researchers in the world. Atkinson provides leadership to numerous entities that focus on research and service to the type 1 diabetes community, and currently provides administrative or advisory service to JDRF, the American Diabetes Association, Diapedia, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Immunology of Diabetes Society. He is a charter member of the NIH's Immune Tolerance Network Scientific Advisory Board, former Chair of the NIH's Human Islet Research Network (HIRN), and a steering committee member of NIH TrialNet. Atkinson also formerly served as an Associate Editor for the journal Diabetes. He now serves as ad hoc Editor-in-Chief for that journal as well as Diabetes Care. Commercial and industry work Along with his colleagues at the University of Florida Diabetes Institute, Atkinson is pursuing a vaccine strategy for preventing type 1 diabetes. The approach seeks to eliminate the autoimmune response directed at insulin that is present in patients with the disease by generating antigen-specific Tregs (regulatory T cells) in response to the antigens of interest rather than try to eliminate the autoreactive destructive cells. To further this line of research, Atkinson and other investigators started a spin-off company called OneVax, LLC.

The club was founded in 2010 and aims to support the interests of Swansea University Rowing Club, to enter some races and to meet up socially at various points throughout each year. History The university club was started in the 1970s and closed in the early 1980s. Since then Will Edmondson and his sister Anne-Marie restarted the club by breaking into the shed and getting out the old boats in 1989. They were helped by Andrew Williams (of Mumbles ARC). Rob Jones joined the club at the end of 1989 and the club set about buying some kit. Will Garnier was President, Rob Jones was secretary and after a bit of work, they got an Eight (rowing) out for the Head of the River Race and raced at various events including Reading Town where they reached the final of the Senior 2 event. At this stage there were about 25 racing members and had a huge social section with parties at their boathouse on the Cwm Lleidi (Swiss Valley reservoir) reservoir near Llanelli. The President and Secretary looked into moving the club to the River Tawe by the Morfa Stadium and secured a small space to keep boats there. The club dissolved around 1995 and didn't start again until 2004. In that time, the stadium had been demolished, with a number of university boats going with it.Pers. Comm. Rob Jones The club was revived in 2004 by Tim Stickley, who found just one river- worthy boat in a shed by the university playing fields. An area was organised in the car park next to the River Tawe on which to put the club trailer and permission obtained from Swansea Yacht and Sub Aqua Club to use their slipway to launch. Membership has increased dramatically and the club's fleet of boats has grown over subsequent years, with different captains bringing new things to the club, notably a training camp and The Welsh Boat Race under Henry Hilsdon, a new trailer under Sophie Clarke-Hackston (club captain for 2 years) and a first boat race win under Jenny Staight. Club captains since then have been Steven Gray and Laura Kentfield.Pers. Comm.

Main types Natural numbers (\\\\mathbb{N}): The counting numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} are commonly called natural numbers; however, other definitions include 0, so that the non-negative integers {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} are also called natural numbers. Natural numbers including 0 are also called whole numbers. Integers (\\\\mathbb{Z}): Positive and negative counting numbers, as well as zero: {..., ‚àí3, ‚àí2, ‚àí1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Rational numbers (\\\\mathbb{Q}): Numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of an integer to a non-zero integer. All integers are rational, but the converse is not true; there are rational numbers that are not integers. Real numbers (\\\\mathbb{R}): Numbers that can represent a distance along a line. They can be positive, negative, or zero. All rational numbers are real, but the converse is not true. Irrational numbers: Real numbers that are not rational. Imaginary numbers: Numbers that equal the product of a real number and the square root of ‚àí1. The number 0 is both real and imaginary. Complex numbers (\\\\mathbb{C}): Includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums and differences of real and imaginary numbers. Hypercomplex numbers include various number-system extensions: quaternions (\\\\mathbb{H}), octonions (\\\\mathbb{O}), sedenions (\\\\mathbb{S}), trigintaduonions (ùïã), tessarines, coquaternions, and biquaternions. -adic numbers: Various number systems constructed using limits of rational numbers, according to notions of \\"limit\\" different from the one used to construct the real numbers. Number representations Decimal: The standard Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system using base ten. Binary: The base-two numeral system used by computers. Hexadecimal: Widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Octal: Occasionally used by computer system designers and programmers. Duodecimal: The most convenient numeral system, due to twelve's divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. Sexagesimal: Originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians (See positional notation for information on other bases) Roman numerals: The numeral system of ancient Rome, still occasionally used today. Tally marks: usually used for counting things that increase by small amounts and don't change very quickly. Fractions: A representation of a non-integer as a ratio of two integers. These include improper fractions as well as mixed numbers. Continued fraction: An expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on. Scientific notation: A method for writing very small and very large numbers using powers of 10. When used in science, such a number also conveys the precision of measurement using significant figures. Knuth's up-arrow notation, Conway chained arrow notation, and Bowers's operators : Notations that allow the concise representation of some extremely large integers such as Graham's number. Signed numbers Positive numbers: Real numbers that are greater than zero. Negative numbers: Real numbers that are less than zero. Because zero itself has no sign, neither the positive numbers nor the negative numbers include zero. When zero is a possibility, the following terms are often used: Non-negative numbers: Real numbers that are greater than or equal to zero. Thus a non-negative number is either zero or positive. Non-positive numbers: Real numbers that are less than or equal to zero. Thus a non-positive number is either zero or negative. Types of integer Even and odd numbers: An integer is even if it is a multiple of two, and is odd otherwise. Prime number: An integer with exactly two positive divisors: itself and 1. The primes form an infinite sequence 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ... Composite number: A number that can be factored into a product of smaller integers. Every integer greater than one is either prime or composite. Polygonal numbers: These are numbers that can be represented as dots that are arranged in the shape of a regular polygon, including Triangular numbers, Square numbers, Pentagonal numbers, Hexagonal numbers, Heptagonal numbers, Octagonal numbers, Nonagonal numbers, Decagonal numbers, Hendecagonal numbers, and Dodecagonal numbers. There are many other famous integer sequences, such as the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, the sequence of factorials, the sequence of perfect numbers, and so forth, many of which are enumerated in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Algebraic numbers Algebraic number: Any number that is the root of a non- zero polynomial with rational coefficients. Transcendental number: Any real or complex number that is not algebraic. Examples include and . Trigonometric number: Any number that is the sine or cosine of a rational multiple of pi. Quadratic surd: An algebraic number that is the root of a quadratic equation. Such a number can be expressed as the sum of a rational number and the square root of a rational. Constructible number: A number representing a length that can be constructed using a compass and straightedge. These are a subset of the algebraic numbers, and include the quadratic surds. Algebraic integer: An algebraic number that is the root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. Non-standard numbers Transfinite numbers: Numbers that are greater than any natural number. Ordinal numbers: Finite and infinite numbers used to describe the order type of well-ordered sets. Cardinal numbers: Finite and infinite numbers used to describe the cardinalities of sets. Infinitesimals: Nilpotent numbers. These are smaller than any positive real number, but are nonetheless greater than zero. These were used in the initial development of calculus, and are used in synthetic differential geometry. Hyperreal numbers: The numbers used in non-standard analysis. These include infinite and infinitesimal numbers which possess certain properties of the real numbers. Surreal numbers: A number system that includes the hyperreal numbers as well as the ordinals. The surreal numbers are the largest possible ordered field. Computability and definability Computable number: A real number whose digits can be computed using an algorithm. Definable number: A real number that can be defined uniquely using a first-order formula with one free variable in the language of set theory.

He warmly accepted Miguel Lopez de Legazpi when he arrived in the Philippines in 1565, and was converted as a Christian. Being hospitable toward de Legazpi and his men, he received a letter of gratitude from the Spanish King, Philip II. He also received a gift from the king in recognition of his grandfather's hospitality to Ferdinand Magellan. Though he was one of the first converts of Catholicism under de Legazpi, he left his faith and allegiance to the Spanish after around fifty years. Together with a babaylan named Pagali and his children, he built a temple for a diwata, and he incited people from six towns to participate in the revolt. It is believed that Pagali used some magic to attract followers, and thought that they could turn the Spaniards into clay by hurling bits of earth at them. Parish priest Father Melchor de Vera went to Cebu to report the insurrection. The rebellion was suppressed by Juan de Alcarazo, the alcalde mayor of Cebu, and the Spanish and Filipino colonial troops in forty ships sent by Governor- General Alonso Fajardo de Entenza. Encamping within the temple for a diwata, the Spaniards burned it down after ten days. Bankaw's head was pierced in a bamboo stake and was displayed for the public to serve as a warning. His son was beheaded, and one babaylan was burned at the stake. Three other followers were executed by a firing squad. In order to dispel the blindness caused by the influence of diwata, eighty one rebel priests were burned. Some rebels were captured, including the daughter and son of Bankaw.

Pacific Standard was published by The Social Justice Foundation, headquartered in Santa Barbara, California. On August 7, 2019, Nicholas Jackson, editor-in-chief, stated on Twitter that Pacific Standard was to close after its primary funder abruptly cut off all funding. On June 2, 2020, the CEO of Grist, Brady Pi√±ero Walkinshaw, announced that Grist bought the Pacific Standard and will be keeping an archive of the magazines articles online.  Background: Miller‚ÄìMcCune years  Pacific Standard, formerly Miller‚ÄìMcCune magazine, was launched in 2008 by Sara Miller McCune, the founder and head of Sage Publications. It was named one of the year's \\"hottest launches\\" by MIN magazine and received the same honor from Library Journal the following year. It also received the 2008‚Äì2009 Society of Environmental Journalists Award for Outstanding Explanatory Journalism and the Utne Reader Independent Press Award 2009 for science/technology coverage. In 2010, Miller McCune was named by Folio magazine to the FOLIO: 40 list of publishing innovators: \\"At a time when print is becoming a secondary product for many publishers (in mindset if not revenue), Miller‚ÄìMcCune is succeeding with long- form journalism.\\" In 2010, the magazine launched Miller‚ÄìMcCune LIVE, a special events program to bring articles to life through comprehensive debate featuring industry leaders. The first debate, on lobbying, took place in September in Washington, D.C. The second debate was held in New York City in November with panelists Sree Sreenivasan and Rachel Sklar, who dug into the effects of social media on \\"real life\\" and ways to humanize the Internet.

Established on 12 December 1960, the club eventually became the most successful team in the history of Slovenian football. Origins The first step in the establishment of Maribor, as we know it today, was the creation of the 1. Slovenski ≈†portni Klub Maribor (I. SSK Maribor), on 28 June 1919, in a small tavern called Jadran on Partizanska cesta street in Maribor. Their first match soon followed, when I. SSK Maribor lost against Hertha (1‚Äì4) on 19 July. The club won their first match against a fellow Maribor based club called SK Aero on 7 September 1919, (7‚Äì5). It wasn't until 1920 when the club acquired their very first pitch in Ljudski vrt. Club players also helped in preparing the pitch. During the inter-war period the Slovenian football scene was dominated by clubs located in Ljubljana and therefore Maribor managed to win the Slovenian Republic league title only three times (1931, 1933 and 1939). After World War II Fiskulturno Dru≈°tvo Maribor (FD Maribor) stepped in as the successor of the I. SSK Maribor. In the first match after the war, on 23 September 1945, FD Maribor met local rivals FD ≈Ωelezniƒçar. The match finished with a goalless draw (0‚Äì0). In 1949, FD Maribor started to compete under the name Branik and three years later, on 12 July 1952, the club received a new pitch in Ljudski vrt where it still stands today. The club then played in the second Yugoslav division since 1953‚Äì54 season but was abolished in August 1960 due to a food poisoning affair before the match against Karlovac. Formation and early years (1960‚Äì1967) NK Maribor football club was founded on 12 December 1960. The board of the newly established club then organized the presidential elections and Dr. Sreƒçko Koren was appointed as the first club president, while Andrija Pflander was appointed as the first head coach and Oto Blaznik as the first team captain. Blaznik was also the one who proposed the combination of purple and white jerseys to the club board. The newly established club played its first match on 5 February 1961, when they defeated city rivals Kovinar by 2‚Äì1 (0‚Äì0), with Stefan Toliƒç scoring both goals. Despite heavy rain 1,500 spectators came to see the match. It was clear that the local fans saw the newly established club as the successor of the club that had been dissolved couple of months earlier. The team colours were purple and white from the beginning, however, the team played its first match in green and blue combination as their violet jersey's were not available in time for the first match. The first official league match was played on 12 March 1961, in Nova Gorica, when the club played against the local team and won by 2‚Äì0. The team won the Republic League (third tier of Yugoslav football) in its first season and therefore won the right to play in qualifications for the Yugoslav Second League. Andrija Pflander was the head coach of the team that won the Republic league, however, he had to step down from the position of head coach right before the start of the promotional qualifications due to illness. His successor became Vladimir ≈†imuniƒá, a man who eventually led the team into the Yugoslav First League six years later. Maribor went through as a winner in the first two rounds of the qualifications and eventually defeated Uljanik from Pula, Croatia in the final phase with the score 2‚Äì1 aggregate, therefore securing the right to play in second Yugoslav division. In 1961 the club received a new stadium called Ljudski vrt and on 2 September of the same year, football fans across Slovenia witnessed the birth of a new rivalry between Maribor and Olimpija. The first match between the two clubs was played in Ljubljana and ended with a draw (1‚Äì1). Matches between these two clubs later became known in Slovenia as Eternal derby ('). After five seasons, during that time the average attendance on home matches was around 8,000 spectators, the club under the guidance of Vladimir ≈†imuniƒá won the second division and managed to reach the Yugoslav first league, becoming one of only three Slovenian clubs in history that played in top flight of Yugoslav football. Yugoslav First League (1967‚Äì1972) The club's first match in Yugoslav top division was played in 1967 against Vardar (1‚Äì1) in Skopje; Maras scored the only goal for Maribor. The first home match was played on 27 August against Proleter Zrenjanin in front of 8,000 spectators and Maribor won with the score 3‚Äì0. The goals were scored by Kranjc, Arnejƒçiƒç and Binkovski. During the same season, football fans across Slovenia witnessed the first match in Yugoslav first league between two clubs from Slovenia, when Maribor hosted a match against the newly established rivals Olimpija in front of 13,000 spectators (0‚Äì0). All matches between the two clubs during this time were sold out, with crowd attendance sometimes reaching up to 20,000 and were also the only matches in Yugoslav first league between two clubs from Slovenia. The team finished its first season in Yugoslav top flight on 12th position. During the five years played in Yugoslav First League Maribor played a total of 166 matches and achieved 40 wins, 57 draws and 69 defeats, with a goal difference of 166‚Äì270. Maribor's highest league position was in 1969‚Äì70 season when the club finished on 10th place in a league with 18 teams. The average league placing of the club in Yugoslav top-flight was 13,8. 1971‚Äì72 was the last season spent in the Yugoslav first league as the team finished on last place with 20 points. During the five seasons spent in Yugoslav top division the club played a total of 10 matches against Olimpija with an overall score of two wins, three draws and five defeats and a goal difference of 14‚Äì24. The last home match was played on 11 June 1972, ironically, against Olimpija. This was also the last match of the season in the Yugoslav first league for the club. The rivals from Ljubljana won the match 6‚Äì3. Maribor was relegated and never played in the Yugoslav top league again. Mladen Kranjc, one of the best players in history of the club, was the best goalscorer for the team in each of its five seasons spent in the Yugoslav first league, having scored 54 goals, which brought him a transfer from Maribor to, then top Yugoslav club, Dinamo Zagreb. The dark years (1973‚Äì1990) Next season Maribor played in second Yugoslav division and finished as runner up, which meant that the team qualified for the Yugoslav first league promotional playoffs. In the first qualifying round against Buduƒánost the team defeated their opponents after penalties and qualified in the decisive round against Proleter. The first leg was played in Maribor on 8 July 1973, and is remembered as one of the most historic matches in history as it still holds the record for most spectators on the club's home match. There were 20,000 spectators, 15,000 of them were already gathered on the stands close to three hours before kickoff, and Maribor won 3‚Äì1. Two goals advantage was, however, not enough as Proleter won the second leg match at home 3‚Äì0 and earned the promotion with the score 4‚Äì3 aggregate. In the second match when the score was 1‚Äì0 for the home team Maribor scored a goal for 1‚Äì1 in the 23rd minute, but the goal was disallowed by the main referee. Later, the TV review showed that the ball had actually crossed the line and that the goal should have counted. After the dramatic playoffs against Proleter a period of stagnation begun for the club. The team finished the new season on 13th place in second division and barely avoided relegation. But it was in the very next season (1974‚Äì75) that the club was relegated from the second Yugoslav division, which meant that the team was not part of the top two divisions of Yugoslav football for the first time after 14 years. However, the team returned to the second division after only one season and was again close to promotion into top division during 1978‚Äì79 season when it finished on second place, six points behind ƒåelik. At the end of 1980‚Äì1981 season Maribor was celebrating as the club managed defeated ƒåelik 4‚Äì2 in the decisive last round finished on 10th place and avoided relegation, when the ' (') bribery scandal caused that the club was relegated, by the disciplinary committee of the Football Association of Yugoslavia, from second division into third division. The club had a secret fund that was used for bribing of the officials and opponents. Some officials at the club were keeping track of the bribery expenses in their black book, which was later confiscated by the authorities. From the book it is clear that Maribor had bribed a total of 31 people. The club was relegated and had to play in the Slovenian Republic league (third tier of Yugoslav football) for the next season. The club never fully recovered from the affair and was bouncing between second and third division up until the independence of Slovenia in 1991. From 1988 and until the independence of Slovenia in 1991 the club played in the Western group of the newly formed Inter-Republic League (third tier of Yugoslav football) with teams from Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1988 Maribor merged with a local football club, Branik, and formed Maribor Branik. Although the club uses the name NK Maribor in domestic and international competitions it is, nevertheless, registered under the name of NK Maribor Branik to this day. The two clubs had always had close ties as Branik was dissolved couple of months before the foundation of Maribor and, at the time, many fans that supported Branik simply switched to Maribor as they viewed the club as the successor of Branik. The latter was later reestablished and, legally, the two clubs had nothing in common until the eventual merger in 1988. During the same year on 22 October, Mladen Kranjc was involved in a tragic motorcycle accident in Dolnja Poƒçehova. Considered as one of the best goalscorers in history of the club, he died at the age of 43. New country - New league (1991‚Äì1996) After the declared independence of Slovenia in 1991, Slovenia's best clubs were joined into the Slovenian League. Maribor was one of the league's founding members and is one of only three clubs, the others being Gorica and Celje, that has never been relegated from Slovenian top division. The team played its first match of the newly formed league against Gorica in Nova Gorica, 1‚Äì1. Later the match was registered as a 3‚Äì0 win to Gorica because Maribor's goalscorer Ante ≈†imund≈æa was not eligible to play for the team. The team had to wait until the second round when they won their first points after they defeated Koper with the score 5‚Äì0. The first official goalscorer for the club in a Slovenian league match was Igor Pozniƒç. During the first couple of seasons, Maribor's rivals Olimpija from Ljubljana, which has had a long tradition of playing in the Yugoslav first league and at the time still had their squad composed of players from that era, dominated the league. Although Olimpija Ljubljana was dominating the league, Maribor still managed to win the first Slovenian Cup. The final match was played in Ljubljana on the Be≈æigrad Stadium against Olimpija. The match ended in a goalless draw (0‚Äì0) and was won after a penalty shoot-out (4‚Äì3). This was the first major success for Maribor. During the next season the team played its first match in the European competition (UEFA Cup Winners' Cup). It was on 19 August 1992, when the team hosted ƒ¶amrun Spartans from Malta and won with the score 4‚Äì0. Ante ≈†imund≈æa scored the first historic goal. Next season the team again played in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and achieved its biggest victory in European competitions to date, when they defeated Estonian side Norma with the score 10‚Äì0. The same match is also historic for being the first match in Ljudski vrt stadium that was played during the night. Olimpija Ljubljana won the first four consecutive championships, while Gorica won in the 1995‚Äì96 season. Maribor was runner up in the 1991‚Äì92, 1992‚Äì93 and 1994‚Äì95 seasons, while ending third in 1993‚Äì94 and fourth in 1995‚Äì96 season. During this period the club managed to win another Slovenian cup in the third season (1993‚Äì94), after the club defeated Mura from Murska Sobota in two matches (aggregate 3‚Äì2). Domination (1996‚Äì2004) The 1996‚Äì97 season was the turning point in the history of Maribor. The club stormed the Slovenian League and became the national champion for the first time in history. During this season the average home attendance of Maribor's matches was 5,289 spectators, still a record in Slovenian League to date. The final match of the season was played on 1 June 1997 against Beltinci and gathered a crowd of 14,000, which is another record of the Slovenian League. During the course of the same season Maribor also won the Slovenian Cup, thus winning the domestic double, a feat also repeated in the 1998‚Äì99 season. The club was also very close to achieving the double in the 2003‚Äì04 season but was stopped in the final round of the Slovenian League by another rival Mura in Murska Sobota, which won the last match by 2‚Äì1 and prevented Maribor from winning their eight consecutive title. The club finished third with two points behind the new champions Gorica. In the 1999‚Äì2000 season, the club under the guidance of Bojan Pra≈°nikar defeated Genk (5‚Äì1, 0‚Äì3) and Lyon (1‚Äì0, 2‚Äì0) and qualified for the UEFA Champions league group stage for the first time, where the team competed alongside Dynamo Kiev, Bayer 04, and Lazio. Maribor started their Champions League campaign with a win as the team managed to pull an upset in Kiev against Dynamo; Ante ≈†imund≈æa scored late in the game for the final score of 1‚Äì0. After that Maribor did not won any points in the group until the final round when the team played in Leverkusen against Bayer and managed to hold on to a 0‚Äì0 draw, thus preventing the German side from qualifying to the next round. One of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian league's history was played in the final round of 2000‚Äì01 season, when Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium in Ljubljana. Both teams were competing for their fifth league title. The home team needed a win to secure the title, while a draw was enough for Maribor. The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off and the stadium with 8,500 seats was completely sold out. At the end, the match ended with a draw (1‚Äì1) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3,000 violet fans that gathered in Ljubljana that day. Croatian coach Ivo ≈†u≈°ak became the first and the only foreign coach to date with the Slovenian league title. Altogheter, the club has won seven consecutive league championships and three cup titles in eight seasons between 1996‚Äì2004. 2002‚Äì03 was the season that started to announce the end of Maribor's domination. Celje was the team leading in the championship table and Maribor started to encounter with the first financial and result crisis in over a decade. The team was behind first place for as much as 12 points when, with the new head coach Matja≈æ Kek, the chase for the title begun. Maribor caught up with the team from Celje three rounds before the end of the season and played the decisive match against them, at home, only one round later. The match was played in front of 10,000 spectators in Ljudski vrt stadium and Celje was leading 0‚Äì1 until the 86 minute when Danijel Breziƒç and Damir Pekiƒç scored late in the match and Maribor won 2‚Äì1, thus securing its seventh consecutive title. Financial difficulties (2004‚Äì2007) The 2003‚Äì04 Slovenian cup title was the last trophy won by Maribor before the darkest era of the club begun. Between 2004 and 2008 the club was struggling with financial difficulties and the abolishment of the club was seriously considered at one point. Luckily the club did not follow their rivals Olimpija Ljubljana and Mura Murska Sobota on that path. Due to a high financial debt, which at one point reached as high as four million euros, the club could not afford to buy new players. As a consequence, the first team consisted mostly of youth team players together with a couple of foreign players brought to the club as free agents. In autumn 2006 the club changed its leadership with the debt still consisting over three million euros and it was not until January, 2011, when the club announced that the debt has been paid for in full. Despite the huge financial debt the club managed to defeat Villarreal, a club that played in the semifinal of the elite UEFA Champions League only couple of months earlier, in the UEFA Intertoto Cup at the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season. UEFA acknowledges Maribor as one of the 11 winners of Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, a team that advanced farthest in UEFA competitions that season. With the victory over Villarreal, Maribor managed to qualify into the UEFA Cup, where they were defeated after a dramatic second leg against Partizan Belgrade (3‚Äì2 aggregate). The second leg match against Partizan (1‚Äì1) was the last match at the Ljudski vrt stadium before its major renovation. During this period, Maribor never finished higher than in third place in the league. Zlatko Zahoviƒç era (2007 to 2020) From the 2007‚Äì08 season onwards, former Slovenian international Zlatko Zahoviƒç as the sports director, and soon afterwards, Darko Milaniƒç as the head coach and the club's former player Ante ≈†imund≈æa as the assistant coach, were appointed at the head of the club's sports department. On 10 May 2008, the club reopened Ljudski vrt stadium, which underwent a major reconstruction that lasted almost 20 months. The first match played on the new stadium was a league match against Nafta Lendava, which was won 3‚Äì1 in front of 12,435 spectators. At the start of 2008‚Äì09 season Maribor went into history as the first club that has won 1,000 points in league's history. This was achieved in the second round against Rudar in Velenje, Maribor won 2‚Äì1. In the same season the team again went far in the Slovenian Cup, reaching semi-finals. They were defeated by Ljubljana based club Interblock (4‚Äì5 on aggregate). Their home defeat 3‚Äì2 was their first ever domestic defeat on the renovated stadium. With a 1‚Äì0 home victory in front of 9,500 fans against Celje on 9 May 2009, the club managed to secure their first title after six years. The scorer of the goal that brought the side its eight league title was Dalibor Vola≈°. At the beginning of 2009‚Äì10 season, the team have won their first Slovenian Supercup title, the only domestic trophy missing among club honours. The club had also reached the final of Slovenian Cup, which was hosted on their stadium in May 2010, and won their sixth cup title after extra time, defeating Dom≈æale. David Bunderla scored the decisive goal in the 120th minute of the match. With the latest trophy Darko Milaniƒç became the first coach to have won all three domestic trophies in Slovenian club football. He has achieved that in only two seasons as the head coach of Maribor. Maribor players celebrating the club's ninth league title in 2011. Maribor played in another Supercup final at the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 season, but failed to defend the title at the home ground, losing to Koper after penalties. The team had an impressive run in the UEFA Europa League where it played a total of six matches, defeating Videoton (1‚Äì1, 2‚Äì0) and Hibernian (3‚Äì0, 3‚Äì2) before losing in the play-offs against Serie A club Palermo (0‚Äì3, 3‚Äì2). On the very next day of the second match against the Italians, it was confirmed that Palermo had acquired Josip Iliƒçiƒá and his teammate Armin Baƒçinoviƒá from Maribor for a permanent move. After 15 rounds of the new season the club set a record for the best start in Slovenian league history. With eleven wins and four draws the team won an impressive 37 points and improved the previous record held by Dom≈æale (35 points) and also improved the club's record of the generation that played in the UEFA Champions League eleven years earlier (34 points). On 12 December 2010, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary. One month later on 13 January 2011, the club announced that their financial debt, that accumulated between 1999 and 2000s, has been paid for in full. On 6 March 2011, Maribor played a home match against Gorica and lost 2‚Äì1, which was their first defeat in domestic competitions since April 2010. Although Maribor lost the 2010 Supercup final against Koper, the match officially counts as a draw, as the game finished with the score 0‚Äì0 after regulation and was decided only after penalties. Therefore, the undefeated run of the team lasted a total of 33 matches in 326 days. With the 2‚Äì1 away victory over Primorje, on 21 May 2011, Maribor secured its ninth Slovenian league title. Four days later the team played the Slovenian cup final at Sto≈æice stadium and lost to Dom≈æale, 4‚Äì3. Marcos Tavares was crowned as the best goalscorer of the 2010‚Äì11 season, with 16 goals.

At the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Maribor played in the 2011 Slovenian Supercup against Dom≈æale on 8 July 2011 and lost with the score 2‚Äì1 after regulation. This was the second consecutive loss for Maribor against Dom≈æale in domestic cup finals in five weeks, after losing the Slovenian cup in May 2011. After narrowly loss against Maccabi Haifa (2‚Äì1 in Haifa and 1‚Äì1 in Maribor) in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers, Maribor caused one of the biggest upsets in the UEFA Europa League play-offs. They were drawn against the Scottish team Rangers. The first leg in Maribor ended in 2‚Äì1 win for the home side, while the second leg at the Ibrox ended 1‚Äì1.

Early life Ant√≥nio Mota de Sousa Horta-Os√≥rio was born in January 1964, in Lisbon, the eldest son of Ant√≥nio Lino de Sousa Horta Os√≥rio, a lawyer and table tennis champion, and grandson of the late Ant√≥nio de Sousa Horta Sarmento Os√≥rio, a lawyer, economist and politician. Education Horta- Os√≥rio graduated in Management and Business Administration from the Catholic University of Portugal, Lisbon, in 1987. He received his MBA at INSEAD, in 1991, where he was awarded the Henry Ford II prize for the best student in that year. He attended an Advanced Management Program (AMP) at Harvard Business School in 2003. Career In 1987 Horta-Os√≥rio joined Citibank in Portugal, where he became vice president and head of Capital Markets until 1990. During this period, he also taught at the Catholic University of Portugal, where he was an assistant professor, and a guest professor from 1992‚Äì1996. He was also a guest professor in the Superior Course of Banking Management at the Portuguese Bank Training Institute (IFB), from 1988 to 1994. In 1991 he joined Goldman Sachs, working in their corporate finance division, in New York City and London, from 1991 to 1993. That year, he was invited by Emilio Bot√≠n and Ana Bot√≠n to join the Santander Group and set up Banco Santander de Neg√≥cios in Portugal (BSNP), of which he became CEO. From 1995 to 2003, he was president of the Association of Alumni of INSEAD in Portugal. In 1998 he became a member of the INSEAD Portuguese Council, and from 2003 to 2007 he was the chairman. In 1997, Horta-Os√≥rio moved to Brazil, where he initiated Santander‚Äôs retail activities in the country, purchasing two retail banks and merging them into Banco Santander Brasil,Santander 2007 Annual Report, p.2. https://www.santander.com.br/document/gsb/institucional_rel_anual_p2007_ingles.pdf of which he became CEO (1997‚Äì1999) and chairman (1997‚Äì2000). From December 1997, he also became the chairman of Banco Santander Portugal. With the 1999‚Äì2000 agreement between Ant√≥nio Champalimaud, the Santander Group and the Caixa Geral de Dep√≥sitos, the Santander Group became the owner of Banco Totta & A√ßores and Cr√©dito Predial Portugu√™s, adding these to Banco Santander de Neg√≥cios and Banco Santander Portugal. Following this, the Group changed its name to Banco Santander Totta. In 2000, he became chief executive of Banco Santander Totta in Portugal. He also became executive vice president of Banco Santander in Spain and a member of its management committee. He joined Abbey National as a non-executive director in November 2004. In August 2006, he moved to the UK, and became CEO of Abbey and its successor Santander UK. In 2006, he became chairman of Santander Totta in Portugal. In 2008, he led the integration into the Santander Group of the British building societies Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester. Horta-Os√≥rio was appointed as a non-executive director to the Court of the Bank of England in June 2009, relinquishing this position in February 2011, as he became CEO of Lloyds Banking Group on 1 March 2011. Horta-Osorio is currently a non-executive director of EXOR N.V., Funda√ß√£o Champalimaud and Sociedade Francisco Manual dos Santos in Portugal, a member of the Board of Stichting INPAR. He also serves on the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) President‚Äôs Committee and is Chairman of the Wallace Collection. =Lloyds= In January 2011 he joined Lloyds Banking Group as an executive director, becoming CEO on 1 March 2011. In November 2011, he went on temporary leave due to exhaustion, which the Evening Standard called the most high-profile sick leave in the City. The following month, he announced that he was ready to return to work. In January 2012, he cited the impact that his leave of absence had on the company as the reason that he did not wish to receive a bonus for 2011, and said \\"As chief executive, I believe my bonus entitlement should reflect the performance of the group\\". Under his leadership, the bank's financial performance was turned around. It returned to profitability, slimming down to focus on domestic lending and to meet tougher regulatory requirements on the amount of capital it holds. Lloyds started down the road to full private ownership, with the Government reducing its stake in September 2013 and March 2014 respectively. In 2014, Horta-Os√≥rio saw his pay increase more than 50 percent to ¬£11.5m as Lloyds returned to profit. Lloyds completed its return to private ownership in May 2017 with c.¬£900m above the original stake being repaid to the government. In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, Horta-Os√≥rio sought to allay fears the bank would shift operations abroad as other UK banks had announced. He told Forbes, \\"We have no plans to move jobs to Luxembourg, or anywhere else in Europe, as a result of the UK‚Äôs decision to leave the European Union‚Ä¶But the nature of our business, and our UK focus, means the direct impact on our business is less compared to our peers\\". In 2017, Lloyds' statutory profit increased by 24% to ¬£5.3bn in the year and it paid out the largest dividend in its history (¬£2.3bn) including a share buyback of ¬£1bn. It also completed the acquisition of MBNA (1 June) and announced the acquisition of Zurich's UK workplace pensions and savings business (12 October). In July 2020 Horta- Os√≥rio announced that he would stand down as chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group by summer 2021. Honours and awards Horta-Os√≥rio was made a Commander of the Spanish Order of Civil Merit in August 1998. In October 1998, Brazil awarded him the Order of the Southern Cross. In June 2009, he was awarded the Spanish title of Encomienda de Numero of Orden de Isabel la Catolica (Commander by Number of Order of Isabella the Catholic). He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Edinburgh in June 2011, the University of Bath in July 2012, the University of Warwick in 2015 and the University of Birmingham in 2019. Portugal awarded him the Order of Merit Gr√£- Cruz in June 2014, its highest order of civil merit. Horta-Os√≥rio won Euromoney's award for best banker in 2013. In 2018 he was granted the Freedom of the City of London and in 2019 was a recipient of the Foreign Policy Association Medal, British American Business Corporate Citizenship Award and the INSEAD Alumni Achievement Award. Personal life Horta-Os√≥rio and his wife Ana have three children, and live in Chelsea, London. He is a keen scuba diver, and enjoys playing tennis and chess. Horta-Os√≥rio supported the UK remaining in the European Union. In August 2016, Horta-Os√≥rio issued an apology in an email sent to the bank's 75,000 staff for reported transgressions in his personal life while travelling abroad. He clarified that there was no financial misdeed, as he paid all his expenses personally, and indicated that he did not intend to leave the group as a consequence. He wrote: \\"I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group‚Äôs reputation.\\" His actions were reported to have been in breach of a code of personal responsibility for Lloyds staff that he had introduced himself.  Mental health  Horta-Os√≥rio has been public in describing how restoring Lloyds Bank's fortunes \\"almost shattered\\" his mental health and he has become a prominent campaigner for employers to support their employees with mental health challenges and so shrug off its stigma. At Lloyds he oversaw the training of thousands of mental health first aiders, while he and around 200 other senior executives underwent a 12-month ‚Äúoptimal leadership resilience programme‚Äù, devised with his psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Pereira. Since January 2017, Lloyds Banking Group‚Äôs partnership with Mental Health UK has raised ¬£11m and enabled 14,000 volunteering hours and 40 support groups. The partnership also runs a Mental Health and Money Advice service. Horta-Os√≥rio was also involved, with Prince William, in the launch of Mind‚Äôs Mental Health at Work ‚Äúgateway‚Äù in 2018; and in Lloyds‚Äô membership of the City Mental Health Alliance. He has been widely praised for his campaign against the workplace taboo surrounding mental health issues; Simon Blake OBE, chief executive of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England, described his openness about his own problems as ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù. In 2020, Lloyds Banking Group‚Äôs work to raise awareness of mental health earned it a Gold award in the Business Disability Forum‚Äôs Disability Standard.  Arts  In 2015 Horta-Os√≥rio was made chairman of the highly regarded Wallace Collection, the most valuable private art collection ever bequeathed to the British nation. In 2019, during his tenure, the gallery eased its traditional ‚Äúno loans‚Äù policy and began both to make and receive temporary loans of selected works ‚Äì for example, lending Titian‚Äôs ‚ÄúPerseus and Andromeda‚Äù for the National Gallery‚Äôs 2020 exhibition, Titian: Love, Desire, Death. The collection‚Äôs director, Xavier Bray, hailed the change as a ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù which was ‚Äúlike bringing fresh air to the collection and just making it live again‚Äù. Horta-Os√≥rio‚Äôs chairmanship, a prime ministerial appointment, was renewed in 2019. Horta-Os√≥rio is also a significant collector of Portuguese art, particularly works of art made under Portuguese patronage in maritime Asia from the 16th to the 18th century. The collection includes objects created in China, Japan and India (especially Gujarat), often in rare materials such as tortoiseshell, mother-of-pearl and ivory and rock crystal. It also features a number of early chess sets.

The managing editor is Charles Bahr. The journal was originally established as the Bell System Technical Journal (BSTJ) in New York by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;) in 1922, published under this name until 1983, when the breakup of the Bell System placed various parts of the system into separate companies. The journal was devoted to the scientific fields and engineering disciplines practiced in the Bell System for improvements in the wide field of electrical communication. After the restructuring of Bell Labs in 1984, the journal was renamed to AT&T; Bell Laboratories Technical Journal. In 1985, it was published as the AT&T; Technical Journal until 1996, when it was renamed to Bell Labs Technical Journal. History The Bell System Technical Journal was published by AT&T; in New York City through its Information Department, on behalf of Western Electric Company and the Associated Companies of the Bell System. The first issue was released in July 1922, under the editorship of R. W. King and an eight-member editorial board. From 1922 to 1951, the publication schedule was quarterly. It was bimonthly until 1964, and finally produced ten monthly issues per year until the end of 1983, combining the four summer months into two issues in May and July. Publication of the journal under the name Bell System Technical Journal ended with Volume 62 by the end of 1983, because of the divestiture of AT&T.; Under new organization, publication continued as AT&T; Bell Laboratories Technical Journal in 1984 with Volume 63, maintaining the volume sequence numbers established since 1922. In 1985, Bell Laboratories was removed from the title, resulting in AT&T; Technical Journal until 1995 (Volume 74). In 1996, the journal was revamped under the name Bell Labs Technical Journal, and publication management was transferred to Wiley Periodicals, Inc., establishing a new volume sequence (Volume 1). =Editors= The journal was directed by the following former editors: *1922 (July) R.W. King *1954 J.D. Tebo The History of Phone Phreaking. 1954. *1957 (May) W.D. Bulloch *1959 (January) H.S. Renne *1961 (March) G.E. Schindler, Jr. Abstracting and indexing The following abstracting and indexing services cover the journal: According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 1.2. Notable papers The Bell System Technical Journal and its successors published many papers on seminal works and revolutionary achievements at Bell Labs, including the following: * In 1928, Clinton Joseph Davisson published a paper on electron diffraction by nickel crystal, thus unambiguously establishing the wave nature of electron. This discovery led to a widespread acceptance of particle-wave duality of matter and won him the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics. * Claude Shannon's paper \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\", which founded the field of information theory, was published as two-part article in July and October issue of 1948. * The journal previously published numerous articles disclosing the internal operation of the long-distance switching system used in direct distance dialing (DDD) in the Bell System in the 1950s and 1960s. Articles such as those by A.Weaver and N.A. Newel (In-Band Single-Frequency Signaling), and by C. Breen and C.A. Dahlbom (Signaling Systems for Control of Telephone Switching) enabled phone phreaks to develop the blue box apparatus, which mimicked the switching system's signals to allow them to make free long-distance calls. * Many landmark papers from the developers of the UNIX operating system appeared in a themed issue in 1978. * The 2009 Nobel Prize physicists Willard Boyle and George E. Smith described their new charge-coupled device in the journal in a 1970 paper.

Nebergall owned Knoll Crest Farm when they contracted with Benton Steele to design and construct a round barn in 1914. The building is a true round barn that measures around. The bottom half of the barn is constructed of clay tile and features square windows. Red vertical board-and-batten siding covers the upper half of the barn that features rectangular windows. A driveway divides the interior circular arrangement between the horse stalls and the cattle stanchions, which ringed the outer perimeter of the main level. with Grain bins and feedways are located between the animals and the center drive. Separate hay chutes serviced the horse and cattle sides of the barn. In that way, the horse hay and the cattle hay could be efficiently stored and the animals fed. There is no silo built into this barn. A cupola rests on top of a 2-pitch conical roof. The Nebergall family sold the farm in 1992 to John Penne. He re-roofed the barn in 1998 with wood shingles. The hayforks and manure track system remain in working condition. Benton Steele The barn was built by Benton Steele, who was a specialized builder/architect. He built his first barns in the dairy districts of Indiana and Wisconsin before moving to Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. He wrote articles in publications such as the Kimball's Dairy Farmer of Waterloo, the Breeder's Gazette of Chicago, and the Hoard's Dairyman of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin as a way to advertise his work.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. History The historic district is located in a part of the city known as the LeClaire Reserve and was developed later than other parts of the Reserve. It covers the 300 to the 800 blocks of East 14th Street and includes 67 houses. with The earliest homes were built in the 1870s and the newest around 1910, however, most of the houses were built between 1880 and 1900. The district is located in the heart of the non- German residential area. The Germans largely resided to the west of Harrison Street. Several prominent entrepreneurs, industrialists, and professionals lived along East 14th Street. Their families, however, lived here for several decades unlike the German's who would spend a lifetime in their neighborhoods. Architecture The homes on East 14th Street are described as ‚Äúsolid, reasonably prosperous, and unostentatious.‚Äù For the most part, they are large (2 to 2¬Ω stories) and of frame construction. The houses are located on long, narrow lots and are set back 20‚Äì30 feet from the street. Many of the lots are slightly elevated and terraced. Most of the houses are single-family dwellings, or they were when they were built. There are also several double houses where the two sides of the main facade are a mirror image of each other. The houses follow changing tastes and architectural styles. The earliest style found in the district is the Italianate with its emphasis on symmetry and the horizontal. It was followed by the Queen Anne with its irregular plan, towers, variegated roofs, projecting bays, dormers, and a variety of surface textures. Closer to the turn of the 20th century the symmetry of the Colonial Revival style became more predominant, especially the Georgian Revival form. Some of the houses show the influence of the Prairie Style. There is also evidence that older homes were remodeled with the features and textures of the later styles, so some of the houses are a combination of styles. East 14th Street also has several houses built in a vernacular style that was popular in 19th century Davenport. They are two- story, three-bay, front gable houses with a main entrance that is off center and a window located in the gable end.

Specifically, the social construction of gender stipulates that gender roles are an achieved \\"status\\" in a social environment, which implicitly and explicitly categorize people and therefore motivate social behaviors. : See also: :: An intimately related, though notably distinct matter in feminist theory is the relationship between the ascribed status of biological sex- male and female; and their achieved status counterparts in gender- masculine and feminine. Basic concepts = Status (feminist theory) = In the context of feminist theory, the word status deviates from its colloquial usage meaning rank or prestige but instead refers to a series of strata or categories by which societies are divided, in some ways synonymous with \\"labels\\" or \\"roles\\". The semantic distinctions of \\"labels\\" and \\"roles\\" are homogenized into the term \\"status\\" and then re-differentiated by the division into \\"ascribed status\\" and \\"achieved status\\" respectively. Within the domain of psychoanalytical and Radical feminism, status bears additional significance as a mechanism of arbitrary power; where arbitrary refers to the derivation of power from status as opposed to mutual agreement of involved parties. Therefore, the undermining and disassembly of status and status symbols is a prerequisite to liberation from arbitrary power. =Social constructionism= Social constructionism is a theory of knowledge which describes the relationship between the objectivity of reality and the capacity of human senses and cognition. Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions. The social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of Objectivism developed by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power. This intimacy demonstrates the close inspirational source of Marxist doctrine, as utilized in the works of Foucault and his writings on discourse. The work The Blank Slate of Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, the demonstrate the existence of socially constructed categories such as \\"money, tenure, citizenship, decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\\" which \\"exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist.\\" However, they are not a support of the social constructionism as the principle lens through which to understand reality, but rather a specific context for particular social phenomena. Instead, the autonomy and biologically informed nature of human existence. In this manner, Pinker explicitly contradicts social constructionist scholars Marecek, Crawford & Popp in \\"On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities\\", who deny the autonomy of the individual, as well as assert a variation of the Tabula rasa theory of thinking, in that knowledge and meaning are generated exclusively as a collective effort and that the individual is incapable of doing so independently. Which therefore assets that the perception of the creation of independent meaning is an illusion created by manipulation of social perceptions and expressions. Alsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams: # Materialist theories, which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles; # Discursive theories, which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender. They also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either essentialist or non-essentialist. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction. =Gender= Gender is used as a means of describing the distinction between the biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity. According to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is \\"an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society.\\" Pdf. :* As a social construct, gender is considered an achieved status by feminist theory, typically (though not exclusively) one which is achieved very early in childhood. The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\\"doing\\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \\"gender activities\\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others. A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a person holding a sign stating \\"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\\". Gender roles Gender roles are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status. In less theoretical terms, gender roles are functional position in a social dynamic for which fulfillment is a part of \\"doing gender\\" Empirical investigations suggest that gender roles are \\"social constructs that vary significantly across time, context, and culture\\". Ronald F. Levant and Kathleen Alto write: American philosopher Judith Butler makes a distinction between gender performativity and gender roles, which delineates between the social behaviors of the individual seeking to express the behavior which articulate their own perception of their gender; and behavior which creates the perception of compliance with societal gender expressions in aggregate. This is not to imply that participation in gender performativity can not correspond to pressure to fulfill a gender role, nor that fulfillment of a gender role can not satisfy the desire for gender performativity. The distinction refers primarily to context and motivation, rather than particular behaviors and consequences- which are often closely linked. In some subdomains of feminism, such as intersectional feminism, gender is a major though not solitary axis along which factors of oppression are considered, as expressed by Berkowitz, who wrote \\"The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\\". Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically referred to as \\"patriarchy\\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J. (2010). Walk Like a Man, Talk Like a Woman: Teaching the Social Construction of Gender. Teaching Sociology, 38(2), 132-143.

Besteman observes the differences in gender roles in the context of parenting by Somali Bantu refugees in Lewiston, Maine; The separate roles communicate the agency of individuals based on their gender ‚Äì agency in which males tend to be favored in terms of social power.

Gender identity Gender identity is a related concept, which instead of referring to the external social understanding developed between persons, gender identity refers to the internal sense of ones own gender on an individual scale. The term inherently lacks qualification of what does or does not constitute gender identity. Primarily, as its actualization is entirely internalized it prevents external parameterization or communication as those are external social behaviors. In a work titled \\"Social Cognitive Theory of Gender Development and Differentiation\\" by doctors of psychology Kay Bussey and Alburta Bandura published in Psychological Review and academically cited approximately 2817 times (and thousands more in the citations to secondary literature on which the analysis is based), the pair review a variety of explanations for the modes and mechanism contributing to the cultivation of childhood gender identity. The first of which is a psychoanalytic theory stating: > Initially, both boys and girls are believed to identify with their mothers. > However, at between 3 and 5 years of age this changes, and children identify > with the same-sex parent. Identification with the same-sex parent is pre- > sumed to resolve the conflict children experience as a result of erotic > attachment to the opposite-sex parent and jealousy toward the same-sex > parent. This attachment causes children much anxiety as they fear > retaliation from the same-sex parent. The principle contention being that gender differentiation in children is motivated by sexual attraction to the parent, as well as negative emotion, fear, and anxiety regarding threats or retaliation from the same-sex parent. In this, they also describe this as resulting in \\"boys' castration anxieties.\\" and \\"[girls facing] resentment over being de-prived of a penis, inferior, and fear retaliation from the mother for their designs on their father.\\" Bussey and Bandura do not provide in their research any study of the frequency of these fears or anxieties, nor any multi-varied analysis of peripheral factors to these feelings erotic or neurotic. Additionally, no description is provided of the methodology by which Bussey and Bandura derived any data from children to reach the conclusions of precisely the feelings being experienced during adolescent development, nor how children of age 5 were able to articulate their feelings at being \\"deprived of a penis\\". Additionally, no analysis or method is provided explaining how any of this information could be collected in testing the theory nor how the data could be assembled such as to provide a clinical model of childhood development. They continue, providing cognitive- developmental analysis of their findings proposing that \\"Gender identity is postulated as the basic organizer and regulator of children's gender learning\\" and that \\"children develop the stereo-typic conceptions of gender from what they see and hear around them\\". Their works asserts that after children develop this concept, they also develop \\"gender constancy‚Äîthe belief that their own gender is fixed and irreversible\\". Children then act in a way that fulfills their conception, as cognitive consistency is gratifying. This model does not account for the fluidity of gender asserted by persons like American Psychologist Lisa M. Diamond who explains is not a stable, fixed trait ‚Äì rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual. This model directly contravenes both the notion of gender identity being individual and internal, by explaining its source as social behavior and its manifestation as a desire for congruence with a received notion of gender. It is unclear whether this contradiction occurs as an inconsistency in terminology or as a contradiction of two claims. Other proposed models include that of the Gender Schema Theory, which conjectures that the development of gender identity, is a process of self identification which must precede the ability for \\"children to label themselves and others as males or females\\". Bussey and Alburta note its similarity to the cognitive-developmental analysis, but do not clarify how these similarities manifest. They differ, however, in that the Gender Schema theory proposes the development of gender as a tool for developing children to better categorize and define the social behaviors around them, and contributes to the development of a growing and expanding model. Additionally, the cognitive-developmental analysis asserts that in a developing child the concept of gender is immutable once established, however the Gender Schema theory does not require this assumption, instead leaving the possibility that a developing child may refine and curtail their gendered differentiation according to experiences as they develop and thus produce a more nuanced and individual model than may have been initially received during early and uncontextualized adolescent experiences. Fourth, Bussey and Bandura discuss the biological theory of gender differentiation. The various theories which follow this track as described include that gender differentation is motivated as a social manifestation of ancestrally inherited differences concerning \\"mate preferences, reproductive strategies, parental investment in offspring, and the aggressive nature of males.\\" In their analysis of these theories, these differences are discussed exclusively in the context of the males strategic advantage in mating multiple partners, as well as the capacity of males for coercive force in obtaining a mate. This context is an unusual one, and no elucidation is provided as to how or why this particular lens of understanding proto-civilization social dynamics of evolving humans was selected. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of humans back to the most recent common ancestor implies that the rate of reproductive success among females was significantly higher than males, in a journal published by the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Additionally, further study relating to Darwins original work on sexual selectivity has indicated humans as a model species for analysis of sexual selection, specifically female sexual selection as Darwin observed in On the Origins of Species that in most species sexually assertive males competed among themselves for the selection of choosy drab and coy female mates describing the process of both battle and pursuit as follows: > The female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not > please or excite her; and when pursued, as so incessantly occurs, by several > males, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting > together, of escaping with, or at least temporarily pairing with, some one > male. Darwin and others after him however noticed the ornamentation of females to imply a difference in the human species, but this theory was largely ignored until recent contemporaries continue the work. This theory is further reinforced by the rapid evolutionary departure from chimpanzees, among whom females are not sexually selective and with lesser childhood burdens. It is for these reasons that a model of battle, rape, and a lack of male investment in offspring is inconsistent with prevailing scientific literature despite being a published work reflecting on the gender distinctions which derive as a result of ancestral sexual dynamics on an evolutionary timescale. In general, the work of Bandura and Bussey, despite its prolific citation and endeavour to detail the mechanisms of gender identity as a fact of childhood development, is internally inconsistent, and contradictory to other relevant works on the topic and riddled with indications of bias or ulterior motives. See the presentation of Gender Schema as the only theory which presents gender differentiation as being of utility to the development of a child, while also claimed as similar to the model which presents gender differentiation as an immutable and parasitic side effect of social imposition. The study features intense, concentration on the sexual eroticism of children, and the existence of intense neurotic emotion in response to fantasy concerning absence or mutilation of same and opposite sex genitalia, but this is presented absent information as to how this information was extricated from subjects analyzed, or measure to prevent psychological projection onto malleable adolescent subjects in an environment where the subject matter is explicitly predicated on volatile neurotic emotional response to sexual social pressure from adult figures. Additionally, it lacks analysis of controls for selection bias or parental factors and is yet the first theory presented and analyzed by a child gender developmental study. The work concerning evolutionary biological theories adopts a very specific lens, which describes the ancestral social paradigm as one predicated upon, rape, coercive violence, and abandonment of females by their male counterparts which not only is absent all socio-cultural analysis and later diverted to focus on hormonal patterns and other physiological phenomena; but is also a model which directly contravenes the prevailing literature on sexual selectivity, evolution, and proto- civilizational social dynamics in humans. Additionally, it stands in contradiction to itself and other works which cite it, by the repeated conflation of biological sex, male and female, with gender, gender identity, and their confluence at the concepts of man and woman. A distinction which is fundamental to feminist theory of gender as an achieved status and sex as an ascribed status The broadly encompassing comprehensive work of Babdura and Bussey in their summary analysis reflect a complete internal inconsistency of the body of work it represents- which includes dozens of other oft cited studies referenced within itself- as well as total incongruence with prevailing scientific theory on adjacent subjects of biology in a form that is prolific and continuously cited decades after publication. Sexuality/sexual orientation In recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non- traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is discovering and accepting their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality. The authors characterize this style of representation as \\"homonormative\\", and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a trans man or that they were simply pretending. Diamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviewing women that fall into a sexual minority group over the course of ten years. One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine \\"stance\\" and started to question her gender identity. When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man. The perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender. Heterosexuality is assumed for those individuals who appear to act appropriately masculine or appropriately feminine. If one wants to be perceived as a lesbian, one must first be perceived as a woman; if one wants to be seen as a gay man, one has to be seen as a man. =Core gender identity= According to Alsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon, \\"Gender is part of an identity woven from a complex and specific social whole, and requiring very specific and local readings\\". Thus, gender identity can be defined as part of socially situated understanding of gender. LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \\"gender identity\\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals. =Intersections of gender identity with other identities= While men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways. Pdf. Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \\"patriarchal invitation to privilege\\". For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have to white women. White women are accountable for their gendered display as traditionally subservient to white men while women of color may be held accountable for their gendered performance as sexual objects and as recalcitrant and bawdy women in relations with white men. West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \\"relational position\\" to white men. Gender as accomplishment Gender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does ‚Äì it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \\"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\\". People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. \\"Doing\\" gender is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles ‚Äì it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered. The performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent ‚Äì roles are \\"situated identities\\" instead of \\"master identities\\". The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \\"know\\" as \\"reality\\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives. In other words, individual perceptions of \\"\\"knowledge\\" or reality...must be the central focus.\\" These performances normalize the essentialism of sex categories. In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender ‚Äì that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth). Institutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained ‚Äì \\"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\\". In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior. This can be said for constructions of any identity in certain contexts (e.g. femininity, race, Black femininity, etc.). Accountability People hold themselves and each other accountable for their presentations of gender (how they 'measure up'). They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life. Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations. Accountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate ‚Äì it is the possibility of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a machismo masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility. Even though gender seems more salient in some situations ‚Äì for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession ‚Äì gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious. For instance, gender is maintained before the woman enters the male-dominated group through conceptions of masculinity. Race, class, and other oppressions can also be omnirelevant categories, though they are not all identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done. People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.). This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context. Gender is created in different ways among uneducated and educated African Americans. =Sex and sex category= West and Zimmerman give this definition for sex in their paper Doing Gender: \\"Sex is a determination made through the application of socially agreed upon biological criteria for classifying persons as females and males. The criteria for classification can be genitalia at birth or chromosomal typing before birth, and they do not necessarily agree with one another\\". The differentiation between gender and sex did not arise until the late 1970s, when researchers began using \\"gender\\" and \\"sex\\" as two separate terms, with \\"gender\\" referring to one's self-identity and \\"sex\\" referring to one's chromosomal makeup and sex organs. :Citing: :* The binary of male and female leaves out everyone who does not fit into these categories because of genital make up, chromosomes, or hormone levels. Anne Fausto-Sterling addresses the issues facing intersex people in her article The Five Sexes. She claims that there is at minimum five sexes but probably more; this is based on the vast range of ways bodies show up in nature. She points out that, \\"recent advances in physiology and surgical technology now enable physicians to catch most intersexuals at birth...infants are entered into a program of hormonal and surgical management...\\" Pdf. This highlights the intense adherence to the binary instead of allowing bodies to present in the world without intervention. West and Zimmerman also give a definition for sex category: \\"achieved through application of the sex criteria, but in everyday life, categorization is established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category\\". Sex category is applied to a person in everyday life through commonly recognized cues that are not necessarily fulfilling biological criteria of sex. Applications of gender performance The term \\"gender performativity\\" was first coined in American philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler's 1990 book Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. In Gender Trouble, Butler sets out to criticize what she considers to be an outdated perception of gender. This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of performativity and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \\"gender proves to be performance‚Äîthat is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\\". In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \\"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way‚Ä¶To say that gender is performative is a little different‚Ä¶For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman‚Ä¶we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\\" Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \\"there is no 'being' behind doing‚Ä¶ 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed ‚Äì the deed is everything.\\" Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives. On Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in drag performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of gender binaries in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \\"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\\". Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed \\"can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\\". Amelia Jones proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the gaze and sexual fetishism, which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure. =Infancy and young childhood= The idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \\"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\\". Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled Language and Gender, states: \\"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\\". Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \\"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\\". Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy. Butler suggests in both \\"Critically Queer\\" and \\"Melancholy Gender\\", that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from Sigmund Freud's notion of melancholia, such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \\"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\\". =Teen years= One's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \\"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys‚Ä¶\\". This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted. Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance. = Queer identity = The Butlerian model presents a queer perspective on gender performance and explores the possible intersection between socially constructed gender roles and compulsory heterosexuality. This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is heteronormative, contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings. This idea is reflected in the activism organized by political groups such as ACT UP during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals who had lost their partners to the disease. The survivors commemorated the dead by quilting together their rags, repurposing their possessions, and displaying their own bodies for premature mourning. All of these protests amounted to a message that some part of them will be left in the world after they have expired. Queer Failure is a concept in queer theory that also calls gender into question, because it examines queer art and the bodies of LGBTQ+ people through the lens of what a parental figure may identify as \\"failure\\" on the part of their character. Instead of recognizing these instances as moral or psychological failures, this concept frames them as the resultants of a conflict between a person's sexuality and their gender. = Political potential and limits = Butler suggests that \\"[t]he critical promise of drag does not have to do with the proliferation of genders‚Ä¶but rather with the exposure of the failure of heterosexual regimes ever fully to legislate or contain their own ideals\\", although such remarks fail to indicate how the inadequacies of heterosexual regimes might be explicitly exposed. According to Butler, gender performance is only subversive because it is \\"the kind of effect that resists calculation\\", which is to say that signification is multiplicitous, that the subject is unable to control it, and so subversion is always occurring and always unpredictable. Moya Lloyd suggests that the political potential of gender performances can be evaluated relative to similar past acts in similar contexts in order to assess their transgressive potential: \\"Even if we accept that there are incalculable effects to all (or most) statements or activities, this does not mean that we need to concede that there are no calculable effects.\\" Conversely, Rosalyn Diprose lends a hard-line Foucauldian interpretation to her understanding of gender performance's political reach, as one's identity \\"is built on the invasion of the self by the gestures of others, who, by referring to other others, are already social beings\\". Diprose implies that the individual's will, and the individual performance, is always subject to the dominant discourse of an Other (or Others), so as to restrict the transgressive potential of performance to the inscription of simply another dominant discourse. Martha Nussbaum criticizes Butler's concepts of gender performativity as a misguided retreat from engaging with real-world concerns: > \\"Butler suggests to her readers that this sly send-up of the status quo is > the only script for resistance that life offers [...] Butlerian feminism is > in many ways easier than the old feminism. It tells scores of talented young > women that they need not work on changing the law, or feeding the hungry, or > assailing power through theory harnessed to material politics. They can do > politics in safety of their campuses, remaining on the symbolic level, > making subversive gestures at power through speech and gesture. This, the > theory says, is pretty much all that is available to us anyway, by way of > political action, and isn't it exciting and sexy?\\" During development Gender features strongly in most societies and is a significant aspect of self-definition for most people. One way to analyze the social influences that affect the development of gender is through the perspective of the social cognitive theory. According to Kay Bussey, social cognitive theory describes \\"how gender conceptions are developed and transformed across the life span\\". The social cognitive theory views gender roles as socially constructed ideas that are obtained over one's entire lifetime. These gender roles are \\"repeatedly reinforced through socialization\\". Preview of earlier edition. Hackman verifies that these gender roles are instilled in us from \\"the moment we are born\\". For the individual, gender construction starts with assignments to a sex category on the basis of biological genitalia at birth. Preview of earlier edition. Following this sexual assignment, parents begin to influence gender identity by dressing children in ways that clearly display this biological category. Therefore, biological sex becomes associated with a gender through naming, dress, and the use of other gender markers. Gender development continues to be affected by the outlooks of others, education institutions, parenting, media, etc. These variations of social interactions force individuals to \\"learn what is expected, see what is expected, act and react in expected ways, and thus simultaneously construct and maintain the gender order\\". Preview of earlier edition (p. 208. =Gender-based harassment= It is very common for gender- based harassment to occur throughout the academic years of a person's life. This serves as a form of gender boundary policing. People who identify as women are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are people who identify as male. Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to machismo, which is the notion that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys. Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls. This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. In their study, \\"Correlates and Consequences of Peer Victimization: Gender Differences in Direct and Indirect Forms of Bullying,\\" Lopez, Esbensen & Brick state that \\"boys were more likely to experience direct or physical forms of bullying and girls were more likely to report being teased or joked about.\\" This can be interpreted as females typically harassing other females in more of a mental, emotional, and psychological torment while males take more of a physical and aggressive approach. Unique appearances and attempts to stand out among girls are regarded very negatively. This type of female on female bullying sets the standard for norms on appearance and the importance of conforming to the societal expectations of that appearance for females. Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of students by students. =Adolescent view of adulthood= Gender is a cultural construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints. Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear gender differences because \\"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\\". With \\"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls. Crocket and Beal in their article \\"The Life Course in the Making: Gender and the Development of Adolescents\\", \\"gender differences in the anticipated timing of future role transitions, the impact of expectations and values on these expected timings, and the extent to which expectations foreshadow actual behavior\\". The actions of a youth in high school greatly impact the choices the individual will have over a lifetime. Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of motherhood. Males can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to Jack Halberstam (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with \\"maleness and to power to domination‚Äù, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy. In a 2015 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on \\"education,employment, and socioeconomic status\\" whereas the expectations for black men focused on \\"sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship‚Äù. These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man. Adolescents view on adulthood is also determined by their employment in high school. Many boys work during high school and \\"unlike young women, young men who had not worked during high school did not quite match their peers\\". Because many other boys are working, those who don't work may not be as successful after graduation. In the book Working and Growing Up in America, Jeylan T. Mortimer explains \\"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more vocationally successful after leaving high school\\". This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school. This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work. =Depression= High school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to \\"cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems\\". One of these psychological problems is depression. While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is psychological well-being. Negriff and Susman explain in their article \\"Pubertal Timing, Depression, and Externalizing Problems\\" that \\"the same hormones that increase during puberty are also related to depression and aggressive tendencies. Higher levels of testosterone are associated with increased aggression in boys and girls, whereas higher estrogen for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms\\". The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students. One study done by James Battle in 1980 took 26 student ages 15‚Äì18 showed a correlation between depression and self-esteem. In the 80s, research had not looked past adults and Battle's research was some of the first of its kind which showed a direct correlation between self-esteem and depression. Self-esteem is not a product of our biology but rather is culturally constructed. Girls in high school also tend to have lower self-esteem due to body image. With depression and self-esteem being so closely linked the potential for having the disease can result in an educational experience which can be compromised. Depression can be isolating, and without proper academics and societal support, high school can be challenging. Along with higher rates of self-esteem issues in adolescents, this can adversely affect girls' academics and social life in high school. =Body image= There are many different factors that affect body image, \\"including sex, media, parental relationship, and puberty as well as weight and popularity\\". The intersectionality of these factors causes individualistic experiences for adolescents during this period within their lives. As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to psychological well-being during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction. In the article \\"Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type\\", Helen Winfield explains that an adolescent's high school experience is closely linked to their perceived body image. She analyzed over 336 teenagers and found \\"ratings of physical attractiveness and body image remain relatively stable across the early teenage years, but become increasingly negative around age 15‚Äì18 years because of pubertal changes\\". This shift during the high school years may cause serious psychological problems for adolescents. These psychological problems can manifest into eating disorders causing serious lifelong problems. Due to these findings, it is shown that these body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter puberty, expectations of height and muscle mass change as well. Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G. Pope Jr. in their article, \\"Body image in boys: A review of the literature,\\" claim that \\"girls typically wanted to be thinner, boys frequently wanted to be bigger\\". This statistic displays that gender difference in body image cause different beauty ideals. Gender can have an impact of affecting an adolescent's body image and potentially their high school experience. =Education= Due to the amount of time that children spend in school, \\"teachers are influential role models for many aspects of children's educational experiences, including gender socialization\\". Teachers who endorse the culturally dominant gender-role stereotype regarding the distribution of talent between males and females distort their perception of their students' mathematical abilities and effort resources in mathematics, in a manner that is consistent with their gender-role stereotype and to a greater extent than teachers who do not endorse the stereotype. According to the 1994 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns by the American Psychological Association, \\"[m]ost standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.\\" Differences have been found, however, in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures. Even within mathematics, it is noted that significant differences in performance as a result of gender do not occur until late in high school, a result of biological differences, the exhibition of stereotypes by teachers, and the difference in chosen coursework between individual students. While, on average, boys and girls perform similarly in math, boys are over represented among the very best performers as well as the very worst. Teachers have found that when certain types of teaching (such as experiments that reflect daily life), work for girls, they generally work for boys as well. Although little difference in mathematics performance was found among younger students, a study of students grade 1-3 by Fennema et al. noted that significant differences in problem-solving strategies were found, with girls tending to use more standard algorithms than the boys. They suggest that this may be due to both the teachers' stereotypical beliefs about mathematics and gender, as well as the study's design permitting \\"the children's stereotypical beliefs to influence strategy use and thus the development of understanding in these classrooms\\". A study conducted at Illinois State University examined the effects of gender stereotypes on the teaching practices of three third grade teachers, noting that \\"[the teachers] claimed gender neutrality, yet they expressed numerous beliefs about gender difference during the study\\", such as allowing boys (but not girls) to respond to questions without raising their hand or providing reading selections that promoted women in non-traditional roles, but not doing the same for men. Overall, differences in student performance that arise from gender tend to be smaller than that of other demographic differences, such as race or socioeconomic class. The results of the 1992 NAEP 12th grade science tests, on a 500-point scale, show that the differences of scores between white and African American students were around 48 points, while differences between male and female students were around 11 points. = Media = Social gender construction (specifically for younger audiences) is also influenced by media. In the 21st century, modern technology is abundant in developed countries. In 2018, roughly 42% of tweens and teens experience feelings of anxiety when not near their phones. There is a growing amount of teens that spend an average of 6.5 hours on media daily. This data reflects how much of a teenager's personality is dependent on media. Media influencing gender construction can be seen in advertising, social networking, magazines, television, music, and music videos. These platforms can affect how a developing human views themselves and those around them. There is both positive and negative media and each type can be perceived differently. Media will often portray men and women in a stereotypical manner, reflecting their \\"ideal image\\" for society. These images often act as an extreme expectation for many developing teenagers. Men are typically portrayed as assertive, powerful, and strong. Particularly in television, men are usually shown as being nonemotional and detached. Women are often portrayed as the opposite. Gender roles are generally more enforced for women in media than they are for men. Women are typically represented as the backbone of the household, the caretaker, and often even as stay at home mothers. Females in media are often given weak, dependent, and passive personalities. Media presence often perpetuates that men are not allowed to be caring and that women are not allowed to be strong and demanding. These gender influences from the media can mislead a growing child or teenager because while they are still trying to construct their identities and genders in a social environment, they are surrounded by biased influences. Research methods Inclusiveness and acceptance play significant roles in social constructionist practice ‚Äì examples include sharing work with others in a cooperative manner, including a diverse sample, being open to other interpretations of data, and blurring the lines between scientific research, participatory research and social activism. The blurring of scientific research also means incorporating other disciplines into psychological work (e.g. performative psychology includes artistic expression or humor) and thinking in terms that go beyond traditional scientific language. These methods are not currently valued in psychology because they are not seen as scientific. A social constructionist psychologist can make it explicit that his or her perspective is not universally true in all contexts across historical periods. Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique ‚Äì no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations. Related to this is the idea that social constructionists must constantly question their own work because their work can be constantly reinterpreted and have different meanings at different times. Social constructionists argue that the gender dichotomy is so ingrained that it is impossible for research findings to remain unaffected by it. People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings. That is, research questions are framed in ways that look for a difference between genders, and thus their methods will be constrained by this framework as well. Moreover, the actual outcome of the study, even if the claims are dubious or modest at best, often come to be accepted as facts if they support the gender discourse narrative and are often cited and discussed. This phenomenon is labeled the \\"hall of mirrors\\" effect. In order to fully and accurately record the socialization processes at play regarding gender construction, ethnographic and longitudinal studies are ideal. However, these methods have their constraints. It is costly and time consuming to carry out such studies that would yield significant results, and there is an abundance of factors that influence an individual's gender construction. Thus, more research is needed regarding the social construction of gender. Research can either be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative data is beneficial because it can give a voice to the subjects of the study. However, poorly-constructed qualitative research can lead to reproduction of race and class biases if findings are inappropriately generalized. For example, qualitative research methods often involve small, homogeneous samples. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalize the findings of a study conducted on a specific group of people and then apply them to all people of that gender. Quantitative data is useful when hard data is needed, such as addressing policy issues, when hard data is needed to convince people unfamiliar with the topics. However, quantitative research can reinforce gender and cultural assumptions as well through item construction. That is, for data to be quantitatively analysed, they must fit into specific categories. However, such categories can be based on or at least influenced by gender stereotypes. Promoting social change and criticisms =Social change= Gender often means adhering to gender normative behavior and roles. The performance of gender reinforces the essentialism of gender categories. Essentialism argues that there are essential differences between genders which manifest themselves in differences in gender performance. Gender performance consists of a stylized practice involving gestures, language, and speech and serves to form and build an identity. When an individual performs their gender to the standards set by societal norms, this bolsters the argument of gender essentialism. Pdf. Historically, men have assumed a dominant gender role, and women have been prescribed a role submissive to men. In order for subordination to go unquestioned, the structure must not appear as a cultural product ‚Äì it must seem natural. Social movements can challenge the categories that appear \\"natural.\\" Certain legislation can promote equality for men and women, which could call into question whether there needs to be two categories of gender at all (if both are treated equally). Social change relies on an understanding of how inequality is rooted in gender accomplishment. Throughout history, women have fought for their rights regarding various issues.. The first wave, which began in 1854, was a fight for women's rights to education and to the vote by the suffragettes. This movement was then followed by Second-wave feminism and Third-wave feminism which furthered the feminist cause. The feminist movement was not only about fighting for women's rights, but more essentially about earning recognition and respect from the general public acknowledging the fact that they are not inferior than men and thus deserving to be treated equally and granted fair opportunities. Feminism emerged and started to challenge the idea that a woman's appropriate place was confined to that of the domestic and private sphere. Over time, men and women's attitudes have been becoming more liberalized with regard to gender roles. Men and women are agreeing on a more egalitarian responsibility distribution within the family sphere. They are also in agreement that women should and can have roles in the public sphere, especially in leadership positions and that men can have and involved role in the private and domestic sphere. Pdf. These markers of increasingly liberalized attitudes toward gender roles indicate the trajectory of social change in terms of what is deemed normative. =Criticism and opportunities to \\"undo\\" gender= Because the theory says that one can \\"do\\" gender whether they conform to gender norms or not (and is always held accountable for behaving in accordance with gender norms), change seems impossible. If essential differences between the sexes are problematic, a society where gender is omnirelevant could be argued to always uphold gender inequality. The language of \\"doing\\" gender implies doing difference instead of unraveling it. Most studies that rely on social constructionism explore the ways in which gender is constructed but nevertheless demonstrate how those gender constructions uphold gender as a construct and gender inequality. However, because gender is \\"done\\" or constructed, it can also be \\"undone\\" or deconstructed. The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine: (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered, (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions, (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality, (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change, and (5) interaction as the site of change. =Nature versus nurture= Theories that imply that gendered behavior is totally or mostly due to social conventions and culture fall into the nurture end of the nature versus nurture debate. Much empirical research has been done on to what extent gendered behavior stems from biological factors.

Bain, Woodhead Publishing; 1 edition (March 13, 1996) is a method of calculating investment return. To apply the time-weighted return method, combine the returns over sub-periods, by compounding them together, resulting in the overall period return. The rate of return over each different sub-period is weighted according to the duration of the sub-period. The time-weighted method differs from other methods of calculating investment return only in the particular way it compensates for external flows - see below. External flows The time-weighted return is a measure of the historical performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for external flows. External flows are net movements of value which result from transfers of cash, securities or other instruments, into or out of the portfolio, with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction, as in the case of a purchase or sale, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends. To compensate for external flows, the overall time interval under analysis is divided into contiguous sub-periods at each point in time within the overall time period whenever there is an external flow. In general, these sub-periods will be of unequal lengths. The returns over the sub-periods between external flows are linked geometrically (compounded) together, i.e. by multiplying together the growth factors in all the sub-periods. (The growth factor in each sub-period is equal to 1 plus the return over the sub-period.) =The problem of external flows= To illustrate the problem of external flows, consider the following example. Example 1 Suppose an investor transfers $500 into a portfolio at the beginning of Year 1, and another $1,000 at the beginning of Year 2, and the portfolio has a total value of $1,500 at the end of the Year 2. The net gain over the two-year period is zero, so intuitively, we might expect that the return over the whole 2-year period to be 0% (which is incidentally the result of applying one of the money-weighted methods). If the cash flow of $1,000 at the beginning of Year 2 is ignored, then the simple method of calculating the return without compensating for the flow will be 200% ($1,000 divided by $500). Intuitively, 200% is incorrect. If we add further information however, a different picture emerges. If the initial investment gained 100% in value over the first year, but the portfolio then declined by 25% during the second year, we would expect the overall return over the two-year period to be the result of compounding a 100% gain ($500) with a 25% loss (also $500). The time-weighted return is found by multiplying together the growth factors for each year, i.e. the growth factors before and after the second transfer into the portfolio, then subtracting one, and expressing the result as a percentage: :(1+1.0)(1-0.25)-1 = 2.0 \\\\times 0.75-1 = 1.5-1 = 0.5 = 50\\\\% . We can see from the time-weighted return that the absence of any net gain over the two-year period was due to bad timing of the cash inflow at the beginning of the second year. The time-weighted return appears in this example to overstate the return to the investor, because he sees no net gain. However, by reflecting the performance each year compounded together on an equalized basis, the time-weighted return recognizes the performance of the investment activity independently of the poor timing of the cash flow at the beginning of Year 2. If all the money had been invested at the beginning of Year 1, the return by any measure would most likely have been 50%. $1,500 would have grown by 100% to $3,000 at the end of Year 1, and then declined by 25% to $2,250 at the end of Year 2, resulting in an overall gain of $750, i.e. 50% of $1,500. The difference is a matter of perspective. = Adjustment for flows = The return of a portfolio in the absence of flows is: :R = \\\\frac{M_2 -M_1}{M_1} where M_2 is the portfolio's final value, M_1 is the portfolio's initial value, and R is the portfolio's return over the period. The growth factor is: :1+R= \\\\frac{M_2}{M_1} External flows during the period being analyzed complicate the performance calculation. If external flows are not taken into account, the performance measurement is distorted: a flow into the portfolio would cause this method to overstate the true performance, while flows out of the portfolio would cause it to understate the true performance. To compensate for an external flow C_1 into the portfolio at the beginning of the period, adjust the portfolio's initial value M_1 by adding C_1. The return is: :R = \\\\frac{M_2 - (M_1 + C_1)}{M_1 + C_1} and the corresponding growth factor is: :1+R= \\\\frac{M_2}{M_1 + C_1} To compensate for an external flow C_2 into the portfolio just before the valuation M_2 at the end of the period, adjust the portfolio's final value M_2 by subtracting C_2. The return is: :R = \\\\frac{(M_2 - C_2) - M_1}{M_1} and the corresponding growth factor is: :1+R= \\\\frac{M_2 - C_2}{M_1} =Time-weighted return compensating for external flows= Suppose that the portfolio is valued immediately after each external flow. The value of the portfolio at the end of each sub-period is adjusted for the external flow which takes place immediately before. External flows into the portfolio are considered positive and flows out of the portfolio are negative. :1+R = \\\\frac{M_1 -C_1}{M_0}\\\\times\\\\frac{M_2 -C_2}{M_1}\\\\times\\\\frac{M_3 -C_3}{M_2}\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times\\\\frac{M_{n-1} -C_{n-1}}{M_{n-2}}\\\\times\\\\frac{M_{n} -C_{n}}{M_{n-1}} where :R is the time- weighted return of the portfolio, :M_0 is the initial portfolio value, :M_t is the portfolio value at the end of sub-period t, immediately after external flow C_t, :M_n is the final portfolio value, :C_t is the net external flow into the portfolio which occurs just before the end of sub-period t, and :n is the number of sub-periods. If there is an external flow occurring at the end of the overall period, then the number of sub-periods n matches the number of flows. However, if there is no flow at the end of the overall period, then C_n is zero, and the number of sub-periods n is one greater than the number of flows. If the portfolio is valued immediately before each flow instead of immediately after, then each flow should be used to adjust the starting value within each sub-period, instead of the ending value, resulting in a different formula: :1+R = \\\\frac{M_1}{M_0 +C_0}\\\\times\\\\frac{M_2}{M_1+C_1}\\\\times\\\\frac{M_3}{M_2 +C_2}\\\\times...\\\\times\\\\frac{M_{n-1}}{M_{n-2} +C_{n-2}}\\\\times\\\\frac{M_{n}}{M_{n-1} +C_{n-1}} where :R is the time-weighted return of the portfolio, :M_0 is the initial portfolio value, :M_t is the portfolio value at the end of sub-period t, immediately before external flow C_t, :M_n is the final portfolio value, :C_t is the net external flow into the portfolio which occurs at the beginning of sub-period {t+1}, and :n is the number of sub-periods. Explanation =Why it is called \\"time-weighted\\"= The term time-weighted is best illustrated with continuous (logarithmic) rates of return. The overall rate of return is the time-weighted average of the continuous rate of return in each sub-period. In the absence of flows, :\\\\text {End value} = \\\\text {start value} \\\\times e^{r_{\\\\mathrm{log}}t} where r_{\\\\mathrm{log}} is the continuous rate of return and t is the length of time. Example 2 Over a period of a decade, a portfolio grows by a continuous rate of return of 5% p.a. (per annum) over three of those years, and 10% p.a. over the other seven years. :\\\\text {End value} = \\\\text {start value} \\\\times \\\\left(1+0.05\\\\right)^3 \\\\times \\\\left(1+0.1\\\\right)^7 \\\\approx \\\\text {start value} \\\\times e^{0.05 \\\\times 3} \\\\times e^{0.10 \\\\times 7} ::=\\\\text {start value} \\\\times e^{\\\\left(0.05 \\\\times \\\\frac {3}{10} + 0.10 \\\\times \\\\frac {7}{10} \\\\right) \\\\times 10} The continuous time-weighted rate of return over the ten-year period is the time-weighted average: :5\\\\% \\\\times \\\\frac{3}{10} + 10\\\\% \\\\times \\\\frac{7}{10} = \\\\frac{5\\\\% \\\\times 3 + 10\\\\% \\\\times 7}{10} = 8.5\\\\% =Ordinary time-weighted rate of return= Example 3 Consider another example to calculate the annualized ordinary rate of return over a five-year period of an investment which returns 10% p.a. for two of the five years, and -3% p.a. for the other three. The ordinary time-weighted return over the five-year period is: :(1+0.10)(1+0.10)(1-0.03)(1-0.03)(1-0.03)-1 ::= 1.1^2 \\\\times 0.97^3-1 ::= 0.104334\\\\ldots ::= 10.4334\\\\ldots\\\\% and after annualization, the rate of return is: :(1.1^2 \\\\times 0.97^3)^{1/(2+3)} -1 :: = 1.0200\\\\ldots-1 ::= 2.00\\\\ldots\\\\% \\\\text { p.a.} The length of time over which the rate of return was 10% was two years, which appears in the power of two on the 1.1 factor: :1.1^2 Likewise, the rate of return was -3% for three years, which appears in the power of three on the 0.97 factor. The result is then annualized over the overall five-year period. Portfolio performance measurement Investment managers are judged on investment activity which is under their control. If they have no control over the timing of flows, then compensating for the timing of flows, applying the true time-weighted return method to a portfolio, is a superior measure of the performance of the investment manager, at the overall portfolio level. =Internal flows and the performance of elements within a portfolio= Internal flows are transactions such as purchases and sales of holdings within a portfolio, in which the cash used for purchases, and the cash proceeds of sales, is also contained in the same portfolio, so there is no external flow. A cash dividend on a stock in a portfolio, which is retained in the same portfolio as the stock, is a flow from the stock to the cash account within the portfolio. It is internal to the portfolio, but external to both the stock and the cash account when they are considered individually, in isolation from one another. The time-weighted method only captures the effect attributable to the size and timing of internal flows in aggregate, i.e. insofar as they result in the overall performance of the portfolio. This is for the same reason, which is the time-weighted method neutralizes the effect of flows. It therefore does not capture the performance of parts of a portfolio, such as the performance due to individual security- level decisions, so effectively as it captures the overall portfolio performance. The time-weighted return of a particular security, from initial purchase to eventual final sale, is the same, regardless of the presence or absence of interim purchases and sales, their timing, size and the prevailing market conditions. It always matches the share price performance (including dividends, etc.). Unless this feature of the time-weighted return is the desired objective, it arguably makes the time weighted method less informative than alternative methodologies for investment performance attribution at the level of individual instruments. For performance attribution at individual security level to be meaningful in many cases depends on the return being different from the share price return. If the individual security return matches the share price return, the transaction timing effect is zero. See Example 4 below, which illustrates this feature of the time-weighted method. Example 4 Let us imagine an investor purchases 10 shares at 10 dollars per share. Then the investor adds another 5 shares in the same company bought at the market price of 12 dollars per share (ignoring transaction costs). The entire holding of 15 shares is then sold at 11 dollars per share. The second purchase appears to be badly timed, compared with the first. Is this poor timing apparent, from the time-weighted (holding-period) return of the shares, in isolation from the cash in the portfolio? To calculate the time-weighted return of these particular shareholdings, in isolation from the cash used to purchase the shares, treat the purchase of shares as an external inflow. Then the first sub-period growth factor, preceding the second purchase, when there are just the first 10 shares, is: :\\\\frac {\\\\text{End value}}{\\\\text {start value}} = \\\\frac {10 \\\\times 12}{10 \\\\times 10} = \\\\frac {120}{100} = 1.2 and growth factor over the second sub-period, following the second purchase, when there are 15 shares altogether, is: :\\\\frac {\\\\text{End value}}{\\\\text {start value}} = \\\\frac {15 \\\\times 11}{15 \\\\times 12} = \\\\frac {165}{180} = 0.91666\\\\ldots so the overall period growth factor is: :\\\\text {Product of sub- period growth factors} = \\\\text {first sub-period growth factor} \\\\times \\\\text{second sub-period growth factor} ::= \\\\frac {120}{100} \\\\times \\\\frac {165}{180} ::= \\\\frac {120 \\\\times 165}{100 \\\\times 180} ::= \\\\frac {19,800}{18,000} ::= 1.1 and the time-weighted holding-period return is: :\\\\text{Growth factor} - 1 = 0.1 = 10\\\\% which is the same as the simple return calculated using the change in the share price: := \\\\frac {\\\\text {End value} - \\\\text{start value}}{\\\\text{start value}} = \\\\frac {11-10}{10} The poor timing of the second purchase has made no difference to the performance of the investment in shares, calculated using the time-weighted method, compared for instance with a pure buy-and-hold strategy (i.e. buying all the shares at the beginning, and holding them until the end of the period). Comparison with other returns methods Other methods exist to compensate for external flows when calculating investment returns. Such methods are known as \\"money- weighted\\" or \\"dollar-weighted\\" methods. The time-weighted return is higher than the result of other methods of calculating the investment return when external flows are badly timed - refer to Example 4 above. =Internal rate of return= One of these methods is the internal rate of return. Like the true time-weighted return method, the internal rate of return is also based on a compounding principle. It is the discount rate that will set the net present value of all external flows and the terminal value equal to the value of the initial investment. However, solving the equation to find an estimate of the internal rate of return generally requires an iterative numerical method and sometimes returns multiple results. The internal rate of return is commonly used for measuring the performance of private equity investments, because the principal partner (the investment manager) has greater control over the timing of cash flows, rather than the limited partner (the end investor). =Simple Dietz method= The Simple Dietz methodDietz, Peter O. Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance. Free Press, 1966. applies a simple rate of interest principle, as opposed to the compounding principle underlying the internal rate of return method, and further assumes that flows occur at the midpoint within the time interval (or equivalently that they are distributed evenly throughout the time interval). However, the Simple Dietz method is unsuitable when such assumptions are invalid, and will produce different results to other methods in such a case. The simple Dietz returns of two or more different constituent assets in a portfolio over the same period can be combined together to derive the simple Dietz portfolio return, by taking the weighted average. The weights are the start value plus half the net inflow. Example 5 Applying the Simple Dietz method to the shares purchased in Example 4 (above): :\\\\text {Simple Dietz return} = \\\\frac {\\\\text {gain or loss}}{\\\\text {start value} + \\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\times \\\\text {net inflow}} :\\\\text {Gain or loss} = \\\\text {end value} - \\\\text {start value} - \\\\text {net inflow} ::= 165 - 100 - 60 ::= 5 so :\\\\text {Simple Dietz return} = \\\\frac {5}{100 + \\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\times 60} ::= \\\\frac {5}{130} ::= 3.86 \\\\% \\\\text { (2 d. p.)} which is noticeably lower than the 10% time-weighted return. =Modified Dietz method= The Modified Dietz method is another method which, like the Simple Dietz method, applies a simple rate of interest principle. Instead of comparing the gain in value (net of flows) with the initial value of the portfolio, it compares the net gain in value with average capital over the time interval. Average capital allows for the timing of each external flow. As the difference between the Modified Dietz method and the internal rate of return method is that the Modified Dietz method is based on a simple rate of interest principle, whereas the internal rate of return method applies a compounding principle, the two methods produce similar results over short time intervals, if the rates of return are low. Over longer time periods, with significant flows relative to the size of the portfolio, and where the returns are not low, then the differences are more significant. Like the simple Dietz method, the Modified Dietz returns of two or more different constituent assets in a portfolio over the same period can be combined together to derive the Modified Dietz portfolio return, by taking the weighted average. The weight to be applied to the return on each asset in this case is the average capital of the asset. Example 6 Referring again to the scenario described in Examples 4 and 5, if the second purchase occurs exactly halfway through the overall period, the Modified Dietz method has the same result as the Simple Dietz method. If the second purchase is earlier than halfway through the overall period, the gain, which is 5 dollars, is still the same, but the average capital is greater than the start value plus half the net inflow, making the denominator of the Modified Dietz return greater than that in the Simple Dietz method. In this case, the Modified Dietz return is less than the Simple Dietz return. If the second purchase is later than halfway through the overall period, the gain, which is 5 dollars, is still the same, but the average capital is less than the start value plus half the net inflow, making the denominator of the Modified Dietz return less than that in the Simple Dietz method. In this case, the Modified Dietz return is greater than the Simple Dietz return. No matter how late during the period the second purchase of shares occurs, the average capital is greater than 100, and so the Modified Dietz return is less than 5 percent. This is still noticeably less than the 10 percent time weighted return. =Linked returns methods= Calculating the \\"true time-weighted return\\" depends on the availability of portfolio valuations during the investment period. If valuations are not available when each flow occurs, the time-weighted return can only be estimated by linking returns for contiguous sub-periods together geometrically, using sub-periods at the end of which valuations are available. Such an approximate time- weighted return method is prone to overstate or understate the true time- weighted return. Linked Internal Rate of Return (LIROR) is another such method which is sometimes used to approximate the true time-weighted return. It combines the true time-weighted rate of return method with the internal rate of return (IRR) method. The internal rate of return is estimated over regular time intervals, and then the results are linked geometrically. For example, if the internal rate of return over successive years is 4%, 9%, 5% and 11%, then the LIROR equals 1.04 x 1.09 x 1.05 x 1.11 ‚Äì 1 = 32.12%. If the regular time periods are not years, then either calculate the un-annualized holding period version of the IRR for each time interval, or calculate the IRR for each time interval firstly, and then convert each one to a holding period return over the time interval, then link together these holding period returns to obtain the LIROR. =Returns methods in the absence of flows= If there are no external flows, then all these methods (time-weighted return, internal rate of return, Modified Dietz Method etc.) give identical results - it is only the various ways they handle flows which makes them different from each other. Logarithmic returns The continuous or logarithmic return method is not a competing method of compensating for flows. It is simply the natural logarithm ln \\\\left( \\\\frac {M_2}{M_1} \\\\right) of the growth factor. Fees To measure returns net of fees, allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for them by treating them as an external flow, and exclude the negative effect of accrued fees from valuations. Annual rate of return Return and rate of return are sometimes treated as interchangeable terms, but the return calculated by a method such as the time-weighted method is the holding period return per dollar (or per some other unit of currency), not per year (or other unit of time), unless the holding period happens to be one year. Annualization, which means conversion to an annual rate of return, is a separate process. Refer to the article rate of return.

They were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Severin Miller  Severin Miller was born in Prussia on October 17, 1824, the son of Bartholomew and Anna Marie Miller. He was raised and educated there, and learned the machinist trade from his father. In 1846 at the age of 22, he immigrated to the United States. He landed in New York City and initially settled in Philadelphia. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri and in 1850 he moved again to Davenport. He found work as a machinist in all these places. In 1852 he purchased property on the corner of Second and Gaines Streets. He returned to St. Louis briefly before returning to Davenport in 1857 when he built a shop and home on the property he bought in 1852. Miller mainly did repair work on farm equipment. His business expanded to the manufacture of pumps and a foundry. He sold the business in 1875. In 1862 he married Christiania Baussmann and they raised four children. He built his home on Telegraph Road in 1868 in what was then a rural area outside of the city. The house remained with the Miller's daughters until they died in the mid-1940s. Architecture Barn This house and the barn behind it are two of a very few vernacular stone structures that remain from Davenport's early decades. with The house has a symmetrical five-bay front reminiscent of the Greek Revival style. The four round-arch windows all feature a keystone and above them are slabs that suggest sills of small attic windows that were never installed. The possible inspiration for the house was the architecture of Miller's native Prussia. There are plans for another wing, but they were abandoned when Christiania Miller died in 1871. The Miller Foundry produced the metal work used throughout the house. An addition was built on the back of the house sometime after 1982, which replaced a previous addition. Behind the house sits a rubble stone barn. The structure is typical of barns found in the German communities in Pennsylvania and other eastern states. It features triangular, wood relieving arches and the gable ends covered with vertical wood planks.

Like its U.S. parent, it sold books, CDs, DVDs and stationery. All of the stores also had Gloria Jean's Coffee shop concessions in them. The second outlet in Singapore was opened at Parkway Parade in 2007. To pay off debt, Borders Group sold all of its Australian, New Zealand and Singaporean stores to Pacific Equity Partners (owner of competitor Angus & Robertson) in 2008. A new company called REDgroup Retail was formed. After this transaction, the Borders stores in the US, the UK (which had also been sold off to another company but closed down in 2009 due to entering administration) and the Asia/Pacific region were owned by three wholly independent entities.

Borders Lygon Court operated from 2002 until 2011. On 17 February 2011, REDgroup Retail (including the Borders, Angus & Robertson as well as Whitcoulls chains) were placed into voluntary administration with Ferrier Hodgson appointed as administrators. The immediate aftermath of the announcement saw the closure of 48 Angus & Robertson stores and one Borders store. The day after the announcement, customers of the surviving stores were informed that gift vouchers could only be redeemed if they also spent an equivalent amount in cash. After 3 April, unused vouchers became void. On 6 April, RedGroup Retail announced that 16 of the 25 remaining Borders stores in Australia were to close within two months. The handling of the administration prompted 25 franchised Angus & Robertson stores to sever ties with RedGroup, rebranding themselves as independents. By the end of May, 70 of the 87 RedGroup-owned bookstores in New Zealand had been sold off: ten airport-based Whitcoulls stores to Australian-based LS Travel Retail Pacific, and another 57 Whitcoulls plus five Borders stores to the James Pascoe Group. On 2 June 2011, the administrator announced the closure of the remaining nine Borders stores, as no buyer could be found. All stores in Australia were closed by July 2011.

Busch owned and operated a grocery store in the Village of East Davenport and the family lived above the store for several years before this house was built in 1877. with Over the years he had made a sizeable investment in real estate on the east side of Davenport where he developed many houses and commercial structures. Architecture While this house sits geographically in the McClellan Heights neighborhood, architecturally it fits more properly in the neighboring Village of East Davenport. East Davenport was an industrial town that began in the 1850s and was annexed into the city of Davenport by the time the decade ended. The house follows a popular Vernacular style of architecture from the mid to late 19th-century Davenport known as the McClelland style. It shows influences from other architectural styles as well, such as the bracketed eaves and the polygonal window bay on the east side that suggests the Italianate style. The round arch windows in the attic is another popular feature in Davenport homes built in this era. The veranda that wraps around from the front of the house to the west side was probably added in the early 20th-century. The same is true for the sunroom in the re-entrant angle between the houses main block and the pavilion on the west side.

The world's largest celt of Stone Age and the largest cemetery of the megalithic age have been discovered in Kalahandi. This shows the region had a civilized culture since the pre-historic era. Asurgarh near Narla in Kalahandi was one of the oldest metropolises in Odisha whereas the other one was Sisupalgarh near Bhubaneswar. Some other historical forts in the region includes Budhigarh (ancient period), Amthagarh (ancient period), Belkhandi (ancient to medieval period) and Dadpur-Jajjaldeypur (medieval period). This land was unconquered by the great Ashoka, who fought the great Kalinga War, as per Ashokan record.B. Mishra, 2003‚Äì2004 In medieval period the region had played a prominent role to link South India, Eastern India and Central India region and witnessed the battle ground for Somavamsi, Chola, Kalachuris of Kalyani and Eastern Ganga dynasty. Kalahandi region was the main route for Chola to attack Subarnapur. The history of Kalahandi is rich in terms of contribution towards the Indian culture and temple architecture. Temple of Goddess Stambeswari at Asurgarh, built during 500 AD, is a perfect example where the first brick Temple in Eastern India was built. Sanskritization in Odisha was first started from Kalahandi, Koraput region, ancient Mahakantara region. Earliest flat-roofed stone temple of Odisha was built at Mohangiri in Kalahandi during 600 AD. Temple architecture achieved perfection at Belkhandi in Kalahandi and then traversed to Ekamra, present Bhubaneswar, along with the political expansion of the Somavamsis during the 1000‚Äì1100 AD. The distribution and occurrence of precious and semi-precious gemstones and other commercial commodities of Kalahandi region have found place in accounts of Panini (5th century BC), Kautilya (3rd century BC), Ptolemy (2nd century AD), Wuang Chuang (7th century AD) and Travenier (19th century AD). Present name Kalahandi finds mention for the first time in the Junagarh Dadhivaman temple inscription issued from Kalahandinagara by Maharaja Jugasai Dev in A. D. 1718... The region was known as various names in different period of time such as Kantara, Mahakantara, Titilaka Janapada, Atavi Land, Chakrakota Mandala, Kamala Mandala and Karonda Mandal. It was also part of Trikalinga for a certain period. It was a feudatory under Eastern Ganga dynasty, Gadajat under Maratha and Princely State under British rule in India. After independence of India, in 1948, Kalahandi joined Indian Union and became a part of Odisha state. However, in post independence period the name Kalahandi got associated with backwardness despite its rich history, culture, art, craft and agriculture & forest resources. Prehistoric Era: cradle of civilization The finding of plant fossil in the southwest basin of the Tel river in Kalahandi pushes back of the antiquity of primeval shrub on this landmass to at least 0.1 million years before the present.B. Mishra, An overview of Tel river civilization, Kalahandi Renaissance, 2005, p2. =Stone Age culture (15th millennium BC to 2nd millennium BC)= Archaeological record of Tel valley reveals the presence of the primates in its various zones during the Pleistocenephase. Paleolithic is being documented in Kalahandi, like Moter river basin in Dharamgarh region.R.P. Prusty, 1992, Paleolithic Vestiges from Kalahandi, Odisha Historical Research Journal, XXXVII, no. 1-5, pp. 55-66, Odisha State Museum, Bhubaneswar The prehistoric painting in Gudahandi in Kalahandi shows a well advanced human settlement in the region. World's largest size celt (axe) of late Stone Age culture has been recovered from Chandrasagarnala in Kalahandi.P. Mohanty, B. Mishra, Op. Cit,2001, p.47 This is the largest stone Axe of the world measuring 47 cm and weighing 2.5 kg, which shows very sophisticated workmanship. Similarly mesolithic and neolithic historical records are evident in Bijadongar, Koradongar [Junagarh], Gudahandi, Bicchakhaman, Budigarh, Chandrasagarnala, Karlapada, Bhaludongar, Chilpa, Habaspur, Belkhandi, Jamugudapadar, Dongargarh, Asurgarh, Phurlijharan, Ghantmal, Kuttrukhamar, Jampadar, Pipalnala, Godang, Budipadar, Mahimapadia, Nehena, Penjorani, Yogimath etc. in Kalahandi. The findings include hand axe, cleaver, pebble tools (chopper-chopping), core, blade, flake, point, celt, ring stones, microlithics, coarse pottery, grooving marks, cave art (painting & carving) etc. =Copper ‚Äì Bronze Age (1600 BC to 1000 BC)= The provenances in this period are Jamugudapadar, Chandrasagarnala, Urlukupagarh, Budigarh (M. Rampur), Bhimkela ‚Äì Asurgarh, Kholigarh (Belkhandi) etc. in Kalahandi and the finding include celt, ring stone, microlithc, colourful and sophisticated ceramic, graffiti / sign / alphabet (Harappan & Megalithic), copper items, gold article, high tin bronze objects, precious and semi ‚Äì precious stone beads, terracotta figurines, house foundation, spindle ‚Äì whorl, weight stone, and mud brick. =Iron Age and Megalithic (1000 BC to 700 BC)= Menhir and stone circles of megalithic Iron Age at Bhairavapada (Junagarh), Ruppangudi, Sagada, Bileikani, Themra, Bhawanipatna etc. Iron smelting zone and cemetery Juxtaposed to the settlement is discerned in some of the above sites, which reveal iron tools of war and peace, slages, ceramics, Terra-cottas, firebaked brick, furnace, semi-precious stone beads and micro beads. Beginning of early Iron Age Kalahandi may be placed in the first millennium BC in which black and red ware was the diagnostic pottery type. Next phase of Iron Age represents to early history that was concomitants with state formation and urbanization and technological break through besides voluminous trade, agriculture surplus and heterogeneous social complex in ancient Kalahandi. The material culture of Iron Age found in Kalahandi included semi-precious beads, terracotta figurines, iron implements of war and peace, decorated and plain ceramic, burnt brick, hopscotch (gaming items), spindle whorl, weight stone etc. The largest Megalithic Cemetery was found in the river bank of the Tel river Bileikani, Kalahandi. Early history =Kantara= Mahabharata refers to the territory known as Kantara Sahadeva was said to have vanquished during his southern campaign. Kantara was extended from the up to the bank of river Vena, tributary of Godavari. It is generally accepted that Kantara means a forest-tract of 'wilderness'. The present Kalahandi and undivided Koraput district of Odisha and Bastar district of Chhattisgarh most probably comprised the Kantara kingdom of Mahabharata.N.K. Sahu, P.K. Mishra, J.K. Sahu, History of Orissa Kantara kingdom has been also referred to in the Sanskrit works like Brihatsamhita and the Puranas.Proceedings, Indian History Congress, 1947, 10th session, 178 =Titilaka Janapada= Around 500 ‚Äì 100 BC Asurgarh ‚Äì Narla served as the political - cultural and commercial hub of the Taitilaka Janapada & Atavikas. Very much details of early history of Kalahandi area is unknown. Sera Vanija JatakaE.B. Cowell, (ed), The Jataka, Delhi, 2001, pp.12-14 describes about merchants sailing in the Telavana which is identified as Tel river due to oil traffic in the early period. Taitilaka Janapada described in Ashtadhyayi of Grammarin Paanini comprised part of modern Kalahandi and Balangir district, around Titlagarh. The region was famous for brisk trade in rhinoceros ride and Tel river valley was carrying commerce and trade through navigation. =Atavi Land= During the period of Maurya emperor Ashoka, Kalahandi along with Koraput and Bastar region was called Atavi Land.H. C. Rayachoudhurey, Political History of Ancient India, 538 Around 261 BC intimidation of Ashoka the Great occurred to the Atavikas after the devastating Kalinga war in Rock Edict ‚Äì XIII, and Kalinga Edict ‚Äì II[Jaugad version] was separated. The possible reason could be:‚Äì The Atavikas opposed the mining operation plan of the monarch at Indravanaka and other places to obtained Diamond and precious Gem stones. The Atavika land remained Abhijita [ unconquered] when neighbouring Kalinga [coastal Orissa] lost its independence. Asurgarh seems to be an important centre of Atavika territory and the excavation amply indicates that this area was not under developed during the days of Ashoka and the people had a high standard of civilisation characterised by well polished potteries of northern black polished fabric. =Indravana= In the 4th century BC Kalahandi region was known as Indravana from where precious gem- stones and diamonds were collected for the imperial Maurya treasury. Around the 1st to 3rd century AD ancient Kalahandi [Atavika land] had a commercial and sociocultural relationship with the Chedi of Kalinga and Kusana empire of the northwest. In Amaravati stupa inscription the land is designated as Mahavana. Tel river is a major tributary of Mahanadi rising in the north of Umarkote Tahsil in Nabarangpur district, it passes through few km in Chhattisgarh and then enters into Kalahandi, Balangir district and finally meets Mahanadi in Sonepur district near Manamunda. The important feeders of 150 miles Tel river on its right bank are Moter, Hati, Sagada, Bulat, Ret, Utei and Rahul whereas on its left bank tributaries are Suktel, Lanth, Under, Sungad, Udanti etc. Tel river civilization put light towards a great civilization existing in Kalahandi in the past that is recently getting explored. The discovered archaeological wealth of Tel Valley suggest a well civilized, urbanized, cultured people inhabited on this land mass around 2000 years agoP. Mohanty, B. Mishra, Op. Cit,2000C.R. Mishra, S. Pradhan, op. cit. 1989‚Äì1990, Infra, F.N.79 and Asurgarh was its capital. =Asurgarh, Narla= The Asurgarh (Fort of Asura) existed in the period from 400 BC to 500 AD was one of the ancient metropolis. Asurgarh ‚Äì Narla served as the political - cultural and commercial hub of the Taitilaka Janapada & Atavikas. It is almost rectangular in shape having four gates piercing the surrounding mammoth wall that is made of brick, rubble and earth. After the wall, a wide and deep moat girdles the fort on three sides respectively on the north, south and east. The fort area measures 24.29 hectares of land. On the west of the fort, the river Sandol flows close to the western rampat towards north to meet the river Utei, a tributary of the Tel, about 3 km from the fort site. Close to the eastern ditch, the builders of the fort excavated a huge water reservoir measuring 200 acres of land. It is popularly known as Asursagar. It has been pointed out that the water of the reservoir could be trained into the ditch of the fort through two sluices gate. On the southwest corner of the fort, another small tank was dug, which is known today by its name Radhasagar. Habitation zone of the peoples is being documented towards the south and north of the fort immediately after the fortified wall. Lowe town or habitation area is further superimposed by another mud wall within 100 hectares radius at each settlement zone, the mud wall has single gate in the middle.S.C. Behera (ed.), 1980, Interim Excavation Report, Asurgarh, pp 1-7, Sambalpur University =Asurgarh- Manamunda= The other early urban center bearing the nomenclature-Asurgarh is located on the confluence of the river Mahanadi and Tel near Manamanda of Sonepur-Boudh region of Western Orissa. This site is designated as Asurgarh- Manamunda to distinguish it from other site bearing same appellation. It is believed that the culture of Asugarh-Manamunda is from the 4th century BC to the 3rd century AD. =Budhigarh= Budhigarh or literally the fort of the old lady is one of the ancient urban centers in Kalahandi and configures on the right bank of the river Rahul in Kalahandi. The location of Budigarh is moreover on the ancient salt route range of MohangiriM.P. Singh Deo, 2004‚Äì2005, Black Knobbed ware of Bidhigarh, Madanpur, J. Bengal. Art, Vol 9 & 10, pp. 451-455, ICSBA, Dhaka that connected Kalinga, South-Kosala and Kantara. It was the strategic location of Budhigarh which seems to have contributed for the rise of township in ancient period. Fortification of Budhigarh is discerned towards its west where a huge brick wall runs in south‚Äìnorth direction. The total settlement area of Budhigarh spreads over 12.75 hectares of land. The urban center of Budhigarh is 20 km from the metropolitan center of Kharligarh. =Kharligarh= This site is near the confluence of the river Rahul and Tel around Tushra (Balangir district) whose fortification demonstrates it as one of the metropolises of ancient Odisha. The fort was planned one a piece of horse-shoe shape land measuring 18 hectares, on the right bank of river Rahul. It is a rectangular fort. Rhul river meanders in the fort on three sides in 'U' shape respectively in its south, east and north and then flows towards north to meet the river Tel one km from the fort site. The time period of this fort is verified from 200 BC to 200 AD. (Period I) and 200 AD to 400 AD (Period II).S. Pradhan,2003, Kharligarh: An early historic fort in western orissa, J. Humanities. Soc. Sciences, Vol II, pp 51-61, Sambalpur University =Urlukupagarh= Urlukupagarh is one of the ancient urban centers on the right bank of the present river Utei, also known as Gauraveni in early medieval time, of Madanpur Rampur in Kalahandi. The entire settlement area is under cultivation. =Sirpur= Archaeological site of Sirpur, another ancient urban center in Kalahandia, lies on the right bank of Sandol river of Kalahandi. The river Tel bounded its north and Asurgarh, Narla on the south. Perhaps the strategic situation of the site in the ancient Attavi or Kantara kingdom ultimately gave rise to township here. The finding zone of Sirpur spreads along the left bank of the Sandol river in east‚Äìwest axis covering an area about 8 hectares. =Dumervahal-Gupti= Dumervahal-Gupti is another ancient town on the Southern basin of Tel river situated about 10 km from ancient metropolis Asurgarh, Narla. Tradition bespeaks the settlement as one of the territorial entity of Asurgarh, Narla during the reign of king Vyaghraraja. =Nehna= Nehan is located in the upper Tel valley and is three km from Khariar town in Nuapada district. =Amthagad= Amathguda or Amthagad is a fort, situated on the right bank of the river Tel to the place where the road leading towards Balangir crosses the river. The Udayapur area, the capital of Rashtrakuta kings who ruled the valley, is still dotted with standing structure and ruins mostly found at Amathgad. Ruins of a medieval fort too exist here. =Terasinga= It is one of the ancient urban centers in Kalahandi located near Kesinga. Ancient history =Mahakantara (500 BC to 500 AD)= In the beginning of the Christian era probably it was known as Mahavana.N. K. Sahu, 1964, op. cit. During the 4th century AD the territory was referred to as Mahakantara (Greater forest). Both Mahavana and Mahakantara are synonymous terms representing the same land. Mahakantara comprising Sambalpur, Bilaspur and Raipur were two distinct but neighboring territories. Originally these two geographical units were known as Kantara and in Mahabharata.Mahabharata Sabhaparva, 31, sloka-11-16 In the 4th century AD Vyaghraraja was ruling over Mahakantara comprising Kalahandi, undivided Koraput and Bastar region. Asurgarh was capital of Mahakantara. In ancient history Asurgarh region was transition point for trading between Kaling, Mahakantara. Asurgarh bears special importance so far as the Atavika people are concerned. These people find mention in Ashokan edicts and they are considered to have constituted the fighting forces of Kalinga against Ashoka in the famous Kalinga war. But after defeating him the state of Mahakantara was returned to Vyaghraraj, as the Gupta influence in the Deccan was more of cultural than of political significance. The impact of Gupta culture in Kalahandi region is known from the rise of Saktism, Saiviam and Vaishaniam as well as spread of Sanskrit culture in this area in post-Gupta period. In the 5th century AD Sanskritization in Orissa was first started from Kalahandi ‚Äì Koraput [ancient Kantara]. Kalahandi was the cradle of Stambeswari Creed in the 5th century AD due to Sanskritization, which was a forerunner of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra or Jagannatha Cult. The first brick temple in Eastern India, the temple of Goddess Stambeswari, was built at Asurgarh during the 5th century AD. =Parvatadwarakas= After Vyaghraraja, the Nala kings, whose headquarters was at Puskari identified with modern Podagars near Umarkote in Nabarangpur district, like Bhavadatta Varman, Arthapati and Skanda Varman ruled over south part of this region up to about 500 AD, the territory was known as Nalavadi-visayaN. K. Sahu, Utkal University, History of Orissa, 433 and rest of Mahakantara, lower part of Tel river valley was ruled by king Tastikara and his scions, the kingdom was known as Parvatad-waraka, whose headquarters was Talabhamraka near Belkhandi. In the 6th century AD a new kingdom developed in the Kalahandi tract under King Tustikara, but very little is known about other kings of his family. Maraguda valley in Nuapada district was identified as capital of Sarabapuriyas.S.P. Tiwari, Comprehensive History of Orissa, 95-96 The earliest flat roofed stone temple of Orissa was built at Mohangiri in Kalahandi during the 6th century AD. Medieval history Kalahandi region was scramble for power among Eastern Gangas, Rastrakutas, Somas, Kalachuris, Chindakanagas and Gangas from 6th to 14th centuries. * This period dalvanized Temple Art and Architecture * Rajpadar ‚Äì Belkhandi was the greenhouse of temple architecture in Odisha, where the architect succeeded in erecting the must complex temple structure ‚Äì construction of garbhagriha, mahamandapa, mandapa, and ardhamandapa of brick in an axis. Odisha Temple architecture achieved perfection at Belkhandi and then traversed to Ekamra, present Bhubaneswar, along with the political expansion of the Somavamsis during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. * During this time trade Guild like \\"Kamalavanavanikasangha\\" came into existence * The Gangas Circulated Gold Coin popularly known as Gangapana * Kings & Chieftains espoused the cause of Sanskritization: (i) Varna system came into existence and (ii) Land donation to Brahmana, accelerated the scope and dimension of agriculture besides giving rise to feudal structure. * The process of urbanization continued unabatedly throughout medieval age =Trikalinga= By 9th or 10th century the region including Western Orissa, Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastar was known as TrikalingaM.N. Das (Ed) Sidelight on History and Culture of Orissa, 36 along with Kalinga, Utkal and Dakshina Kosala Kingdom. The Somavamsi king Mahabhavagupta I Janmejaya (925 AD - 960 AD) assumed the title Trikalingadhipati.Orissa District Gazetters, Kalahandi, 46-49 The period between 10th and 13th centuries was a period of great political disturbance in kalinga, utkala, South Kosal and Trikalinga area due to continuing warfare between Saomavansi, Kalachuri, Chindaka Naga, Chola and Ganaga dynasties and Kalahandi became marching route of army and battle field of many battles. There was virtual competition among different powers to become Trikalingadhipati. This period saw Somavansi rulers gradually shifting their capital to safer places to combat inroad of Kalachuries from Chhattisgarh region. Perhaps during this period they moved their capital of South Kosal to Subarnapur-Boudh belt. During the period of internal dispute in Somavansi family, the general of Rajendra Chola vanquished Indra Ratha of Somavanshi. However, the successor of Indra Ratha, Chandihara Jajati 2nd was defeated by Kalachuri king Gngayadev of Tumura.S. Panda, Orissa Review, Vol. XLV, 7& 8 This prompted him to shift his capital from Jajati Nagar near Boudh to coastal belt at Jajpur and divided Somavansi empire into two parts, the Western part Kosala remain in charge of a Governor belonging to Somavansi family. =Chakrakota Mandala= Trikalinga was short lived and Chindakangas carved out a new kingdom called Chakrakota Mandala or Bramarakota Mandala, which later one expanded to whole Kalahandi and Koraput. Nagas started ruling Kalahandi since 1006 AD. Though some historian believe Kalahandi was under Chakrakota Mandala, few other believe few parts of Kalahandi was with other Western Orissa part, separated from Utkala by Udaya Keshari in 1040 AD.N.K. Sahu, Orissa History Res. J, III, 1954, p 135 During this period Chindakangas raised hoods from Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastar region and Chindakangas Someswar Dev defeated Janmejaya 2nd of Kosala branch of Somavansi and made his Telguchoda General as feudatory Chief of Subarnapur.Orissa Dist Gazetteers, Kalahandi, p 48 In 1023 AD the Chola army of Rajendra Chola, proceeded through the course of Tel river from Vengi to reach Yayatinagar near Sonepur.J.K. Sahu, Roads and Highways in Orissa through Ages, Souvnier, Orissa Sahitya Academy, Bhubaneswar, 1982, page 113-114 Around 1110 AD, Kalachuri dynastry from Ratnapur defeated and dethroned the Teluguchoda feudatory chief of Subarnapur. He also marched over kingdom of Chindaknag, perhaps Kalahandi was part of it, causing immense loss.EP Ind. Vol I, P. 218 & XXVIII p. 283 The Kalachuri group ruled 50 years in Subarnapur region, but nothing is clear about Chakrakota Madala including large part of Kalahandi except Madanpur Rampur region which was feudatory of Somavansi. The goddess of Chindakangas was Manikyadevi alied Manikeswari, present deity of Kalahandi. However, remains and influence of Kalachuri such as sati stones are obtained in Kalahandi as per archaeological evidences. During the same period there was confusion and anarchy in Utkal branch of Somavansi (in coastal part of present Orissa) and Eastern Ganga dynasty king Chodaganaga Dev defeated last Somavansi king of Utkal and tried to capture upper Mahanadi valley (Western Orissa and Chhattisgarh region) and Trikaling region. Chodaganga Dev had to fight with Ratnadev 2nd of Kalachures and met a crushing defeat. Chindakangas made friendship with Eastern Ganga dynasty king and thus invited wrath of Kalachuries, who crushed Chakrakota Nagar in order to terrorise Ganga king. At last in more than 100 years of fighting Anag Bhimdev-III of Eastern Ganga dynasty defeated Kalachuris, during this period Western Orissa region went under Eastern Ganga dynasty. =Kamala Mandala= As per Darbar record of History of Naga dynasty of Kalahandi is the only dynasty in Orissa having a record of thousand years (1050‚Äì1948 AD). During the 12th century AD, Chkrakota Mandal was incorporated with the Eastern Ganga dynasty (of Kalinga-Utkal) realm and renamed as Kamala Mandala, thus, Kalahandi region became part of Kalinga as a feudatory of the Eastern Ganga dynasty under Nagas rules till the 14th century. Recent archaeological finding of Dadpur-Jajjaldeypur Fort of 20 hectares of land suggest that Dadpur was capital of Kamal Mandala during Ganga monarch Anangbhimadeva in the 13th century.B. Mishra, P. Mohanty, Archaeological heritage of Dadpur region, District Kalhandi, Orissa, J. Bengal Art, Vol 4, 1999, page343-357 It appears that the imperial Gangas had two provincial headquarters respectively ar Sonepur (Mahanadi valley) and another at Kamal Mandal (Kalahandi or Tel valley). During the long power struggle the other parts of Western Orissa region turned to a vassal state with no importance as the Eastern Ganga dynasty rulers were weakened by frequent foreign invasion of Muslims. Finally local power like Naga and Chauhans raised head. After the 14th century Nagas owed allegiance from Eastern Ganga dynasty to the Surjayavamsi Gajapatis. Since 1568 Nagas ruled Kalahandi independently. Modern history =Nagavamsi rule (1400 AD to 1947 AD)= Sabha Mandap, Bhawanipatna Palace Coat of arms of the Naga dynasty As per the traditional record preserved in Kalahandi Darbar assert that Nagas succeeded the Gangas in Kalahandi hailed from Chot Nagpur. The last Ganga Governor of Kalahandi, Jagannath Deo, had no male issue and his only daughter was married to Raghunath Sai, a prince of the Naga house of Chot Nagpur. Once Raja Jagannath Deo went on pilgrimage with his Rani to northern India and on his return was not allowed by his son in law to enter the Kingdom. Raghunath Sai usurped the Throne of Kalahandi in 1005 AD and then started the rule of Naga dynasty and following genealogy of the Naga dynasty of Kalahandi.J. P Singh Deo, History and Culture of Kalahandi: Political Scenario of Kalahandi, Feb 2010, page: 41-43 ;Genealogy of the Naga Dynasty of Kalahandi *Raghunath Sai (1005‚Äì1040 AD) *Pratap Narayan Deo (1040‚Äì1072 AD) *Birabar Deo (1072‚Äì1108 AD) *Jugasai Deo I (1108‚Äì1142 AD) *Udenarayan Deo (1142‚Äì1173 AD) *Harichandra Deo (1173‚Äì1201 AD) *Ramachandra Deo (1201‚Äì1234 AD) *Gopinath Deo (1234‚Äì1271 AD) *Balabhadra Deo (1271‚Äì1306 AD) *Raghuraj Deo (1306‚Äì1337 AD) *Rai Singh Deo I (1337‚Äì1366 AD) *Haria Deo (1366‚Äì1400 AD) *Jugasai Deo II (1400‚Äì1436 AD) *Pratap Narayan Deo II (1436‚Äì1468 AD) *Hari Rudra Deo (1468‚Äì1496 AD) *Anku Deo (1496‚Äì1528 AD) *Pratap Deo (1528‚Äì1564 AD) *Raghunath Deo (1564‚Äì1594 AD) *Biswambhar Deo (1594‚Äì1627 AD) *Rai Singh Deo II (1627‚Äì1658 AD) *Dusmant Deo (1658‚Äì1693 AD) *Jugasai Deo III (1693‚Äì1721 AD) *Khadag Rai Deo (1721‚Äì1747 AD) *Rai Singh Deo III (1747‚Äì1771 AD) *Purusottam Deo (1771‚Äì1796 AD) *Jugasai Dei IV (1796‚Äì1831 AD) *Fate Narayan Deo (1831‚Äì1853 AD) *Udit Pratap Deo I (1853‚Äì1881 AD) *Raghu Keshari De (1894‚Äì1897 AD) *Court of Wards (1897‚Äì1917 AD) *Brajamohan Deo (1917‚Äì1939 AD) *Pratap Keshari Deo (1939 until the merger with Orissa state) However, historians do not accept such an early date for the establishment of Naga dynasty rule in Kalahandi. As per historian the Nagas succeeded the Gangas in Kamalamandala during the 15th century taking advantage of the weakness of the Central authority, the Gangas of Orissa. This was the period when the Chauhans of Patna roused to power. This created genealogy and established en ‚Äì rapport with the turbulent Khond tribe and started special kind of Abhiseka ceremony at Jugasaipatna, where on a stone, the prince was sitting on the lap of Pat Maghi (Chief of the Khond tribe) and then crowned by the tribes in order to legitimating the royalty. Junagarh designated as \\"Kalahandinagara\\" was selected as capital with Kanaka Durga as tutelary deity. Thirty one kings from Raghunath Sai to Pratap Kesari Deo ruled over Kalahandi and the Naga kings claimed authority over eighteen Gads/Garh. The Maratha Power of Nagpur intervened in Kalahandi during 1788 AD and Raja Purussottama Deo was recognised as the Raja of Kalahandi by the Maratha Chief Raghujee Bhonsala. In 1853, the Nagpur state lapsed to the British Crown as Raghujee III died without an heir and Kalahandi came under the control of the British during the reign of Raja Fate Narayan Deo who shifted also the capital of Kalahandi from Kalahandinagara (Junagarh) to Bhaumadevapatna alias Bhawanipatna and accorded recognition to the local deity Manikeswari. In 1855, first Kond rebellion took Place. Lt. Macneill, the agent of the hilly tracts was attacked at Urladani when the latter arrested Rindo Majhi. In 1882, the second Kond rebellion took place during the reign of queen Asha Kumari. Modernity entered into Kalahandi during the reign of Brajamohan Deo, who occupied the Throne in 1917. In 1939, Maharaja Pratap Kesari Deo succeeded to the throne. =Karonda Mandal= Kalahandi became a princely state under British and known as Karonda Mandal. Maharaja Pratap Keshari Deo, the Ex- Maharaja of Kalahandi, in one of his articles expressed his view that the historical significance of naming Kalahandi as Karunda Mandala is based on the availability of Corundum in this region. Manikeswari (the goddess of Manikya), the clan deity of the Naga kings of Kalahandi may have also necessitated the adoption of the name. Post-Independence period =Anti-merger agitation in Kalahandi= \\"Orissa Government Get Out, We want Separate State\\", the slogan of the people, rented in the air of Kalahandi after Maharaja P.K Deo signed the merger document at Cuttack. The merger was not Democratic in spirit and content. It has been termed as ‚ÄòConquest‚Äô by Orissa Province. People's opinion was never sought on the merger issue. Maharaja P.K Deo was intimidated at Cuttack either to sign the merger document or face military action. The plea of P.K Deo that Kalahandi Assembly has already unanimously passed resolution of the merger with the Eastern States Union rather than with Orissa was bluntly ignored at Cuttack Darbar in December 1947 which was attended by Sardar Patel and V.P Menon at the behest of H.K Mahatab, the then Orissa Premier. The anti ‚Äìmerger agitators organised demonstration at several place of Kalahandi, displayed pamphlet, leaflet and soughed anti‚ÄìOrissa slogan. Twenty five agitators were arrested and kept in prison for a year. Peoples then submitted a memorandum to Gandhi seeking his intervention on the issue through Orissa Government. The petition however was never forwarded to Gandhi. There was a psychological fear among the people that in the event of the merger of Kalahandi with Orissa province, the interest of Kalahandi would be jeopardized. Former British ruled Orissa like Cuttack, Balasore, Ganjam, Sambalpur and Koraput where freedom movement took place, would take upper hand on every issue. So, the people were justified to take anti‚Äìmerger stand. =Part of modern Orissa state= After Indian independence, Kalahandi joined with the Union of India on 1 January 1948. On 1 November 1949, Patna Balangir district and Subarnapur district together constituted a separate district and the Nuapada sub-division of Sambalpur was added to the Kalahandi district. In 1967, Kashipur block of Kalahandi district was transferred to Rayagada division for administrative purpose. In 1993, Nuapada sub-division was carved out as a separate district, but Kalahandi (Lok Sabha constituency) continues to constitute present Kalahandi district and Nuapada district together. Kalahandi was famous for gemstone (Karonda Mandal), rich agriculture- and forest-based economy. During Bengal famine Kalahandi alone had sent 100,000 tons of rice. During the 1930s princely state of Kalahandi had proposed to build Upper Indravati Project but subsequent merger of princely state with India delayed the project. It got approved in 1978 and yet to be fully completed. In the meantime, drought occurred in the 1960s and lately in the 1980s. In the 1980s Kalahandi become infamous for drought, child selling, malnutrition and starvation death and social worker referred it as Kalahandi Syndrome.Food Though KBKhttp://kbk.nic.in/ project was announced in the 1990s by central Government specially for undivided Kalahandi, Balangir and Koraput districts primarily keeping poverty, backwardness and starvation death in mind, undivided Kalahandi district continued to remain politically ignored for various reasons. Indira Gandhi visited Kalahandi in the early 1980s; Rajiv Gandhi visited in 1984; Sonia Gandhi visited in 2004, and Rahul Gandhi visited in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Since 1980, the Indian National Congress has been ruling for 20 years at the centre; but the visits of the said VVIPs have contributed nothing to the development of Kalahandi. Despite late prime ministers Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P.V.Narasimha Rao, and present leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi etc. tall claims for developing Kalahandi, little was done for long-term sustainable development in higher education, national highway, railway and industry during those leadership at Delhi. Few initiatives taken in post-independence of India for developing Kalahandi were only during non-congress rule in India such as Upper Indiravati Irrigation Project (during Moraji Desai as Prime Minister of India), Lanjigarh road - Jungarh (during Chandrasekhar as Prime Minister of India), National Highway 201 & 217 passing through Kalahandi (during Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister of India), all these projects are not yet fully accomplished. Since the 2000s the Indravati Water Project, second biggest in the state has changed the landscape of southern Kalahandi, leading to two crops in a year. Because of this, blocks like Kalampur, Jaipatna, Dharamgarh, Jungarh, Bhawanipatna etc. are witnessing rapid agricultural growth. This has boasted the Highest Number of Rice Mills in Kalahandi among districts in Orissa. The number of rice mills in the district was around 150 in the year 2004‚Äì05. More than 70% have been built in the five years after commissioning of the Indravati project. However, Indiravati Irrigation Project is not yet completely implemented. Since 2005 Kalahandi came more often news for controversial Alumina Refinery Project by Vedanta Alumina Limited (VAL),http://www.vedantaaluminium.com/ a subsidiary of Sterlite Industries and for proposal to mine of Niyamgiri bauxites that was opposed by various international NGOs for tribal right and violation of forest act.

Constable III is an American lawyer who was the 16th Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, serving from 2012 to 2015. A former Assistant US Attorney, he was also the Deputy Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Early life and education Constable was raised in East Orange, New Jersey, and graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School. He attended the University of Michigan, where he was awarded a Harry S. Truman Scholarship, and graduated magna cum laude in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. In 1997, he received his law degree and Master of Public Administration from the University of Pennsylvania. Career After graduating from law school, Constable clerked for Minnesota Supreme Court Justice and NFL Hall of Fame inductee Alan Page. Constable then worked as a litigation associate with Sullivan & Cromwell LLP in New York City from 1998 to 2002. Subsequently, he was hired by Chris Christie as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark. For eight years, Constable represented the United States in criminal matters including public corruption, government, tax, and mortgage fraud. He investigated and prosecuted high-profile elected and appointed officials including US senators, state assemblymen, and mayors charged with bribery and extortion. In 2010, he left the U.S. Attorney's office to join the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development as Deputy Commissioner, where he managed the daily operations. Along with Commissioner Harold J. Wirths, Constable implemented several administrative and programmatic reforms to streamline the efficiency of the department. Constable was also an adjunct professor at Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìNewark and Fordham Law School in New York. In 2011 he was appointed Commissioner of the NJ Department of Community Affairs by Governor Christie. As commissioner, Constable chaired the Council on Affordable Housing, the Interagency Council on Homelessness, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority, and the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission. Constable resigned as commissioner in 2015 and joined the private sector. Commissioner of NJ Department of Community Affairs On November 21, 2011, Governor Chris Christie announced that he chose Constable to join his cabinet as Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and replace incumbent Commissioner Lori Grifa. Christie stated that Constable was \\"someone who has worked with me for years and whom I have turned to many times for his leadership skills, integrity and friendship.\\" Constable was unanimously confirmed, by the NJ State Senate, as DCA Commissioner in 2012. Constable, a lifelong Democrat, said of working in the Christie Administration, \\"I'm not working for a Republican governor, I'm working for Chris Christie, a man I've known for years, a friend.\\" When Constable stepped down in March 2015, he was succeeded by Charles Richman. =Council on Affordable Housing= As DCA Commissioner, Constable was the chair of the NJ Council on Affordable Housing (COAH). COAH met April 30, 2014, and voted 5‚Äì1 to adopt proposed new guidelines that govern municipal and contractor obligations to provide affordable housing in the state as mandated by the New Jersey Supreme Court in a January 2014 ruling. The proposed rules called for roughly 110,000 affordable housing units to be added across the state between 2014 and 2024. =Hurricane Sandy= On Monday, October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused unprecedented damage to New Jersey's housing, business, infrastructure, health, social service and environmental sectors. Immediately following the storm, Governor Christie selected Commissioner Constable and DCA as the lead agency in providing Sandy-displaced families with temporary and permanent housing options. The DCA was entrusted to administer billions in federal Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to support efforts to rebuild homes, businesses, and infrastructure. In 2013, the DCA engaged Hammerman & Gainer Inc. (HGI) to administer the federally funded, $1.2 billion Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Elevation and Mitigation (RREM) program, which gives grants of up to $150,000 to homeowners to repair and rebuild homes damaged by Sandy. HGI's $68 million bid was $127 million lower than Tetra Tech, the only other bidder. \\"It would have been fiscally irresponsible for the state to take the higher bidder,\\" said Constable. The $68 million contract was originally meant to run from 2013 to 2016, but in December 2013 was revised to end in January 2014. Initially, the RREM program had problems, leading to complaints from some applicants and Democratic lawmakers. Constable cited HGI's \\"performance problems\\" and noted several months of \\"corrective action\\" by DCA. HGI's bills totaled $51 million. It was paid $36 million, and $15 million was subject to an arbitration dispute. The DCA subsequently retained ICF International to perform work previously assigned to HGI. At a New Jersey Assembly Budget Committee hearings, in April 2014, Constable said \\"the good news is that we're at a place now where the concerns that were widely publicized don't exist anymore.\\"  References  Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:New Jersey lawyers Category:University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania Law School alumni Category:People from East Orange, New Jersey Category:People from Orange, New Jersey Category:Sullivan & Cromwell associates Category:Fels Institute of Government alumni Category:Commissioners of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs Category:University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice alumni ","title":"Rich Constable"},{"id":"29529297","text":"The Bonaventura Heinz House is a historic building located in the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States.

History The site was discovered in 1950 by the French Antarctic Expedition under Andr√©-Franck Liotard and a landing made on 18 January 1950. The base was established by Liotard and a team of 11 men who raised the main building with several annexes to house scientific activities. It was named for expeditioner J. A. Martin, originally second-in-command of the expedition, who had died en route to the Antarctic. On 6 January 1951 the base team was relieved by 17-member team under the leadership of Michel Barr√©. Over the following year they enlarged the main building while continuing the research program. They, in turn, were relieved on 4 January 1952 while a smaller team of four, led by Mario Marret, built a secondary base on Petrel Island, some to the west in the G√©ologie Archipelago. On the night of 23‚Äì24 January 1952 the Port Martin base was largely destroyed by a fire which burnt down its main building. No lives were lost nor injuries incurred but the base personnel were evacuated to Petrel Island, where they overwintered, and Port Martin abandoned. =Historic site= Since 1952 the site has remained largely undisturbed. What remains in Port-Martin are the base's ancillary buildings, including a weather shelter and its coal and supply sheds, beneath a covering of snow. It represents an optimal site to design archeological methods and techniques in extreme climatic conditions. It is considered a valuable archaeological as well as a historic site and is protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.166. It has also been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 46), following a proposal by France to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Martzahn organized the Davenport Slaughter & Rendering Company, which was the only such business in the city and became one of the largest in Eastern Iowa. The company's specialty was rendering and dealing in hides. Martzahn married Minnie Schmidt in 1884 and they raised a son. He built this house along West Third Street in 1911. Architecture The Martzahn House continued the popular 19th-century tradition of combining several architectural styles into one house. with This house combines Georgian Revival mass with decorative elements of the American Craftsman and the Prairie School. Those elements include the two-tone stucco fa√ßade, the geometrically-patterned leaded glass, the large rectilinear brackets at the main entrance, and the wide eaves with projecting rafter ends. The short posts that support the deep cornice returns on the dormers are also of interest. The house was designed by Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling.

Biography He was born in Haarlem, and in 1591 went to study Greek and Latin at the University of Leiden. He became the assistant director of the Latin school in Haarlem in 1597, where he also started work on translating Ovid. He was friends with the Mannerist artist group led by Karel van Mander, who himself translated Ovid's Metamorphoses in 1604. Schrevelius married Maria van Teylingen (1570-1652) in Alkmaar in 1599 and had seven children, including sons Augustinus Schrevelius, attorney at the Hof van Holland (High Court of Holland and Zeeland) and Cornelius Schrevelius, who later succeeded him as director of the Leiden school.Schrevelius biography at the website of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences In 1609 he succeeded Cornelis Schonaeus as director of the Haarlem Latin School, but in 1620 he was dismissed for his Remonstrant ideas. He fled to Leiden with other Haarlem Remonstrant supporters and from 1625-1642 he was director of the Latin school in Leiden (where Rembrandt had received his early education from ca. 1615-1620). In 1642 after handing his position over to his son Cornelis, he returned to Haarlem where he devoted himself to writing about Haarlem in his Harlemum (1647) and Harlemias (1648). He died in 1649 and was buried in the St. Bavochurch in the Brewer's chapel. =Works= *Translation of Ovid's Tristia Tristium (1612) *Diatribae scholasticae (1626) *Staten edition of the three books of Homer's Iliad in 1636 *Harlemias, 1648, in Google books History of Haarlem He is best known today for his Harlemias, or history of Haarlem, which was first published 20 years after his colleague Samuel Ampzing published his poetic history of Haarlem in verse form called Beschrijvinge ende lof der stad Haerlem in Holland.

In existence from 1968 through 1988, its rise and fall mirrored that of its charismatic and mercurial leader, Michael \\"Rapunzel\\" Metelica. The Brotherhood of the Spirit underwent several distinct identity changes during its 20-year history.  The Brotherhood of the Spirit: 1968‚Äì1973  Brotherhood of the Spirit: Warwick, Mass. 1970. Michael Metelica was born in 1950 and grew up in the small rural town of Leyden, Massachusetts. At age 16, he dropped out of high school and after reading an article about the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, moved to California to join them. Repelled by their violent nature, he was instead drawn to the 1967 Summer of Love but returned to Leyden the following year. In May 1968, he asked a local blueberry farmer named Donnie Herron if he could build a treehouse on his land, and after receiving permission, lived there in solitary meditation, working for farmers for free and expecting nothing in return. In search of answers for his spiritual experiences, Metelica consulted Beth St. Clair, a psychologist, and her cousin Charles Hapgood, a professor at Keene State College and author of \\"Earth's Shifting Crust\\" the foreword of which was written by Albert Einstein. They in turn introduced him to a farmer named Elwood Babbitt, a trance-medium in the Edgar Cayce tradition. These people believed that the Earth was about to undergo cataclysmic changes in preparation of the Aquarian Age. Babbitt, in particular, said he was getting information through his spirit guides who warned that humanity's selfish and self-destructive behavior would cause nature to literally rebel in such a way as to cause widespread death and destruction. These ‚ÄúEarth Changes‚Äù as they were called would be a precursor to the spiritual enlightenment of the Aquarian Age, supposedly the next step in the evolution of the human race. Metelica became something of a local sensation and attracted his first following from among his boyhood friends. After the treehouse was destroyed in late 1968 by suspicious locals, Metelica and his little band wandered around the many hill towns in the area, gaining more members, teaching their view of spirituality at area churches and schools until by early 1970, they numbered around 50. Rules were mandated banning drugs, cigarettes, alcohol and sexual promiscuity and members practiced to purge themselves of their imperfections through meditation and intense encounter-group confrontation tactics. By then, Metelica knew that he had the makings of a deliberate community that was based on spiritual beliefs and practice. According to Babbitt, groups like the Brotherhood would be the harbingers of a New Age, functioning as teachers of this higher wisdom to the shattered survivors of these worldwide cataclysms. In March 1970, The Brotherhood purchased a 25-acre property in Warwick, Massachusetts and the group underwent the first of its many radical transformations. Their growth coincided with a counter-cultural migration as millions of young Americans, disenchanted with the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù during the Vietnam War era, dropped out of universities and cities en masse and hit the road that summer looking for new venues. The membership skyrocketed to 150 leading to the acquisition of an additional house in nearby Northfield, the building of a dormitory in Warwick and more stringent membership rules. Metelica became less involved with the commune, devoting most of his energy to the commune's band ‚ÄúSpirit in Flesh‚Äù whose mission was to bring about the message of spirituality through the medium of rock and roll. In late 1970, Spirit in Flesh signed a contract with Metromedia records and the commune's focus began to shift into a full-time promotion of the band. Veterans of the Brotherhood of the Spirit consider the Warwick era as being the closest to their ideal of a spiritual community composed of independently inspired individuals. Their youthful enthusiasm allowed them to overcome the many hardships created by an insulated environment dedicated to personal growth and spiritual reflection. For the many that came from urban backgrounds, Warwick introduced the realities of self-sufficiency through logging, house building, the cultivating and canning of homegrown food, and the ability to enjoy life without the distractions of mainstream media. Their spiritual belief system was based on aspects of Buddhism and New Age thinking mixed with an enlightened, almost Gnostic form of Christianity. Reincarnation, meditation, and the power of positive thought were considered to be major doctrines. The years 1971-1972 were spent in frenzied activities surrounding Spirit in Flesh, including the printing of several thousand silk-screened posters that were placed all across the United States and even into parts of Europe. Because of the sluggish support from the record label, the commune devised its own guerilla tactics to promote the band which included marches in New York City, mass telephone call-ins to Metromedia, and infiltrating popular national TV talk shows to announce the band's impending success. These tactics culminated in a concert at Carnegie Hall that was sparsely attended. The first album, which featured the entire membership of the Brotherhood commune on its cover, sold less than 1000 copies. The Brotherhood had developed into an efficient entity aside from promotional activities for the band. An elaborate infrastructure including business management, child care, auto maintenance, farming and food production was created. New members signed over all their money and possessions, making a \\"lifetime commitment\\" to the commune. Controversy arose due to Brotherhood members being briefly on welfare while Metelica was gifted with a Rolls-Royce. There were also numerous run-ins with local selectmen about building code violations concerning the commune's houses and septic systems. By late 1972, with membership at nearly 300, the commune's first public businesses were launched. A magazine, Free Spirit Press, was sold along the East Coast from a rainbow-painted school bus. Also in late 1972, the commune bought the Shea Theater block in Turners Falls, a decaying working-class town next to Greenfield. Metelica issued an order that all members must find jobs outside the commune. By now, the Brotherhood of the Spirit had been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal, Look, Family Circle, and Mademoiselle magazines. They had also been featured on 60 Minutes and the David Frost show. The Metelica Aquarian Concept and Renaissance Community: 1973‚Äì1976 Sunday Meeting:Renaissance Community, 1976. In 1973, the commune went through its most drastic and traumatic change, morphing into what became known as the Metelica Aquarian Concept. Metelica shifted his focus from his band (renamed Metelica) to take absolute control over the running of the commune. He demanded that every cent earned by commune members be turned over to him whereby he then spent the money to radically reshape the appearance of the group. A shopping spree ensued that purchased 35 new cars (the tiny Honda 600 which got 50 mpg), three GMC motor homes and an airplane, plus several movie, video and still cameras. Metelica's aim was to replace the image of ragged commune hippies with that of media-savvy entrepreneurs who would change the mainstream society by mimicking its need for image and materiality. This shift in focus caused some long-term members to leave as well as causing a more negative reaction from the local community. Metelica's demand for complete power caused a cult-like mentality to permeate the group which was divided into a distinct hierarchy with him as the unquestioned and undisputed leader. The nadir of this period was the murder of a commune member while hitch-hiking from work, a crime which was never solved and the subsequent ‚ÄúMetelica Marches‚Äù whereby members vigiled on the streets of Turners Falls and Greenfield with signs proclaiming Metelica as a new religion. The Shea Theater complex in Turners Falls became the nerve center of the group while the Warwick property slowly fell into decline. It was during this time that Metelica's drug and alcohol addictions began which would have dire consequences for the group in the near future. In 1974, the commune became the legally recognized and tax-exempt Renaissance Church and Renaissance Community; Metelica changed his name to Rapunzel (although few of his former adherents currently refer to him as such.) All community properties (which now included several residences in Turners Falls) were lavishly renovated while members worked a variety of jobs in the outside world. One of these work experiences occurred at the Belchertown State School which housed close to a thousand developmentally-disabled people of various ages and infirmities. Conditions at the school were described by one observer as \\"barbaric\\" and \\"medieval.\\" Due to a lawsuit in 1973, the school was mandated to hire one hundred additional employees. Commune member, Larry Raffel arranged for fifty of his communal peers to be hired and to work in each building on the grounds. Their care and consideration helped transform Belchertown State School into a more humane institution. During the three years of their tenure at the school, commune members helped release over a hundred residents from locked wards and into the mainstream community. The first of many business and creative ventures were launched during this time while Metelica worked full-time in the Shea Theater's recording studio with various bands. Meetings in which Rapunzel discussed his philosophy and worldview at length were held in the theater complex. The Renaissance Church, meanwhile, opened its Sunday services to the general public featuring music and meditations with an accommodating spiritual philosophy. It also sponsored a free Christmas dinner in the Shea Theater for the next few years, which was fully attended and reportedly popular with the outside population. By 1975, Renaissance operated a dozen businesses downtown. These reportedly included a 24-hour grocery, Cucumber Grocery, Dan Pritchet Audio, a record store, and a stylized pizza parlor, Zapmia Pizza. The Noble Feast restaurant featured diversely innovative cuisine. Rocket's Silver Train provided luxury-modeled tour buses for rock musicians including the Rolling Stones and Linda Ronstadt. Silver Screen Design and Renaissance Greeting Cards were founded at this time. These businesses used start-up funds from working Renaissance members and two went to become successful national enterprises. These were coupled with contracting crews specializing in high-level industrial and residential painting, paving and excavating, carpentry and plumbing. The recording studio, video lab, darkroom and media equipment were made freely available to members to engage in creative enterprises. The Choir, an all-women chorus, was created at this time and performed both at church services and at outside concerts. A \\"Renaissance Radio Show\\" was syndicated nationally. Outreach to the local community was made through a series of free public events culminating in a Renaissance Faire street festival (not associated with the better-known Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California) that attracted about 3,000. The community was popular with young people from Turners Falls, who sought employment in Renaissance businesses or simply hung out in the \\"drop-in center\\". Members claim that Renaissance revitalized Turners Falls without government grants or taxpayer money. While Metelica was still a central figure, devotion to him was giving way to a growing sense of personal autonomy as members practiced a variety of new skills and acquired leadership abilities of their own.  The 2001 Center in Gill: 1975‚Äì1988  2001 Center garden with new houses, 1982. At the end of 1975, the Renaissance Community purchased the rural Olde Stone Lodge in Gill and began constructing another self-sufficient community utilizing alternative energy and sustainable technologies. Again, the group radically changed its identity as the focus shifted away from the Turners Falls businesses (most of which closed) to the building of innovatively designed houses on the 80-acre Gill property, nicknamed the \\"2001 Center.\\" During this time, the community began networking with other spiritual communities; especially Findhorn in Scotland, whose leaders and members exchanged visits with those of Renaissance. There was also a huge increase of children. These were later said by members to be the most relaxed and harmonious years since the beginning. At the 1976 May Day rock concert, 14,000 people descended on Gill, but otherwise the community got on well with the town. Although the financial policies regarding commune members was gradually liberalized, the dispute concerning Metelica's leadership role divided the community into two hostile groups culminating in the decision by the card company to separate from the community and re-establish itself in southern Maine. A large segment of core members departed. By the mid-1980s the population of the community was drastically reduced to about 70 adult members with an equal number of children. For the next few years, this remnant continued to build their houses and maintain the land in Gill despite the departure of other long-term members and the influx of new ones, some of whom were violent or otherwise dysfunctional. Rapunzel's increasingly erratic behavior caused another rebellion against his authority in 1984, this time centered around the silkscreen company. This led to a final migration of vital members from which Renaissance never recovered. Meanwhile, reunions and newsletters of former members signaled a shift in focus toward those who had left and were trying to process the communal experience for themselves. From 1984 until 1988, the community, now down to its final dozen members, struggled to maintain some semblance of cohesion as group meetings and projects ended and the land itself began to deteriorate. In 1988, the remaining community leadership offered Metelica $10,000 to leave and never return. He accepted and moved to upstate New York for the remainder of his life.  The Aftermath: 1988‚Äì2003  Reunion, 2002. In 1988, the Renaissance Community as a recognizable communal entity came to an end. The Gill property was cleaned up and cooperatively managed. The various houses were sold off to private ownership and the Olde Stone Lodge house was renovated into separate apartments. Several successful contracting businesses based in Gill still exist, along with regular seminars dealing with meditation and spiritual practice. Former and current members attend reunions and discuss the community's controversial legacy. Former members have gone on to become teachers, artists, health-care providers, millionaire executives, and at least one ordained Buddhist monk. In May 2006, former member Bruce Geisler produced a documentary film about the community entitled Free Spirits: The Birth, Life and Loss of a New Age Dream. For DVD, Michael Metelica lived out the remainder of his life in the Hudson River valley in upstate New York. There he was licensed as an EMT, attended AA to treat his addictions, and entered therapy for bipolar disorder. He was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer in May 2002. The following month a gathering in his honor occurred at the home of his long-time friend and mentor, Beth St. Clair, and was attended by his children, and about 100 of his former followers. He died in February 2003 in Cairo, NY.

The film was directed by Dick Maas and marked his return to the horror genre, in which he gained acclaim with his debut De Lift (1983) and Amsterdamned (1988). The story distorts the popular traditions of Sinterklaas and portrays him as a ghost who murders large numbers of people when his annual celebration night coincides with a full moon. Plot On 5 December 1492, a gang led by former bishop Niklas is killed by villagers who refuse to put up with the gang's looting and killing any longer. In years in which the gang's death date coincides with a full moon, they return as murderous ghosts. The public is unaware of this and annually celebrates the Sinterklaas tradition on 5 December, with adults not believing that Sinterklaas exists but making little children believe that he is benevolent. The Zwarte Pieten are not blackened by soot from chimneys but as a result of the fire in which they were killed. Niklas' crosier (bishops‚Äô staff) has sharp edges and is a weapon. On 5 December Sinterklaas and the Zwarte Pieten do not stand out, as many people are dressed like them for the celebration. The last time the ghostly gang returned was in 1968. Hundreds of people were killed, including the whole family of a little boy, Goert, who is now a police detective. The authorities downplay the incidents, and they, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, keep the possible involvement of Niklas a secret. Since there is a full moon on 5 December 2010, Goert is very concerned and recommends forbidding all Sinterklaas activities and increasing surveillance, but he is not taken seriously and sent on leave. As Goert predicts, the gang returns and kills hundreds of people. While the gang is immune to bullets, they are finally chased away by fire.

Chris Cabin of Slant Magazine rated the film one out of four stars, calling it \\"predictably plotted and visually monotonous\\", criticizing the film's \\"unexceptional\\" kills and, lack of tension and/or scares. James Dennis from '\\"Screen Anarchy gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"With strong effects work, it's a breezy, fun ride while it lasts, but it's not something that will linger in the mind long. And that's a bit of a shame given the potential of Saint's creepy premise.\\" Controversy While children are not permitted to see the film, parental concern arose over the film's poster, seen in the streets and in the lobbies of movie theaters. It shows Sinterklaas with a mutilated face and a malevolent look. Some people were concerned that this could be confusing and frightening for little children that still believe in Sinterklaas. A legal complaint was filed in October 2010, requesting the removal of all posters. In the subsequent court case, director Dick Maas argued that if parents could make their children believe that Sinterklaas existed they could also inform their children that the man on the poster was not the real Sinterklaas. The court ruled in favor of Maas, noting that the mutilated face was not visible enough on the poster, and rejected the complaint.

The \\"Ricovrati\\" The name \\"ricovrati\\" literally means \\"sheltered\\" and the academy took its name from a line from Boethius, \\"Bipatens animis asylum\\" (Latin: \\"a sanctuary of the soul open at both ends\\"), related to a scene by Homer (Odyssey, book 13) describing a cave, open at both ends, and sheltered by an olive tree. This image was used in their heraldic badge. Female members At the end of the 17th century, the Academy of the Ricovrati was one of the few in Europe which had female members. These included the first woman in Europe to receive a university diploma, Elena Cornaro Piscopia. Other female members included Anne Dacier, Madeleine de Scud√©ry, Maria Selvaggia Borghini, and Marie-Catherine de Villedieu. Female membership in this period was only honorary and female members did not have the right to vote or occupy administrative posts in the academy. Of the 25 women admitted to the society between the 17th and 18th century, only four were Italian; the others were French and did not attend meetings. The Enlightenment Antonio Vallisneri became president of the academy in 1722, and proceeded to enact a series of reforms based on the principles of the Enlightenment. He also instigated a series of debates on the education of women and their inclusion in such academies.

In game design the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework is a tool used to analyze games. It formalizes the consumption of games by breaking them down into three components: Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics. These three words have been used informally for many years to describe various aspects of games, but the MDA framework provides precise definitions for these terms and seeks to explain how they relate to each other and influence the player's experience. * Mechanics are the base components of the game - its rules, every basic action the player can take in the game, the algorithms and data structures in the game engine etc. * Dynamics are the run- time behavior of the mechanics acting on player input and \\"cooperating\\" with other mechanics. * Aesthetics are the emotional responses evoked in the player. There are many types of aesthetics, including but not limited to the following eight stated by Hunicke, LeBlanc and Zubek: # Sensation (Game as sense-pleasure): Player enjoys memorable audio-visual effects. # Fantasy (Game as make-believe): Imaginary world. # Narrative (Game as drama): A story that drives the player to keep coming back # Challenge (Game as obstacle course): Urge to master something. Boosts a game's replayability. # Fellowship (Game as social framework): A community where the player is an active part of it. Almost exclusive for multiplayer games. # Discovery (Game as uncharted territory): Urge to explore game world. # Expression (Game as self-discovery): Own creativity. For example, creating character resembling player's own avatar. # Submission (Game as pastime): Connection to the game, as a whole, despite of constraints. The paper seeks to better specify terms such as 'gameplay' and 'fun', and extend the vocabulary of game studies, suggesting a non-exhaustive taxonomy of eight different types of play. The framework uses these definitions to demonstrate the incentivising and disincentiving properties of different dynamics on the eight subcategories of game use. From the perspective of the designer, the mechanics generate dynamics which generate aesthetics. This relationship poses a challenge for the game designer as they are only able to influence the mechanics and only through them can be produced meaningful dynamics and aesthetics for the player. The perspective of the player is the other way around. They experience the game through the aesthetics, which the game dynamics provide, which emerged from the mechanics.

Its lyrics are the words of two young lovers who pledge their fidelity while one of them is away serving in the war. Background Originally titled \\"Anywhere the Bluebird Goes\\", the melody was written by Sam H. Stept as an updated version of the nineteenth-century English folk song \\"Long, Long Ago\\". Lew Brown and Charles Tobias wrote the lyrics and the song debuted in the 1939 Broadway musical Yokel Boy. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Brown and Tobias modified the lyrics to their current form, with the chorus ending with \\"...till I come marching home\\". \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\" remained in Your Hit Parade's first place from October 1942 through January 1943. It was the longest period for a war song to hold first place. On February 18, 1942 the Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the song with vocals by Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, and The Modernaires. This record spent thirteen weeks on the Billboard charts and was ranked as the nation's twelfth best-selling recording of the year. In May the song was featured in the film Private Buckaroo as a performance by the Andrews Sisters with the Harry James orchestra and featuring a tap dancing routine by The Jivin' Jacks and Jills. This scene is often considered one of the most memorable of the film. The Andrews Sisters then released the song on Decca Records. (In a 1971 interview, Patty Andrews reported that this was their most requested song.) Many other artists released records of the song that year, including Kay Kyser. With the Miller, Andrews, and Kyser records all being popular on the radio, \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\" became one of the few songs in history to have three different versions on the radio hit parade at the same time. The Andrews version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016. Other versions *Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album On the Happy Side (1962). *In 2012, Broadway icon Carol Channing released a duet of the song with Country singer T. Graham Brown on her album True To The Red, White, and Blue. Parodies *In 1943, Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh wrote \\"They Just Chopped Down the Old Apple Tree\\" for the film Around the World as a humorous parody of this song, which was recorded by The Dinning Sisters. *Frank Loesser's and Arthur Schwartz's \\"They're Either Too Young or Too Old\\" from Thank Your Lucky Stars, also references the song when a woman tells her lover that she \\"can't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me\\" because all of the other men her age are also fighting in the war. Popular culture More recently, \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\" was featured in the films: *Twelve O'Clock High (1949), *With a Song in My Heart (1952), *Kiss Them for Me (1957), *A Carol for Another Christmas (1964), *In Dreams (1999) *The Master (2012). It also featured in the mini-series The Pacific *An instrumental muzak version was featured in the film Devil (2010). *The title of the song was the inspiration for columnist Lewis Grizzard's 1981 book, Don't Sit Under The Grits Tree With Anyone Else But Me. *The title of the song was the inspiration behind Steven J. Andrews' debut novel, 'Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree'.

Turkish intelligence officers first recruited Sharifov between 1989 and 1990. At some point shortly after 1990, the CIA recruited him. Sharifov studied at the Kiev Shevchenko State University. While a student, the KGB recruited him with leverage. The KGB caught Sharifov illegally buying and selling foreign currency on the black market. In lieu of prosecution, the KGB got Sharifov to work for them. After Sharifov graduated, he worked for Azerbaijan‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Trade in South Yemen. He worked in a unit responsible for transporting Soviet military weapons and equipment to South Yemen. While working at that position, he secretly served as a human asset of the KGB‚Äôs First Chief Directorate. In 1990, two shipments of weapons going from the Soviet Union to South Yemen disappeared. The KGB investigated. Their investigation concluded that ‚Äú a ‚Äúhostile foreign intelligence agency‚Äù had learned about the transports from a ‚Äúmole‚Äù recruited among the Soviet employees in South Yemen who had knowledge about the transports.‚Äù The KGB found evidence that Sharifov had made been making contact with Turkish intelligence officers while working for the KGB at the South Yemen station. The Soviet government removed Sharifov from his position and flew him to Moscow for interrogation.

In the 1836 Treaty of Washington, with the Ottawa, etc. (), Drew was granted a tract of one section and three quarters, to his Indian family, at Cheboygan rapids, at the rate of four dollars. Later in his career, he served as a Michigan House of Representatives for the 1841 session.

In Leech Lake he had a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Drew (b 1806-d June 2, 1888), with an Ojibwe woman whose name is not recorded. Mary Elizabeth married Joseph Lecuryer. He worked for Drew after the trader set up a partnership known as Aiken and Drew. Lecuryer later was appointed as the first lighthouse keeper in Michigan; he was responsible for the Potawatowam Light House on Rock Island. While living in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, John Drew had a relationship with Marie Saugeuaqua, an Ojibwe neighbor. They had a daughter, Polly Drew (b. December 13, 1817-d. Feb 11. 1897).

In 1329, Geoffrey, abbot of Arbroath, made an agreement with one of its senior tenants, Fergus mac Donnchaidh (Fergus son of Duncan).Barrow, Scotland and its Neighbours, p. 220 Abbot Geoffrey leased the land of Tulloes and Craichie (near Dunnichen) to Fergus, allowing him to introduce his own men. The agreement specified the abbot's legal rights, but allowed that \\"the aforesaid Fergus and his heir ... have the court which is called couthal for the men residing within the said land, to deal with the countless acts arising amongst themselves only, and they shall have the fines arising therefrom\\".

As one of the Byzantine Empire's three dedicated naval themes (Greek: ), it served chiefly to provide ships and troops for the Byzantine navy, but also served as a civil administrative circumscription. Origins The theme has its origins in the late antique civil province of the \\"Islands\\" (; ), which encompassed the islands of the southeastern and eastern Aegean up to Tenedos. The term \\"Aigaion Pelagos\\" appears for the first time as an administrative circumscription in the early 8th century, when seals of several of its kommerkiarioi (customs officials) are attested. One seal, dated to 721/722, even refers to an official in charge of all the Greek islands, possibly implying an extension of the old province over the islands of the northern and western Aegean as well. Militarily, the Aegean islands came under control of the Karabisianoi corps and later of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme during the 7th and 8th centuries. In 726, the Byzantine emperor Leo III forbade praying for icons and began to remove them from the churches. Against him did Agallianos Kontoskeles - military leader of Hellas (theme) rebel. The rebels were joined by the head of the fleet of the Cyclades islands, Stephen. They proclaimed Cosmas their own emperor, and began a campaign against Constantinople, where they were defeated with the help of Greek fire by the superior forces of Leo III. From the late 8th century, however, two separate commands appear in the Aegean: the droungarios of the Aegean Sea (Aigaion Pelagos), apparently controlling the northern half, and the droungarios \\"of the Twelve Islands\\" (Dodekanesos) or \\"of the Gulf\\" (Kolpos), in charge of the southern half. The latter command eventually evolved into the theme of Samos, while the former evolved into the theme of the Aegean Sea, encompassing both the islands of the northern Aegean as well as the Dardanelles and the southern coasts of the Propontis. History The theme of the Aegean Sea must have been created in 843: its governing strategos does not appear in the Taktikon Uspensky of 842/843, which still lists the droungarios, but he is elsewhere attested as being active at Lesbos in 843. The theme of the Aegean Sea was a regularly organized theme, subdivided into tourmai and banda and with a full complement of military, civil, and fiscal officials. In the areas of the Dardanelles and the Propontis, however, the droungarios and later the strategos of the Aegean probably shared authority with the Count of the Opsician Theme, to whose jurisdiction these territories properly belonged. The Count of the Opsicians probably retained authority over civil administration and local defence, while the Aegean theme was solely responsible for equipping ships and raising the men for fleets from these areas. A similar procedure existed in the theme of Samos as well. This view is strengthened by the fact that the Opsicians, and especially the Slavs (Sklabesianoi) forcefully settled by the Empire in the Opsician Theme, are attested serving as marines in the 10th century. According to Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913‚Äì959), in the early 10th century the theme included Lesbos (the seat of the strategos), Lemnos, Imbros and Tenedos, Chios (later transferred to Samos), the Sporades and the Cyclades. According to H√©l√®ne Ahrweiler, the Cyclades were probably transferred to the Aegean theme when the Dodekanesos/Kolpos naval command was broken up and the theme of Samos established from it in the late 9th century. In 911, the forces of the naval theme of the Aegean are recorded as being 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines. The province survived until the late 10th/early 11th century, when it became progressively split up into smaller commands. As the Cyclades and Sporades, Chios and the region of Abydos acquired their own strategoi, the theme of the Aegean became a purely civil province comprising only the coasts of the Propontis and the region around Constantinople. By the late 11th century, what remained of the old thematic fleet was incorporated into the unified imperial navy at Constantinople, under the command of the megas doux. Thereafter, some time in the 12th century, the theme of the Aegean seems to have been fused with the Opsician theme into a single province, as attested in the Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae in 1204. The theme ceased to exist after the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204.

Early life  Stuart was the son of Dugald Stuart, of Ballachulish in Argyll. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in November 1819.  Career  He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Newark-on-Trent at an unopposed by-election in January 1846. The borough was at that time under the patronage of the under the patronage of the Dukes of Newcastle-under-Lyne, and the 4th Duke was a staunch Conservative and protectionist. In an address \\"to the free and independent-minded electors of the borough of Newark\\", he pledged himself as a \\"firm supporter\\" of the Church of England and of the Corn Laws, claiming that their abolition would \\"injure the best interests of our empire\\". The hustings took place in the town square of Newark in heavy rain on the morning of 29 January 1846, where Stuart spoke in favour of protection for agriculture and for industry. Since no other candidate was proposed, Stuart was nominated and promptly declared elected. He was re-elected at the 1847 general election. At the 1852 general election he did not stand again in Newark. The 5th Duke (who had succeeded in 1851) was a supporter of free trade, and declined to support Stuart. Stuart was elected instead for the borough of Bury St Edmunds.Craig, page 73 He resigned that seat later the same year to take up the post of Vice Chancellor (i.e. a judge of the Court of Chancery). He succeeded James Parker, who had died, after some speculation. Earlier that year Stuart had refused the post of Solicitor General in Lord Derby's new government, and was reported to be indignant that he was not appointed Lord Chancellor. Whilst he was reported by The Times to be eminently qualified for the role, it was suggested that his Ultra-Toryism and opposition to reform of Chancery would make his appointment unpopular. He was knighted in 1853, and sat as a judge until 1871, when he retired on a pension and was sworn as member of the Privy Council.  Family  In 1813, Stuart married Jessie, the daughter of Duncan Stewart. He was a landlord in Scotland, with estates at Loch Carron in Ross-shire and Grishernish on the Isle of Skye. He was reported by The Times newspaper to be a \\"deservedly popular\\" landlord.

The camp is operated by a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization, \\"Camp Good Days and Special Times Inc.\\", which is one of the largest organizations of its kind in the country. In addition to camping, the organization provides year-round events and activities in several locations. History Camp Good Days was founded by Gary Mervis after his daughter Elizabeth \\"Teddi\\" Mervis was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor at the age of nine, in 1979. Mervis believed that the loneliness of being the only child in her school and neighborhood dealing with cancer was as painful to his daughter as the treatments. To help alleviate this isolation, he organized a camping experience for Elizabeth and 62 other children with cancer. After his daughter's death in 1982, Mervis, with the help of friends and organizations in his hometown of Rochester, NY, continued to provide summer camp sessions for other children with the disease. As the program grew, Camp Good Days and Special Times was formed. At first, week-long camp experiences were held at private camps. In 1986, the Branchport property, formerly cottage resorts \\"Campbell's Beach\\" and Pebble Beach\\", was purchased to provide expansion of the program. Camp Good Days was the fourth organization of its kind in the United States and the first to be started by a lay person. As of 2010, the camp has served more than 43,000 campers from 22 states and 27 foreign countries. The camp has maintained accreditation from the American Camp Association, and has been inducted into the Safety 1st Hall of Fame by Markel Insurance Company. Programs Camp Good Days provides activities and services for children, adults and families who have been affected by cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. These include programs for children, Adult Oncology Programs, Family Programs and Brain Tumor Family Retreats. All services are free of charge for participants. Mervis has never charged to attend camp. \\"I never wanted potential campers to be turned away by cost,\\" Mervis says. \\"I never wanted people to have to choose between a car payment and going to camp.\\" Facilities The camp's fifteen acre site includes lakefront facilities and a large swimming pool, a craft-lodge, a playground, a ropes course, a miniature golf course, an archery range, and additional sports, residential and recreational areas. Location Camp Good Days is located on the western shore of Keuka Lake in New York State's Finger Lakes region, at the southern edge of the hamlet of Branchport, New York. It is about 50 miles south of Rochester, New York. Its headquarters and volunteer training center are located in Mendon, NY and the camp also maintains offices in Buffalo, Syracuse, and Ithaca, NY. Fundraising Camp Good Days holds several annual events including Golf tournaments, dinners and discos in efforts to fund its camping programs. One of its most famous fundraisers is the World's Largest Disco, an annual event held in Buffalo the Saturday after each Thanksgiving. The World's Largest Disco, which has taken place annually since 1994, regularly draws thousands of participants. Cancer Mission 2020 On 2 December 2010, Mervis announced a new initiative to end cancer by the year 2020. This effort was the result of continued discussions, suggestions, and plans originally set forth in the Camp Good Days' Cancer Summit, held in 2009. The first step, according to Mervis, is to collect 1.5 million email addresses. From there, further summits will be held in an effort to bring together the necessary professionals from the medical, research and legislation fields. Several notable public figures have stated their support of the cause, including the Lieutenant Governor of New York and former Rochester mayor Robert Duffy, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, Congressman Tom Reed, Maggie Brooks, James Alesi, and David Koon.

People of different nationalities used to live there in peace: Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Germans, the Czechs. Kisielin was wealthy and prosperous. There was a publishing house and a library there, an oil pressing factory, and a distillery, a brickyard, as well as a dairy plant. Today, only the ethnic Ukrainian villagers remain. The old ruins of a Polish Catholic church serve as witness to the tragedy that took place there during the massacres of Poles in Volhynia. On 11 July 1943, a group of Ukrainian nationalists slaughtered the Polish worshipers inside the Kisielin temple, and set it on fire. The rest of the Polish inhabitants escaped from Kisielin, never to return.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Genocide and rescue in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ: recollections of the Ukrainian nationalist ethnic cleansing campaign....

The musical setting for the film constitutes the work of the mentioned Krzesimir Dƒôbski (now a classical composer), inspired by his own borderland memories, especially the excerpts of his Oratorio to the End of Kresy, composed in commemoration of the victims of Polish genocide in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ.Grzegorz Motyka, \\"Zapomnijcie o Giedroyciu,\\" Gazeta Wyborcza, 24 May 2008 The world premiere of his work was held on 17 September 2008, at the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra. The film is not only a story about the murdered Poles of Kisielin. It is also a reflection on the eradication of Polish culture and tradition in the entire region, and the painful legacy that lingers. Reception Polish historian and publicist Ewa Siemaszko noted, that many Ukrainians in Volhynia and Lesser Poland today, are afraid to talk about the destroyed Polish settlements and the locations of Polish mass graves in Western Ukraine. The reason for that lies in the politicized mythology surrounding the OUN-UPA death squads in the struggle for Ukrainian independence.Jacek Dytkowski, \\"Nie ma wƒÖtpliwo≈õci, ≈ºe ludob√≥jstwo,\\" (No doubt, it was a genocide) after: Nasz Dziennik, ≈öroda, 16 lipca 2008, Nr 165 (3182), published by Bibula. Pismo niezalezne with photographs from the collection of E. i W. Siemaszko, 15 July 2008. The OUN- UPA formations used to treat people saving Poles as traitors.

The date of July 11 has a symbolic meaning in the history of Polish genocide in Volhynia. On that Sunday, the OUN-UPA death squads aided by local peasants simultaneously attacked over 100 Polish settlements within the Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship. It was a well-orchestrated attack on people gathered for a Sunday mass at Catholic churches. The towns affected included Kisielin, Poryck, Chryn√≥w, Zab≈Çoƒáce, Krymn, with dozens of other towns attacked at different dates with tens of churches and chapels burned to the ground. The Volhynian massacres spread over four prewar voivodeships including Wo≈Çy≈Ñ with 60,000 victims, as well as Lw√≥w, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and Tarnopol in Little Poland with 70,000 Poles murdered for the total of 130,000 Polish victims of UPA terror.

Operations began using the latest CNC machinery available at the time. As of 2015, the company employs 65 people and manufactures for multiple industries including aerospace and compressors.  Aerospace Division  Sertco was among the first aerospace machine shops to use one-hundred 100 percent CNC machines, when manual milling machines were predominantly used.still the norm Customers Sertco worked with included Cessna, McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, the United States Department of Defense and others. The aerospace industry requires very specific weights and strengths in parts and components, and are made from aluminum billet, stainless steel or other high stress alloys.  High Performance Division  In May 1984, Sertco developed an improved motorcycle engine cylinder for race applications that increased the reliability and maximum displacement available to racers. Following the 'big block,' Sertco developed a shock absorbing rear sprocket that drastically reduced transmission breakage. The 'torsion sprocket received the \\"Murdoch Award\\" in 1993 as the year's most significant new product in the sport of motorcycle racing.  Energy Division  The methods developed to support the aerospace and high performance industries led to the formation of the energy division in late 1997 which became Sertco's main focus. The application of the technology from the aerospace and high performance divisions were deployed in the development of a reciprocating natural gas compressor. This represents a significant cost savings to small and medium size natural gas producers. One compressor design is based on the rotating assembly from the Chevrolet 350 (5.7L) automobile motor packaged in a split case horizontally opposed cylinder arrangement. To date, over 1,000 units have been produced logging millions of hours of continuous service. Sertco utilizes several distributors and currently has units operating worldwide. Besides hundreds of units operating in the United States, many more are operating in Mexico, South America, Europe, Russia and Indonesia. Other emerging markets such as Australia are also being studied and investigated for their potential opportunities.  Facility Expansions  In November 2005 and July 2010, Sertco expanded its operations adding a total of 60,000 square feet of additional fabrication and assembly area that include 4 separate manufacturing facilities. The additional space and staff have allowed the company to quadruple production rates from pre-expansion levels. Independent areas include a 9 machine CNC shop, weld and engine building, a 6 line (32 station) production building, as well as, a blast and paint booth and test loop area.

As the name indicates, the term embraces both the Keuper landscapes (including the well-known parts of the Keuper Upland Ha√überge, Steigerwald and Franconian Heights) and lias landscapes (Black Jurassic) in Franconia. In addition, the fore-land of the Franconian Jura (Vorland der Fr√§nkischen Alb), in which part of the Brown Jurassic occurs, as well as parts of the former volcanic region of Heldburger Gangschar belong to this region. The highest elevation in the area is the unique Hesselberg (689 m) immediately north of the crater of the N√∂rdlinger Ries which separates the Swabian from the Franconian Jura.  Location and boundaries  The Franconian Keuper-Lias Plains are bounded to the north and west by the muschelkalk G√§u landscapes of the Main-Franconian Plateaux, to the southwest, of which, are the G√§u Plateaus. In the southwest, are the geologically and topographically similar Swabian Keuper-Lias Plains. To the east, the landscape transitions into the Malm Plateau of the Franconian Jura, to the northeast are the Upper Palatine-Upper Main Hills (especially the Upper Main Hills) as a buffer zone between the Franconian Jura and the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest. The conurbation of Nuremberg, with its outlying towns of F√ºrth and Erlangen, lie roughly in the centre of the Franconian Keuper-Lias Plains.

Located near the village of Laurelville in Hocking County, the mound is a circular structure that measures in diameter at its base and high at the center. It is constructed primarily of earth, with large stones placed on various parts of the surface. Few changes have been made to the mound since white settlement of the region; a small depression in the northwestern corner may be the result of someone digging, but no significant damage was done.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 777-778. The Ross Mound is important primarily for its archaeological value. The land surrounding the mound has yielded large numbers of archaeological artifacts, and a concentration of stones on the western edge of the mound's surface suggests that a grave or wall was once located there. The essentially pristine condition of the mound guarantees that any burials and grave goods placed in the mound at the time of its construction is still buried within. Because no systematic excavation has been undertaken of the mound, its contents and its builders are uncertain. Archaeologists are certain that it is a burial mound, but the date and culture are unknown: possible candidates for the builders are the Adena, Hopewell, or Fort Ancient cultures, and it could have been built as early as 1000 BC or as late as AD 1000. In recognition of the Edith Ross Mound's archaeological value, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973; it is one of four Hocking County archaeological sites on the Register.

Located near the village of Laurelville in Hocking County, it is one of Ohio's largest remaining burial mounds that has not been significantly damaged since white settlement. Measuring in diameter and high, it lies in the middle of a farm field, but it has never been cultivated, and vegetation on the mound has prevented erosion. Although no archaeological investigation has ever been carried out at the Karshner Mound, it is believed to have been constructed by people of the Adena culture, who inhabited the region between 1000 BC and AD 400. This identification is based on its shape and location; the Karshner Mound lies on the second terrace above Salt Creek, and large numbers of mounds on terraces above small streams have been found to be constructed by the Adena. Because of this identification, the mound is seen as a valuable archaeological site and believed to be likely to yield many informative artifacts if excavated.

Glover's charred body was later found in a destroyed Chevrolet Malibu parked on a Mississippi River levee. Warren was tried on federal charges relating to Glover's death, eventually resulting in an acquittal. Four other NOPD officers were charged in connection with events following Glover's death, including the burning of the body. Persons involved *Henry Glover was a 31-year-old African-American resident of the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. *David Warren, a rookie NOPD police officer at the time. *Greg McRae, an NOPD police officer at the time. *Robert Italiano, an NOPD police lieutenant at the time. *Travis McCabe, an NOPD police lieutenant at the time. *Dwayne Scheuermann, an NOPD police lieutenant at the time. Shooting Henry Glover had endured Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans along with his mother, brother, and sister. On September 2, 2005, Glover had gone to a strip mall to retrieve some baby clothing. NOPD Police Officer David Warren fatally shot Glover from a second-story balcony, from where Warren had been guarding a detective bureau office. Legal proceedings Officer Warren was charged with a federal civil rights violation, specifically one count of committing manslaughter with a firearm. Officer Greg McRae was charged with obstructing justice and other charges in relation to burning Glover's body a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu that belonged to one of Glover's friends. Police Lieutenant Dwayne Scheuermann was charged with assaulting civilians who came to Glover's aid, and obstructing the federal investigation into the burning of Glover's body. Police Lieutenant Travis McCabe was charged with obstructing justice and lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He was also charged with lying to a federal grand jury. Police Lieutenant Robert Italiano was charged with obstructing justice and lying to the FBI. In total, the 11-count indictment accused the five officers for their roles in the fatal shooting of Glover, the assaulting of Glover's brother and one of his neighbors, and attempting to conceal their actions, through activities such as the attempted cremation of Glover's corpse. Glover's death was highlighted as an example of police misconduct in the direct aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Prosecutors alleged that Warren had fatally shot Glover in the chest with a .223 rifle near an Algiers strip mall. Glover's brother, Edward King, and sister, Patrice Glover, came to Glover's aid. A neighbor of Glover named William Tanner drove Glover and his brother to seek medical attention at a nearby school, Habans Elementary School, which had been commandeered by a SWAT team of officers. Several SWAT officers testified in trial that Tanner actually fled from a marked police car near the school. It was only after several other police cars joined in the chase that he stopped on the Mercedes Street side of the school. Neither of the two men knew how Glover had been injured. SWAT officers at the school immediately placed Tanner and King into handcuffs, and then allegedly beat them. The jury acquitted the officers on this charge. Testimony in trial also alleged that an African American officer also struck one of the detained men, but little effort was put into finding that officer. While it was alleged by William Tanner in numerous media interviews that the SWAT officers let Henry Glover bleed to death in the car, the trial testimony of Lt. Scheuermann proved that in fact he had checked Glover's body for any signs of life and in fact he was already deceased. This proof was in the form of photographs provided to the defense in discovery. NOPD officer Greg McRae set fire to Glover‚Äôs body as it sat inside Tanner‚Äôs 2001 Chevrolet Malibu. The car was left parked on a Mississippi River levee down the street from a NOPD office. Istvan Balogh, a former law enforcement officer who had come in from out of state, discovered Glover's corpse on September 9. He admitted in trial that he video taped the burned car with Glover's remains and has since sold copies of the video tape. On March 31, 2011, Judge Lance M. Africk sentenced David Warren to 25 years and 9 months in federal prison on a federal civil rights violation of committing manslaughter with a firearm. Judge Africk sentenced Greg MacRae to 17 years and 3 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release on obstruction of justice and another civil rights charge. \\"Henry Glover was not at the strip mall to commit suicide. He was there to retrieve some baby clothing. You killed a man. Despite your tendentious arguments to the contrary, it was no mistake,\\" Africk told Warren. However, on December 17, 2012, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Warren's felony conviction and two of the convictions related to McRae, ordering new trials on those charges. The three-judge panel found, among other concerns, that the trials of the two men should have been conducted separately. The Glover case was incorporated into the plot of the television series Treme. The defendants cited local media coverage along with the portrayal in Treme when they sought a change of venue for the re-trial. On December 11, 2013, a jury acquitted Warren on both counts against him.

She was elected to Togo's parliament in 2007. She is well- known for orchestrating a sex strike in August 2012, protesting electoral reforms that favored the party in power. In 2013, she was elected to the National Assembly a second time. Early life and legal career Am√©ganvi was born on 3 September 1961 in the town of Kpalim√©, Togo, the sixth of eight children. She received her primary education at the Evangelical School Hanoukop√©. She enrolled at the coll√®ge Notre Dame des Ap√¥tre and the Tokoin Lyc√©e in Lom√©, Togo's capital. Afterwards, she studied at Lyc√©e Jean-Baptiste Say in Paris, France, and received her degree in 1983. Am√©ganvi earned a law degree at Paris I University in 1989 and a master of law at the University of Benin the following year. Am√©ganvi was a trainee lawyer under Ahlin K. Komlan in Lom√© from 1994 to 1996. In February 1997, she was called to the bar in Togo. As a lawyer, she represented students, political prisoners, journalists, trade unionists and other human rights activists. In the 1990s, she joined the Togolese League of Human Rights and the Collective of Associations of Women. Ameganvi later served on the legal committee of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Togo. Political career She was elected to the National Assembly of Togo in the 2007 parliamentary election, representing the Union of Forces for Change (UFC). However, in 2010 she was arbitrarily excluded from the party and lost her seat in the assembly. She is the leader of the women's rights division of the group Let's Save Togo, an alliance of nine civil society groups and seven opposition parties and movements. At a rally on 26 August 2012, attended by thousands of people, she called the women of Togo to a week- long sex-strike against recent electoral reforms, which would make it easier for the ruling president Faure Gnassingbe's party to win re‚Äëelection in the parliamentary polls scheduled for October 2012.\\"Togo women call sex strike against President Gnassingbe\\", BBC Online, 27 August 2012. Accessed 23 October 2016. The Gnassingbe family has ruled Togo for 45 years.

Accessed 23 October 2016. In addition, Ameganvi encouraged women to dress only in red pants to resist the imprisonment of 120 opposition supporters. \\"We have power to change things. We do not want to remain in the kitchen, but we can have our say in politics,\\" Ameganvi said. \\"We cannot stay hand-crossed, as our children and husbands are being kept in jail.\\" She complained that women bore the brunt of Togo‚Äôs economic and political problems and were no longer willing to put up with it. Amenganvi led another demonstration on 20 December 2012 in which she encouraged women to dress up in red. This demonstration was against the precarious economic situation of women in Togo. The color red was chosen because traditionally Togolese women made and sold red garments at markets. Ameganvi was a board member of the National Alliance for Change (ANC). In June 2013, she resigned from the ANC. Ameganvi cited the many frustrations and disappointments arising from the establishment of lists of candidates for the upcoming parliamentary election.

Lyrics  There is evidence that in the original manuscript the line read \\"Every time I see red shoes, I remember her\\" but was changed to \\"think of\\". Originally unreleased, a fifth stanza was discovered in notes released in 1978.  Established origin theory  The established theory is that the lyrics were written based on a true story. It is believed that a young girl from Fushimi, Shizuoka Prefecture named Iwasaki Kimi (July 15, 1902 - September 15, 1911), was the model for the girl wearing red shoes.A Japan Times article about the statues, Kimi, and the song. Kimi's mother, Kayo Iwasaki was raising her as a single mother, but eventually moved to Hokkaido and married Shirou Suzuki. When Kimi was 3 her parents joined a commoner's farm in Hokkaido that at the time was being watched as a part of the Socialist movement. However the farming life was harsh so using her father-in-law, Sano Yasuyoshi, as a medium Kayo entrusted Kimi's upbringing to a pair of married American missionaries by the name of Hewitt. In time the Hewitt's decided to return home to America, but Kimi contracted Tuberculosis (incurable at the time) and they were unable to take her to America with them as a result. Instead they entrusted her to the orphanage at Toriikazu Church in Azabu, Tokyo and returned without her. Unable to meet her mother again, Kimi died at the orphanage at age 9. Kayo went her entire life thinking Kimi had gone to America with the Hewitts, not knowing that she had in fact died of TB at an orphanage in Tokyo. In 1907, Ujou Noguchi, who was published as a socialist poet in 1903, became close to Suzuki Shirou, a co-worker at the newspaper he worked for in Sapporo, and his wife Kayo. He then heard the story of how Kimi had been taken to America by missionaries from Kayo. Having a new suckling child, the Suzuki's had become discouraged with the farming lifestyle. At this same time Kimi was at the orphanage in Tokyo, but Kayo was unaware of this. Later in 1921, Noguchi wrote \\"Akai Kutsu\\" based on the story and in 1922 it became a nursery rhyme using Motoori's composition. In 1973 Kimi's half-sister, Sono (Shirou and Kayo's third daughter), wrote to the newspaper stating that \\"My sister is the girl from \\"Akai Kutsu\\". Upon seeing this a reporter for Hokkaido Television Broadcasting, Hiroshi Kikuchi, became interested and started investigating. After 5 years of fact gathering Kikuchi was able to confirm the story and in 1978 a documentary entitled \\"Document: The Girl in the Red Shoes\\" aired on HKB. After that Kikuchi released a non- fiction book titled \\"The Girl in The Red Shoes\\". This book's account of the story became the established theory on the matter. = Arguments against the established theory = The idea that this established theory is partially based on fabrications was advocated by the author Shousuke Ai. When the \\"Mother and Child Statue\\" was erected in Nihondaira in Shizuoka in 1986, Ai was asked to write a script for a commemorative special by the local TV station, SBS, entitled \\"The Wandering Poem: The Girl in the Red Shoes.\\" However, at this time Ai was harbouring doubts about the truth behind the established theory that had been presented in Kikuchi's book and \\"Document: The Girl in the Red Shoes\\" and decided to investigate the contradictions in the theory. In his book \\"Hoax: The Unworn Red Shoes\\"ËëóÊõ∏„ÄéÊçèÂÉè „ÅØ„ÅÑ„Å¶„Å™„Åã„Å£„ÅüËµ§„ÅÑÈù¥ Tokuma Shoten December, 2007, Ai clarified his position of the established theory having no basis. Ai's theory is as follows: #The statement in Kikuchi's book that Sano was Kimi's real father has no basis. It's best to think that Kimi being in the family register as Sano's adopted daughter was just a step taken to allow an illegitimate child to be put in her grandfather's family register. #The name of the missionaries, identified as Kimi's adoptive parents in Kikuchi's book, Hewitt is correct, but the Hewitts never had any contact with Kimi. \\"The story of Kimi being entrusted to the missionary couple was just a lie Sano told to comfort Kayo. In reality, Sano gave her directly to the orphanage in Tokyo and she lived out her life there. During that time, the Hewitts were in Hokkaido doing missionary work and therefore could not have adopted Kimi who never came to Hokkaido. #Kikuchi's book says that \\"Ujou, who had heard the story from Kayo about Kimi being adopted, turned the story into a poem\\", but Kayo did not have many occasions to meet and talk with the Noguchis, and would not have been likely to discuss the illegitimate child she had before marriage. The relationship between the Noguchis and Suzukis probably never exceeded the men associating as co-workers and discussions about socialism. #Ujou's \\"Akai Kutsu\\" should be seen as a metaphor for the frustrations of the Utopian Socialist movement. Ai argues that Kikuchi filled the holes in his research with his imagination, but Kikuchi insists there are no errors in the basis of his theory. Ai also insists that, based on Noguchi Nobuya's (Ujou's son) research, \\"Ujou's nursery rhymes, of which \\"Akai Kutsu\\" is included, are not about any particular person.\\" On the other hand, Kukichi states that \\"Akai Kutsu\\" and some of Ujou's other works are in fact referring to particular people. The two are even in disagreement about the interpretation of \\"Shabondama\\" in which the line \\"So soon after it was born, it broke and was no more\\" may express Ujou's sorrow over the premature death of his eldest daughter The two are in complete agreement on the fact that Kayo honestly spent her life believing Kimi had been adopted by missionaries and gone to America. However, the two and their supporters disagree on whether those missionaries were the real-life Hewitts (Kikuchi's theory) or if they were just fabrications created by Sano (Ai's theory). Ai says that \\"Kikuchi is damaging the good name of the Hewitts, who never even met Kimi, with his fictional story that he created for a TV program.\\" Furthermore, Ai is trying to substantiate his theory that Ujou's \\"Akai Kutsu\\" is not about Kimi while at the same time criticizing that the story of Ujou writing the poem after hearing from Kayo about Kimi's adoption is \\"just a further embellishment of the boasting based on Kayo's bad assumption, by Kikuchi and Sono.\\" However it is a fact that Kayo told Sono that \\"Ujou-san wrote a poem about Kimi.\\" For that reason it is impossible to reject the interpretation from Kayo. Because the theories about Ujou, Kayo's interpretation, and the validity of Kikuchi's data collection process are a disorganized mess of debate, no consensus has been reached. In order to refute Kikuchi's book and Sono's statement that \\"Kayo spoke to the Noguchi's about Kimi,\\" Ai is performing a thorough investigation into his own theory that \\"Kayo didn't have many opportunities to talk to the Noguchi's and wasn't close enough with them to speak of such things.\\" On the other hand, because the two sides aren't in disagreement about the possibility that the Suzuki's could have told Ujou about Kimi or that Ujou may have researched the Suzuki family, an investigation of whether Ujou could have known about Kimi would be insufficient. On August 21, 2009, the statue \\"Kimi-chan\\" was erected in Hakodate, Hokkaido based on the established theory. However, a newspaper article about the statue's erection pointed out that there are many theories about \\"Akai Kutsu.\\" Mainichi Shimbun reported that \\"There are indications that it was written about the setbacks of the Utopian Socialist movement that was based around Sh≈´sui K≈çtoku who had led the development of peasant farming, and relatives of Noguchi assert that \\"there was no real-life model (for the girl in the song).\\"\\" Currently the debate on whether or not the Noguchi's relationship with the Suzuki's, who had suffered setbacks in the peasant farming movement, had an effect on Ujou's poems (including \\"Akai Kutsu\\") is not making progress. Furthermore, even Ujou's relatives are split on whether his nursery rhymes are about particular people or not. Ujou's granddaughter, Fujiko, as representative of the Ujou Noguchi Memorial Hall, stated in a speech that \\"Shabondama\\" expresses his sorrow over the premature death of his daughter. Nobuya and Fujiko also differ on their stance towards the official theory; Nobuya consistently opposes it while Fujiko made a commemorative speech at the celebration of the completion of the \\"Kimi-chan\\" statue. However, Nobuya also thinks that Mokichi Noguchi (Ujou's younger cousin), who was a devoted follower of Sen Katayama's theory on Socialism, had a huge effect on Ujou's early poems that weren't nursery rhymes. In her recent work \\"A Poet of Nostalgia and a Childlike Heart: The Ujou Noguchi Story\\"ÈÉ∑ÊÑÅ„Å®Á´•ÂøÉ„ÅÆË©©‰∫∫ ÈáéÂè£Èõ®ÊÉÖ‰ºù November, 2011, Fujiko Noguchi writes that it's natural to think that the fourth stanza in \\"Akai Kutsu\\" is about Mokichi (who left for America from Yokohama in 1905 and died in Los Angeles in 1954). In regards to the established theory she writes that while there is no evidence, it is adequate to think that some personal experience of Ujou's became the basis for \\"Akai Kutsu.\\" Fujiko doesn't touch on Ai's theory in the book.  Other debates  Even before the publishing of \\"Hoax: The Unworn Red Shoes\\", differing opinions on the interpretation of this rhyme were an issue. In 2003 on NHK Educational TV's educational program \\"A Course About Humans\\" in a series titled \\"Why Do People Sing?\\", Rokusuke Ei stated that he heard from Fujiko Noguchi that \\"The Aka (red) in \\"Akai Kutsu\\" (\\"Red Shoes\\") is a reference to the Soviet Union, and that Ujou was saying \\"where has the Soviet Union and Socialism gone?\\", but in order to avoid censorship under the Peace Preservation Law law he used a metaphor.\\" However, in an article in the June 17, 2003 issue of \\"Weekly Shinchou\\" Fujiko Noguchi refuted this claim saying \\"I never spoke to Ei about Ujou's nursery rhymes.\\" There is now a rift between her and Ei who insists he heard it from her. In the same article there are also comments from Hiroshi Eguchi pointing out Ei's misunderstanding saying \\"the Peace Preservation Law wasn't established until years after the release of \\"Akai Kutsu\\"\\", and composer Koichi Sugiyama criticizing Ei by saying \\"He is misinterpreting Ujou's masterpiece as something anti-Japanese.\\" Also in the article, former chairman of the Ujou Council and Ujou researcher Masako Saijou refers to the established theory of Ujou basing the poem off a story he heard from Suzuki Shirou and expresses doubt over Ei's interpretation of the red as representative of the Soviet Union. In the conclusion the reporter quotes uses Ujou's own words, \\"it is not acceptable to critique a nursery rhyme's lyrics using logic,\\" to disregard Rokosuke Ei who is just trying to escape into the idea that \\"no matter the author's feelings a song is something that is influenced by the ideas of those that come after.\\" The article does not mention the fact that Ujou was published as a Socialist poet or that Shirou Suzuki was involved in peasant farming. There is also no discussion on the debate of whether Ujou's later change in literary style was due to him seriously doing an about-face on Socialism, or if his change was just a disguise and his Socialist roots remained. In December, 2009 guest Tomoko Matsushima introduced the established theory on TBS Radio's .  Statues  A statue dedicated to Iwasaki Kimi, the little girl in the song. In 1979 in Yamashita Park in Yokohama the statue \\"The Girl in the Red Shoes\\" was erected.

In popular culture  The word foreigner („ÅÑ„Åò„Çì„Åï„Çì) in the song was commonly used from the time of the Bakumatsu through the Meiji period to refer to someone from a foreign country (Â§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫Ôºâ, as opposed to someone from a different domain within the country.

Manga artist Momoko Sakura, from Shimizu, wrote the sh≈çjo manga \\"Chibi Maruko-chan\\" based on this idea. Even before his book, \\"The Wandering Poem: The Girl in the Red Shoes\\", Shousuke Ai wrote a television script based on \\"Akai Kutsu\\" under his real name Bunbei Ai. The 45th episode of Ultraman Taro, entitled \\"From A Japanese Nursery Rhyme: Wearing Red Shoes...\\" (1974), is about a young girl who was taken away by aliens when she was little and turned into a monster to help invade Earth, and her childhood friend who is a member of the Self-Defense Forces. The 349th episode of , entitled \\"The Woman from Greece!\\" (1984), depicts the interactions between Katsuhiko Yokomitsu, a detective in disguise on a special mission, and a young girl. In one scene Yokomitsu sings \\"Akai Kutsu\\". The Akai Kutsu Committee (later renamed the Japan Akai Kutsu Committee), that was established for the sake of the movement against the established theory, has Ai as chairman and Yokomitsu as an honorary adviser, but Yokomitsu is participating more as a \\"former actor turned politician.\\" The movie \\"Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers\\" (2008) was made in anticipation of the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Port of Yokohama. The statue in Yamashita Park is also featured in the film. The \\"Akai Kutsu Girl\\", who seems like a normal human at first, plays a being who transcends time and space and guides Ultraman. However her true form is unclear. In the 2007 drama \\"Gluttonous Detectives 2\\", in an episode entitled , the circumstances of a man who was taken from his Japanese mother and went abroad overlap with the song. It was also filmed in Yamashita Park. At the Yokohama Carnival that takes place in summer a big dance event known as the Hamakoi Odori (a dance originating from Yosakoi) is held. One of the rules of the dance is that the nursery rhyme \\"Akai Kutsu\\" must be included among the tunes.

On the lowest tier kneel Sir Thomas's two sons, facing each other over a prie-dieu. On the tier above lies the semi- recumbent figure of Sir Thomas Hele, dressed in full armour, excepting helm which rests by his shoulder. His two daughters kneel watching him in prayer, one at his head, the other at his feet. On the tier above him kneel a man and his wife, either side of a prie-dieu, the man on the left, his wife on the right. Behind the man are his five sons kneeling, behind the woman three daughters. On the top tier the arrangement is repeated, with two sons behind the man and four daughters behind the wife. The two uppermost tiers are thought to represent the family of sir Thomas's father and grandfather. On top of the monument is an escutcheon showing the arms of Hele (very worn). There is no inscription on the monument, but it is probable that the effigies represent Thomas Hele of Exeter, Thomas Hele of Fleet (his son), and his son Sir Thomas Hele who was the first baronet of the family. There is the Red hand of Ulster badge of a baronet in the arms which probably applies to Sir Thomas, the first baronet, but the style is earlier.

Until the end of World War II the village was inhabited mainly by ethnic Germans. The town was known for suffering through frequent fires that may have been related to the large amount of foreign troop movements that it saw during the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the Austro-Prussian War. The dominant Reinowitz Holy Ghost church dates from 1697-8 and was renovated in 1882 and 1995. Roads joining Reinowitz with the towns of Wemschen, Luxdorf and Reichenberg were built in 1852. The cemetery was dominated by the Priebsch family tomb from 1862‚Äì4. In 1900, the village was connected to the tram network of Gablonz an der Nei√üe. In 1910, Reinowitz was home to nearly 1150 people. The Munich Agreement permitted Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler to annex the area, in 1938, into what he called the Sudetenland. There were several small glass works and brickworks. Just before the war began a complex of factories were built, which today is an industrial zone in the town of Jablonec nad Nisou. During World War II, Reinowitz was the location of a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp providing forced labour for the German firm \\"Feinapparatenbau GmbH\\".en.gross-rosen.eu Its prisoners were mostly Poles, but also Czechs, Russians and Germans. Following World War II, in 1945, the town returned to Czechoslovakia and the German inhabitants were expelled under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement and Bene≈° decrees.

According to most ancient authors, Arruns and his brother were the sons of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king, and Tanaquil. However, in some sources they are described as grandsons; their father may have been a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius, who according to an Etruscan tradition was defeated and killed by the heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, together with a certain Macstarna. Apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin word magister, Macstarna has been identified with Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome. According to legend, Servius had come to the palace as a child, following the capture of Corniculum by Tarquinius Priscus. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, discovered his potential for greatness by various omens. When the elder Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil gave out that he was merely wounded, and installed Servius as regent, preferring him to her own sons. The Etruscan tradition may preserve an account of a revolt by Tarquin's sons against Servius' magistracy. Servius married a daughter of the elder Tarquin, and in turn he gave his own daughters to Arruns and Lucius Tarquinius. Arruns Tarquinius was mild and unassuming, while his brother was ambitious. Arruns' wife, known to history as Tullia Minor, as she was the younger daughter, was similarly ambitious, while her elder sister was not. Tullia sought to place her husband on the throne, which would require her father's death. But as Arruns lacked the ambition to overthrow his father-in- law, Tullia contrived his murder, and that of her own sister, that she might marry Lucius. Once these deeds were accomplished, she and Lucius plotted her father's destruction. With a sudden and bloody palace coup, the pair deposed and murdered the king, and Lucius seized the throne. Lucius' second son was named after his murdered brother; but it was the overweening pride and arrogance of Lucius' sons that brought about the downfall of the Roman monarchy.

Family and marriages Tullia was the younger of the two daughters of Rome's sixth king, Servius Tullius. By Roman custom, both daughters were named Tullia, the feminine form of their father's nomen. Servius Tullius arranged the marriage of his daughters to the two sons of his predecessor, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. The sons were named Lucius and Arruns. According to Livy, the younger of the two daughters had the fiercer disposition, yet she was married to Arruns, who had the milder disposition of the two sons.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.46 Livy says that the similar temperaments of the younger Tullia and Lucius Tarquinius drew them to each other, and Tullia inspired Tarquinius to greater daring. Together they arranged the murder of their respective siblings, in quick succession, and Tarquinius and Tullia were afterwards married. Overthrow and murder of Servius Tullius Tullia driving over her father's body Tullia then encouraged her new husband to seek the throne. Tarquinius was convinced, and began to solicit the support of the patrician senators, especially those families who had been given senatorial rank by his father. He bestowed presents on them and vilified Servius Tullius in their company. Having acquired the backing of a large number of senators, Tarquinius went to the senate house with an armed guard and seated himself on the throne.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.47 When Servius Tullius protested, Tarquinius hurled him bodily into the street, where he was murdered by Tarquinius' assassins, apparently at Tullia's suggestion.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.48 Tullia then drove in her carriage to the senate house, where she hailed her husband as king. He ordered her to return home, away from the tumult. She drove along the Cyprian Street and turned towards the Orbian Hill, in the direction of the Esquiline Hill. There at the top of the Cyprian Street she encountered her father's mutilated remains and, in a frenzy of madness, drove the carriage over his body. Ever afterwards this street was called the \\"Vicus Sceleratus\\" (street of infamy, or of wickedness) in memory of her actions.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.48 Tullia's act of desecration spattered her with blood that stained her clothes, and in this manner she returned to her husband's house. Livy states that Tarquinius' household gods were angered by this crime, and determined that a reign begun so badly would also end badly. Unpopularity and exile When the uprising led by Lucius Junius Brutus ended the Roman monarchy and King Tarquinius and his family were exiled from Rome, Tullia in particular was cursed by the Roman people as she fled her home, given her role in the murder of her own father.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.59 In culture Tullia is the main character of the 1533 play Tullia. She has also been depicted in several paintings.

Banjo rolls serve a variety of functions within an ensemble: Earl Scruggs is known for being the pioneer of banjo picking. Scruggs grew up in a musical family where his parents and siblings all played instruments including the guitar, piano, fiddle and the organ. Scruggs began playing the banjo at the age of 5, by the age of 10 he perfected three-string-plucking on a 5 sting banjo now known as ‚ÄúScruggs- Style‚Äù. When Scruggs was 21 he began playing with Bill Monroe group called Blue Grass Boys which is where the term ‚Äúbluegrass music‚Äù comes from. Later on, Monroe and Scruggs launched The Foggy Mountain Boys. The four essential 5-strong banjo rolls The forward roll: this is the simplest roll on the banjo, just as the name says, you roll your fingers forward and away from you across the strings. This banjo roll is made up of eight movements. The reverse or backward roll: In order to play this roll correctly you want grasp onto the strings then forward toll then reverse the order in which you play the 1st and 2nd strings. The Forward-Reverse Roll: The 5 string banjo roll typically will only use four out of 5 strings, also other than using just 3 that are used to play the forward and backward rolls. The mixed roll: The mixed roll is also known by the names of ‚Äòthe thumb-in-and-out‚Äô or ‚Äòalternating thumb‚Äô roll, this pattern is neither ascending or descending. This roll technique also uses all 5 strings. Also, the thumb will play every other note. \\"The word roll has different meanings for different kinds of musicians.

It is currently owned by the National Trust and known as an attractive tarn for fishing and walking. It is known for its association with Beatrix Potter ‚Äì she owned the tarn and donated it to the National Trust after her death, and it served as inspiration for some of her stories. Description The tarn is on Claife Heights. Alfred Wainwright calls it the \\"most attractive\\" tarn on Claife Heights; it is stocked with water lilies and fish, and surrounded by rhododendrons. The outflow is bridged by a small dam. The tarn is best reached by following a track from Near Sawrey, a small village between Hawkshead and Windermere. History Wainwright contends the \\"tarn\\" to be a reservoir, noting that none of the tarns on Claife Heights appear on 19th-century maps. He notes, however, that they are \\"not obtrusively artificial\\". After Beatrix Potter and her husband William Heelis married in 1913, they lived in Castle Cottage in Far Sawrey and rowed on the tarn in summer evenings. Potter sketched near the tarn and her husband fished in it. In 1926, Potter bought part of the tarn, planting the water lilies and stocking it with fish. Along with much other land, it was left to the National Trust by Potter upon her death in 1943. It was probably a combination of Moss Eccles Tarn and Esthwaite Water that served as inspiration for the home of Jeremy Fisher in The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher; the road to the tarn from Near Sawrey was also drawn by Potter for The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly- Poly Pudding. The \\"strange, flat bottomed boat\\" in which Potter and Heelis rowed is now housed in the Windermere Steamboat Museum; it was salvaged from the tarn in 1976. Fishing The tarn is stocked with brown trout, and the fishing rights are controlled by the Windermere, Ambleside and District Anglish Association on behalf of the National Trust. The membership of the association is open, and tickets to fish in the tarn can be bought from local pubs, service stations and fishing shops. There is a limit to two fish per day per person.

Early life At age seven, Osorio played the cuatro, violin, flute and viola in Emil Friedman school. Career In 1982, while being a member of the choir of his church in Caracas, met Juan Carlos Perez and formed the duo Fernando y Juan Carlos. They recorded in 1985 their first album, which was only released in Venezuela. Osorio also has had combined a parallel career as a songwriter. Venezuelan performer Guillermo D√°vila recorded in 1984 \\"Definitivamente\\" written by Osorio, being the first time someone recorded a song by Osorio (aside from his band). Karina and Ricardo Montaner followed D√°vila and also included songs by Osorio on their respective albums. As a writer, his first success overseas came with \\"S√≥lo Con Un Beso\\" recorded by Montaner in 1988. The song peaked at number seven in the Billboard Hot Latin Songs (formerly Hot Latin Tracks) in the United States. Osorio also composed \\"Ojos Negros\\" and \\"Vamos a Dejarlo\\" for Montaner's debut album. Osorio recorded a self-titled debut album in 1993. In 1996, he wrote \\"Llorar√©\\" for Jerry Rivera's album Fresco, reaching number-one on the Latin Tropical Airplay chart. A year later he wrote \\"Se Mi Aire\\" for Mexican singer Cristian Castro. Castro also covered \\"Llorar√©\\" and included those songs on the Grammy Award nominated album Lo Mejor de M√≠. Osorio also wrote \\"Moja Mi Coraz√≥n\\" with Andr√©s Levin, the first single of Azabache, a 1997 studio album released by Spanish singer Marta S√°nchez. The track became a Top 20 hit in the United States Latin charts and number-one on the Latin Pop Airplay chart. The same year, Osorio signed a recording contract with WEA Latina and wrote 40 songs for his first album under this contract. In 1998 the album was released under the title Con Palabras. According to the writer, this album included eleven \\"stories of love, with personal and some borrowed feelings.\\" Osorio received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 1st Latin Grammy Awards, losing to Cuban singer Ibrahim Ferrer. =As a writer= Luis Enrique, Marc Anthony, MDO, Frankie Negr√≥n, Huey Dunbar and Celia Cruz have also recorded songs written by Osorio. The track \\"Con Cada Beso\\", a top five hit for Huey Dunbar, was recognized as the Best Salsa Song of 2002 by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Celia Cruz recorded \\"La Negra Tiene Tumbao\\" by request of Sergio George, who was producing Cruz' (then) new album; the lyrics for the song came related to the incident that Cruz had with Andy Mont√°√±ez on political issues for some years and because of these differences, the \\"Guarachera\\" was booed in Puerto Rico. While praising Cruz attitude, who was able to successfully overcome this difficult time with the public, Osorio said: \\"¬°Oye, esa negra es brava y tiene tumbao!\\" (\\"Hey, that woman is fierce and has tumbao!), \\"¬°Celia camina de frente!\\" (Celia walks up to the front!); thus was born the idea for the song. This track was nominated for two Latin Grammy Awards, Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the 2002 ceremony. \\"La Negra Tiene Tumbao'\\" spent 89 weeks in the Latin Tropical Airplay chart and peaked at number two in the Hot Latin Songs chart. Osorio also wrote the Spanish lyrics for \\"Soy Tu Lluvia\\", a track included on Soy, an album released by Mexican singer Alejandra Guzm√°n which also was awarded a Latin Grammy. Osorio and Alejandra Guzman wrote Spanish lyrics for \\"Amor En Suspenso\\", a song written by Roxanne Seeman and Philipp Steinke, for Guzman's √önico album released in November 2009, reaching Gold status in Mexico. Osorio also composed the last track recorded by Celia Cruz before her death: \\"Rie y Llora\\" (\\"Laugh and Cry\\"); the song reached number-one on the Latin Tropical Airplay and earned Osorio a Latin Grammy in 2004 for Best Tropical Song. The writer stated about his relation with Cruz: \\"Celia [Cruz] asked for the song to be the main theme of the album, because she was very identified.\\" Osorio also was nominated for Best Tropical Song at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2010 for the track \\"Sue√±o Contigo\\", co-written by Jorge L.

It was founded 27 March 1914, and the line opened 11 June 1917 from Stortorvet to S√¶ter. The company also built a line to Simensbr√•ten that was closed 29 October 1967. Ekebergbanen also operated buses in Oslo. History The company was founded on 24 March 1914, and started construction of the line immediately, but the delivery of technical equipment and rolling stock was delayed because of the First World War. The company's formal establishment was therefore made on 1 June 1917, when the line between Stortorvet and S√¶ter was opened. In 1918, AS Ekebergbanen sent an application to build a funicular from Gamlebyen (then called Oslo) to Ekebergplat√•et. The stations were mostly built with tiny wooden sheds in new baroque architectural style by the Norwegian architect Erik Glosimodt. On the station Holtet, a larger station building was constructed, also drawn by Erik Glosimodt. This was to be the \\"main base\\" for Ekebergbanen, equipped with power stations with and a tram depot with place for twelve cars on six tracks. The depot is still used by the Oslo Tramway. In 1924, the company started to operate diesel buses, especially a route from Oslo city centre to Sv√¶rsvann named \\"√òstmarkruten\\". This bus route was in 1953 overtaken by Oslo Sporveier and renumbered to line 71. On 30 September 1931, a branch line from Jomfrubr√•ten to Simensbr√•ten was opened, officially named Simensbr√•ten Line. The service on this branch line was during the peak hours extended to Stortorvet. The Simensbr√•ten Line was closed on 29 October 1967. The Ekeberg Line was extended from S√¶ter to Ljabru on 17 September 1941, which originally was single- tracked. While waiting for the Gullfisk-trams, Ekebergbanen borrowed trams from B√¶rumsbanen until 1974. On 1 July 1948, Oslo Sporveier bought the major share of the company's stocks. 17 years later‚Äîon the same day‚Äîthe administration and operation of the two lines were transferred to Oslo Sporveier. The company formally merged with Oslo Sporveier on 1 July 1992, and was declared defunct the year after. Tram lines The Ekeberg Line is a long continuation of the Gamleby Line, from which it connects at Oslo Hospital. The entire line is built as a light rail with its own right-of-way. It runs up Ekeberg on the east side of Kongsveien, passing Sj√∏mannsskolen and Jomfrubr√•ten. This is where the Simensbr√•ten Line previously branched off. It was long and had three stations: Ekebergparken, Smedstua and Simensbr√•ten. The Ekeberg Line continues from Jomfrubr√•ten past Sportsplassen to Holtet, which is the location of the depot. The line then crosses Kongsveien and continues along the west side of Ekebergveien. It passes the stations S√∏rli, Kastellet, Br√•ten and S√¶ter. Between S√¶ter and the terminus Ljabru is a bridge over Nordstrandsveien which is single tracked. The remaining part of the network was eventually double track and electrified at 1,200 volts direct current. Bus operations In 1924, Ekebergbanen bought four Berliet buses with bodies from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and put them into service on two lines, from Jernbanetorget to Abilds√∏ and from S√¶ter to Godheim. The latter route was used to feed the Ekeberg Line. In 1927, the company bought Republic and Studebaker buses, and in 1928 four B√ºssing buses which replaced the Berliet vehicles. From 1927 to 1931, the company ran a bus line from Jernbanetorget to Simensbr√•ten, and also for some years from Nordstrandsh√∏gda to Aker University Hospital. From 28 August 1932, the two original bus lines were combined and extended to Sv√¶rsvann. It was branded as √òstmarkaruten and ran the route Jernbanetorget‚ÄìAbilds√∏‚ÄìKlemetsrud‚ÄìGodheim‚ÄìSv√¶rsvann. In 1937, the company bought four diesel buses from B√ºssing. In 1940, the company had four modern diesel buses and three older gasoline buses. The company had silver buses with a wine red cheatline with the EB logo in silver on a blue background. The company also ran an automotive workshop and fuel station at Holtet. During World War II, the operation of buses was limited, although because some of the buses ran on diesel, it was easier to procure fuel, compared to gasoline buses. One of the buses was rebuilt to a truck. From 1946 to 1951, the company bought new buses from Scania-Vabis and Volvo, with bodies built at Holtet. From 1 February 1952, the √òstmarkaruten was transferred to Oslo Sporveier, which numbered it Line 71. The buses continued to use Holtet as a depot until 1957, when they were transferred to Grefsen. Trams An Ekebergbanen tram in 1918 The company operated several classes of unique trams, which were only used on the Ekeberg Line, the Simensbr√•ten Line and the connection to the city center. They were all capable of both running on 1,200 V on the Ekeberg and Simenbr√•ten Lines, and 600 V in the city. The junction between the two networks was a section without an overhead wire at Oslo Hospital. This allowed each of the pantographs to touch their current at the same time. All the trams had four motors, each running at 600 V. They were grouped in two pairs, each serial connected. The two groups were connected so they were either serial or parallel connected, so each motor would either receive 300 V or 600 V. However, they were not connected to they would receive the same current in the city as on the hill section, thus the trams had only half the power when running on the 600 V section, with each motor either running at 150 V or 300 V. However, peak power was not needed, as the city was flat and had a maximum speed limit of .

A major contender for the Bulgarian throne, Strez initially opposed the ascension of his close relative Tsar Boril. He fled to Serbia, where he accepted the vassalage of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanjiƒá, and Serbian support helped him establish himself as a largely independent ruler in a large part of the region of Macedonia. However, Strez turned against his suzerains to become a Bulgarian vassal and joined forces with his former enemy Boril against the Latins and then the Serbs. Strez was murdered amidst a major anti-Serbian campaign under unclear circumstances in a plot that likely involved Saint Sava. Throne contender and Serbian vassal Genealogical chart of the Asen dynasty, including Strez and Boril. Nothing is mentioned of Strez until the events in the wake of the sudden death of Tsar Kaloyan (1197‚Äì1207) during his siege of the Crusader-held Thessaloniki.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 98 Just like Alexius Slav, another noble who would later emerge as a separatist, Strez was a nephew of the Asen brothers Peter, Ivan Asen and Kaloyan, who were the first three emperors of the Second Bulgarian Empire.–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤ (2003) However, it is unclear whether through his relation to the early Asens he was a first cousin or a brother of Boril (1207‚Äì1218).Fine, p. 94–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), p. 353 At the time of Kaloyan's death, Strez was in the capital Tarnovo, perhaps seeking to capitalize on his ancestral rights to the Bulgarian crown. However, Boril proved to be the more ambitious candidate. Boril persecuted the other candidates for the throne, and Alexius Slav, along with Ivan Asen's sons Ivan Asen II had to leave Bulgaria.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), p. 354 As happened to other members of the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjiƒá (1196‚Äì1228) in 1207 or early 1208.Curta, p. 385 Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria,–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 179 the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make it much easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braniƒçevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan.Fine, pp. 94‚Äì95 At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Latins at Plovdiv.Velimiroviƒá, p. 61–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 180 Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty. The gorge of the Vardar at modern Demir Kapija was the site of Strez's capital, Prosek, from 1208 to 1214 In 1208, Strez headed a Serbian force which seized much of the Vardar valley from Bulgaria. He established himself as a Serbian vassal at the Prosek fortress (near modern Demir Kapija), formerly the capital of another Bulgarian separatist, Dobromir Chrysos. By 1209, Strez's realm spread over much of Macedonia, from the Struma valley in the east, where he bordered the lands controlled by Boril, to Bitola and perhaps Ohrid in the west, and from Skopje in the north to Veria in the south. While Strez quickly gained the support of the local Bulgarian population and possibly inherited the remaining administration from Boril's rule, Serbian units nevertheless remained in his domains, either to guarantee his loyalty or with the intent to oust him and annex his lands.Fine, pp. 95‚Äì96 Bulgarian vassal Alexius Slav's marriage to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, who was at the time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 181–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 99 Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil- inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though it is more likely that the union was achieved through negotiations.Fine, pp. 97‚Äì98 In the same year, Strez and Boril had come to peace with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of Epirus. In late 1209, Strez and Michael may have attempted a joint campaign against Thessaloniki,–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), p. 355 as they both lost lands to the Latins in what was likely a retaliation raid in late 1209 or early 1210. The failure of this attack prompted Michael to break away from his Bulgarian allies and support the Latins. In early 1211, Strez clashed with the Latins and Epirotes at Thessaloniki and required Boril's assistance after Michael and Henry invaded the western reaches of Strez's realm. In the early summer, the allied Bulgarian army suffered a heavy defeat at Bitola at the hands of Michael, Henry's brother Eustace and Bernard of Katzenellenbogen.Housley, p. 73 Even though it resulted in no territorial losses, it prevented Strez from an expansion to the south. In relation to an anti-Bogomil council in 1211, Strez is referred to as a sebastokrator. The title was either conferred to him by Boril as part of their agreement in 1209, or was awarded to Strez by Kaloyan during his rule. In any case, Boril certainly recognized Strez's right to that appellation. There are signs that Strez divided his possessions into administrative units, each headed by a sebastos.Fine, p. 98 In 1212, Strez was powerful enough to be considered one of the Latin Empire's chief adversaries, along with Boril, Michael and Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris, by Henry himself. Anti-Serbian campaign and death After a series of military failures against the Latins, Boril made peace with Henry in 1213, cemented through two royal marriages.Fine, pp. 100‚Äì101–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 182 As Boril's vassal, Strez joined the Bulgarian‚ÄìLatin union, the short-term goal of which was a double invasion of Serbia.–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤ (2007), p. 154Fine, p. 101 In 1214, the forces of Boril and Henry attacked Serbia from the east, while Strez's army, deemed in contemporary sources to be \\"countless\\", penetrated Serbian territory from the south and reached the Polog. Facing a major invasion on two fronts, the Serbs were quick to ask for peace. After Stefan's envoys to Strez failed, he sent his brother, archbishop Sava (canonized as Saint Sava) to Strez's camp.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (2004), p. 183Fine, p. 103 Even though Sava's diplomacy was of no effect either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel,–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), p. 356 though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, some of whom had turned against him and organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.Fine, pp. 103‚Äì104Velimiroviƒá, p. 62 While Strez's murder meant an end to the Latin‚ÄìBulgarian campaign, Stefan did not undertake a campaign into Macedonia due to the proximity of the coalition troops, which had halted at Ni≈°. In 1217, all of Strez's territory was under the Epirote rule of Theodore Komnenos Doukas, though Boril may have controlled some or all of it in the meantime.Fine, p. 104 The Serbs failed to take advantage of Strez's death as far as they did not manage to acquire any of his former domains. Assessment and legacy Contemporary Serbian sources, such as the hagiography of Saint Sava, are highly critical of Strez's actions. The Serbs accused Strez of recklessness, drunkenness, ungodliness, treason and cruelty. The hagiography of Saint Sava tells of Strez's alleged tendency to have captives thrown from a high cliff into the Vardar River for his and his guests' entertainment. As the prisoners were falling to their death, Strez would sarcastically shout at them not to get their coats wet.Velimiroviƒá, pp. 60‚Äì62–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ (1999), pp. 355‚Äì356 Bulgarian historian Ivan Lazarov dismisses these allegations as slanderous. In his biography of Strez, he hails the medieval ruler as a \\"true member of the Asen dynasty\\" and defends his actions due to him being a \\"child of his time\\". Lazarov assesses Strez as a characteristic, vivid personality who put his independence above all. The name of Strez has become a part of Bulgarian folklore, including a legendary account of his life written down as the Biography of Prince Stregan in the 18th century or later.–ú—É—Ç–∞—Ñ—á–∏–µ–≤, p. 110 At least one location throughout Macedonia was tied by the locals with Strez, whom the folk interpreted as a voivode or hajduk who defended the people against the Ottomans.

First flown in 1993, it has been produced in large numbers and in several variants. Design and development The Lilienthal Bekas is a pod and boom, multi-purpose, pusher configuration ultralight with a high wing and low- set boom carrying a T-tail. The well glazed pod seats two in tandem and carries the constant chord wing at its top. The wing is braced to the lower fuselage by two pairs of cross braced struts and is fitted with flaps, which have a maximum deflection of 40¬∞. A fixed, tricycle undercarriage with a castoring nosewheel is mounted on the pod. The engine is mounted at the rear top of the pod, behind the cabin; types in the 60-100 hp (45-75 kW) range may be fitted, most commonly Rotax two or four cylinder models such as the Rotax 582 or 912UL and 912ULS. The engine is cowled on some aircraft but not all. Much of the slim boom is occupied by a broad chord fin with a straight swept leading edge. On some aircraft it is extended forwards with a fillet. The rudder hinge, also slightly swept, is at the end of the boom. The tailplane is of constant chord and braced to the end of the boom by a strut on each side. The aircraft has JAR-VLA certification. Operational history The X-32 Bekas first flew in March 1993 and received its Ukrainian certification in 1995. The Rotax 582 and 912 variants were certified in 2003 and 2005 respectively.

Biography Stephen Olney entered the service as an ensign in Hitchcock's Regiment (14th Continentals) May 1775, joining the Continental Army's 11th Continental Infantry in January, 1776 as a Lieutenant and participating in the siege of Boston, battles of Long Island, Harlem Heights, White Plains, Second Trenton, and Princeton. He became a Captain in the Second Rhode Island in January, 1777 where he saw service at the Battles of Red Bank, Monmouth, Rhode Island, and Springfield, where he was wounded. By act of Congress the 2nd Rhode Island and 1st Rhode Island were merged along with Sherburne's Battilion and served at the siege of Yorktown under Lafayette. Captain Olney lead the American sappers over the top of Redoubt 10, calling back to his troops \\"in a tone as if there were no danger, Capt. Olney's company form here\\". Armed with only an espontoon, he was immediately attacked by 6 to 8 bayonets. The Americans took the redoubt in about 10 minutes, but Capt. Olney was badly wounded including a bayonet in the gut which was thought to be fatal. He was sent to the hospital in Williamsburg where he recovered and returned to his regiment 3 weeks later. He resigned in May, of 1782, stating in a letter to General Washington that since the war was over, he felt it was not honorable to remain in the Army waiting to be paid. He returned to Providence and subsequently represented North Providence in the legislature for twenty years, besides holding various other town offices.

As second-in-command of the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment, he fought at Red Bank. After its commander was wounded early in the action, he led Varnum's brigade in bitter fighting at Monmouth in June 1778.

After the war he helped found the Rhode Island chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati. He supported the Federalist Party and held various civil offices. After helping to establish the Providence Theater, he defended it against accusations of immorality. He also invested in farms, turnpikes, shipping, and other business ventures. Early career Olney was born in 1749 at Providence, Rhode Island to parents Joseph Olney (1706-1777) and Elizabeth T. Mawney (b. 1714).

Donop sent British Major Charles Stuart under a flag of truce to demand the fort's surrender. The American commander, Colonel Christopher Greene of the 1st Rhode Island sent Lieutenant Colonel Olney of the 2nd Regiment to receive the message. Stuart addressed Olney in a tone loud enough for the fort's garrison to hear. He said, \\"The King of England orders his rebellious subjects to lay down their arms, and they are warned that if they stand battle, no quarter will be given\\". When Stuart insisted on seeing the fort's commander, Olney replied that they would, \\"defend the fort unto the last\\". The British officer pressed further and Olney remarked that, \\"seeing Colonel Greene was altogether needless,\\" because he would defend the fort \\"as long as he had a man and as to mercy it was neither sought nor expected\\". Hessian officer Johann von Ewald recalled Olney shouting, \\"By God no!\\" in reply to the demand for surrender.McGuire, 160 Later that afternoon, the Hessians tried to rush the fort but were slaughtered by American gunfire. An eyewitness reported that during the fight, Olney used the flat of his sword on soldiers who fired over the parapet without aiming their muskets. American losses in the engagement were 14 killed, 21 wounded, and one captured while the Hessians suffered 90 killed, 227 wounded, and 69 missing. Donop was mortally wounded.McGuire, 166 In January 1778, the enlisted men of the 1st Rhode Island were transferred to the 2nd Rhode Island. The officers and non commissioned officers of the 1st went back to the state to recruit. The regiment was filled up by enrolling slaves who were purchased by the state. The slaves were promised freedom after their terms of enlistment expired. No other state followed this course of action.Wright, 149 Though every \\"negro, mulatto, or Indian man-slave\\" was eligible to enroll and the bounty was the same as for white men, fewer than 200 signed up. Alarmed at the cost, the Rhode Island Assembly stopped recruiting slaves on 10 June 1778. Monmouth Olney's brigade faced the crack British grenadiers at Monmouth. Grenadier, 40th Foot. At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Olney led the two consolidated Rhode Island regiments in Varnum's brigade which was temporarily commanded by Colonel John Durkee.Morrissey, 46 Part of Charles Lee's advanced guard, this 300-man unit also included the converged 4th and 8th Connecticut Regiment plus two attached guns from Captain David Cook's company of the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment.Morrissey, 85 As the American units came into contact with the British rear guard, confused fighting broke out. Some British light dragoons attacked a party of militia horsemen but were driven off by volleys from infantry detachments under Richard Butler and Henry Jackson. Butler and Jackson moved forward but came under fire from two British cannons and pulled back into some woods. Thinking Butler and Jackson were enemy forces, Lee sent Durkee's soldiers to attack them. The matter was quickly straightened out and Durkee was shifted to support two guns commanded by Eleazer Oswald on the left flank. At this time Durkee was wounded and Olney succeeded him in command of Varnum's brigade.Morrissey, 49 Soon after this, Lee became aware that British commander Henry Clinton assembled 6,000 troops nearby, many more than he had suspected. Oswald withdrew his two guns because they were out of round shot and the crews were unable to bring up their ammunition wagon. As Clinton's troops moved forward menacingly, Lee lost control of his division. Some units began retreating and other units, seeing their neighbors withdraw, fell back as well. Observing his troops withdrawing without orders, Lee gave orders for a general retreat. Oswald, Lee's artillery chief, massed 10 cannon to cover the movement.Morrissey, 52-53 Pressed by British columns, the retreat continued and Oswald dissolved his large battery, returning Olney's two guns as well as two guns belonging to William Maxwell's New Jersey Brigade. Two more guns were sent to the rear.Morrissey, 57 Washington appeared on the scene and relieved Lee of his command. However, he soon relented and permitted Lee to organize a holding action while he deployed the American main body into a defensive line. Lee placed Olney's brigade behind a north-south hedgerow with two of Oswald's guns in support on their right. Oswald's other two guns took a position where they could cover the detachments of Nathaniel Ramsey and Walter Stewart on the left flank. Lee directed Henry Livingston Jr. to protect Oswald's two guns on the right, but instead he took position behind the hedgerow on Olney's left.Morrissey, 65 After a sharp struggle with the Brigade of Guards, Stewart and Ramsey were driven out of the woods on the left. Both Stewart and Ramsey fell wounded and Ramsey was captured by some troopers of the 16th Light Dragoons. Next, the dragoons attacked the hedgerow but were repelled by Olney and Livingston. Clinton yelled for the 2nd Grenadier Battalion and half of the 1st Grenadier Battalion to attack the hedgerow. Charging into intense musketry and case shot, the elite grenadiers broke into the hedgerow position. Oswald pulled his guns out just in time, covered by Olney's men. In the melee, 16 grenadiers found themselves surrounded by Olney's troops, but the Americans were so bent on retreating that they paid no heed to their enemies. During the violent struggle, the commander of the 2nd Grenadiers Henry Monckton was killed. After this action, which occurred about noon, Olney joined the rest of Lee's division which was reorganizing in the rear of Washington's main body.Morrissey, 69-70 Later career Olney's father-in-law, Governor Nicholas Cooke On 26 April 1780 Olney wed Sarah Cooke (1755-1843), daughter of Governor Nicholas Cooke. He fought at the Battle of Springfield on 23 June 1780. In the combat, the 2nd Rhode Island under Angell held up Wilhelm von Knyphausen's greatly superior British-Hessian force at the Springfield Bridge for 40 minutes before withdrawing in good order.Boatner, 1047 The new bride received a mistaken report that her husband had been killed, causing her to have a nervous breakdown. Her condition lasted a few years after which she recovered and outlived her husband by over 30 years. The couple had only one child, Mary Timmins Olney (1799-1878) who married Samuel Carr (1795-1832) and had three sons. The 1st and 2nd Regiments were merged on 1 January 1781 and the new unit was named the Rhode Island Regiment. Olney transferred to the new regiment in January and assumed command of the regiment on 14 May 1781 after Colonel Greene and Major Ebenezer Flagg were killed by Tories at the Battle of Pine's Bridge on the Croton River in Westchester County, New York that same day. When the regiment began its march south to Virginia, Olney was listed as the commander of 360 officers and men.Selig, 68 At the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781, his regiment belonged to Colonel Elias Dayton's Brigade of Benjamin Lincoln's Division.Boatner, 1240 Olney was brevetted as a colonel on 30 September 1783 in recognition of his long and faithful service in the Continental Army. At the end of the war Olney resigned his commission. He was one of the few individuals who served in the Continental Army for the entirety of its existence. He was a founding member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati and served as its treasurer and later as its president from 1800 until his death in 1812. Post war After the war, Colonel Olney served as Distributor of Pensions for Rhode Island's invalid soldiers. During the war he paid his own money for supplies and equipment for his regiment. After the war he had difficulty getting reimbursed for these expenses. A staunch member of the Federalist Party, he argued in favor of adoption of the United States Constitution. For his political support, he was rewarded by being appointed in 1790 to the lucrative position of Customs Collector for the Port of Providence by President George Washington. He retained this position despite attempts to oust him in 1793 and 1802 for too-rigorous enforcement of duties and fees. The Embargo Act of 1807 caused a large increase in smuggling and he resigned his post in 1809. Olney pursued numerous money-making ventures after the war. From 1784 until his death, he managed a farm in Rehoboth, Massachusetts that was owned by his in-laws. He sold water from \\"Jeremiah Olney's Fountain\\" to nearby homes in North Providence. He bought shares in turnpikes, sold framed prints, invested in property, and sold lottery tickets. He acted as the agent for some ex-officers who owned shares in a farm in Tiverton, Rhode Island. From 1806 to 1811 he owned shares in the Union Cotton Manufacturing Company. He invested in the trading voyages of his seafaring brother-in-law Joseph S. Cooke. He helped start the Providence Theatre and defended it in print against people who called it a bad influence. He died on 10 November 1812 and was buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence.

Founded by Arlene Wagner and her husband George in 1995, the museum housed over 6,000 nutcrackers in 2010. Wagner studied ballet under Alexandra Danilova, and subsequently became a ballet instructor. She taught multiple productions of The Nutcracker, and became enamored of nutcrackers. She began collecting them during the 1960s. The museum's building is of a Bavarian style and is of an area of 3,000 square feet; it is situated above Wagner's shop Nussknacker Haus, which sells nutcrackers. Wagner came to be known as \\"the Nutcracker Lady\\". The Museum was featured on the NBC program Today in 2000. In 2001, the museum became a part of the National Heritage Foundation. David Evangelista favorably reviewed the museum in a piece for an A&E; Network special in 2003. Wagner wrote a book, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers, which discusses 1,000 pieces from the museum. In December 2009, the museum was featured on the \\"Sunday Morning\\" program of CBS News. On November 8, 2010, Wagner became the first guest featured on Conan O'Brien's late-night television program on TBS, Conan. The Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum has received favorable reception in the book You Know You're in Washington When..., where the authors recommended it as the best location to learn about the art and engineering of nutcrackers. Wagner's book The Art and Character of Nutcrackers was also given positive mention in the book. Wagner was consulted as a resource for the book Nutcracker Nation. Authors Ken and Dahlynn McKowen recommended the museum in their book Best of Oregon & Washington's Mansions Museums & More. History The curator of the museum is Arlene Wagner. Wagner (born 1925) founded the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum with her husband George in 1995, alternate link as a non-profit organization. Wagner had previously worked as a ballet instructor, and supervised productions of The Nutcracker. She learned ballet from Alexandra Danilova. The museum's website notes, \\"just as Clara in the ballet became entranced with the wooden figure with the big teeth, so did Arlene.\\" She started her collection of the toy soldiers as a child. During the 1960s, Wagner began to purchase various kinds of nutcrackers. The museum's building is of a Bavarian style and is of an area of 3,000 square feet; it is situated above Wagner's shop Nussknacker Haus, which sells nutcrackers. Assorted nutcrackers. In 2010, the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum contained over 6,000 nutcrackers similar to those, with some dating to the 16th century. Wagner came to be known as \\"the Nutcracker Lady\\". The Museum was featured on the NBC program Today in 2000. Arlene and George Wagner ceded their collection in 2001 to the National Heritage Foundation so that the museum would be maintained in the event of their deaths; however Arlene Wagner retained her position within the museum. David Evangelista favorably reviewed the museum in a piece for an A&E; Network special in 2003. In 2003 the museum had a collection of 3,028 artifacts. By 2007 the collection had grown to over 5,000 pieces. In 2010 it contained over 6,000 nutcrackers, including pieces from the 16th century. Nutcrackers are represented in the museum from 38 different countries. The museum contains the greatest amount of collected nutcrackers in the United States, including a nutcracker made in Germany that stands six feet tall. It was manufactured for Wagner by Karl Roppl from Oberammergau, Germany, and made from a solid piece of linden wood. A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD is one of the oldest in the museum ‚Äì it was discovered in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: \\"That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up ‚Äì very valuable 16th and 17th century ones.\\" In December 2009, Wagner and her museum were featured on the \\"Sunday Morning\\" program of CBS News. Judith Hole, a CBS News producer, discovered the museum through an online search, and got in touch with the curator for further research on the news piece. Journalist Rita Braver of CBS interviewed Wagner about the museum. A CBS camera crew filmed inside the museum and documented its collection. Wagner observed, \\"they took pictures and asked questions ‚Äì everything from the nutting stones that are supposedly from 4,000 to 8000 years old, clear up to the modern ones.\\" She noted of the CBS crew, \\"They were very interested in the old ones, and how the 'Nutcracker' ballet influenced the collecting of nutcrackers in America.\\" Wagner appeared as the first guest on the premiere of Conan O'Brien's TBS program Conan, on November 8, 2010. On his website, O'Brien had arranged an online survey of potential first guests with Wagner being listed on the website among candidates including Jack Nicholson, Pope Benedict XVI, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Vladimir Putin, and the Sultan of Brunei. During the poll, O'Brien posted to his Twitter account, \\"If the Nutcracker lady wins, I'm in trouble.\\" In an interview with KING-TV, Wagner replied, \\"Why would he be in trouble? I think I should do just fine on his show.\\" She noted the production staff of Conan had contacted her, \\"They just called us out of the blue.\\" She explained, \\"Many people think nutcrackers are just for Christmas but they're not.\\" Wagner stated she intended to present O'Brien with a gift of an Irish nutcracker from her collection. Reception Writing in You Know You're in Washington When..., Sharon Wootton and Maggie Savage characterize the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum as, \\"The best place in America to admire nutcracker mechanics, art, and creativity\\". The authors write of Wagner's book The Art and Character of Nutcrackers, \\"It shows the breadth of construction styles and materials, often capturing the cultural milieu behind each nutcracker's form.\\" Wagner's work is used as a reference in the book Nutcracker Nation by Jennifer Fisher. The museum is recommended in the book Best of Oregon & Washington's Mansions Museums & More. Authors Ken and Dahlynn McKowen note, \\"This is a fun museum in a fun town.\\" Arlene Wagner is regarded as a \\"national authority\\" on the subject of nutcrackers.

Government The church was established as a chapelry of the Anglo-Saxon minster of St. Mary's, Bampton. Later in the Anglo-Saxon era Langford was elevated to a minster with its own dependent chapels at Grafton and Radcot. Both chapels are long gone, but Grafton and Radcot hamlets remain parts of Langford's ecclesiastical parish. Langford was part of the Diocese of Lincoln until the Diocese of Oxford was established under Henry VIII in 1541. Despite becoming part of the new diocese, Langford remained a prebend of Lincoln Cathedral until 1848, when the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840 ceded all prebendal estates in England to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The church at Langford was formerly dedicated to St. Mary. It was later rededicated to its current patron, St. Matthew. The parish is now part of the Benefice of Shill Valley and Broadshire, which includes also the parishes of Alvescot, Black Bourton, Broadwell, Broughton Poggs, Filkins, Holwell, Kelmscott, Kencot, Little Faringdon, Shilton and Westwell. Anglo-Saxon building Headless rood of Christ, possibly 8th century, on east wall of south porch 10th century rood of Christ, St. Mary and St. John on south gable of south porch 11th century lancet windows and relief on the south wall of the tower The oldest parts of the present church at Langford are the bell tower and nave, which were built in the second half of the 11th century. They may post-date the Norman conquest of England, but they are very high quality work by Anglo-Saxon masons and are the most important Anglo-Saxon remains in Oxfordshire. The north and south aisles were added in about 1200 and the south porch in the 13th century, all in the Early English Gothic style. The west walls of the nave and two aisles each have a 13th- century lancet window. At one time the porch had two storeys. The upper storey has since been removed, but its blocked doorway and the outline of its stairs are still visible inside the south aisle. The porch includes two Anglo-Saxon stone rood reliefs, but they are repositioned and their original sites are not known. The one on the east wall of the porch is 8th century and has lost its head. The one on the south gable of the porch is 10th century and has been assembled with Christ's left and right arms swapped over and the figures of Saint Mary and Saint John the Evangelist also transposed. Later additions In the 13th century the chancel was rebuilt wider and taller. The line of the former 11th century Anglo-Saxon roof against the east wall of the tower can be seen at the west end of the chancel. The concave lozenge at the top of each of the chancel windows is a highly unusual feature for the 13th century. The elaborate aumbry in the north wall of the chancel, with six compartments under three gables, is also unusual and suggests that it was a rich parish at the time. Most of the windows of the north wall of the north aisle and south wall of the south aisle are 14th or 15th century Decorated Gothic or Perpendicular Gothic additions. The present font is 15th century. In 1574 two flying buttresses were added to the north side of the north aisle. The more westerly of the two bears an inscription giving the date in the reign of Elizabeth I. A pair of tall, cylindrical pinnacles at the west end of the nave, surmounting the late Norman pilaster buttresses on the west gable wall, were also added in the 16th century. The pulpit is Jacobean, made in 1673. A clock was installed in the latter part of the 17th century but is now a static exhibit in the south aisle. Restoration and conservation The architect and builder Richard Pace restored the building in 1829. Further repairs were recommended by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners' surveyor Benjamin Ferrey in 1848 and undertaken the following year. The Gothic Revival architect Ewan Christian restored the nave roof to its original pitch in 1864. St. Matthew's is now a Grade I listed building. Bells The tower has a ring of six bells. Four were cast in 1741 by Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire, who at the time had a bell-foundry at Witney. The tenor and treble bells were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1953.

Designed to optimize busy production environments with high volumes of content traffic, TACTIC applies business or workflow logic to combined database and file system management. Using elements of digital asset management, production asset management and workflow management, TACTIC tracks the creation and development of digital assets through production pipelines. TACTIC is available under both commercial and open-source licenses, and also as a hosted cloud service through Amazon Web Services Marketplace. History TACTIC began in 2005 in computer graphics (CG) production, providing visual effects (VFX), film, animation, post production and video game development studios with a way to manage the digital files used in production. The platform has since expanded into providing software solutions at the enterprise level, and is now being used to help marketing groups, creative ad agencies, consumer product teams and transportation corps, among others, manage files, projects, resources and workflows. Current TACTIC users include Adidas, Technicolor, Transunion, Teague, Tegna, General Dynamics, Procter and Gamble, Bell Digital Media, Nissan North America, Astral Media, Ubisoft, Blohm + Voss, Saatchi and Saatchi, Lockheed Martin, and Legend3D. Prior to version 3.8, TACTIC was only available commercially. In the summer of 2012 current CEO, David Lowe and Remko Noteboom (CTO) followed in the footsteps of Red Hat, Acquia and Blender and made the leap into open-source, releasing TACTIC for free download on August 20, 2012 under the OSI-approved Eclipse Public License. TACTIC's software became available for free download, while Southpaw shifted focus to custom solutions and professional support services. According to CEO Mundell, TACTIC's general-purpose nature was a key component of Southpaw's decision to go open-source: \\"Every company has its own unique workflow,\\" he says, \\"and needs a foundational product like ours to support that workflow.\\" TACTIC is now developed and maintained by an open community of thousands of active users. Key features =Web framework= TACTIC is a web-based platform or framework for delivering enterprise data- driven HTML5 applications. It uses a hierarchical drawing engine to deliver self-contained HTML5 widgets to a browser. Each widget is an encapsulated bundle of HTML, JavaScript, CSS (cascading style sheets) and server-side Python code. Widgets can contain other widgets, and can be dynamically loaded through AJAX. TACTIC also includes tools that allow it to deliver branded customized widgets or themes. By coupling standard web technologies with TACTIC's asset management and ability to handle complex data models, TACTIC can be used to deliver enterprise applications to any device with a browser. TACTIC also uses standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS and AJAX to make the customization process easy and accessible. An embedded expression language provides simplified access to complex data models without having to build up large SQL statements. Reviewers write that TACTIC's key strengths are its strong workflow capabilities and its suitability for managing large volumes of production assets, especially big files. Features of TACTIC include a flexible data model, a visual workflow designer, powerful API connectivity and an adaptable plug-in architecture. =Workflow management= TACTIC organizes workflows through pipelines, production command chains that grant users the ability to define discrete processes within a workflow. In each process, files can be checked in and versioned, tasks created, notes added and triggers responding to events in the process executed. Users can also configure their workflows to assign arbitrary metadata, send notifications and update the status of projects. TACTIC's trigger system allows custom business logic to be attached to any event in the system, including every data change and file check-in. =File system management= TACTIC deploys several technologies to manage its file systems: strict file naming conventions, check-in/out or gatekeeper/librarian function, and versioning. First TACTIC breaks up all the business entities into assets. In the TACTIC world, a user works on assets, or more specifically on some part of the process in the workflow that produces assets. Assets are organized into \\"types of searchable assets\\", or \\"sTypes\\" in TACTIC terminology. This configuration provides a space or sandbox for a user to do his or her work. The sandbox is generally a freeform area designated by TACTIC where a user can create and manage his or her files. When the work evolves to a stage where it requires an external review or is ready to be pushed on to the next process, the user checks in his or her files. This check-in process hands files off to TACTIC, which acts as a gatekeeper to the repository where all the files are kept. TACTIC also acts as a librarian, sorting the files it receives into the appropriate location in the repository. If specified by the system, file names will also be renamed accordingly to make their locations more identifiable (a function cognate to card cataloguing). TACTIC's automated file management system ensures that files are uniformly named and appear in predictable and reliable locations, effectively eliminating human error in the repository. =Data management= TACTIC's data management strategy is rooted in its flexible data model, which makes no assumptions about structure or file type. Instead, the TACTIC framework adapts to any type of file, including audio, video, graphic and enterprise content. Data models can either be built in TACTIC or TACTIC can be mapped onto a pre- existing data model. This capability allows TACTIC to provide an updated web interface for legacy systems with critical data. Instead of relying on classifications based on file type, TACTIC manages data by defining an overall \\"schema\\" for each project. Each schema contains sTypes (\\"types of searchable assets\\"), with each type representing a different category or classification of entities. This structure is largely arbitrary but can follow good database table design. TACTIC can also access multiple databases simultaneously, regardless of platform. TACTIC projects can view databases from multiple disparate locations, including Oracle, MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQLServer, and unify the user experience. TACTIC's built-in expression language simplifies the process of extracting data from the database, making the overall system much easier to navigate. It provides an interface that removes the complexity of reiterating relationships on every query inherent in SQL. TACTIC's expression language is particularly useful in scenarios with complex enterprise data models where deep relationships between tables must be navigated in order to retrieve and operate on the data. Support platforms and environments TACTIC is written almost entirely in Python programming language and will run on most platforms where Python is available. This includes Windows, OS X and the various Unix flavours and distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.). TACTIC is one of the largest projects written in Python, clocking in at 198949 lines of code. \\"TACTIC Team\\" is a self-contained stand-alone version of TACTIC that runs on SQLite and embeds the Python language and required modules, as well as Cherrypy for web service. It is distributed with an installer and is executable for both Windows and OS X.

Biography Fouchier was born in Bergen op Zoom. Houbraken remarked that his father was a Frenchman who had come to visit the Netherlands for the Siege of Calais in 1596 and stayed for the Siege of Ostend (1601‚Äì1603). The fighting lasted so long that the elder Fouchier had time to fall in love with a young heiress from Bergen op Zoom and he settled there after the war. Bartram de Fouchier biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature When the young Bartram came of age, he wanted to learn painting, so his father sent him to Antwerp to study with Anthony van Dyck. He learned to paint a good portrait there, but since this was the period that Van Dyck had very little time for pupils, Fouchier left his workshop and travelled to Utrecht in 1634 to study with Jan van Bijlert, where he stayed for two years. He first returned home to Bergen op Zoom, but then he left again to make a Grand Tour to Italy, where in Rome he was accused of heresy together with his companion Jan van Isendoorn. They fled to Florence, where they stayed a short while before leaving for Paris, and shortly after that to Antwerp, where they parted company forever. Fauchier returned to Bergen op Zoom and at first tried to make a living at painting in the manner of Tintoretto, but he had more success with genre pieces in the manner of Adriaen Brouwer. He was buried in the Grote Kerk of Bergen op Zoom. According to the RKD, he was trained by Jan van Bijlert and traveled to Italy with Jan van Isendoorn.Bartram de Fouchier in the RKD References Category:1609 births Category:1673 deaths Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:People from Bergen op Zoom ","title":"Bartram de Fouchier"},{"id":"29531703","text":"Franziska Pigulla (6 May 1964 ‚Äì 23 February 2019) was a German actress, news presenter and voice actress.

It is the oldest zoo in Poland, having been opened in 1865 as the Breslau Zoological Garden while the city was part of Prussia. It is also the largest (in terms of the number of animals) zoo in Poland. The zoo covers in downtown Wroc≈Çaw. It is home to about 10,500 animals representing about 1,132 species. In terms of the number of animal species it is the third largest zoological garden in the world.Wielkie liczenie w zoo we Wroc≈Çawiu. Zobacz, ile zwierzƒÖt w nim mieszka The Wroc≈Çaw Zoo is the most visited zoo in Poland and the fifth most visited zoo in Europe. The zoo is an accredited member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). History The beginnings of the zoo date back to 1863 when the decision to establish a zoological garden in Breslau was made at the initiative of a local community. The city authorities designated 9 hectares of land by the Oder River for the purposes of building the zoo, and on 10 July 1865, the grand opening ceremony of the new complex took place, accompanied by a fireworks display, and a military orchestra. The zoo was in possession of 452 animals representing 50 species. The first visitors could see such animals as wolves, monkeys, bears and big cats. In the first year of its existence, the zoo was visited by approximately 67,000 people. Neon logo of the Zoo The zoo enjoyed considerable popularity among the inhabitants of Breslau despite a relatively limited variety of animals to be seen. The first elephant was bought in as late as 1873. It was an Indian elephant named Theodor and was transported from the London Zoo. It instantly became one of the biggest attractions of the zoo in Breslau. In later years, the garden also acquired such animals as an anteater, eared seals, and penguins. Among other favourite animals of the zoo were chimpanzee Moritz and gorilla Pussy which arrived in the city in 1897 from Liverpool. A commemorative statue devoted to her can still be found to this day in the Wroc≈Çaw Zoo. One of the biggest breeding successes of the zoo was the birth of the first in the world Malayan tapir, and in the Interwar period a hippopotamus named Anton. The zoo could also boast Muschi, the only manatee in Europe, which died in the winter of 1945. The feeding of a brown fur seal at the Wroc≈Çaw zoo After the First World War, the zoo was forced to close due to an economic crisis, and the animals had to be transferred to other zoological gardens in Germany, mostly to Berlin, Leipzig and Cologne. The area of the former zoo was turned into a large park. In 1927, the zoological garden reopened and operated up until 1945. During the siege of Festung Breslau, most of the animals were killed and the remaining ones were sent to other zoos located in a number of Polish cities including Pozna≈Ñ, Krak√≥w and ≈Å√≥d≈∫. After the Second World War, the plans to rebuild the zoo were drawn and one of the main initiators of this project was zoologist Stanis≈Çaw Kulczy≈Ñski from the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. In 1947, Karol ≈Åukaszewicz, who previously worked at the Krak√≥w Zoo, was appointed the first Polish director of the zoo that was soon to be reopened. He played a key role in rebuilding the ruined zoo, bringing back the animals that were taken away from the zoo as well as acquiring new ones. On 18 July 1948, the Wroc≈Çaw zoo was ceremonially opened. At that time, it possessed 224 animals representing 72 species, including wolves, bears, wild boars, baboons, a camel, bisons, parrots and a South American tapir. By the end of 1948, the zoo was visited by 365,000 people. In the following years, it was expanded by 15 hectares, which allowed to increase the number of animals that the zoo could exhibit. A giraffe at the Wroc≈Çaw Zoo and the Centennial Hall in the background In the second half of the 20th century, the Wroc≈Çaw zoo achieved a great success thanks to a popular TV show With A Camera Among Animals (Polish: \\"Z kamerƒÖ w≈õr√≥d zwierzƒÖt\\") hosted by Hanna and Antoni Gucwi≈Ñski, who in 1966 became the director of the zoo. The programme ran for more than three decades on TVP Channel (ending in 2001) and contributed to turning the Wroc≈Çaw Zoo into the most popular zoo in Poland. In 2006, Rados≈Çaw Ratajszczak, previously working at the Pozna≈Ñ Zoo, became the new director of the zoo and initiated an extensive programme of investments. New pavilions and enclosures were built, including the ones for rhinoceroses, and lynxes. The Seal Centre was constructed as well as the Odrarium building. However, the biggest and most successful investment was the building of Africarium, an oceanarium specially designed to feature the fauna of Africa which opened in 2014. The building is home to such species as rays, sandbar sharks, Nile crocodiles, hippopotamuses, manatees, speckled mousebirds, hadada ibises, hamerkops, and African grey hornbills. It attracted even more visitors and made it the most frequently visited zoo in Poland with an annual number of visitors amounting to around 2 million. Attractions and activities The zoo includes among others: the Africarium (the only oceanarium of its kind which focuses exclusively on the fauna of Africa), the Madagascar Pavilion, the Odrarium, Terrarium, Zoolandia ropes course, Children's Zoo, the Ranch, as well as food and drinks outlets. Moreover, it houses a collection of a number of rare and exotic species such as manatee, okapi, bear cuscus, red hartebeest, Philippine mouse-deer, L'Hoest's monkey, and long-necked turtle. The zoo also actively participates in a number of initiatives and support programmes aimed at rescuing endangered species, sends zoo workers on rescue missions, runs open meetings such as ZOO na ratunek (\\"Zoo to the Rescue\\") and offers a variety of educational activities for children and teens. The zoo's breeding program has also had a number of major successes, which include the births of Pygmy hippopotamus in 2010 and 2012, Philippine scops owl (the only one in the world outside of the Philippines), reticulated giraffe in 2012 as well as the first in the world Sulawesi bear cuscus in 2018.

This album was Mathis's first non-holiday release since his 1956 debut that didn't make an appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's chart.. Ol√© was released for the first time on compact disc on November 16, 2012, as one of two albums on one CD, the other album being the previous Mathis LP, This Is Love. Both were also included in Sony's Mathis box set The Complete Global Albums Collection, which was released on November 17, 2014. History Mathis described his degree of interest in this project in the liner notes on the back cover of the original album. \\"'I love everything about Latin American music: the rhythms, the melodies, the sentiment and the passion. There is no music I would rather listen to ‚Äì no music I would rather sing.'\\"(1964) Ol√© by Johnny Mathis [album jacket]. New York: Mercury Records SR-60988.

New York: Sony Music Entertainment RGM-0095. The interview elicited many anecdotes regarding the selections for this album, including the two songs that originated in Orfeu Negro (Black Orpheus), \\"Manh√£ de Carnaval (Morning of the Carnival)\\" and \\"Samba de Orfeu\\". \\"'I remember I got so excited when a friend of mine took me to see Black Orpheus, whose music was written by Luiz Bonf√°. His music just blew me away, and I tried to repeat that wonderful opening with the drums going and the voice over the top. Allyn [Ferguson] did the arrangement, and he just mostly transcribed what we heard on the soundtrack.'\\" Mathis also recalls a bit of Ferguson's personality in the studio. \\"'The children on the songs were some of Allyn's children and some from a little grammar school in the [San Fernando] Valley. And Allyn was a tyrant with those kids. They were scared to death of him. But those songs just stay with you forever.'\\" Other recollections involve Connie Cox, his voice teacher during his teenage years in San Francisco. \\"'\\"Granada\\" is one of my all-time favorites because at the time I was still under the spell of my voice teacher and wanted to do something for her ‚Äì all the high notes ‚Äì and we got them all in.'\\" Cox introduced her pupil to another selection here: the first three suites of \\"Bachianas Brasileiras\\" by Heitor Villa-Lobos. \\"'That‚Äôs a vocal exercise‚Ä¶I used to do with Connie. She never dreamed I would record them, but I did mostly because I was under the influence of Allyn Ferguson, who was a typical jazz guy with everything ad-libbed. And he would go, \\"No, man‚Ä¶c'mon, let‚Äôs do it.\\" That's about the way that came about.'\\" A phone interview with WQED-FM's Bryan Sejvar, however, revealed how critical Mathis was of his \\"Bachianas Brasileiras\\" recording. When Sejvar said, \\"You even had some Villa- Lobos on a, uh, Ol√© album of yours\\", Mathis chuckles, \\"Oh-ha-oh, that! Oh, my gosh! I gave it my best shot, but I listen to it once in a while and go, 'Achhh!'\\" He was kinder to himself in the liner notes of The Complete Global Albums Collection, where he wrote, \\"If I were to do the piece today, I'd probably rest my voice between the various parts, but when I recorded it that wasn't the case.

At present it contains the single species Margaretbarromyces dictyosporus. The genus is solely known from the Eocene aged, Appian Way deposits on Vancouver Island. Margaretbarromyces is one of only three known fossil fungus species found on Vancouver Island and the most recent to be described from the Appian Way strata. The agaricomycete Quatsinoporites cranhamii was described from a Cretaceous fossil and Appianoporites vancouverensis, from the same deposits as Margaretbarromyces were jointly described in a 2004 research paper. History and classification The genus Margaretbarromyces is known only from the single holotype, a complete ascoma like fungus fruiting body. The specimen, AW 400 Htop 0-12, is currently residing in the paleobotanical collections housed by the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The specimen was collected south of the Campbell River on the eastern shore of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The fungus specimen was preserved in a calcareous nodule recovered from a silty mudstone matrix. The nodules formed in a shallow marine environment along with abundant plant material. It was first studied by a group of researchers consisting of Randal Mindell, Randolph Currah and Ruth Stockey, from the University of Alberta and Graham Beard of the Vancouver Island Paleontology Museum, Qualicum Beach, British Columbia. Mindell and colleagues published their 2007 type description in the journal Mycological Research volume 111. The generic epithet Margaretbarromyces was coined from a recognition of Margaret Barr for here research on the loculoascomycete fungi and \\"myces\\" to reflect that it is a fungus. The specific epithet \\"dictyosporus\\" was coined to reflect the condition of the ascospores. When first described Margaretbarromyces dictyosporus was the most recent fungus species to be described from Vancouver Island. Cryptodidymosphaerites princetonensis and Palaeoserenomyces allenbyensis were the first fossil fungi to be described from British Columbia, known only from the Early Eocene Allenby Formation near Princeton, B.C.. Quatsinoporites cranhamii a Cretaceous age agaricomycete from the western coast of Vancouver Island and Appianoporites vancouverensis, also from the Appian Way site, were described in the same 2004 paper. With is publication three years later, Margaretbarromyces was the fifth fossil fungus described from British Columbia. Description The holotype of Margaretbarromyces is a lone ascoma like fruiting body 390 Œºm in diameter by 420 Œºm in height in bark of an unidentified seed plant, which was transported by water before preservation in a calcareous nodule. The ascoma is composed of high branching and complex anastomosed hyphae. The interior chamber of the ascoma, filled with calcite, preserves several asci and a number of ascospores. Though the asci are faint the groupings of ascospores are well preserved showing the placement of the asci to be basal. Each ascospore is between 55-90 Œºm and dictyosporous. The specimen was studied by cutting the calcareous nodule into slices with a rock saw and using the cellulose acetate peel technique to create slides that were examined under stereo microscope. With its distinct basal asci placement and dictyosporous ascospores, combined with the ascoma growing within existing tissues, Margaretbarromyces distinct from known genera. Though several other fungal orders have some similar characters the particular grouping found in Margaretbarromyces is closest to members of the Pleosporales. Placement at the family level is uncertain due to the fluctuating nature of the family descriptions.

Carmen and Gabby clash about their daughters and Carmen accuses Gabby of spoiling Juanita and calls her a bad mother. In revenge, Gabby seeks out Bob's legal advice about turning in undocumented immigrants. After discovering that she can legally have Carmen deported but leave Grace with her, as Grace is an American citizen, she calls immigration and tells them of Carmen's whereabouts. However, when the immigration services arrive to arrest Carmen, Gabrielle feels guilty when she sees how much Grace loves Carmen. To make up for her mistake, she poses as Carmen in order to allow Carmen enough time to escape. However, now that Carlos and Gabrielle's home is no longer a safe haven for Carmen and Grace, as Gaby had lied to a government service and used her home to harbor immigrants, Carmen and Grace must leave for Texas immediately. Gaby, Carlos, Grace and Carmen have an emotional farewell and Carmen and Gaby reconcile. Bree, meanwhile, is oblivious to Keith's plans to propose to her and invites his dad along with the pair of them on numerous dates in order to help him overcome his depression ever since being separated from Keith's mother. However, whilst on a date Bree encounters an old friend who she sets Keith's dad up with. However, she turns out to be less than stable and the date ends badly, when the engagement ring Keith arranged to be placed in the starter course is unveiled amidst all the chaos. Keith is upset with everyone, including Bree, for ruining his engagement plans. Bree goes to Keith's apartment but finds his father, Richard, there, who implies that Bree should be with him instead. Lynette and Tom are caught in the opening sequence having sex in the nursery by Susan. Susan comments about how large Tom's manhood is, which Tom overhears. However, Tom feels that when discussing Tom with her friends, Lynette does not place enough emphasis on his good, masculine qualities and that she only focuses on the negatives. This disagreement culminates in the homeowners' association meeting with Lynette going into a tirade about just how masculine Tom really is in an exaggerated and patronizing way. It is later revealed that Lynette only ever mentions Tom's negative attributes because she is always being told by the other women how great a guy Tom really is and that she only focuses on his negative qualities as an attempt to forget that she isn't really worthy of him. Paul Young unveils his plan to build a halfway house for released convicts on Wisteria Lane, realizing that it will de-value his neighbors' property. Throughout the season he has been acquiring numerous properties on the lane. This enables him to bring the homeowners association vote on the rehabilitation center to a deadlock as there are only 15 votes and Paul has 7. In an attempt to pit his neighbors against one another he offers numerous neighbors financial incentives to sell their homes to him in order to secure a majority. This causes those proposed to think about his offer, while those who were not to condemn those who were thinking about it. Lynette tells him he will not be able to destroy the community, to which Paul responds: \\"I don't have to. You're going to do it yourselves.\\".

On February 18 of 2011, the band made its debut performance at Finnish Metal Expo.http://www.fme.fi/?sivu=ohjelma The band released its only album, In Paradisum, in March 2011.  History  After touring together as members of Stratovarius and Angra, guitarist Timo Tolkki and vocalist Andre Matos became good friends. When Matos moved to Sweden, Tolkki called him and told him he had some song ideas he would like to show him. On the condition of being part of the songwriting process but not of the managing duties due to his other activities, Matos flew to Helsinki and started working on the songs, though at that time they didn't know if those songs would be used in a band, or a project or anything alike. Tolkki then completed the team with other musicians who were living in the Nordic countries back then: bassist Jari Kainulainen, keyboardist Mikko H√§rkin and drummer Uli Kusch. Months later, the five musicians met in Helsinki and started rehearsing. By October 2011 last news were that drummer Uli Kusch officially left the band to continue recovering from his nerve damage which made it impossible for him to play drums for a year. The band did a tour in South America (mostly in Brazil) and would start to record a new album subsequently. By December 2011, Timo Tolkki announced in his official Facebook page that he would probably never record anything again (he later announced he would return to music with his new project, Avalon).

It was first published in the Netherlands in 1978 under the title De Heksentuin, and was distributed in the United States by McGraw-Hill the following year. Plot summary A group of children pass a little brick house on their way home from school each day. Trees cast ominous looking shadows upon an unruly, overgrown garden. The children believe the elderly woman who inhabits the house is a witch. In an attempt to frighten her, they create a monster costume from various household items they have collected. Their performance compels the woman to come outside and the children scramble in search of hiding places. She thanks them for the entertainment and invites them inside for a visit. Although the children are wary, they follow her into the kitchen. While the children fill their bellies with pancakes the woman has made for them, she recounts her girlhood encounters with a mysterious circus populated by elves and fairies. After they have finished their meal, the woman takes the children for a walk to a nearby pond. Much to their disbelief and amazement, they are introduced to some of the woman's otherworldly friends. When the children depart, they are unsure as to whether the day's events really took place or if they were imagined. However, they each return to their homes with a renewed sense of wonder and a newfound respect and fondness for the woman. About the author Lidia Postma was born in Hoorn, the Netherlands in 1952. She is the author and/or illustrator of many children's books as well as adult's fantasy books.

RWE Npower Renewables (now: Innogy) were awarded the lease to the development area in 2003. The offshore elements of the wind farm of up to 1200MW power gained planning consent in 2013; RWE reduced the scope of the wind farm to 900MW or under in 2014, to reduce cost per MW. Statkraft became joint owner of the development in early 2015. The onshore and offshore electrical connection assets were given planning permission in September 2016. The Project is now owned by Innogy (59%), J-Power (24%) and Kansai Electric Power (16%). History The project was initially developed by RWE Npower Renewables, who was awarded the 'Triton Knoll' development area by the Crown Estate in 2003. The original development was refined, extending north outside the original area, with the boundaries of the area defined by the avoidance of main shipping routes. In 2008 the developer accepted an offer from National Grid for an onshore grid connection at Bicker Fen, with landfall made at Mumby. Later the connection offer was withdrawn by National Grid due to a re-assessment of their planning. By 2011 the two parties had agreed on a connection at Bicker Fen. However, due to uncertainty over the final state of the Bicker Fen substation, in 2011 the developer split the planning applications into separate offshore wind farm and electrical system applications, to minimise delay. A planning application for the offshore elements was submitted in early 2012. The formal developer was Triton Knoll Offshore Wind Farm Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of RWE Npower Renewables -they applied for a wind farm of in size off the North Norfolk and Lincolnshire coast in the southern North Sea; the development area was cut in two by a NE/SW running pipeline channel of width. The proposed wind farm would be of up to 1200MW capacity, with turbines foundations in water with depth of . The planning application included the offshore structures, but excluded the undersea export cable, and onshore electrical infrastructure. In July 2013 the government approved the plan for a wind farm of up to 288 turbines with up to 1200MW generating capacity, with associated meteorological masts, offshore substations, and connecting cabling, with wind turbines limited to tip height, rotor height, and rotor diameter. Additionally pile driving was not permitted during the Herring spawning season (September to mid October), without prior permission. In January 2014 the developer RWE announced that it had chosen to progress with a reduced plan of between 600 and 900 MW power, in order to reduce the cost (per MW) of the development. In February 2015 Statkraft acquired a 50% stake in the project. In late 2015 Statkraft announced it would no longer be investing in offshore wind, but would continue with the development at Triton Knoll. In April 2015 the developers submitted their planning application for the electrical power export system. HVAC was identified as the preferred method of electrical power export; HVDC and mixed HVDC/HVAC systems were considered but HVDC was rejected primarily on cost grounds, with the export cable length not sufficiently long to justify a HVDC system. Overhead lines were rejected on environmental impact grounds. A landfall at or near Anderby Creek was identified as likely, An intermediate electric compound (IEC) use to regulate the reactive power of the AC cables, and a preferred site was selected to the west of Skegness Stadium. A final substation site at or near Double Twelve Groves northwest of the Bicker Fen connection, and adjacent east of the South Forty Drain was shortlisted as the preferred option. Offshore and onshore export cables were to be energised at up to 220kV for a connection at Bicker Fen at 400kV. The proposed onshore cable route consisted of around of underground cable - a number of interested parties raised concerns about the cable route and windfarm: farmers and the NFU raised concerns about its affects on drainage; and Lincoln City Council claimed the development would have a negative affect of tourism; Lincolnshire County Council raised concerns about the combined environmental impact of the onshore link together with the Viking Link electrical connector to Denmark. The electrical grid connection including onshore and offshore cabling was given planning permission in September 2016. If constructed the wind farm is estimated (2015) to represent a total investment of ¬£3-4 billion. Construction Initial onshore construction started in 2018, with main construction of the substation and cable route planned for late summer 2018. Construction of the cable route commenced in September 2018, with work on the substation set to start in early 2019.https://www.offshorewind.biz/2018/09/10/triton-knoll-onshore-works- start/http://www.tritonknoll.co.uk/triton-knoll-officially-starts-onshore- construction/ Offshore construction began in January 2020, with first foundation installed on 22 January 2020 by the Seaway 7‚Äôs Strashnov vessel. All the turbine foundations and export cables had been completed by August 2020, with the first turbine planned to be installed in early 2021.

City Theater produces and hosts theater, dance and music performances year-round and aims to, ‚Äúfoster an appreciation for the performing arts by using creative avenues to increase community involvement.‚Äù Biddeford‚Äôs City Theater: Board of Directors City Theater is part of the Biddeford City Hall complex, designed by Maine architect John Calvin Stevens in 1895. The building is included on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a contributing element to the Biddeford Main Street Historic District. Theater history Biddeford's City Theater originally opened as an opera house in October 1860 at its present Main Street location as a part of the Biddeford City Hall complex. The opera house enjoyed a high level of popularity in the Biddeford and Southern Maine region until burning down December 30, 1894. Whether to rebuild the opera house was debated, the city eventually settled on rebuilding a more structurally sound opera house.Biddeford City Theater: History Architect John Calvin Stevens was chosen to design the new city hall and opera house, which opened January 20, 1896. The opera house again became a favorite site for cultural and entertainment attractions. Through to the 1920s it brought vaudeville, minstrel shows, illustrated songs, dramatic performances and even community pageants and plays to the Southern Maine community. The introduction of talkies in 1928 began the transition from opera house to movie theater. In 1955, ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù to its interior were made, including panelling of the lobby and its staircase and addition poster displays and a cinemascope screen. The name of the opera house was at this time officially changed to Biddeford's City Theater. However, with the increased popularity of drive-ins and television, City Theater had closed its doors by 1963 and remained closed until 1978. In the interim, Biddeford's City Theater was used as a storage facility for the city and, at one point, a horse-shoe pit, complete with a pile of sand dumped in the orchestra pit. Ironically, also during this period, in 1973 Biddeford's City Theater was added to the National Register of Historical Places. In 1977, the newly incorporated City Theater Associates launched a campaign to renovate and re- open the opera house. Thus, a year later, the internationally popular Norman Luboff Choir opened for Biddeford's City Theater's first performance season in nearly 50 years. Though great improvements were made to its interior during the re-opening, City Theater was still in great need of restoration. It was not until the 1990s, when City Theater celebrated its centennial, that the theater received a full restoration. Funding was provided by local, state and federal governments along with private donations from local businesses and individuals. A new marquee, re-stenciling of the lobby and house walls and ceilings and new sound and lighting were among the improvements made. Present day Current renovations to Biddeford's City Theater include re- pointing the exterior brickwork and improving the stage floor and restrooms. City Theater currently runs a year-round season of theater, music and dance performances. Additionally, the theater has recently added community theater and youth opera and developed an ongoing relationship with the University of New England.

It may be within the resin or at the resin to fiberglass interface. The pad remains connected to the component (usually a Ball Grid Array, BGA) and leaves a \\"crater\\" on the surface of the printed circuit board. Overview Pad cratering most often occurs during dynamic mechanical events such as mechanical shock or board flexure due to In-circuit test (ICT), board depaneling, or connector insertion.http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Preventing-Pad- Cratering-During-ICT-Using- Sherlock.pdf?hsCtaTracking=95bec082-e4c1-40d3-a379-dfe6d7a5727a%7Ce96e5f51-abc5-4c7a-9a2e-28a78cb24e8e However, pad cratering has also been known to occur during thermal shock or even thermal cycling. Susceptibility to pad cratering can be impacted by several factors such as: PCB thickness, PCB laminate material properties, component size and stiffness, component location, and solder alloy selection among other factors.https://www.smtnet.com/library/files/upload/pad- cratering.pdf, PAD CRATERING: THE INVISIBLE THREAT TO THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, Presented by Jim Griffin, OEM Sales & Marketing Manage, Integral Technologyhttp://www.circuitinsight.com/pdf/test_method_pad_cratering_ipc.pdf, M. Ahmad, J. Burlingame, and C. Guirguis, Validated Test Method to Characterize and Quantify Pad Cratering Under BGA Pads on Printed Circuit Boards, Apex 2008. Testing IPC-9708 provides three test methods to characterize the pad cratering of a component and PCBA: pin pull, ball pull, and ball shear testing.IPC IPC-9708, Test Methods for Characterization of PCB Pad Cratering In the pin pull test a pin is soldered to pads and pulled until fracture. It is a useful test for all pad geometries and is sensitive to board design and materials. The ball pull test is specifically design for BGA components and has a large sensitivity to the solder alloy and joint formation. The ball shear test is also specified for BGA components and involves shearing the solder balls of the BGA. This test is typically the most convenient but is less sensitive to the design and material as compared to the ball pull test.D. Xie, D. Shangguan and H. Kroener, ‚ÄúPad Cratering Evaluation of PCB‚Äù, APEX 2010, Las Vegas, NA. Although IPC-9708 specifies procedures for each test type, the challenge is that no standard pass/fail criteria is defined. This is viewed as application-specific and must be defined by the user based on their design, environment, and reliability requirements. Another applicable test method is IPC/JEDEC-9702, which is a monotonic bend test method used to characterize board level interconnects.IPC/JEDEC-9702: Monotonic Bend Characterization of Board-Level Interconnects This can be relevant for pad cratering resulting from board flexure, however this test method is broader and does not specifically focus on pad cratering failure modes. Board level reliability testing is a common approach to assessing product reliability. Performing temperature cycling, mechanical drop/shock, and vibration testing is a good way to evaluate pad cratering. However, similar to IPC/JEDEC-9702, this can be cost and time intensive and does not specifically focus on pad cratering failure modes.Pad Cratering: Assessing Long Term Reliability Risks, Denis Barbini, Ph.D., AREA Consortium, http://www.meptec.org/Resources/23%20-%20Universal%20Instruments.pdf Detection and Failure Analysis Pad cratering can be difficult to detect during functional testing. This is especially the case with small or partial cracking that can escape testing and cause latent field failures.http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Webinar%20Slides%20for%20YouTube/Avoiding- Pad-Cratering-and-Cracked-Capacitor-Webinar.pdf Even if a component failure is identified, diagnosing the failure mode as pad cratering can be difficult. Conventional nondestructive testing and failure analysis techniques such as visual inspection and X-Ray microscopy may not detect the issue. Electrical characterization is an example of a nondestructive technique that can be useful, however this may not detect an anomaly if there is only partial cracking. Typically, pad cratering is detected or confirmed via destructive testing and failure analysis such as dye and pry, acoustic emissionsA New Approach for Early Detection of PCB Pad Cratering Failures, Anurag Bansal, Gnyaneshwar Ramakrishna and Kuo-Chuan Liu, Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4008/a780824029d65803614ff2badb23e31929de.pdf?_ga=2.178646691.640690740.1508535388-688246373.1508535388, cross sectioning, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Mitigation There are several mitigation techniques that can used to reduce the risk of pad cratering. The appropriate method(s) is often driven by design and resource constraints. Limiting Board Flexure: If cratering is due to mechanical overstress then limiting board flexure is typically the best mitigation technique. https://www.smta.org/chapters/files/uppermidwest_padcratering.pdf Simulation: Modeling and simulation can help proactively avoid pad cratering failures. Relevant examples include ICT failures or products with potential for large shock events (i.e. portable electronics). Finite Element Analysis can be done using a physics of failure approach to determine risk of overstress and pad cratering. This proactive approach can rapidly evaluate multiple designs early on, potentially avoiding expensive design changes or warranty costs later on. Underfill, Edge Bonding, and Corner Staking: Epoxies and underfill materials can be added to provide mechanical support and reduce board and solder strain during flexing. This is more common in cases where the component selection and PCBA design are fixed. There are differences between each technique which makes proper understanding of the environment and application important. Solder Alloy: Solder alloy selection can impact susceptibility to pad cratering. Typically, pad cratering is considered a high strain rate event with minimal creep, however there is still potential for plasticity in the solder. More compliant solders or those with lower yield points will reduce pad cratering potential by providing additional load sharing. Board Thickness and Laminate Material: Board thickness and laminate material properties such as Young‚Äôs modulus and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) will impact susceptibility to pad cratering. Board Redesign: If pad cratering persists then a redesign may be required. This could include changing component location or adjusting between solder mask defined (SMD) and non-solder mask defined (NSMD) pads.

Works such as ‚Äò‚ÄôPeter and the Wolf‚Äô‚Äô and Saint-Sa√´ns‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄôCarnival of the Animals‚Äô‚Äô were performed, with celebrity participants including Ray Bradbury, Victor Borge, Hans Conreid, Peter Ustinov and Sam Jaffe donating their services as narrators. In Benjamin Britten‚Äôs opera ‚Äò‚ÄôNoye‚Äôs Fludde‚Äô‚Äô, children from the audience participated. The orchestra also gave special concerts at Juvenile Hall and for the disabled. Initially called ‚ÄúThe Temianka Little Symphony,‚Äù in 1961 the orchestra became the California Chamber Symphony (CCS). It was the first true chamber orchestra in Los Angeles. While based at Royce Hall, UCLA, the group toured the United States and Canada extensively, as well as Hong Kong, and was featured in special television programs on KCET and KNBC. The orchestra gave over 100 concerts during a span of some three decades. In addition to the baroque and classical literature, the CCS performed major works by such famous modern composers as Aaron Copland, Darius Milhaud, Dmitri Shostakovich, Malcolm Arnold and Carlos Chavez; many of these were West Coast premieres. In 1962 the great violinist David Oistrakh performed the Beethoven, the Brahms and the Bach E Major concertos with the CCS, and as an encore joined Temianka to play the Bach ‚Äò‚ÄôDouble Concerto‚Äô‚Äô. Other soloists who appeared with the CCS under Temianka‚Äôs direction included Jean-Pierre Rampal, Henryk Szeryng, Leonard Pennario and Benny Goodman. Temianka once joined violist William Primrose to perform Mozart‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄôSinfonia Concertante‚Äô‚Äô, and on another occasion played viola in that piece with Isaac Stern. Temianka broke tradition by speaking to his audiences from the stage about the music and composers. (At one of the orchestra's first concerts, music critics in the audience walked out!) For this reason the concert series was titled ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk Music‚Äù for some years. He was responsible for the first appearances of many rising musicians such as Christopher Parkening, Jeffrey Kahane, Nathaniel Rosen, Timothy Landauer and Daniel Heifetz, and sponsored the Romero family of four guitarists from Spain (The Romero Guitar Quartet). In later years the California Chamber Virtuosi, an offshoot of the CCS in 1976, gave concerts at the J. Paul Getty museum in Malibu, at Pepperdine University, and at the Taper Forum in Los Angeles. The City and County of Los Angeles repeatedly issued proclamations honoring the CCS. Its last performance was given on Sunday, December 9, 1990.

It originally aired on November 24, 2010 on ABC. The episode was written by Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh and was directed by Michael Spiller. In the episode, Mitchell tries to tell Cameron how he feels uncomfortable with his mom, Barb Tucker. Meanwhile, Haley breaks up with Dylan much to Phil's dismay. Jay has a little stomach ache gets exacerbated when he and Manny look it up on the internet. \\"Mother Tucker\\" received mixed reviews from critics with Joel Keller of TV Squad calling it \\"among the weakest of the season, if not the weakest\\". According to the Nielsen Media Research, the episode received a significant drop from the previous episode due to it airing the night before Thanksgiving. Nolan Gould does not appear in the episode.\\"Modern Family\\" Mother Tucker (TV episode 2010) - IMDb. Retrieved December 10, 2012. Plot The episode begins with Haley (Sarah Hyland) taking tutoring lessons with a smart boy named David (Thomas Kasp). Claire (Julie Bowen) and Alex (Ariel Winter) soon leave the house before Claire realizes she left her shopping list. When she arrives back in the house she finds Haley making out with David. Haley decides it may be time to break up with Dylan (Reid Ewing), which she does through a text message, a decision everyone agrees with except for Phil (Ty Burrell). Phil decides that Dylan might need someone to lean on so he and Dylan decide to get Phil a guitar and drink at a juice bar. Haley initially thinks he's on a date with a girl (because of Phil's sweat jacket, which is very feminine) and wants him back. Unfortunately, Dylan says he needs some time \\"dating Dylan\\", making both her and Phil sad. At the Pritchett house, Jay (Ed O'Neill) is having a stomachache. Manny (Rico Rodriguez) constantly asks Jay about the symptoms and fills them in into a medical website. Jay worries he might have a serious problem. However, Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) initially dismisses it because in Colombia she would never rush to the hospital for every little thing and assumes that Jay is just exaggerating. Jay goes to the hospital and is diagnosed with acute appendicitis. He requires emergency surgery, causing Gloria to panic since she has come close to killing her husband (for the second time as she puts it). Meanwhile, Cameron's (Eric Stonestreet) mom, Barb Tucker (Celia Weston), arrives to the Tucker-Pritchett house. This makes Cameron happy and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) uncomfortable, due to Barb's inappropriate touching on him. Following Claire's advice, Mitchell tries to prove to Cameron that his mother is more than handsy but every time he tries to do it, Cameron is looking the other way. When finally realizing about the situation is when Mitchell is sticking his fanny for Barb to touch. Mitchell eventually confronts Cameron about his mother's inappropriate touching, not realizing that she is behind him. This hurts Barb's feeling before she finally realizes she has touched him inappropriately and apologizes, unfortunately this happens while Mitchell is in the bathtub. Production The episode was written by Paul Corrigan and Brad Walsh, their second writing credit for the season after \\"Earthquake\\". The episode was directed by Michael Spiller who had previously directed seven previous episodes of the season. The episode guest stars Celia Weston as Cameron's mother, Barb Tucker. On September 7, 2010, William Keck of TV Guide reported that Celia Weston would play Cameron's mother. Celia stated that her character \\"is totally accepting of Cameron and Mitchell.\\" Eric Stonestreet, who plays Cameron Tucker, also described Barb as \\"somebody who made him (Cameron) the person he is\\". Celia had previously worked with casting director Jeff Greenberg and creators Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan on Frasier in 2004.

In Indonesian, daun means leaf, ubi refers to cassava, and tumbuk means pounded. The cassava leaves are traditionally pounded with a wooden mortar and pestle, although finely chopping or pur√©eing them using a blender or food processor is an alternative. The dish is commonly found throughout the Indonesian archipelago, from Padang food and Batak cuisine in Sumatra; Dayak cuisine in Borneo; to Manado and Bugis cuisine in Sulawesi while almost all Dayaks eat this dishes in Borneo. Ingredients The leaves are cooked in a fried spice paste consisting at a minimum of chilis and shallots, but usually some or all of ginger, galangal, candlenut, garlic, lemongrass and other spices, along with coconut milk and ikan teri or anchovy. Daun ubi tumbuk is frequently cooked with cempokak, a small bitter aubergine.

The Model 1600 was a carrier-based derivative of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but lost to the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. Development Following the YF-16's victory over the Northrop YF-17 for the U.S. Air Force's ACF competition, General Dynamics decided a navalized variant could also best it in the Navy's Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program. Having no carrier aircraft experience, GD teamed up with Vought (LTV Aerospace), which had designed the successful carrier-capable F-8 Crusader and A-7 Corsair II for the Navy; if selected, Vought would have produced the carrier version of the F-16.Peacock 1997, p. 54. LTV created three concepts for the navalized F-16. The main proposal was the Model 1600, which was based on the Block 10 F-16. It featured structural strengthening, an arrestor hook, and a more robust undercarriage to accommodate the rigors of carrier launch and recovery operations. The Model 1600 employed the Pratt & Whitney F401, but two other powerplant choices were also explored. The Model 1601 had an improved Pratt & Whitney F100, while the Model 1602 used the General Electric F101. The aircraft was to be armed with AIM-7 Sparrow air-air missiles. Launch rails were to be added on the sides of the intakes for AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. However, the Navy preferred a twin-engine aircraft, among other reasons, and on 2 May 1975 it selected the Northrop-McDonnell Douglas YF-17-based Model 267 proposal, which became the F/A-18 Hornet.Buttler 2008, p. 207.

As the book says in its introduction, the Southern newspapers give themselves, especially in advertisements for runaway slaves, evidence of mistreatment of the enslaved. The book invites those interested to call at the office of the publisher, the American Anti-Slavery Society, to verify its sources. The book also analyzes arguments defending slavery. It was very influential in the formative days of the abolitionist movement. Harriet Beecher Stowe used American Slavery as It Is as the direct inspiration for her novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which also became very influential in the movement to end slavery. Stowe went so far as to reportedly sleep with the book \\"under her pillow at night.\\" Within the first year of publication, the book had sold 100,000 copies; it served as a vital combination of testimony from those affected by slavery and advertisements published by slavers themselves. This method proved effective at gaining support for abolitionism, since slave-owners could not dispute their own words no matter how poorly it reflected on their character. Other works inspired in part by American Slavery as It Is included William Goodell's The American Slave Code in Theory and Practice, and Charles Dickens' American Notes quotes whole ads from Weld and the Grimk√© sister's book. Frederick Douglass quoted from the book when giving speeches, and said that \\"not a single fact or statement recorded therein has ever been called in question by a single slave holder.\\"  See also  *Slavery in the United States *Treatment of slaves in the United States *Abolitionism in the United States  References   External links  * 1839 original edition of the book American Slavery as It Is, available at Internet Archive.

It was named by David Unwin in 2003 as the group that contains the most recent common ancestor of Pterodactylus and Ctenochasma, and all their descendants. Euctenochasmatians were specialized pterosaurs that had elongated necks as well as specialized teeth. A peculiar family within this group is the Ctenochasmatidae, which most of the members had very distinguishing teeth that were lined within their elongated snouts. A genus called Pterofiltrus only had 112 teeth, but these teeth cover about 55.8% of the total skull, and the skull itself measured about in length. Description Restored skull of Pterodaustro Euctenochasmatians had very distinctive features in comparison to other pterosaurs, including the shape of their jaws, as well as their highly specialized teeth. These teeth are thought to have been used for filter- feeding, the genus Pterodaustro for example, had a long snout and its lower jaws curve strongly upwards, and the tangent at the point of the snout was perpendicular to that of the jaw joint. Pterodaustro has around a thousand baleen-like teeth in its lower jaws that might have been used to strain crustaceans, plankton, algae, and other small creatures from the water. The teeth of Pterodaustro are unique within pterosaurs, and no other discovered genera had this type of teeth. Other members of this group, such as the gallodactylids, differ from other euctenochasmatians in several distinct features, including having fewer than 50 teeth, and were only present in the jaw tips; rounded crests were also present on the rear portion of the skull and jaws but not near the ends of their snouts. Similarly, the ctenochasmatid Feilongus also had its teeth confined within its jaw tips, as well as having crests on the rear portion of the skull and jaws, but differed Feilongus from the gallodactylids by having a possible pronounced overbite, and 76 teeth, which were needle-like. One of the largest toothed pterosaurs was Moganopterus, it was, yet again, a ctenochasmatid, and was similar in build to Feilongus. What made Moganopterus distinct was its size; while Feilongus had a wingspan of about , Moganopterus had an impressive wingspan of more than , making it more than three times larger than Feilongus. Classification Researchers such as David Unwin, have traditionally defined the dubious family Pterodactylidae in such a way to ensure it is nested within the clade Ctenochasmatoidea. In 2003, Unwin defined the same clade (Pterodactylus + Pterodaustro), but erected the name Euctenochasmatia instead of Pterodactylidae for his conclusion. Unwin had considered Euctenochasmatia to be a subgroup within Ctenochasmatoidea, similar to his former conclusion of Pterodactylidae, but most analyses have since found the genus Pterodactylus to be more primitive than previously thought, making the clade Euctenochasmatia the more inclusive group containing both Pterodactylus and Ctenochasmatoidea.Witton, Mark P. (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy. Princeton University Press. . Below is a cladogram showing the results of a 2018 phylogenetic analysis by Longrich, Martill, and Andres. In the analysis, they placed Pterodactylus as a basal member of Euctenochasmatia, and sister taxon of the group Ctenochasmatoidea.Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018).

The museum opened officially on May 3, 2008, in College Park, MD, with an exhibition entitled \\"Writing Language: Passing It On.\\" In 2014, the museum closed its physical facility and became a virtual museum. At present, it is focusing on outreach activities and virtual exhibits. Its outreach includes a speaker series (the Amelia C. Murdoch Speaker Series) and a summer World Languages camp for children. Among its current (2018) online features are a Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) virtual exhibit, the Greek language Philogelos comic strip, regular interviews with linguistic newsmakers and a bimonthly newsletter. The NML owns the world's only International Flag of Language, the result of a contest sponsored by the museum in 2008. The three shades of green on the flag represent past, present, and future languages. The museum is almost entirely run and staffed by volunteers. History The idea for a national language museum dates to 1971, when linguists at the National Security Agency put on an exhibition called \\"Language, Its Infinite Variety.\\" However the idea of a language museum did not gain hold until 1985, when the linguists from the NSA exhibition met again to discuss the possibility. The linguists were unable to establish exhibits at that time, but an organizing committee was formed and a board of directors were elected in 1997. Prior to opening to the public, the museum did have a presence with a newsletter, annual dinner and occasional programs, e.g. \\"Creole Languages as Misunderstood and Endangered Languages‚Äù symposium in 2007. NML opened officially on May 3, 2008, with an exhibition entitled ‚Äò‚ÄòWriting Language: Passing It On,‚Äù which traced the roots of early alphabet languages, such as Arabic, Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and featured as well character-based Chinese and Japanese. Another noted exhibit which followed was \\"Emerging American Language in 1812\\", which explained influences on the development of American English as a separate entity from British English, and included a display about the contributions of Noah Webster, the \\"First American Lexicographer.\\" Other smaller exhibits focused on Native American, Amharic, and North American French. In 2011, it displayed Bibles and liturgical manuscripts on loan from the Alphabet Museum in Waxhaw, North Carolina. The museum housed the Allen Walker Read Library (collection of books from a noted American etymologist and lexicographer) as well as the Ann Kietzman collection of international children's books in foreign languages. The museum also taught classes on occasion. Among its programs were the creation of a speaker's series (renamed the Amelia C. Murdoch Speaker Series after the NML founder), which featured experts in various areas related to language use and history. The Museum also offered grade school programs, and ran a summer language camp. When the museum went virtual, it maintained the speaker series and the summer camp. It still maintains its book collections and displays its flag at museum events. =Funding= The NML is operated by a largely all-volunteer staff.

Three laughs at Tiger Brook (Chinese: ËôéÊ∫™‰∏âÁ¨ë; Pinyin: h«î xƒ´ sƒÅn xi√†o; Gan: f√ª ki sam siƒìu) is a Chinese proverb which refers to the image that the three men, Huiyuan, Tao Yuanming and Lu Xiujing laugh together when arriving at Huxi (ËôéÊ∫™, Tiger Brook) of Mount Lu. This concept represents the ideal harmonious relations of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism in ancient China. Origin The proverb came from the story of the recluse monk Huiyuan (334‚Äì416), who never used to go farther than Huxi, even for a walk or a friend's visit. Moreover, the tiger hiding in the forest would roar to warn him once he crossed the brook. One day, on the visit of the poet Tao Yuanming (365‚Äì427) and Taoist Lu Xiujing (406‚Äì477), Huiyuan had a congenial talk with them. As a result, they only realized they had passed the brook when they heard the roar of the tiger. They laughed wisely together, which represents the desired relationship among the three main religions/philosophies of that time, namely the harmony among Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. This story began as early as the Tang dynasty and became popular during the Song dynasty. It's proved to be impracticable as Lu Xiujing had a visible age difference from the other two.

It allowed the government actions taken during those times to stay valid after the de facto government had ended. It was initially ruled by the Supreme Court in 1930, and stayed active as law until the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Antecedents A similar ruling was enacted in 1865, just a few years after the 1853 Constitution. Bartolom√© Mitre declared himself President of Argentina after the victory at the Battle of Pav√≥n, under supervision of the Argentine National Congress. The Supreme Court had to rule whenever his rulings were valid, and did so. It considered that he emerged triumphant from a revolution, that the peoples supported his rule, and that he got the duty of following the National Constitution and restore order. Mitre stayed in government this way for just a few months. The doctrine The de facto government doctrine was introduced in 1930, after the coup of Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu against President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen. Uriburu assumed the powers of government, dissolved Congress and intervened in the provinces. Informed of this, the Supreme Court legitimized the new government, \\"as long as it executes the administrative and political function derived from its possession of the force as guarantee of order and social security\\". The court reserved for itself the right to monitor and enforce the new government's pledge to observe and obey the constitution and laws. In cases of necessity and urgency (but excluding penal law), the new government was allowed to issue temporary legislation by decree, but these had to be authorised by the Court and would only remain in force if ratified by Congress. The Supreme Court made a similar ruling after the Revolution of '43, but greatly expanded the rights of the military government. The Court relinquished its right to authorise decrees to the de facto government and also allowed for decrees to remain in force after a return to constitutional government, without the need for ratification. In 1955, the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora ousted President Juan Domingo Per√≥n. The new government dissolved the Congress, replaced the members of the Supreme Court and intervened in the provinces. A constitutional convention repealed Per√≥n's 1949 amendments to the constitution. The Court did not rule on this but accepted the constitution as it was in place in 1898 as the basis of other rulings. The Court did not rule it appropriate for decrees to expire, reasoning that the 1930 coup ousted the executive branch, whereas the 1955 coup aimed at both the executive and legislative branches, and thus decrees should remain in force after the coup. Arturo Frondizi was ousted from office in 1962, but before the military could take the government the president of the chamber of senators, Jos√© Mar√≠a Guido, took the presidency following the leaderless law. The Court judged that he was a legitimate president, and that it shouldn't rule about the actions that led to the leaderless state.

The title song from the album had its first chart appearance on Billboard magazine's list of the 40 most popular Easy Listening songs in the US in the issue dated July 24 of that year and got as high as number 21 over the course of 10 weeks.. It also bubbled under Billboard's Hot 100 for six weeks beginning in the August 7 issue, during which time it peaked at number 108.. The album debuted on the magazine's Top LP's chart shortly after its release, in the issue dated October 16, 1965, and reached number 71 during its 26 weeks there.. The album The Sweetheart Tree was released for the first time on compact disc on November 6, 2012, as one of two albums on one CD, the second of the two being his 1966 follow-up, The Shadow of Your Smile. Both were also included in Sony's Mathis box set The Complete Global Albums Collection, which was released on November 17, 2014. History Much of the album was recorded in London and features songs with an international flavor. It was released in two versions: in the US as The Sweetheart Tree, and in the UK it appeared under the title Away From Home. Ten of the songs are found on both albums. The US version has twelve tracks and includes the title track and \\"Mirage\\", not found on the UK version. The UK version has fourteen tracks, three of which (\\"If I Had You\\", \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" and \\"If Love Were All\\") were not available in the US until they were released as part of The Complete Global Albums Collection. The fourth song, \\"In Love for the Very First Time\\" would appear on Mathis's next album The Shadow of Your Smile. In the liner notes for the 2012 release of both The Sweetheart Tree and The Shadow of Your Smile on one compact disc, James Ritz wrote that the former \\"represents the beginning of the end of the 'pure' Mathis sound, at least in its conceptual approach\\" and that the latter \\"would serve as a transitional vehicle to a different formula for the Johnny Mathis recording career.\\" The latter included covers of \\"Michelle\\" and \\"Yesterday\\" by the Beatles, which were still compatible with the easy listening genre but suggested that Mathis had a willingness to stay current. Reception Billboard wrote that \\"the rich, warm Mathis enhances a well-planned, diversified program of material,\\" and that his \\"treatments of 'Danny Boy' and 'Symphony' are among the standout performances.\\" \\"One of his best love mood packages\\" was their assessment.

It was enacted on 1 June 1949 to provide the right for workers to organize in Japan. It has been translated as the \\"Trade Union Law\\" and \\"Labor Union Law\\".  Historical origins  = Pre-war Trade Union bills= After the First World War there were many attempts to establish a trade union law to protect the rights of workers to organize themselves, including a Department of Home Affairs bill in 1925, which would have prevented employers from discharging workers for belonging to a union, or requiring workers to quit (or not join) a union. But these bills never became law.Kimura, Shinichi, Unfair Labor Practices under the Trade Union Law of Japan = The Potsdam Declaration = As the Second World War was nearing its end, on 26 July 1945, Allied leaders Winston Churchill, Harry S Truman, and Chiang Kai-shek issued the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded Japan's unconditional surrender. This declaration also defined the major goals of the postsurrender Allied occupation: \\"The Japanese government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established\\" (Section 10). In addition, the document stated: \\"The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government\\" (Section 12). The Allies sought not merely punishment or reparations from a militaristic foe, but fundamental changes in the nature of its political system. In the words of political scientist Robert E. Ward: \\"The occupation was perhaps the single most exhaustively planned operation of massive and externally directed political change in world history.\\" 1945 Trade Union Law After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, allied forces, mostly American, rapidly began arriving in Japan. Almost immediately, the occupiers began an intensive program of legal changes designed to democratize Japan. One action was to ensure the creation of a Trade Union law to allow for the first time workers to organize, strike, and bargain collectively, which was passed by the Diet of Japan on 22 December 1945.Dower, John. 'Embracing Defeat. Penguin, 1999. . Page 82. =Drafting process = While the law was created while Japan was under occupation, the law itself was largely a Japanese work. It was put together by a large legal advisory commission headed by the legal scholar Suehiro Izutaro. The commission was quite large, consisting of \\"three Welfare ministry bureaucrats and two scholars, a steering committee of 30 members (including the communist firebrand Kyuichi Tokuda), and an overall membership of more than 130 members representing universities, corporations, political parties, the bureaucracy, social workers, and labor.\\"Dower, John. 'Embracing Defeat. Penguin, 1999. . Page 245. =The post-war Japanese Constitution= The constitution of Japan, which became law on 3 May 1947 includes article 28, which guarantees the right of workers to participate in a trade union. 1949 Law and subsequent amendments On 1 June 1949 a new version of the Trade Union Law was enacted. It has since been amended in 1950, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1959, 1962, 1966, 1971, 1978, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2004, and 2005.Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training Trade Union Law  Main provisions  = Structure = The law consists of 5 chapters, an order for the enforcement of the Trade Union law, and supplementary provisions: * Chapter 1 General Provisions (Articles 1-4) * Chapter 2 Labor Unions (Articles 5-13) * Chapter 3 Labor Relations Commissions Section 1 Establishment, Duties, and Matters under the Jurisdiction, Organizations, etc. (Articles 19-26) Section 2 Procedures for Examination of Cases of Unfair Labor Practices (Articles 27 - 27-19) Section 3 Lawsuits (Articles 27-19 - 27-21) * Section 4 Miscellaneous Provisions (Articles 27-22 - 27-26) * Chapter 5 Penal Provisions (Articles 28-33) * Order for the enforcement of the trade union act * Supplementary Provisions  Unfair Labor Practices  Prohibited under Article 7 of the Act, an unfair labor practice is when an employer interferes with the rights of workers to join, organize, or take part in union activities, and also for an employer refusing to collectively bargain with a union.

Allmovie contributor Sandra Brennan has written that he was \\"among the best art directors in French cinema.\\" He was nominated for an Academy Award in 1969 for Best Visual Effects on the film Krakatoa, East of Java. Early life Louri√© was born in Ukraine in 1903. His first experience with cinema was in 1911 when a movie theater opened in Kharkov. In 1919, he worked on an anti- communist film titled Black Crowes. After he fled from the Soviet Union, he made his way to Istanbul. While there he made money for a fare to Paris, France by painting and drawing movie posters. He even slept in the theater on top of a piano to save money. Film career In the 1930s, he worked as a production designer for such directors as Jean Renoir, Max Oph√ºls, and Ren√© Clair. As an assistant and production designer to Renoir, he worked on such French films as La Grande illusion and La R√®gle du Jeu. After Renoir had moved to Hollywood in the early 1940s, Louri√© moved as well, and worked with other directors including Sam Fuller, Charlie Chaplin, and Robert Siodmak. Then in 1953, he made his directorial debut with The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, the first of three dinosaur films that Louri√© would direct. The film was profitable, however Louri√© has said that he regrets that the film typecast him as a science fiction director. He decided that after his 1961 film, Gorgo, he would stop directing movies because he did not want to direct \\"the same comic- strip monsters.\\" Eight years later, he received an Academy Award nomination for his visual effects on Krakatoa, East of Java. In 1980, Louri√© designed Clint Eastwood's Bronco Billy. Louri√© also had an acting part in Richard Gere's 1983 picture, Breathless. Louri√© makes a silent cameo appearance in Krakatoa, East of Java, portraying a lighthouse keeper on the coast of Java in 1883 who observes Krakatoa's final, cataclysmic explosion and enters the lighthouse to send news of it by telegraph.Model Ships in the Cinema: Krakatoa, East of Java, 1969, caption of photo of lighthouse keeper operating telegraph.

He is the husband of Jane Jetson and the father of teenage daughter Judy and son Elroy. Fictional character biography George resides with his family and his dog Astro in the Skypad Apartments in Orbit City, in a future with the trappings of science fantasy depictions of American life in the future, such as robot servants, flying saucer-like cars, and moving sidewalks. All the apartment buildings are set on giant poles, resembling Seattle's Space Needle; the ground is almost never seen. In Jetsons: The Movie, it is revealed that they live in the sky due to excess of smog. When George was a child, he had to fly through ten miles of asteroid storms to go to Orbit High School, where he was the star pitcher of its Spaceball team. George is now an employee at Spacely's Space Sprockets, a manufacturer of \\"sprockets\\" and other high tech equipment. His job title is \\"digital index operator.\\" His boss is Cosmo G. Spacely, noted for being short in both height and temper; Spacely usually treats his employees (particularly George) in a rather tyrannical fashion. George's job primarily requires him to repeatedly push a single button (or on occasion a series of buttons) on a computer (named RUDI {Short for: Referential Universal Digital Indexer} in the 1980s series of Jetsons episodes). George complains of his heavy work load: pushing a button on and off as many as five times for three hours, three days a week. Often, Mr. Spacely will fire George in a fit of anger, only to hire him back by the end of the same episode. Physically, George is a rather slim man of average height with short red hair and a cartoonishly large nose. His personality is that of a well-meaning, caring father, but he is often befuddled and stressed out by the problems of both his work and family lives. As with most Hanna-Barbera productions of the 1950s and early 1960s, George Jetson was modeled after a contemporary celebrity; in George's case, it was character actor George O'Hanlon, who also voiced (and granted his name to) the character. O'Hanlon was well known for his roles as a common everyman (his best-known role outside of The Jetsons was the Joe McDoakes film series) and once said of his character: \\"George Jetson is an average man. He has trouble with his boss, he has problems with his kids, and so on. The only difference is that he lives in the next century.\\" Catchphrase George's most famous catchphrase is \\"Jane! Stop this crazy thing!\\" seen at the end credits of the 1960s Jetsons episodes, but is also known for frequently uttering the phrase \\"Hooba-dooba-dooba!\\" or \\"Hooba-Dooba\\" (in most episodes) to express wonder or astonishment (possibly inspired by Fred Flintstone's phrase \\"Yabba-dabba-doo!\\"). Portrayer George O'Hanlon voiced and served as a model for the character. Morey Amsterdam was originally hired to voice the character but was fired due to sponsor conflicts between his numerous other projects, including The Dick Van Dyke Show. Amsterdam sued Hanna-Barbera for breach of contract but lost. George O'Hanlon, hired after auditioning but failing to win the role of Fred Flintstone two years prior, became George Jetson's voice actor, a role he would retain for the rest of his life through both the sixties and eighties versions of the cartoon series. O'Hanlon last did the voice for George Jetson in Jetsons: The Movie, which was released posthumously. The current voice of George Jetson is Jeff Bergman, who voiced George (and also Mr. Spacely) in some parts of the movie after O'Hanlon's death, and also voiced George in The Funtastic World of Hanna- Barbera as well as for the cameo in the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode \\"Shaggy Busted\\" and Sp√ºmc√∏'s two Jetsons cartoons: Father & Son Day and The Best Son. In the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode \\"Back to the Present\\", George was voiced by Wally Wingert. In the episode, the Jetsons return to the past to sue the planet for causing global warming.

The clashes erupted along the border with Thailand shortly after Myanmar's general election on 7 November 2010. An estimated 10,000 refugees have fled into nearby neighbouring Thailand to escape the violent conflict. There is concern that due to discontent with the elections, and speculations of electoral fraud, that the conflict could escalate into a civil war. Timeline =June 2010= * 12 June. KNLA kill 12 troops. =October 2010= * 1 October. Fighting erupted yesterday between Burmese troops and a breakaway Shan force only hours after a Burmese soldier died following an ambush by a Karen army. * 19 October. 4,000 troops of the KNLA are now on high alert. =8‚Äì9 November 2010= The fighting started in the town of Myawaddy, in Karen State, on 8 November. The government deployed heavy artillery in the town in response to the presence of forces from the renegade DKBA brigade. The military had allegedly threatened to shoot people who refused to vote. There were also clashes near Three Pagodas Pass. It is believed at least three people were killed and twenty wounded when a Burmese Army artillery shell landed in a market in the centre of Myawaddy. At least five Thai civilians were injured when a rocket propelled grenade exploded in the town of Mae Sot, on the border between Thailand and Burma. It is estimated that at least 10,000 refugees have fled into Thailand to escape the violence. DKBA rebels took the town of Myawaddy on 9 November, and were holding it against government forces. The town was closed off, and information on further casualties remains unavailable. According to Thai sources, the Tatmadaw recaptured the majority of the town later in the evening, after an earlier battle between troops and DKBA forces. By the following morning only a few areas remained under rebel control. The Thai military, who are supervising the thousands of refugees, announced that it would send the refugees back over the border once the situation in the town had calmed down. By the middle of 9 November, reports emerged that government troops had fully retaken the town, and pushed rebel troops back into the forests. Thai Officials were preparing to start moving the estimated 15,000 refugees back over the border. Late on Tuesday 9 November, refugees started moving back over the river from Thailand, with the government claiming that its forces had quelled the violence, and that DKBA fighters were no longer present in the town. It is believed between five and ten civilians were killed during the fighting. However, neither the government nor DKBA fighters have released any information on the numbers of casualties from the fighting. =10 November onwards= By November skirmishes between rebel forces and government troops were continuing around the Three Pagodas Pass area. The next day, both sides continued small skirmishes with both sides exchanging rocket fire. DKBA forces allegedly briefly took control of the town of Payathonsu, however government forces drove the rebels out. According to a Thai official, at least 30 rockets were fired by both sides between 4 and 6am. Both belligerents are believed to have reinforced their numbers over the last few days. The DKBA rebel, Waw Lay base was also destroyed by Government forces after a heavy artillery bombardment. On 12 November, Al-Jazeera English reported that the DKBA had joined forces with the Karen National Liberation Army to counter an expected crackdown by the government. Fighting then erupted again as both sides exchanged rocket fire. During the fighting a RPG exploded near Tinetayar Monastery, wounding 3 civilians who were taken to a nearby hospital. Fighting flared up once more on the evening of 14 November with DKBA forces once more exchanging Mortar and small arms fire with Government troops. The fresh outburst of violence sent at least 200 civilians fleeing across the border into Thailand Thai officials were keen to start sending the refugees back over the border as soon as the violence died down. On the 27th DKBA forces ambushed government troops reportedly killed One soldier and wounding 8. Government forces used 81-millimetre shells against rebel forces during the attack, however no rebel casualties have been announced. The fighting sent a reported 1,000 civilians over the border once more into Thailand. =2011 clashes= January Fighting spilled over into the new year when DKBA and Government forces exchanged yet another large burst of rocket and artillery fire on 1 January. Two Thai Army soldiers who were patrolling the Thai side of the border were wounded when misguided 120mm artillery fire landed near their patrol vehicle which was destroyed. Several Government troops were also reported wounded when their Army truck ran over an IED. Gun battles were exchanged between Junta troops and DKBA personal between 26 and 27 January. According to DKBA sources 26 Junta soldiers were killed and 35 wounded during the fighting. At least 200 more refugees have fled over the Thai border and have taken refuge in the Thai Phop Phra District. DKBA forces accused the Thai Army of allowing Burmese troops to cross into Thai territory to attack Brigade 5 from Thai soil. Thai military officials have made no comment on the matter. February For the first time in over 10 years the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) had an armed clash with Government Troops, reportedly wounding a battalion commander as well as several other soldiers. The KIO said that junta troops, led by battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Yin Htwe, intruded into a KIO- controlled area, which started the fighting. Yin Htwe's condition was unknown. The fighting lasted for approximately 20 minutes before government troops withdrew. According to the KIO, the two sides last fought in April 1997 near Nammatee in Kachin State. March The KNLA ambushed a convoy of 27 trucks carrying more than 300 troops between Kanelay and Bayintnaung in the Waw Lay area killing 16 and wounding 17. From the period 1 January to 31 March 2011, the KNLA was involved in 526 clashes with the Myanmar Army. April 15 April: The conflict escalates from Three Pagodas Pass to Shan State. May 2 May: Clash between the Burmese military troops and the Karenni soldiers near Daw Ta Naw village. 3 May: Clashes between the Burmese military troops and an alliance of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) in Kyarinnseikgyi township.

September Myanmar border clashes intensify. 24‚Äì26 September: Four days as heavy fighting by KIAFour Days of Heavy Fighting in Northern Burma November The government and the Karen National Union agreed to talks aimed at negotiating a ceasefire and eventual lasting peace. Economic impact The recent clashes which have occurred on the Thai-Myanmar border are nothing new to the Thai border village of Mae Sot. However the fighting which has erupted near the town since the 2010 Myanmar elections has been causing a significant impact in the trade between Thailand and Myanmar due to the border being closed. Trade between the two countries brings in approximately 30 to 36 billion baht annually. International reactions * ‚Äì Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about reported clashes between government troops and ethnic rebels \\"and urged all sides to refrain from any action that could raise tensions further or create instability at this sensitive time.\\" * ‚Äì The Australian Greens party has called for a full trade embargo against Myanmar in the wake of the election and resulting violence. * ‚Äì The Department of Foreign affairs announced that they would work with Canadian Friends of Burma to help send aid to refugees affected and displaced by the fighting. * ‚Äì The Thai government called for both sides to show restraint and be careful when firing weapons, as it was revealed several M79 Grenades landed on the Thai side of the border.M79 rounds land on border village 8 November 2010 Retrieved 14 November 2010 References External links * Burma Conflict Situation Report (Web Archive) * Burma Mission - Health Crisis Category:Internal conflict in Myanmar Category:Politics of Myanmar Category:Wars involving Myanmar Myanmar border clashes Myanmar border clashes Border clashes Border clashes Clashes Myanmar Border clashes ","title":"2010‚Äì2012 Myanmar border clashes"},{"id":"29534164","text":"William Louis Ayres (1874-November 30, 1947), better known by his professional name Louis Ayres, was an American architect who was one of the most prominent designers of monuments, memorials, and buildings in the nation in the early part of the 20th century.\\"Architects Chosen to Advise on Plans for Mall Triangle,\\" Washington Post, May 20, 1927.

He graduated from Trinity School, a prep school located in New York City. He attended Rutgers University, graduating in 1896 with a degree in electrical engineering. After graduation, he spent three years with the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, but left (along with several other architects in the firm) to join the firm of York and Sawyer. He became a partner in the firm in 1910. By 1921, he was one of the most prominent architects in the nation. From 1921 to 1925, he served on the prestigious U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the federal advisory panel which had statutory approval over all major building projects in Washington, D.C.Thomas E.

In 1935, Ayres was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1936. =Meuse- Argonne Chapel= One of Ayres' most prominent commissions came in 1925, when he was asked to design a chapel for an American military cemetery in Europe. Congress created the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) in 1923 in part to consolidate the United States Department of War's divisions for military cemeteries and for stone and bronze battlefield map memorials, and in part to build, operate, and maintain American military cemeteries overseas.Grossman, \\"Architecture for a Public Client: The Monuments and Chapels of the American Battle Monuments Commission,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, May 1984, p. 120. The ABMC was deeply influenced by Charles Moore, the chair of the Commission of Fine Arts and whose agency had final approval over the design of the cemeteries and memorials. The ABMC's plans changed and changed again over the next several years, and by 1925 it was ready to hire \\"\\"the most prominent architects in the country\\" for its plans.Grossman, \\"Architecture for a Public Client: The Monuments and Chapels of the American Battle Monuments Commission,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, May 1984, p. 125. Ayres was commissioned to design the chapel at Meuse-Argonne, the largest and most important of the three sites.Grossman, \\"Architecture for a Public Client: The Monuments and Chapels of the American Battle Monuments Commission,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, May 1984, p. 136. Ayres submitted two simple, classical designs and one French Romanesque design. Although both a classical and Romanesque design were approved for construction, the final chapel is Romanesque in style, shorter than proposed, and the colonnades on either side of it reduced in length.Grossman, \\"Architecture for a Public Client: The Monuments and Chapels of the American Battle Monuments Commission,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, May 1984, p. 137. The chapel was dedicated on Memorial Day in 1937, the 20th anniversary of the American entry into World War I.Grossman, \\"Architecture for a Public Client: The Monuments and Chapels of the American Battle Monuments Commission,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, May 1984, p. 143. Ayres' continued to serve the architectural profession in many important ways in the 1920s. He was one of three judges on a panel which in 1925 awarded the design for the proposed Theodore Roosevelt memorial to be built in West Potomac Park in Washington, D.C.\\"Roosevelt Memorial Contest Ends Today,\\" New York Times, October 1, 1925; \\"Roosevelt Design of J.R.

He also played a major role on a board which helped plan the Federal Triangle government office building complex. The U.S. federal government had struggled with the need to build a number of large governmental office buildings since the mid-1910s, but little had been done.\\"Wide Federal Plan for Buildings Told.\\" New York Times. June 6, 1926. In January 1924, the Public Buildings Commission recommended that a new series of federal office buildings be built near the White House.\\"$50,000,000 Plea for Buildings Here Goes to Congress,\\" Washington Post, January 4, 1924; Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation..., 2006, p. 181; Abrams, Capital Sporting Grounds..., 2009, p. 12. In 1926, the U.S. Congress enacted the Public Buildings Act, which, among other things, authorized the United States Department of the Treasury to begin construction on the Federal Triangle complex of buildings.\\"Coolidge Signs Bill for New Buildings,\\" New York Times, May 26, 1926; \\"$165,000,000 Public Building Measure Signed By Coolidge,\\" Washington Post, May 26, 1926; Cannadine, Mellon: An American Life, 2008, p. 373, 375-376.Goode, \\"Introduction: The Creation of Monumental Washington in the 1930s,\\" in Wentzel and Goode, Washington by Night: Vintage Photographs From the 30s, 1998, p. 13. However, disagreements among the three planning bodies overseeing the project (Commission on Fine Arts, Public Buildings Commission, and U.S. Treasury) proved so fundamental that a year-long delay ensued. To end the disagreement, a Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise the groups on the development of the project.\\"Architects Chosen to Advise on Plans for Mall Triangle.\\" Washington Post. May 20, 1927. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Charles S. Dewey recommended Ayres as one of the consultants,Bedford, John Russell Pope: Architect of Empire, 1998, p. 143. and his appointment was almost immediately approved.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation..., 2006, p. 182. Design work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927 to allow the Board to conduct its work.\\"Planners Suggest Justice building Location Change,\\" Washington Post, May 7, 1927. The Board of Architectural Consultants first met on May 23, 1927, at which time it considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures.\\"Architects Considering Public Buildings Plan,\\" Washington Post, May 24, 1927. In June 1927, Ayres and the other consultants approved construction of the Department of Commerce and Internal Revenue Service structures as stand-alone buildings on the previously proposed sites.\\"Federal Building Plans Announced By Treasury,\\" Washington Post, June 21, 1927. A month later, Ayres and the other Board members proposed constructing eight buildings, connected by plazas, semi-circular colonnades, and other architectural and landscaping elements.\\"Triangle Sites Studied By Architectural Board,\\" Washington Post, July 12, 1927. The Department of Commerce building was set on the west side of 15th Street NW between B and D Streets NW. An aerial view looking west at the Herbert Hoover Dept. of Commerce building, designed by Louis Ayres For the architectural style of the buildings, Ayres and the other Board members relied heavily on recommendation of the 1902 McMillan Plan that federal buildings in the District of Columbia be built in the Neoclassical style.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation..., 2006, p. 184-185. Both the Board and Treasury Secretary Mellon rejected the Modern style then heavily in vogue. Rather than a mass of tall, imposing buildings, two unifying open spaces (intended for ceremonial use, and under discussion by the Board at least by March 1928) would be utilized.Speers, \\"Washington's Aspect Is Undergoing Change,\\" New York Times, March 18, 1928. The first would be a Circular Plaza (inspired by the Place Vend√¥me)McCormick, \\"Building the Greater Capital,\\" New York Times, May 26, 1929. bisected by 12th Street NW, and which would require the demolition of the Old Post Office Pavilion. The second would be a rectangular Grand Plaza on the east side of 14th Street NW between the proposed Department of Commerce building (west side of 14th Street NW) and the proposed Post Office Department building (east side of 13th Street NW). The construction of the Grand Plaza would have required the demolition of the District Building. York and Sawyer was commissioned to design the Commerce building. This choice had been made almost 15 years earlier, oddly enough. A new headquarters for the Department of Commerce had been proposed in 1912 and a contract for the design work awarded to the architectural firm of York and Sawyer.Whitaker, \\"Building for the Glory of Washington,\\" New York Times, March 6, 1927. Although this building was never built, Congress honored the contract and in the Public Buildings Act named the firm again as the Commerce building's designer. York and Sawyer put Louis Ayres in charge of the building's design.Moeller and Weeks, AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C., 2006, p. 125; Wasserman and Hausrath, Washington, D.C., From A to Z: The Traveler's Look-Up Source for the Nation's Capital, 2003, p. 77.Freundlich, The Sculpture of James Earle Fraser, 2001, p. 104. But not all design choices were left up to Ayres. By March 1927, government officials had already decided that the Commerce building should be long‚Äîmaking it the then-largest building in the District of Columbia.\\"Plans Capitol Buildings.\\" New York Times. September 29, 1927. Work on the building site was expected to begin by March 31, 1927.\\"Date Set For Start On New U.S. Building,\\" Washington Post, March 4, 1927. Survey work at the site began on that date even though final plans for the project were still unclear. But the May 1927 work moratorium put all decisions regarding the Commerce building design on hold. In September 1927, the Commission of Fine Arts met to discuss proposed plans for both the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings.\\"Plans to Be Considered For Commerce Edifice.\\" Washington Post. September 28, 1927. Even though he was designing the Commerce building, Ayres continued to participate in the work of the Board of Architectural Consultants.

Detail of the Main Lobby of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce building, designed by Louis Ayres and with interior decoration by Barnet Phillips By mid-1927, Ayres was proposing a grandiose building to anchor the western end of Federal Triangle. The proposed building had of interior space (more than 60 percent larger than originally planned). The structure was essentially rectangular, with seven wings and six interior courtyards that was one city block wide and three blocks long.Culver and Hyde, American Dreamer: The Life and Times of Henry A. Wallace, 2000, p. 393-394. There were 15 entrances and 16 interior stairways. Its seven stories were clad in granite and limestone. More than of corridors accessed of office space designed to house 10,000 workers, accommodate 8 million patents in a publicly accessible manner, include a public aquarium with 40 tanks and 2,000 fish, and house a 200,000-item library. Ayres asked James Earle Fraser (sculptor), a sculptor and colleague on the Commission of Fine Arts, to design and sculpt the various external features of the building. At first Fraser said he had far too many other commissions and could not work on the Commerce building, but Ayres and Fraser developed a cooperative work style that eventually was adopted for most of the buildings in the Federal Triangle: Fraser consulted with Ayres and other architects to develop appropriate themes and content and then built or fashioned models of his designs. Then his assistants enlarged the models into full-scale sculptures and did the physical work of actually carving the art. Ayres designed four massive pediments for the building, which Fraser filled with sculptures with the themes \\"Aviation,\\" \\"Mining,\\" \\"Fisheries,\\" and \\"Foreign and Domestic Commerce.\\" Ayres contracted with interior designer Barnet Phillips to design and implement the interior elements of the building.Federal Writers' Project Washington, D.C.: A Guide to the Nation's Capital, 1942, p. 198. Ayres had planned a main lobby that was Neoclassical in design. Phillips designed rusticated walls, placed arches over every doorway, placed Doric columns throughout the lobby, added a painted and coffered ceiling, and laid terrazzo and marble down for the lobby floor. Ayres confronted a vitally important design problem concerning the nature of the soil. Due to the formerly marshy condition of the soil and the existence of several submerged streams nearby, Ayres designed a structure that would stand on more than 18,000 pilings.Du Puy, William Atherton. \\"New Washington Buildings Emerge.\\" New York Times. June 1, 1930.Tiber Creek had once run along B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue NW). In 1815, Tiber Creek was straightened and connected to and became part of the Washington City Canal. The canal fell into disuse by the 1850s. Tiber Creek was enclosed by a masonry tunnel beginning in 1878 and the tunnel connected to the city's sewer system so that the creek's natural flow would help flush sewage into the Potomac River. Much of the area immediately south and west of the B Street NW and the Washington Monument was, at the time, part of the Potomac River. After a disastrous flood in 1881, the United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged a deep channel in the Potomac and used the material to fill in the Potomac (creating the current banks of the river) and raise much of the land near the White House and along Pennsylvania Avenue NW by nearly .

However, water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek would make it difficult to drive the piles.Barrows, \\"Department of Commerce Home Baffles Writers Trying to Visualize Structure,\\" Washington Post, December 31, 1931. Ayres and his team devised a plan whereby a deep-sea diver descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole deep into the earth. A hose would be inserted into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished. The building's foundation was more than three feet thick in places in order to withstand the hydraulic pressure put on it by the submerged Tiber Creek.\\"Ready Soon to Occupy Commerce Building,\\" New York Times, December 26, 1931. Water from the Tiber was utilized as an air conditioning system to cool the building. Ayres submitted his design for the Commerce building to the Public Buildings Commission, which gave its approval on November 1, 1927. The previous size of the building was reaffirmed. Excavation of the site began on November 21, 1927.\\"Work on New Federal Buildings Starts Soon,\\" Washington Post, November 18, 1927; \\"Contractors Start Excavating On Site of Revenue Office,\\" Washington Post, November 22, 1927. However, although Ayres had proposed an Italian Renaissance style for the Commerce building, few of the other building proposals had adopted a classical design. On November 25, 1927, the Commission on Fine Arts adopted a requirement that all the Federal Triangle buildings have a \\"uniform appearance\\" and height (six stories), limiting the Board's design deliberations (and Ayres' proposal for the Commerce building).\\"Unity Is Planned for Pennsylvania Avenue Buildings,\\" Washington Post, November 25, 1927. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon imposed a requirement in December 1927 that all the buildings be built in the Neoclassical architectural style.\\"Mellon Indorses Building Program of Classic Style,\\" Washington Post, December 11, 1927. Ayres modified the exterior design of his structure accordingly. Research Library of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce building, designed by Louis Ayres and with interior decoration by Barnet Phillips By March 1928, newspapers were reporting that the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings would be constructed first.\\"Mellon Tells Aim in Capital Plans,\\" New York Times, October 19, 1928. Ayres' design, however, was still in flux, as the Board of Architectural Consultants refused to give its approval to his plan. Although the size of the Commerce building had stabilized by March 1928,\\"Hoover Hails Our National Projects,\\" New York Times, June 11, 1929. some Board members still suggested that both 15th and 14th Streets NW be submerged in tunnels beneath the structure. Despite the ongoing dispute over the design, additional demolition contracts were awarded for the site in April 1928.\\"Contract to Wreck Buildings Awarded,\\" Washington Post, April 20, 1928. The Board of Architectural Consultants and Ayres met in July 1928 to consider ways in which the construction program might be sped up, and devised plans to have four approved buildings (Internal Revenue, Justice, Labor, and Ayres' Commerce structure) completed by 1932.\\"Federal Building Program Expected to Be Speeded Up,\\" Washington Post, July 16, 1928; \\"Five Mall Buildings To Be Ready by 1932,\\" Washington Post, July 24, 1928. By October 1928, the Board of Architectural Consultants had agreed with prior decisions that no office building should be constructed on the National Mall, and that this space should be reserved for museums. Ayres' design faced one final hurdle in the fall of 1929. Although the Board unveiled its proposed design for the project in April 1929, the design still lacked a unifying architectural look.Cannadine, Mellon: An American Life, 2008, p. 383-384. Subsequently, John Russell Pope was asked in September 1929 to bring a more uniform style to the buildings.Cannadine, Mellon: An American Life, 2008, p. 398. Nonetheless, within this more uniform approach, a variety of styles could be used, and were: Italian Renaissance for the Department of Commerce building, Corinthian for the National Archives building, and Ionic for the Post Office Department.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation..., 2006, p. 184. Meanwhile, Ayres and the Board of Architectural Consultants worked with sculptors, painters, and others to design more than 100 statues, fountains, bronze doors, murals, plaques, and panels (both interior and exterior) throughout the complex. Ayres was involved in approving two major changes to Federal Triangle in early 1930. The Board and other planning groups had long agreed to site the Justice Department building on the block bounded by 7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. But this plan changed in March 1930. Architect John Russell Pope made a proposal to have the Justice and Archives buildings switch sites so that the Justice building would have more space. Although the change would entail major design alterations in both buildings, Secretary Mellon favored the idea. The Commission on Fine Arts approved the plan, and Mellon met with the Board of Architectural Consultants in late March 1930 to discuss the idea.\\"Mellon to Discuss Changing of Sites,\\" Washington Post, March 28, 1930. Although this initial meeting left the issue unresolved,\\"Site of New Justice Building Undecided,\\" Washington Post, March 29, 1930. Ayres and the Board later agreed to Mellon's wishes in April and the two buildings switched plots.\\"Hoover Urges Funds For Six New Buildings,\\" Washington Post, April 23, 1930. President (and former Commerce Secretary) Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone of the Commerce building on June 10, 1929, using the same trowel President George Washington had used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol.\\"Hoover and Notables Aid Dedication of Structure for Big Project,\\" Washington Post, June 11, 1929. The contract for its limestone facade‚Äîaccording to at least one newspaper account, the largest stone contract in world history‚Äîwas awarded in April.\\"Stone Contract Is Given For Commerce Building,\\" Washington Post, April 14, 1929. The cost of the building had risen to $17.5 million. Ayres' Department of Commerce building opened on January 4, 1932.\\"Hoover Inspects Commerce Building,\\" New York Times, January 3, 1932. Ayres continued his work on the Board of Architectural Consultants into the mid-1930s. From 1931 to 1936, the Board struggled to accommodate the need for automobile parking at the complex while also making Federal Triangle pedestrian-friendly.Gutheim and Lee, Worthy of the Nation..., 2006, p. 187-189. The Board began studying traffic issues in late 1927. A major study of parking needs and solutions was conducted in 1931, and traffic and parking patterns assessed again after the Department of Commerce building opened in early 1932.\\"Study of Triangle Parking Needs Near,\\" Washington Post, December 30, 1931. To achieve some of the traffic and parking goals, Ayres and the Board voted to eliminate the east-west streets and diagonal avenues, leaving only the north-south streets through the area, and 12th and 9th Streets NW were submerged in tunnels beneath the National Mall.\\"State Names For Streets Slated Today,\\" Washington Post, January 30, 1936. In the first major change to the Board's \\"final\\" plan of 1929, a proposed \\"Grand Plaza\\" between the Commerce and Post Office buildings was abandoned in favor of a parking lot.The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center currently occupies the site where the Grand Plaza would have been built. The Board considered a number of other solutions to the need to accommodate the more than 7,500 cars expected to arrive every day (including an underground bus terminal and underground parking garage under the Grand Plaza), but in the end only approved a small number of underground parking spaces beneath the Apex Building.\\"Underground Terminal Suggested for Buses,\\" Washington Post, October 13, 1927; \\"Groups Study Car Parking In Triangle,\\" Washington Post, October 24, 1936. The New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded him its Medal of Honor in 1933.\\"Architects' Medal Goes to Louis Ayres,\\" New York Times, April 6, 1933; \\"Honor Medal Given to Architect Ayres,\\" Washington Post, April 9, 1933.

Ayres' was not only a noted architect in his own right, but he helped lead many successful design teams as well. His teams won for York & Sawyer commissions for the Federal Building in Honolulu, Hawaii, (since replaced by the Prince Kuhio Federal Building) and 33 Liberty Street, Manhattan, New York City (the Federal Reserve Bank of New York building). Death Just before his death, Louis Ayres was commissioned to lead a team which would draft a master plan for the expansion of Rutgers University. After a long period of poor health, Ayres died at his home in Manhattan on November 30, 1947. His wife and two stepchildren survived him. References Notes Bibliography *Abrams, Brett L.

Jefferson's interest was also sparked by the extensive literature on the subject of gardening including Philip Miller's The Gardener's Dictionary, Bernard McMahon's the American Gardner's Calendar and Thomas Whately's Observations on Modern Gardening.Betts, p. 2 His approach to gardening was heavily influenced by Thomas Whaley's work and his description of the technique of naturalistic gardening. Naturalistic design features curvilinear paths, the informal planting of flowers, unregimented, borders, wild flowers, and asymmetrical forms. Jefferson first toured English gardens in 1786 and grew especially fond of the naturalistic gardens he observed, compared to the more formal Parisian gardens. These English gardens influenced Jefferson's design of his own garden. Jefferson's written plans for the gardens at Monticello Jefferson inherited Monticello in 1757 and moved there in 1770.Williams, p. 75. There is little documentation of any planting until 1807, most likely due to Jefferson's travels to France in 1784 and the preliminary landscaping that had to be completed.Betts, p. 5 After the land was cleared, roads were built, and trees and shrubs were planted, Jefferson began planning the layout of his gardens. He collected many plants from the surrounding countryside, but also from abroad. Andr√© Thouin, Jefferson's friend and the Superintendent of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, sent Jefferson seeds from Europe.Betts, p5. The gardens contained many exotic species, including the empress tree from China and Japan Williams, Dorothy Hunt, Historic Virginia Gardens Jefferson also had flowers from nurseries sent to him up the James and Rivanna rivers to a town near Monticello.Betts, p.6 Supplying water to the many plants at Monticello was a continuous problem for Jefferson. In 1808 Jefferson began the construction of four cisterns to collect water channeled from the roofs of buildings into gutters.Betts, p.19 During his presidency, Jefferson made frequent visits to Monticello, often bringing with him new plants and flowers to be planted. While away, Jefferson wrote instructions to Edmund Bacon, his overseer.Betts, p.29 Most of the planting was done from 1808 to 1812. After Jefferson's death in 1826, the conditions of the gardens declined rapidly. Parts of the property were sold to pay off the large debts of his estate.Williams, p77. New owners plowed land and planted paper mulberries and silkworm, which had the potential to generate large profits at the time. In 1923 the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Fund (now Thomas Jefferson Foundation) was established and purchased large portions of the Monticello property. The Garden Club of Virginia was later enlisted to restore the gardens. They found that Jefferson had left extensive notes on his original planting, as well as instructions. The original plan for the gardens written by Jefferson in 1807 was found and used as the basis for the restoration project.Williams, p.78 The original beauty of the Monticello Gardens has been restored with great accuracy. Visitors can see the oval and circular flower beds around the house which Jefferson had designed and enjoyed nearly 200 years before.Betts, p. 47.  Horticulture and design  = Flowers= A winding walk is bordered by flower beds, and twenty oval beds are planted at the corners of the house. The twenty oval beds were each planted with a different flower species with bulbs and seeds provided mainly by Bernard McMahon, a Philadelphia nurseryman. The plans for the winding flower border were laid out in 1808 and the garden was planted and tended to by Jefferson's daughters as well as elderly slaves. The winding path, modeled after English gardens which Jefferson had admired in 1786, was located behind the house. Instead of rigid, straight lines, the garden took a more natural, curved path. To keep the garden organized, Jefferson divided the border into 10-foot sections and had each section planted with a different species of flower. = Vegetable = Monticello Vegetable Garden The vegetable garden at Monticello was started in 1770. In 1806 a terrace system was introduced, to create a flat plateau that was hewed from the side of the hill and supported by a giant stone wall. Because of the location in the side of the hill, the climate was slightly warmer, allowing for a longer, warmer growing season. The 1,000-foot garden was divided into 24 different sections, and the vegetables were grouped by which part of the plant would be harvested. The vegetable garden was built and maintained through slave labor. = Orchards = Monticello had two orchards, vineyards, berry patches, and a nursery, all known by Jefferson as his \\"fruitery.\\" The North orchard included only apple and pear trees that were used by Jefferson to produce ciders. The South orchards were planted around the vineyards and berry patches and included fruits such as apple, peach, cherry, pear, plum, nectarine, almond, apricot, and quince. Underneath the vegetable terrace was a large vineyard with both native and foreign species of vines. Jefferson was also famous for his berry squares. These patches of berries were used both for fruit and Jefferson's experiments at growing tropical fruit in the Virginia climate.  Purposes  Thomas Jefferson's gardens had many different uses. They were used mainly to produce food and drink for the family, guests and slaves. The fruit was picked for fruit to eat, and processed for apple cider, brandy, and livestock feed. Jefferson incorporated many European trees into his fruit garden, while also maintaining a New World, Virginian feel. The vegetable gardens were used to grow tomatoes, beans, carrots, and cabbage. They were cultivated for products which Jefferson entered into food contests. The vegetable gardens were also where Jefferson did much of his experimenting. He imported many exotic vegetables, and planted seeds from other American regions, which were brought back to Virginia by Lewis and Clark. He hoped to find the best type of each vegetable by planting a variety of each. Jefferson's gardens were a major source of beauty and entertainment at Monticello. He led his guests on numerous tours, especially to visit his \\"pet trees\\", and enjoy the shade they provided.  Slave gardens and root cellars  =Purpose= Slave gardens were an integral part of plantation life. The gardens were made near slave quarters and fenced in with saplings, branches, and vines, and root cellars were located underneath the slave homes. Based on the observations of travelers, the gardens were small in comparison to the other gardens on the plantation. Slaves grew their own fruit and vegetables to supplement their rations. Vegetables included lima beans, pole beans, cabbages, collards, corn, cymlings (pattypan squash), onions, peanuts, black- eyed or other field peas, potatoes (red or sweet), and potato pumpkins. Fruits included apples, cherries, peaches, watermelons, and muskmelons. Chickens and eggs were also produced. At some plantations, some slaves were healthier than the white family living in the great house because they ate more fresh produce.Genovese, Eugene D. Roll, Jordan, Roll: the World the Slaves Made, New York, NY: Vintage, 1972. Print. The slaves benefited in other ways from the food they produced. They grew some crops out of season, and could sell them to the master and his family. They sold their produce and poultry to other plantations or in local markets if they could get to a town. The plantation mistress bought produce from the slaves. Records kept by Martha Jefferson's granddaughter, Anne Carey Randolph, show that she purchased goods from over forty slaves. Jefferson's slaves benefited from the slave-master bargaining over produce. Though Monticello had a garden, it was not always a reliable food source because Jefferson liked to use his garden to experiment with different plants. The produce cultivated by the slaves was needed for meals in the house as well. The slaves received money and business experience as a result of their gardening and poultry production. They used the money or credit to buy goods such as toys, ribbons, and kitchen utensils. Slaves developed bargaining skills by bartering with the mistress of the house or Jefferson's overseer when selling their crops. =Labor= Slaves worked in their own gardens at night or on Sundays. Although the strength of adult males was needed for groundbreaking and heavy work, most of the gardening was done by older slaves. Older slaves were assigned less plantation work, and they needed the produce from the gardens because their rations were only half that of regular adults. Though slaves shared some of the food they grew with each other, unhealthy slaves and children, who needed the nutrition most, were too weak or tired to work the garden enough to produce enough food to eat or sell. =Plantation owners' viewpoints= Planters and overseers each felt differently about slave gardens. Supporters believed that the gardens tied the slaves to the land, whereas others thought that the gardens gave the slaves too much independence and made them more likely to run away. Selling their own produce gave slaves a feeling of economic freedom, against many slave masters' wishes. Jefferson's records show that though his slaves' gardens were an important part of Monticello, at times he faced problems with slaves stealing and running away, which caused him to view the gardens more negatively.  Jefferson's influence  Thomas Jefferson loved to garden. He fell in love with designing gardens immediately after his inheritance of Monticello in 1757. Jefferson wanted to construct the gardens of Monticello from his own naturalistic point of view, and thus gathered materials from travelers all over the United States and other countries as well. Many of his acquaintances knew of his passion for gardening and often sent him various seeds and plants. With this assortment of seeds, Jefferson cultivated and designed his Monticello gardens according to his vision. First, Jefferson proposed a 1000-foot vegetable garden which he called the \\"hanging garden.\\" Once sown, the \\"hanging garden\\" was divided into twenty-four different growing parcels according to what was being harvested. For example, one section contained fruits, while others contained roots and leaves. Jefferson also ordered the creation of a \\"ferme ornee\\" or ornamental farm. Here, he chose to plant a large tree of varying shades of scarlet, set up rows of purple, white, and green broccoli surrounding the tree, and planted smaller cherry trees along a picturesque walkway. To complete his masterwork, Jefferson designed a pavilion to overlook his gardens and built four roads providing access to them. While Jefferson's gardens did provide his family with food, their primary purpose was to serve as his laboratory where he experimented with hundreds of different types of vegetables from all over the world. He was as meticulous in his experimentation as he had been with his design. He kept a garden book, titled the Garden Kalender, in which he documented every success and failure. He logged the exact dates his seeds were initially planted. He also noted when leaves appeared and when the flowers blossomed. Thomas Jefferson enjoyed experimenting with his gardens and working to produce fruits that were difficult to grow, such as pears, plums, and apricots, even though he rarely succeeded. In his garden book, Jefferson stated that his favorite fruit was the Carnation cherry. He believed it was \\"superior to all the others.\\" Jefferson also took great interest in the production of grape vines. He aspired to make Monticello-grown wine, but he often failed at his attempts to cultivate grapes. Not willing to give up, Jefferson imported several different vines from America and Europe but never achieved his goal. Still, Jefferson's hard work did not go unnoticed. Near the end of his life, he received an award from the French Society of Agriculture for his unique invention of a plow moldboard, which assisted the cutting blade and was advancement in plow creation. He loved presenting his work to guests of Monticello and was proud that his gardens were constantly evolving throughout his life.  Modern  Painting of Monticello from the West Front After the death of Thomas Jefferson, Monticello was sold to other owners. Uriah P. Levy, a 5th- generation American whose ancestors were early settlers in Charleston, purchased it in 1834 and restored it, investing in repairs which Jefferson and his family had been unable to make because of their debts. After his death, lawsuits among heirs meant the property deteriorated; finally Levi's nephew, Jefferson Monroe Levy, bought out the other heirs in 1879. Like his uncle, he invested much money in restoring the house and grounds. In 1923, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation (now the Thomas Jefferson Foundation) was founded to preserve Monticello, as it was a larger task than one person could afford. Soon after acquiring it, the Restoration Committee hired architects to restore the house and grounds. They left Monticello and Jefferson's gardens without completing the task, especially because of the expenses during the Great Depression. In 1938, president of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, Stuart Gibboney, contacted The Garden Club of Virginia about Monticello. He asked the club to help restore the gardens and its members agreed. When preparing to repair the gardens, members of the Garden Club of Virginia discovered that Jefferson's garden book had been left behind. Upon reading it, they found Jefferson had included his desired plans for restoration in it. The Garden Club worked to follow Jefferson's wishes, renovating the home and gardens according to his design. The renovations brought the life and beauty of the past back to the gardens. In addition, the Garden Club restored the cemetery of Jefferson's family, which is now owned and operated by the Monticello Association, a private lineage society of his descendants. The Club continues to maintain the grounds. Today, tourists flock to visit Monticello and its well-kept gardens.

He was ranked 77th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019. =2019 season= On July 24, 2019, Lewan announced in a video that he was suspended four games after failing a drug test for a banned substance. He was reinstated from suspension on September 30, and was activated on October 4. Lewan started all twelve of the Titans remaining regular season games, blocking for Derrick Henry as he won the league rushing yards title. The Titans finished 9-7 for the fourth consecutive year and qualified for the 2019-20 NFL playoffs, making it to their first AFC Championship Game since 2000 where they lost to eventual Super Bowl LIV champions Kansas City Chiefs. Lewan started all three of the Titans playoff games, blocking for Henry as he ran for almost 200 rushing yards in each of the first two games. =2020 season= During a Week 6 overtime win over the Houston Texans, Lewan suffered a knee injury and an MRI the next day revealed the injury to be a torn ACL, prematurely ending his 2020 season. Legal troubles On October 30, 2014, Lewan pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of drunk and disorderly and disturbing the peace in a Washtenaw County district courthouse. The plea deal included the dismissal of one count of aggravated assault and two counts of assault and battery. These charges stemmed from an incident where he allegedly assaulted two Ohio State fans outside of the Brown Jug restaurant during the early morning hours of December 1, 2013.http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/10/ex- michigan_football_lineman_t.html Personal life Lewan resides in Nashville with his wife Taylin Gallacher and his daughter Wynne Rebel Lewan.

It is desirable that a greater proportion of this horizontal change in crown width be achieved in the vertical distance between the implant platform and the gingival margin (gumline) so as to achieve an emergence profile as similar to natural as possible. The vertical dimension between the implant platform and the gingival margin is termed running room. In implant dentistry, running room refers to the apico-coronal distance between the platform of a dental implant and the gingival margin. It is a critical factor in restorative implant dentistry because it is effectively the \\"vertical distance [available subgingivaly] to make a transition from the smaller diameter prosthetic platform of an implant to the larger cross-sectional cervical shape of the tooth being restored.\\"Cavallaro Jr. JS, Greenstein G: Prosthodontic complications related to non-optimal dental implant placement. In Froum, editor: Dental Implant Complications: Etiology, Prevention, and Treatment. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell 2010. page 157 The term was coined by Jonathan Zamzok, a Manhattan prosthodontist, in the late 1990s.Zamzok J. _Nonsurgical soft tissue sculpting_. Alpha Omegan 1997;90:65-69 Rationale Adequate running room is necessary to allow the implant-supported crown to exhibit a tooth-shaped contour despite the smaller diameter and circular nature of implant platforms.Smith RB, Tarnow DP. _Classification of molar extraction sites for immediate dental implant placement: technical note_. Int J Oral Maxillofac Impl 2013;28:911-916 For example, the mean mesial-distal dimension of a maxillary central incisor at the points at which it contacts the adjacent teeth is 8.6 mm, and the mean mesial-distal dimension of the same tooth at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) is 6.4 mm.Scheid RC, Woelfel JB. Woelfel's Dental Anatomy: its relevance to dentistry, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2007 Even though the implant diameter chosen for the maxillary central incisor is usually around 4-5 mm, the supragingival tooth contours need to mimic those of the natural tooth if esthetic success is intended. As the anatomical crown and root tapers towards the apex, the mesial-distal dimension decreases, and so the mean mesial-distal dimension at the marginal crest of bone, which lies approximately 2 mm apical to the CEJ, is smaller. The tooth has the apico- coronal distance from the marginal crest of bone to the contact point in order to increase from the much narrower mesial-distal dimension to the greater mesial-distal dimension, and this distance is subgingival (below the gum line). Running room refers to this subgingival apico-coronal distance. In general, it is recommended that implants be given approximately 3mm of running room in compliance with the rule of thumb that implants should be placed as deep as necessary and as shallow as possible.Greenstein G, Cavallaro J. _The relationship between biologic concepts and fabrication of surgical guides for dental implant placement_. Compendium 2007;28(4):130-137 When implants are placed too palatally or lingually due to aberrant anatomical landmarks, bone resorption or surgical error, it is wise to place the implant more apically to increase the available running room in order to allow for a more convex emergence profile and avoid a buccal ridge-lap of the prosthetic crown in fixed partial denture cases. Similarly, when narrower than normal implant connections are used, deeper placement may enhance one's ability to generate an optimal emergence profile.

Snarky Puppy combines a variety of jazz idioms, rock, world music, and funk and has won three Grammy Awards. Although the band has worked with vocalists, League described Snarky Puppy as \\"a pop band that improvises a lot, without vocals\\". History The band was formed as a 10-piece group by Michael League in Denton, Texas, after his second year at the University of North Texas, in 2004, ‚ÄúBecause I was so bad,‚Äù he recalled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt place into any of the school ensembles. So Snarky Puppy was my way of getting to play.‚Äù The group has grown into an international super-band made up of \\"...a wide-ranging assemblage of musicians known affectionately as \\"'The Fam\\".\\" In more than 15 years since its founding, about 40 players have performed in \\"The Fam\\" on guitar, bass, keyboards, woodwinds, brass, strings, drums, and percussion, but six of the 10 members on the first studio album The Only Constant remain on the regular roster. Many past and present band members were students at the University of North Texas. Members have performed with Erykah Badu, Marcus Miller, Justin Timberlake, Stanley Clarke, Kirk Franklin, Ari Hoenig, Roy Hargrove, David Crosby, Snoop Dogg, and many other artists. While touring, the band has given clinics, workshops, and master classes in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and most members either lead or are primary players in other working recording bands. In 2005, League self-released the band's unofficial first album Live at Uncommon Ground. Snarky Puppy's next three albums were released independently, after which Tell Your Friends, groundUP, Family Dinner: Volume One, and We Like It Here were released on the band's GroundUP imprint on Ropeadope. The album We Like It Here was performed and recorded live in October 2013 at the artistic compound Kytopia in Utrecht, Netherlands. On January 26, 2014, Snarky Puppy and vocalist Lalah Hathaway won a Grammy Award in the Best R&B; Performance category for their rendition of the Brenda Russell song \\"Something\\" from Family Dinner ‚Äì Volume 1. Sylva debuted at number one on the Billboard magazine Heatseekers Chart, the Jazz Album chart, and the Contemporary Jazz Album chart. The album won the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. The album Culcha Vulcha (2016) won the 2017 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. Friday 26th April, 2019, the band released the first bonus track from Immigrance. Immigrance is the latest evolution of the band as League noted to David Browne in Rolling Stone: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre more into setting up nice grooves that we like and sitting with things a bit longer.‚Äù Label With the release of the album GroundUP in 2012, Snarky Puppy started its own imprint, GroundUP Music, on Ropeadope Records.. It was inspired by the idea of helping lesser-known artists capitalize on Snarky Puppy's growing fanbase. In 2016, GroundUP Music left Ropeadope and partnered with Universal Music for three years of releases and is now a fully independent label. It has released albums by David Crosby, Snarky Puppy, Becca Stevens, Bokant√©, Banda Magda, Alina Engibaryan, Charlie Hunter, Breastfist, Sirintip, Mark Lettieri, House of Waters, PRD Mais, Roosevelt Collier, Forq, Lucy Woodward, The Funky Knuckles, Michelle Willis, Cory Henry, Justin Stanton, Bill Laurance, and Maz.  GroundUP Music Festival  In 2017, the GroundUP Music Festival, also known as GUMFest, debuted within the grounds of the North Beach Band Shell in North Beach, Miami. The first GroundUP Music Festival was initiated by Andy Hurwitz, directed by Paul Lehr, and artistically directed by Michael League. The festival features performances by Snarky Puppy all three nights, with a line-up curated by League that has featured Michael McDonald, Cecile McLorin Salvant, David Crosby, B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones, The Wood Brothers, Robert Glasper, Knower, Concha Buika, C4 Trio, Pedrito Martinez, Jojo Mayer + Nerve, Mark Guiliana's Beat Music, John Medeski's Mad Skillet, Charlie Hunter Trio, Laura Mvula, Eliades Ochoa, Esperanza Spalding, Lionel Loueke, Joshua Redman, Terence Blanchard, Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, MARO, and Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band as well as the full GroundUP Music roster, among others. Through February 2020, GroundUP Music Festival, Miami, has become an annual event. Band members Snarky Puppy is sometimes referred to as a \\"collective.\\" The band's current roster boasts about 19 members, and well over 40 musicians have performed with the group over the years and through the group's 13 albums. Michael League explains that, in the early days of the original 10-piece band, if someone got an opportunity to earn more money than for the band's gig, \\"...we'd get a substitute and if the substitute played well, then it felt like, 'Well, they learned the music and played great, what a waste for them to learn all that for one gig...' so we would kind of just keep them in the Rolodex, so to speak, and rotate them in and out. Then it became a thing where we started touring so much that guys couldn't do all the dates, or didn't want to, or whatever.\\" When people came in, the differences in their playing would influence all those on the date. \\"That would change the way that they played the music. And then even when that new person left, that memory of that new relationship with the music would remain. So really we just kept building on the personalities of the new people that would come in, brick by brick. ...in general, the guys understand what the band is‚Äì a rotating cast... But I don't really think of Snarky Puppy as a collective. It's just a large band and sometimes people aren't there. It doesn't feel like a revolving door, it doesn't feel anonymous at all. The guys who have played gigs with us the least have still played several hundred gigs. That's more than most people play with their own bands. So it's very much a tight, familial unit. Everyone feels very, very close and very essential, also.\\" Members listed on the notes of album Immigrance (2019): * Michael League ‚Äì bass guitar, oud, percussion * Jay Jennings ‚Äì trumpet, flugelhorn * Mike Maher ‚Äì trumpet, flugelhorn * Chris Bullock ‚Äì tenor and soprano saxophones, bass clarinet, flute, alto flute, bansuri, percussion * Bob Reynolds ‚Äì tenor saxophone * Zach Brock ‚Äì violin * Bill Laurance ‚Äì piano, keyboards * Shaun Martin ‚Äì keyboards * Bobby Sparks ‚Äì keyboards * Justin Stanton ‚Äì keyboards, trumpet * Bob Lanzetti ‚Äì guitars * Mark Lettieri ‚Äì guitars * Chris McQueen ‚Äì guitars * Robert \\"Sput\\" Searight ‚Äì drums * Larnell Lewis ‚Äì drums * Jamison Ross ‚Äì drums * Jason Thomas ‚Äì drums * ‚Äì percussion * Nate Werth ‚Äì percussion * Marcelo Woloski ‚Äì percussion Awards and honors * 2013 Grammy Award for Best R&B; Performance, \\"Something\\" * 2013 Best Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist, JazzTimes Readers' Poll * 2013 Best New Artist, JazzTimes Readers' Poll * 2015 Best Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist, JazzTimes Critic' Poll * 2015 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album, Sylva * 2015 Jazz Group of the Year, DownBeat Readers' Poll * 2016 Jazz Group of the Year, DownBeat Readers' Poll \\\\ * 2016 Best Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist, JazzTimes Readers' Poll * 2016 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album, Culcha Vulcha \\\\ * 2017 Best Electric/Jazz- Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist, JazzTimes Readers' Poll \\\\ * 2017 Jazz Group of the Year, DownBeat Readers' Poll \\\\ * 2018 Best Electric/Jazz- Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist, JazzTimes Readers' Poll * 2019 Jazz Group of the Year, DownBeat Readers' Poll Discography * Live at Uncommon Ground (Sitmom, 2005) - self-release * The Only Constant (Sitmom, 2006) * The World Is Getting Smaller (Sitmom, 2007) * Bring Us the Bright (Sitmom, 2008) * Tell Your Friends (Ropeadope, 2010) * groundUP (GroundUP, 2012) * Amkeni with Bukuru Celestin (Ropeadope, 2013) * Family Dinner ‚Äì Volume 1 (Ropeadope, 2013) * We Like It Here (Ropeadope, 2014) * Sylva with Metropole Orkest (Impulse!, 2015) * Family Dinner ‚Äì Volume 2 (GroundUP, Universal Music Classics, 2016) * Culcha Vulcha (GroundUP, 2016) * Immigrance (GroundUP, 2019) * Live At The Royal Albert Hall (GroundUP, 2020) References External links * Official website Category:American jazz ensembles Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Musical groups from Denton, Texas Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:Jazz fusion ensembles Category:Jazz musicians from Texas Category:GroundUPmusic artists Category:Ropeadope Records artists Category:Impulse!

Established in 1971, as of 2013 approximately five-percent of UMass graduates were receiving their undergraduate degrees through the program annually. History The University of Massachusetts' University Without Walls was one of a number of similar programs founded at 17 American universities in 1971 with the help of a grant from the United States Office of Education (other participating institutions included the University of Minnesota, the University of South Carolina, and Howard University). Samuel Baskin was considered the \\"driving force\\" behind the nationwide initiative. In 2010, Mark Cerasuolo became the first University of Massachusetts graduate from the University Without Walls program to deliver the University of Massachusetts' student commencement address.UWW website As of 2013, an average of 250 students were annually receiving bachelor's degrees through the UMass University Without Walls program, out of approximately 5,000 total undergraduate degrees annually awarded by the University of Massachusetts. Between 1971 and 2015, the University of Massachusetts had awarded approximately 3,000 degrees to students through the UWW program. The program enrolls more students who are veterans of the U.S. armed forces than any other academic department at the University of Massachusetts. Structure The UMass University Without Walls program only admits students who have already completed a minimum number of undergraduate university credits at the University of Massachusetts, or at another accredited institution, and have a minimum cumulative grade point average in those credits. Once enrolled, students are required to take four program-specific courses, plus additional classes equal to the difference between their accumulated university credits and the University of Massachusetts' 120-credit graduation requirement. Program-specific courses are taught by dedicated UMass University Without Walls faculty and deal with academic writing, critical thinking, research skills, and issues analysis. Students who require additional courses to meet the 120-credit requirement make up the deficit through standard University of Massachusetts classes taken from the school's other academic departments. Because the University Without Walls program functions as a regular academic department within the University of Massachusetts, students do not undertake an academic major (baccalaureate degrees are awarded in \\"University Without Walls\\"). Instead, nine interdisciplinary areas of study are offered - including applied psychology, arts administration, and journalism - each consisting of courses from several academic fields drawn from both the student's previously completed credits as well as University of Massachusetts courses he or she completes while enrolled in the program. =Social justice residency= Beginning in 2012, the UWW program began offering a \\"social justice residency,\\" a one-credit, three-day, intensive course held at the University of Massachusetts' Springfield Center that teaches the \\"theory and practice of social justice activism, particularly as related to racial and economic inequality.\\" People =Alumni= * Nubar Alexanian - documentary photographer * Julius Erving - NBA player * Clare Higgins - mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts * Thomas Merrigan - Franklin County, Massachusetts commissioner * Lou Roe - NBA player Former Minuteman Lou Roe excited to join Derek Kellogg's staff at UMass, Daily Hampshire Gazette, August 22, 2012 * Jeff Taylor - founder of monster.comTHUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN - Breaking Down Walls, The Republican, Monday, June 25, 2007 * Steve Turre - Jazz Trombonist * Serena Williams - professional tennis player (student) * Marcus Camby - NBA player =Faculty= * Lawrence Hott * Lisa Aronson Fontes * Robert S.

He played a key role in the independence movement as the first military leader of the patriotic militias.  Biography  Juan de Salinas was born in the town of Sangolqui, near the Ecuadorian capital of Quito, on November 24, 1755. His father was Diego Salinas, a man of Basque descent who was sent to the Americas as governor of Yahuarzongo, and his mother was Maria de Zenitagoya, from a wealthy Quito family. He studied philosophy and law at Santo Tomas University in Quito, but decided to pursue a military career, becoming an officer in President Jose Diguja‚Äôs escort. In that capacity he was ordered to pacify the area around Otavalo, which was experiencing an uprising of the indigenous peoples. Returning from this campaign around 1778, he was sent with Apolinar Diez de la Fuente, who had just opened a route from Quito to Quijos in the Amazon, to define the border with Brazil. They reached the Mara√±√≥n river around April 1780, but Salinas fell ill and had to return to Pevas. Once recovered he spent the next few years exploring the Amazonian jungle, but in 1783 he became ill again and was ordered back to the highlands, where he was stationed in the military garrison of the Royal Audiencia of Quito. In that city he married Maria de la Vega y Nates in 1794. By 1801 he was commanding the military corps stationed in Quito and seemed to be very popular with the troops for his generous character and proven valor. Around 1803 he was sent on a mission that took him and his troops all the way the Isthmus of Panama, where he encountered trouble with the local authorities. On his return to Quito he found a city in conflict, divided into two factions: the capetones, or European-born Spaniards, and the criollos (American-born Spaniards). The criollo elites resented the way in which the Spanish-born were preferred for high-level bureaucratic appointments. Salinas joined the group of local criollos that espoused somewhat liberal ideas of self-government. On December 25, 1808, he went to the meeting that the Marques de Selva Alegre had arranged on his estate in the valley of Chillos. Here the \\"revolutionary\\" group decided to establish a Supreme Junta to govern the Royal Audiencia of Quito. But only in August 1809 did the group find their opportunity, using Napoleon's invasion of Spain to justify the creation of an autonomous government in the Audiencia. While declaring loyalty to King Ferdinand VII of Spain, they took power from the appointed Spanish representatives. On the morning of August 10 Salinas went to the barracks he commanded and convinced the troops that it was their patriotic duty to resist the French usurpation. He took three battalions into the streets to start the revolt and gain effective power in the capital. Salinas was given the rank of colonel by the Junta, while the Marques de Selva Alegre, somewhat forcedly, was given overall command of the government and the small army. It was a poorly organized and ill-equipped group. The noble (titled) leaders were uncomfortable with the radical turn the revolt had taken, as they had wanted better treatment from Madrid, not a complete severing of ties from the mother country. It took the royal forces less than two months to organize a counterrevolution. On October 13 the Marques de Selva Alegre offered his resignation to the Junta and was replaced by his kinsman the Count of Selva Florida, who started talks with the deposed Count Ruiz de Castilla, the royal representative of Spain. The viceroy of Peru sent troops under the command of Manuel de Arredondo. They arrived in Quito on November 24, promptly took over the city and returned Ruiz de Castilla to power. Salinas was imprisoned on December 4 and taken to the military barracks, charged with treason. He spent the next eight months imprisoned in the military dungeons with other \\"conspirators\\". His wife and daughters were under house arrest, but arranged for a group of patriots to try to free her husband. On August 2, 1810, while the people of Quito were trying to save them, the imprisoned men were butchered by the troops as they lay in their cells. His wife and daughters were taken to be hanged in the central plaza, but the nuns of the Convent of Concepcion intervened and gave them refuge. Salinas's youngest daughter Maria del Carmen, who was born while he was in captivity, married Manuel de Asc√°subi, who also took part in the independence process and helped in the formation of the young Ecuadorian nation. The family was persecuted and their holdings expropriated until the War of Independence ended and the victorious Marshall Antonio Jos√© de Sucre returned to Salinas's heirs all that had been taken. Juan de Salinas is remembered as the first military leader in what is now Ecuador and one of the first martyrs of the Wars of Independence.

The present buildings are mostly of local stone, and several are thatched. The civil parish was combined in 1934 with neighbouring Teffont Magna to form a united Teffont parish. Location Teffont Evias lies northeast of the large village of Tisbury and west of Wilton. The southern boundary of both the former Teffont Evias parish, and the modern Teffont parish, is the Nadder. The village street follows a stream which rises at Teffont Magna and flows south to join the Nadder.

The modern name derives from \\"Teo\\", an old Germanic word meaning a boundary, and the Late Latin word \\"fontana\\", meaning a spring of water. The perennial stream rises at Spring Head at the north end of Teffont Magna, and flows some 2.5 km south to its debouchment into the River Nadder.

From Saxon times the village has been generally on the valley bottom along the course of the stream; the Teffont Archaeology Project found remains of Roman settlement, possibly a sacred site, on higher ground. The River Nadder at the site of Teffont Mill For administration, including punishment of misconduct, the village formed part of Dunworth hundred; in 1502 its tithingman was presented to the hundred court for not carrying a staff as precedent required. According to Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870‚Äì1872): The civil parishes of Teffont Magna and Teffont Evias were combined in 1934 to form Teffont parish. The population of Teffont Evias in 1931 had been 98. Buildings Teffont Manor (left, with water tower) is close to the church (right) These are scattered along the valley of the south- flowing stream and the road, in irregular clumps giving views of the woods and fields. The manor house and its adjoining church date largely from the 15th century, with significant embellishments and extensions especially in the 19th century; to the east of the manor house a former lodge from early in that century is in rubble stone under a thatched roof. There are several workers' cottages in vernacular styles, some with carved dates in the 1600s. The house known as Bridges, built in the 18th century and extended and altered in 1842, was the rectory until 1939. William and Emily Fane de Salis paid for the building of a small school in the 1860s (closed in 1876 after Teffont Magna school opened) and opposite it, in 1883, a pair of almshouses (now Acacia Cottages). =Church= St Michael's Church The Anglican Church of St Michael and All Angels is Grade II* listed. The present building, in local rubble stone and ashlar with a tiled roof, is largely a rebuilding of 1824‚Äì26 to designs of Charles Fowler, at the expense of John Mayne. A church is first mentioned in the 12th century but the structure prior to the rebuilding was from the 16th and 17th; the Ley family's north chapel of 1630 was retained while the chancel and nave were rebuilt with higher walls, a north aisle was added, and the northwest tower was built. The buttressed tower has three stages and a parapet with four spirelets; between 1830 and 1843 a tall recessed spire was added. Pevsner writes: \\"It is an impressive steeple, and indeed an impressive church, rising on the lawn of the Manor House\\".  Interior  Inside are effigies and tombs of Henry Ley (d. 1574) and his two sons, and an early 19th-century reredos.

Parish  The rectory was united in 1922 with the newly created benefice of Teffont Magna (until then a chapelry of Dinton), retaining the rectory house at Teffont Evias. The benefice was held in plurality with Dinton from 1952. In 1979 the benefice became part of a group ministry, today called the Nadder Valley team and covering fourteen parishes with sixteen churches. The church's parish registers survive in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre for the following dates: christenings 1684‚Äì1991, marriages 1701‚Äì1994, and burials 1683‚Äì1991.Teffont Evias at genuki.org.uk. Retrieved 9 November 2010. In 1914 the Reverend Sir Douglas Edward Scott, 7th Baronet, was appointed as the parish's rector. Shortly afterwards he was declared bankrupt and his rectorship terminated; four years later, he was convicted of bigamy and imprisoned. Governance Teffont Evias is now part of the parish of Teffont, which has a parish council and is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions. It falls within the South West Wiltshire parliamentary constituency and the serving Member of Parliament is Andrew Murrison. Proprietors of the manor Thomas Hungerford (d.1397) bought a 114-acre estate at Teffont Evias in 1377‚Äì8. The estate continued in the Hungerford family but after the attainder in 1461 of Robert Hungerford, 3rd Baron Hungerford it was granted to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, later Richard III. The attainder was reversed in 1485 and the manor was restored to Walter Hungerford of Farleigh (d.1516). His grandson Walter, later 1st Baron Hungerford of Heytesbury, inherited in 1522 but in 1540 he was attainted by act of parliament and executed for treason, sorcery, and offences forbidden by the Buggery Act 1533, with his estate forfeited to the Crown.Parliament Roll, 31 & 32 Henry VIII, m. 42.

The Crown granted the manor to Henry Ley (d.1574), whose descendant James ‚Äì created Earl of Marlborough in 1626 ‚Äì sold it to John Ash in 1652. His grandson sold it to Christopher Mayne in 1692, and ownership was to continue in the Mayne family until 1907. Emily-Harriet Mayne, Mrs Fane de Salis from 1859, eldest daughter of John Thomas Mayne; portrait by alt= Christopher Mayne (1655‚Äì1701), descendant of a prosperous though plebeian Exeter family, bought the manor in 1679 for ¬£12,000 and moved there in 1692. The manor continued in the Mayne family until it was sold in 1802, then was bought back in 1813 by John Thomas Mayne, FRS, FSA, (1792‚Äì1843), of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. In response to the severe distress of the labouring population and the ensuing riots, he became an \\"indefatigable reformer\\", circulating a petition for parliamentary reform and reduced expenditure which was signed by over 14,000 inhabitants of the county, and presented to Parliament on 10 February 1831. With friends, J. T. Mayne enlarged Teffont Evias church and gave it its present tower and steeple. He also extended and remodelled the manor house, and increased the woodland in the parish. He attempted to improve his family tree: he included in it connections (which he could not document) to two West Country clergymen, the Catholic (now Saint) Cuthbert Mayne and the Anglican Jasper Mayne, and he spent many days researching and copying the documents of the aristocratic, extinct Mayne family of Kent, then claiming them (and some of their portraits, one still in Teffont) as his own ancestors.Soldiers, Saints, and Scallywags. David Gore. Wiltshire Family History Society 1997, pp.15‚Äì18. Published by the author, 2009. From 1852 until her death in 1896, J. T. Mayne's eldest daughter Emily, and her husband William Fane de Salis, were in charge. They built the present service court and water tower of the manor house. Their marriage was childless, so on Emily's death in 1896 the house and estate passed to her next unmarried sister Margaret (d.1905), then to the youngest sister Ellen-Flora (1829‚Äì1907), Mrs. Maurice Keatinge, and thence to Ellen's eldest son Richard Keatinge. He sold it to his younger brothers Maurice Walter and Gerald Francis (1872‚Äì1965),Audrey McBain and Lynette Nelson, The Bounding Spring (Black Horse Press, 2003, ) who shared the advowson of the benefice of Teffont Evias with the patrons of the church of Dinton.'Teffont Magna', in A History of the County of Wiltshire, Volume 8: Warminster, Westbury and Whorwellsdown Hundreds (1965), pp. 74‚Äì78, accessed 7 July 2011. Maurice died childless and in 1947 Gerald passed the estate to his son Edgar Keatinge (1905‚Äì1998), later Sir Edgar, who had been a Conservative MP for a short time. In 1958 the advowson was transferred to the Bishop of Salisbury.

It has distinctive lobed leaves and yellow flowerheads which appear in spring and summer. It is one of the many species described by the botanist Robert Brown Description Isopogon trilobus grows as a shrub anywhere from in height. The new stems are pale to reddish brown, and initially covered with small fine hairs before becoming smooth. Its leaves are highly variable and have anywhere from three to nine small to deep lobes. The barrel-shaped yellow inflorescences appear from September to January and are terminal (occurring on the ends of stems). Measuring across, they contain many yellow or cream individual flowers. Flowering is followed by the development of relatively large hairy grey fruit. Taxonomy Botanist Robert Brown described Isopogon trilobus in 1810, from a collection possibly from Lucky Bay on the southern Western Australian coast. Isopogon tripartitus R.Br., which Brown described in 1830, is now considered a synonym of the older name. The species name is derived from the Latin terms tri- \\"three\\", and lobus \\"lobe\\", and relates to the leaves. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and that species had already been placed by Richard Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus on the grounds of priority, and made the new combination Atylus trilobus for this species, as well as A. tripartitus for I. tripartitus. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905. Distribution and habitat The range is from the Stirling Range east to Israelite Bay along the south coast of Western Australia. It grows on sandplains, dunes or rocky outcrops, on sandy soils, sometimes over laterite, in heathland or shrubland communities. Ecology The colletid bee Hylaeus sanguinipictus and halictid bee Lasioglossum caesium have been recorded visiting the flowerheads of Isopogon trilobus. Cultivation Sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, Isopogon trilobus requires excellent drainage and full sun. It will likely not tolerate humid climates. Grafting onto eastern species such as I.anethifolius or I.dawsonii could render it more adaptable to a wider climatic range. Its dense habit and large fruit give it its horticultural potential.

The Bayside Centre opened in August 2000, home of Bayside Church Cheltenham location. Bayside Church continued to grow to incorporate three services - Saturday night, Sunday morning and Sunday evening. In November 2005, a new location in Frankston opened kick-starting the vision of multi-locations in the Bayside suburbs. Media In 2002, a media production arm of Bayside Church was born. Bayside Media produces an engaging TV show \\"The Exchange\\". The Exchange is broadcast on C31 Melbourne, Australian Christian Channel as well as internationally on United Kingdom‚Äôs UCB. www.theexchangetv.com.au  Beliefs  Bayside Church is a non- denominational Pentecostal church which is affiliated with Crosslink Christian Network, an Australian based group of Churches and Christian Ministries. The Church‚Äôs beliefs are evangelical and Pentecostal in that they \\"wholeheartedly\\" believe that the Bible is the inspired, infallible and authoritative written Word of God (2 Tim 3:16; 2 Peter 1:19-21). They also hold that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14), and that Jesus Christ, as the son of God, reconciled humanity through his death and resurrection and that everyone is invited to accept this gift of salvation. The Church also believes that salvation can only take place with the regenerative work of the Holy Spirit and that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is given to believers who ask. The Holy Spirit also gives supernatural gifts to believers. In October 2009, Bayside Church became the first Pentecostal church in Australia to welcome LGBT+ people who want to follow Jesus. Rob Buckingham Until the age of 19, Rob Buckingham was a self-professed atheist and didn't think too highly of Christians. While hitchhiking around Australia, Rob had a near-death experience in a truck as it collided with another truck. Both the driver and Rob survived the ordeal, but the occupants in the other truck, unfortunately, didn't. After leaving the hospital, Rob was invited to stay with the truck driver‚Äôs family. They were devout Christians and decided to challenge his perception that God was nonexistent. Shortly after Rob attended their church and committed his life to Jesus. Rob became a popular professional breakfast announcer on 6GE in Geraldton, Western Australia. In 1984, Rob was called to pastoral ministry and attended Commonwealth Bible College in Katoomba, NSW, where he trained to become an ordained pastor. In 1988, Rob moved to Melbourne to become an Assistant Pastor at Lighthouse Church in Keysborough serving as Minister of Christian Education. Despite his call to Christian ministry, Rob continued to work in radio and worked at 3MP for 15 years and hosted 3MP's Rob Buckingham and Friends program each Sunday from 1993-1999. He interviewed guests such as Whitney Houston, Lionel Ritchie as well as many well-known community figures. In 1992, Rob started a church in Cheltenham which he commenced with a small group of people. The church has grown to 2,000 in 2013. In 1994 Rob Buckingham married Christie McClay and together they have led Bayside Church. In December 2002 Rob began working with Melbourne's new Christian radio station, Light FM, where he worked as Music Director for many years.

It connects Mexican Federal Highway 1 on the Mexican side with Interstate 5 on the American side. The San Ysidro Port of Entry is one of three ports of entry in the San Diego‚ÄìTijuana metropolitan region. Gateways There is a northbound and southbound vehicle crossing, as well as two separate bidirectional pedestrian crossings. =Northbound vehicle crossing= There are currently 25 northbound vehicle lanes to cross from Mexico to the U.S. which will increase to 34 lanes (and 62 booths) when the expansion project is complete.San Ysidro Port of Entry Fact Sheet, http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist11/departments/planning/pdfs/GSA_SanYsidro_Fact_Sheet.pdf =Southbound vehicle crossing (El Chaparral)= The southbound lanes of Interstate 5 which take vehicles into Mexico have been moved west of their previous location through the new El Chaparral Point of Entry ().Project Overview, This relocation and expansion was necessary to provide space for the construction of new administrative and border inspection facilities and to increase the number of northbound vehicle lanes. The El Chaparral gateway also has a vehicle and passenger inspection station at which U.S. officials may conduct inspections of southbound traffic, and provides for more thorough inspection of southbound traffic by Mexican officials. El Chaparral was the name of the Tijuana border crossing prior to the 1983 modifications. =Eastern/main pedestrian crossing= Pedestrians may cross northbound immediately east of the northbound vehicle crossing. As of May 2017 they are temporarily processed in the Milo building while a new facility is built to the west. There are currently 15 pedestrian lanes, and more will be added with the current expansion project. The eastern (main) southbound pedestrian crossing is east of the northbound crossing, immediately south of the San Ysidro trolley station. Pedestrians pass through the 6.9-million-dollar, three-story Puerta Este M√©xico-San Ysidro building, opened in August 2015, containing Mexican passport control and customs which since late 2017 exits to a path leading to Frontera street just southwest of Ferrocarril street. Prior to 2012 the southbound pedestrian crossing was west of the northbound vehicle crossing and exited to a bridge leading to Plaza Viva Tijuana. =PedWest (western pedestrian crossing)= The PedWest pedestrian crossing is located at the east side of the Las Americas outlet mall where Virginia Avenue dead-ends at the border, immediately west of the El Chaparral port of entry into Mexico. On the Mexican side a walkway connects PedWest southeastward, ending across the street from the Plaza Viva Tijuana mall, from which there is a bridge to Downtown Tijuana. PedWest opened for northbound pedestrians in July 2016 and July 31, 2017 for southbound pedestrians. PedWest improved efficiency as now 63,000 people pass through it each day. There are 10 northbound and 2 reversible lanes. This has also become a better alternative for pedestrian traffic, due to the Southbound I-5 re-alignment.

File:SY_LPOE_sign.jpgPhoto of the sign on the East Pedestrian Facility at the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry. History There has been a land border inspection station in the community of San Ysidro since the early 20th century. San Ysidro Border Inspection Station in 1922 Cars, pedestrians, trucks and trains have been inspected at this crossing. In the 1950s, due to congestion, truck traffic was moved a short distance west to a crossing at Virginia Avenue. Then in 1983, the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was opened and all truck traffic is now inspected there. In 1933 the NRHP-listed Old Customs House was built in Mission Revival style, and still stands housing offices. Mission Revival-style Old Customs House, in a photo from 1981 The current San Ysidro Land Port of Entry facility was constructed in the 1970s to meet the needs of the time and the projected growth in the coming years. This port is considered the busiest international port of entry in the world in terms of individual crossers and vehicle movements from one country to another. With over 90,000 daily commuters crossing between Tijuana and San Diego, commuting has become a challenge for everyday commuters in the metropolitan region; visitors to and from Baja California spend one to three, and as many as five, hours waiting to enter into the United States. U.S. Border and Customs officials have said that newly implemented inspection technology and properly processing the large number of persons and vehicles who go through the port on a daily basis have resulted in long lines and long wait times.The article states: \\"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials are warning of delays this summer 2008 at California border crossings as they install new technology. They say the new tools will ultimately decrease wait times.\\" =2018 confrontation= On Sunday, November 25, 2018, groups of Central American migrants tried to forcibly cross the border into the United States. Some of them threw rocks at US Border Patrol agents, who responded by firing tear gas into the crowd which included families with small children. The firing of tear gas across the international border into Mexico was immediately protested by the Foreign Ministry of Mexico, which demanded a full investigation. Expansion project The San Ysidro Land Port of Entry Expansion Project is a bi-national effort between the United States and Mexican governments which aims for the demolition, relocation, expansion, renovation, modernization and construction of new administrative and operational facilities of the current land port of entry in the San Ysidro district of San Diego. The project calls for a complete overhaul of the current international border inspection facilities on both sides of the border at a total cost of about $625 million which includes $577 millionProject Funding, http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103065 for the expansion of the northbound U.S. point of entry and roughly $48 million (MXN $598) for the construction of an entirely new southbound Mexican point of entry.In Spanish, El Chaparral Expansion Project, The project is being carried out in three phases:San Ysidro Construction Project, http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2010-01-25/mexico/san-ysidro-construction- project-expected-to-last-until-2015 *Phase I involves the expansion of northbound vehicle lanes, the implementation of dual primary vehicle inspection booths and a higher capacity secondary inspection facility. *Phase II involves the demolition of the current administrative building and construction of bigger replacement along with a multi-story employee parking structure. A new pedestrian processing building will also be constructed. *Phase III involves the relocation of the southbound lanes entering Mexico. These lanes will be moved west of their current location to make space for the planned expansion of new buildings, parking structure and extra northbound lanes. Their new location will allow for a southbound traffic checkpoint to facilitate U.S. officials to conduct inspection of vehicles heading to Mexico. Mexican officials will greet vehicles and occupants at a bigger and better equipped immigration and customs inspection station known as Puerta Mexico El Chaparral. After the completion of the expansion project, the total northbound lanes is expected to be 62 automobile lanes. This will also add 110,000 square feet of energy preserving and producing material. Not only is there an expected increase in lanes, but an increase in efficiency to S.E.N.T.R.I. (Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection) system. =Construction= ;2011 * On the U.S. side, construction of the new east/west pedestrian bridge was completed on February 15, 2011. * On September 14, 2011, part of the wooden panels and support beams from the construction project collapsed on vehicles crossing the border, injuring nine people, two seriously. All northbound traffic was diverted to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry for the rest of the day, causing massive traffic jams. ;2013 * On the Tijuana side construction of links to connect the new El Chaparral Facility with Via R√°pida and Avenida Internacional, which leads drivers to the western Tijuana borough of Playas de Tijuana and nearby Rosarito Beach, was built in 2013 (see below).Spanish, El Chaparral Expansion Project, http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx/portal/noticia_completa.jsp?noticia=19316 ;2015 Prior to September 2012, pedestrians walked from the U.S. to Mexico by crossing a pedestrian bridge, entering Mexico to the west of Interstate 5, and walking through a corridor leading to the west side of the crossing (Avenida de la Amistad). Then a temporary pedestrian crossing facility was built on the Mexican side on the east side of the crossing. This was replaced when in August 2015 Mexico inaugurated a new pedestrian crossing facility to the east of the northbound traffic lanes. For the first time foreigners are required to show passports when entering Mexico at the border, whereas previously they only had to be shown when entering the interior of the country.\\"New pedestrian crossing unveiled in Tijuana\\", Sandra Dibble, San Diego Union-Tribune\\", Aug. 19, 2015\\"First day of new pedestrian border crossing\\", San Diego Red, September 24, 2012 ;2016 On July 15, 2016, the PedWest pedestrian crossing and Virginia Avenue transit center were opened. On the Mexican side a temporary, partially enclosed walkway was opened connecting this crossing southeastward to the pedestrian bridge from Plaza Viva Tijuana that heads southwest to Downtown Tijuana.\\"Everything You Need to Know About PedWest, San Ysidro‚Äôs New Pedestrian Port of Entry\\", San Diego Red, July 2016 This walkway was nicknamed \\"Puente Chicanadas\\" (\\"cheap/quick fix bridge\\") and characterized by some as dangerous, suffocating and embarrassing to Mexico. In September 2016, a definitive walkway from Plaza Viva Tijuana costing 25 million pesos (about 1.3 million dollars at the time), was opened.\\"Adi√≥s al puente chicanadas; ya funciona la obra definitiva en Ped West\\", Sintesis TV, September 12, 2016 ;2017 Phase III began in September 2017, once the realignment of Southbound Interstate 5 had been completed. Once complete, it will result in an increase from 5 inspection lanes to 10. This project also includes an increase in the Northbound inspection lanes by adding 8 new lanes on the east side of the border crossing. This project does not affect existing pedestrian lanes. Architects Miller Hull Partnership are leading the third phase of the project with a budget of US$150 million.

Sanatana Dharma is presently a large facet of the collective synthesis of beliefs known as Hinduism. It often rejects previously long-established socio- religious systems based on interpretations of sectarian followers of an individual sant (saint or pontiff). The term was used by Gandhi in 1921 while describing his own religious beliefs. \\"I call myself a Sanatani Hindu, because I believe in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, and all that goes by the name of Hindu scripture, and therefore in avataras and rebirth; I believe in the varnashrama dharma in a sense, in my opinion strictly Vedic but not in its presently popular and distorted crude sense; I believe in the protection of cow. I do not disbelieve in murti puja.\\" (Young India: June 10, 1921) Sanatana dharma SanƒÅtana dharma (Devanagari: meaning \\"eternal dharma\\" or \\"eternal order\\") is another name for Hinduism. Dharma is often translated as \\"duty\\", \\"religion\\" or \\"religious duty\\", but has a deeper meaning. The word comes from the Sanskrit root \\"dhri\\" which means \\"to sustain\\" or \\"that which is integral to something\\" (e.g. dharma of sugar is to be sweet, fire to be hot). A person's dharma consists of duties that sustain him according to his innate characteristics which are both spiritual and material, generating two corresponding types: # Sanatana-dharma ‚Äì duties performed according to one's spiritual (constitutional) identity as atman and are thus the same for everyone. # Varnashrama-dharma ‚Äì duties performed according to one's material (conditional) nature and are specific to the individual at that particular time. According to the notion of sanatana-dharma, the eternal and intrinsic inclination of the living entity (atman) is to perform seva (service). Sanatana-dharma, being transcendental, refers to universal and axiomatic laws that are beyond our temporary belief systems. Today, Sanatana Dharma is associated only with Hinduism. The term was used during the Hindu revivalism movement in order to avoid having to use the term \\"Hindu\\" which is of non- native (Persian) origin.See also R. D. Baird, \\"Swami Bhaktivedanta and the Encounter with Religions\\", Modern Indian Responses to Religious Pluralism, edited by Harold Coward, State University of New York Press, 1987) Sanatana Dharma was designed as a way of life designed to best ensure the continuity of humanity on this earth and provide the entire population with spiritual sustenance. In current-day usage, the term sanatana dharma is diminished and used to emphasize a \\"traditional‚Äù or sanatani (\\"eternalist\\") outlook in contrast to the socio-political Hinduism embraced by movements such as the Arya Samaj. In sharp contrast to the efforts by Lahore Sanatana Dharma Sabha to preserve the Hindu tradition against the onslaught of reform, now it is being stressed that Sanatan Dharma cannot be rigid, it has to be inclusive without excluding the best and totality of knowledge to guide the karmic process, especially as Sanatan has no beginning and no end. The phrase dharma sanƒÅtana does occur in classical Sanskrit literature, e.g. in the Manusmrti (4-138) and in the Bhagavata Purana,Authority, Anxiety, and Canon By Laurie L. Patton, P. 103. in a sense akin to \\"cosmic order\\". Sanatanis as a denomination Since many reformist groups had the word Samaj (meaning society) or were led by a sant (meaning saint), Sanatanis are often held to be in contrast with Samajists and Santpanthis (meaning those who walk on the panth/path shown by their sant/saint). Unlike South India, where religious traditions such as Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism form the principal Hindu denominations, \\"they were effectively subsumed under the Sanatani identity\\" in many regions of North India, and the Samajs and Santpanths became the other distinct Hindu denominations. Reformist denominations such as the Arya Samaj are often fundamentalist in their approach. The Arya Samaj regards the Vedas as infallible scripture, and rejects what it regards as non-Vedic innovations in Sanatani Hinduism. These non-Vedic additions included inherited caste, the position of Brahmins as a revered group, idol-worship, and the addition of thousands of deities to the Sanatani Hindu pantheon. These differences are often apparent in social practices. Arya Samaji weddings, for instance, are based on Vedic practice and tend to be simpler and shorter with a qualified individual of any caste-heritage conducting the wedding, whereas Sanatani weddings are longer, with more complex rituals and always involve an officiating Brahmin priest. Competition with other denominations Sanatanis and reformists (such as the Arya Samaj, the Radha Soamis and the Ramakrishna Mission) have competed for adherents for more than a century, sometimes creating deep schisms in Hindu society, as in the case of South African Hindus who were split between the Arya Samaj and Sanatanis. While the reformist groups were better organized initially, by the 1860s, a process of internal counter-reform was underway in Sanatani groups as well, and societies to propagate orthodox beliefs along modern lines emerged, such as Sanatan Dharm Rakshini Sabha in 1873. Some religious commentators have compared the Sanatani-Samaji dichotomy within Hinduism as similar to the Catholic- Protestant division in Christianity.

Founded in 2007, ICTS has grown from a fledgling institution to a global centre of activity in various areas of science. Prof. Spenta R. Wadia was the founding director of the institute and served till 2015, after which he was succeeded by Rajesh Gopakumar as the Director.  Mission  ICTS is a multi and interdisciplinary venture that brings together various subjects such as mathematics, physics, biology, computer science and earth sciences. It is envisaged as a place where researchers from around the world meet and interact for critical periods of time in a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere. ICTS hopes to attract the best researchers from around the world to organize and participate in programs that stimulate progress in science. It is also involved in high level education and training and in reaching out to the larger society by serving as a node for scientific information and values. The activities at ICTS fall under the following broad categories # In-house research # Programs # Science outreach and public engagement  Research  ICTS aims to have a high quality permanent faculty of modest size together with a large floating population of visitors, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The faculty members work in various areas of theoretical sciences. ICTS also has a wide group of Associated Faculty, who are deeply involved in various activities of the Centre. ICTS has a vigorous Ph.D. students‚Äô program. The students are stationed in Bangalore and their course requirements for a degree from TIFR are partly fulfilled by arrangements with various institutions in Bangalore. A strong post-doctoral program has also been initiated. The scientific questions that drive the current ICTS faculty research are from the broad areas of Astrophysical Relativity, Data Assimilation and Dynamical Systems, Condensed matter and Statistical Physics, Physical Biology and String Theory and Interdisciplinary/Exploratory mathematics.  Programs  ICTS provides a platform along with resources for researchers working on diverse subjects to congregate during high-quality programs of varying durations. Cross-disciplinary immersions are encouraged at ICTS. Long duration programs have a large educational component. They aim to provide an introduction to current problems in an emerging research area. There is a fair balance of international and national participation. The lecturers are carefully chosen and are often distinguished scientists. The participants are mainly graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty. Short programs are focused discussion meetings on a recent exciting development in a given field. They are also often organized around a leading lecturer on a theme related to her/his work. These meetings usually include a research- oriented participation and are frequently organized in conjunction with one of the following three lecture series: Chandrasekhar (Physical Sciences), Ramanujan (Mathematics) and Turing (Biology, Computer Science and Engineering). ICTS also organizes programs in collaboration with other international research institutes. Examples include the \`ICTP-ICTS Biology Program‚Äô and the \`Asian Winter School in Strings, Particles and Cosmology‚Äô. Anyone holding a faculty position at any research and educational institution can apply for organizing a program at the ICTS. However, until the ICTS campus comes up, its programs must be organized at other places in India. For this reason, at present, it is preferable to have at least one of the organizers from an existing institution in India. A typical proposal for organizing a program is expected to have two or more organizers.

He served as the Anglican Bishop of Toronto from 1972 to 1989 and was the Archbishop of the ecclesiastical province of Ontario from 1979 to 1985. Early life Garnsworthy was born in Edmonton, Alberta, the son of an unemployed carpenter. Raised in a non-religious environment, he became a practising Christian after being taken to Bible class at age seventeen.John Allemang, \\"Outspoken Anglican plans to just fade away,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 November 1988, A19. He received a Bachelor's Degree at the University of Alberta in 1943 and later earned a theological degree from Wycliffe College in Toronto. He spent twenty-two years as a priest in the city before being elected as an assistant bishop in 1968. Bishop of Toronto In 1972, he was chosen as the ninth Bishop of Toronto. In this capacity, he presided over a diocese of 160,000 people, the largest in Canada.Michael McAteer, \\"Garnsworthy's wisdom,\\" Toronto Star, 29 October 1988, SA2; Michael McAteer, \\"Archbishop Lewis Garnsworthy, the outspoken and sometimes controversial former head of Toronto's Anglican diocese, died today. He was 67,\\" Toronto Star, 26 January 1990, A1. He became an archbishop in 1979. When the Anglican Diocese of Toronto was divided into five regions in 1980, Garnsworthy himself was given charge of the downtown division.\\"Anglican bishops assigned to new divisions of diocese,\\" Globe and Mail, 20 December 1980, T15. Garnsworthy was a frequent guest at official state functions,See for instance Zena Cherry, \\"Princess Anne feted by Premier Peterson,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 June 1986, D18. and in October 1982 he conducted the funeral ceremonies for former premier John Robarts.Rosemary Speirs, \\"Robart's body will lie in state,\\" Globe and Mail, 20 October 1982, p. 1. ;Views on the Church in Canadian society Garnsworthy argued in 1982 that the Anglican Church should stop performing civil marriage ceremonies. Saying that the church should not act as a \\"cheap auxiliary to the state,\\" he called for Canadian marriages to consist of a civil marriage performed by the state with the additional option of a \\"service of blessing\\" for those who wish it. At the time, Garnsworthy's views were considered controversial.\\"Church's marriage role assailed,\\" Globe and Mail, 15 October 1982, p. 5; \\"Use of Old City Hall criticized; Better place for civil marriage asked by Anglican archbishop,\\" Globe and Mail, 6 November 1982, p. 20. He acknowledged in 1986 that the Anglican Church had only limited influence in Canada's \\"comfortable\\" society, saying that it had more authority in places like South Africa where it was the victim of persecution. He rejected the suggestion that the church could rebrand itself in the manner of American televangelists, saying \\"I don't think you can sell religion like soap.\\"Michael McAteer, \\"Church makes 'little impact' primate says,\\" Toronto Star, 12 April 1986, A1. In 1988, he accepted a court ruling that ended compulsory recitations of the Lord's Prayer in Ontario public schools.Kevin Donovan, \\"Church leaders laud ban on compulsory classroom prayers,\\" Toronto Star, 25 September 1988, A25. In 1983, Garnsworthy and Community and Social Services Minister Frank Drea signed an agreement for the Government of Ontario and various churches to provide housing, meals, and day programs for poor and mentally ill individuals.\\"Ontario and churches plan pilot aid project,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 April 1983, p. 5. ;The role of women within the Church Garnsworthy initially opposed the ordination of women, but later reversed his position and became a proponent of the policy.Michael McAteer, \\"Bishop 'warm, compassionate',\\" Toronto Star, 27 January 1990, A6. ;LGBT issues In 1979, Garnsworthy defended the Anglican Church's decision to accept openly gay priests on condition that such individuals not participate in same-sex sexual activity. He argued that the decision was not a change of policy for the church and that equivalent restrictions existed for heterosexual priests in relationships out of wedlock. Brent Hawkes of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto cautiously accepted the Anglican Church's decision as a step forward, although he added that the requirement for celibacy would still result in gay priests being closeted.Denys Horgan, \\"Anglican bishops criticized,\\" Globe and Mail, 26 February 1979, p. 5. ;Separate school funding Garnsworthy took part in a high-profile dispute with the Government of Ontario from 1984 to 1986, after Progressive Conservative premier Bill Davis made a surprise decision to fund Ontario's public and Catholic high schools on an equal footing. (The province had previously funded Catholic education only as far as Grade Ten.) Garnsworthy strongly opposed the decision and wrote an article complaining that the religious and moral values of the Roman Catholic Church had in effect been given official state sanction. In particular, he wrote that he did not accept the Catholic positions on family planning, contraception, and abortion, nor did he accept the church's claim to be the sole arbiter of religious truth.Richard J. Doyle, \\"Davis's motive on schools remains a mystery,\\" Globe and Mail, 4 July 1984, p. 7. Some believe that this intervention had the effect of dividing the funding issue along religious lines.Robert Matas, \\"Primate attempts to ease rift over schools,\\" Globe and Mail, 12 July 1984, M1. Garnsworthy responded that he was not anti-Catholic and did not want to revive sectarian conflicts from the nineteenth century, but that he believed in and wanted to defend Ontario's public education system.\\"Anglican archbishop critical,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 March 1984, M1. During the 1985 provincial election, Garnsworthy accused Davis of changing the province's education system in the same manner as Adolf Hitler in 1930s Germany. He declined to withdraw the analogy, saying \\"This is how Hitler changed education in Germany, by exactly the same process, by decree. I won't take that back.\\"Robert Matas, \\"Davis like Hitler on schools: bishop,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 April 1985, p. 1. (He later clarified that he was not comparing Davis with Hitler in a more general sense.) Frank Miller, who had by this time succeeded Davis as premier and was continuing his funding policy, described the comment as \\"odious\\" and \\"totally unfounded.\\"John Cruickshank and Robert Matas, \\"Miller accuses archbishop of reopening religious wounds,\\" Globe and Mail, 26 April 1985, p. 1. Many believe this controversy caused significant damage for the Progressive Conservatives in the 1985 election, costing them support among their historically strong constituency of Anglican voters.See for instance John Best, \\"RC school funding dominates election,\\" The Times, 16 November 1985, T; Rosemary Speirs, \\"How Tories threw it away after 43 years,\\" Toronto Star, 14 October 1986, A12. Speirs does not take a strong position on whether the funding issue helped to swing the election, but she acknowledges that many believed it was a significant factor. David Rotenberg, a cabinet minister defeated in his bid for re-election, remarked, \\"I think [Garnsworthy] would probably get the Ian Paisley award of the year because his speech certainly made it respectable to be anti-Catholic.\\"Duncan McMonagle and Sylvia Stead, \\"Attack by bishop cited in Tory election setback,\\" Globe and Mail, 8 May 1985, p. 1. The Progressive Conservatives actually won the election by a narrow margin and formed a minority government afterwards, but lost power two months later after being defeated on a confidence vote in the legislature. The new government of Liberal premier David Peterson continued Davis and Miller's support for full Catholic school funding, and Garnsworthy continued his battle against the legislation. In 1986, Garnsworthy argued that teachers applying for positions in the Catholic system should not be required to have a letter of recommendation from a priest; his position was that this requirement prevented non-Catholics from seeking a publicly funded office.Robert Matas, \\"Bishop rejoins battle over school financing,\\" Globe and Mail, 12 April 1986, A15. Despite his efforts, full funding was extended to Catholic schools by the Peterson government. ;Other views Garnsworthy defended Ontario's Sunday shopping laws in 1986 and argued that store owners who violated the laws were exploiting their non-unionized employees.Denise Harrington, Alan Christie and Jim Emmerson, \\"Workers can't be forced to work on Sundays, Scott says,\\" Toronto Star, 4 December 1986, A1. In 1987, he spoke against a proposal to re- institute the death penalty in Canada.Michael McAteer, \\"Canadian faiths divided in death penalty debate,\\" Toronto Star, 18 April 1987, A1. Garnsworthy spoke in support of AIDS victims in 1987, saying that they have a right to pastoral care within the church community and expressing concern at \\"fear and ignorance abroad about AIDS.\\"Michael McAteer, \\"AIDS victims entitled to pastoral care, archbishop says,\\" Toronto Star, 12 September 1987, A6. Final years Garnsworthy did not seek re-election to his provincial office in 1985.Kelley Teahen, \\"Garnsworthy is supported by successor,\\" Globe and Mail, 18 October 1985, A1. He retired as Bishop of Toronto in 1989; in his last address, he called on the various churches of Toronto to work together and take a greater role in combatting social ills.Michael McAteer, \\"'Co-operate,' retiring prelate tells faiths,\\" Toronto Star, 17 September 1988, A6. Garnsworthy underwent surgery to remove a cancerous lung in July 1983.\\"Anglican archbishop loses lung to cancer,\\" Globe and Mail, 12 July 1983, p. 1. He died in January 1990.

Construction began on July 3, 1942, and was completed on February 15, 1943. The Camp was named after Juan Bautista de Anza, an early explorer who camped near the site in 1774. The US Army purchased the 1,240-acre site from the Willits J. Hole Ranch (1910-1942), a barley and wheat farm. Before 1910 the land was part of Rancho La Sierra (1797-1910). The post was activated on December 2, 1942, initially designated as Arlington Staging Area and Arlington Special Training Center, and renamed Camp Anza on December 12, 1942. Camp Anza was a large Army base with 512 buildings housing 20,000 Troops. Over 600,000 Troops were processed over the three years of use. The camp had over a hundred wood barracks. Also Built were: headquarters, recreation rooms, chapel, laundry building, Southern Pacific Railroad station, library, Fire station, newspaper print room (Anza Zip), 2,000 seat outdoor theater, water storage tower, motor pool, heating plant, and mess halls.

Formed in 2004, the three met as students at Capilano College while studying jazz. Their influences are cited as being diverse, ranging from Vespertine-era Bj√∂rk to the Wayne Shorter Quartet to local talents. In March 2005, they became the regular performers at the Rime, a new music hub located in East Vancouver. There, they recorded their first live album, Live at Rime in 2005. The trio released their studio album, Day In, in 2006 and in the same year, earned the title Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Galaxie Rising Star Award for best new group at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival. The album was also nominated for a 2007 Western Canadian Music award for Jazz Album of the year. After the album, the trio began collaborating with jazz trumpeter Brad Turner in 2007 and released the album Looks Like It's Going to Snow in 2009. Turner, had previously produced Day In and is also the producer for the new record. The album is noted for its lyricism and rich arrangements. One review notes that \\"it easily and off-handedly incorporates funk and rock elements without becoming a collection that is dominated by a backbeat aesthetic.\\" The band is also noted for its rhythmic complexity, as songwriter Cole enjoys the frequent play with irregular time signatures and unusual phrase lengths. The trio has also opened for Dave Holland and the Monterey Quartet. The band has performed at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, the National Jazz Awards in Toronto, the Montreal Jazz Festival, the Seattle Earshot Jazz Festival, the Portland Jazz Festival, the Calgary Jazz Festival, and the Edmonton Jazz Festival. They have also toured eastern Canada and the United States in June 2010 to promote their latest recording.

He fought a long series of wars with the House of Savoy and lost control of all of his county outside of the traditional Genevois and saw his influence over the city of Geneva proper and the Bishop of Geneva severely reduced. William was the second son of Count William I of Geneva (died 1195) and younger brother of Count Humbert I of Geneva. When Humbert died in 1225, William seized the county and expelled Humbert's sons, his nephews, Peter and Ebal, who eventually found protection under Peter le Petit Charlemagne, who had brought them with him to England by 1244. That year Peter, the elder, married a rich English heiress, Mathilda de Lacy.Cox (1974), 295. Peter le Petit Charlemagne was in fact William's nephew, a son of his sister Margaret. In September 1229 at Tournon William was one of the arbiters of a dispute between the Bishop of Valence, William of Savoy, who was a brother of le Petit Charlemagne, and the citizens of Valence.Cox (1974), 38. In 1234 he had his second son, Amadeus, installed as a canon in the Diocese of Lausanne. In 1239 Amadeus was successful in leading the pro-Genevan party over he pro-Savoyard in the episcopal election which placed Jean de Cossonay on the bishop's seat.Cox (1974), 86‚Äì87. In 1236‚Äì37, Aymon, Baron of Faucigny, made himself protector of the priory of Chamonix despite the fact that the count of Geneva had a prior right. The ensuing war, in which Aymon's son-in-law, le Petit Charlemagne, was captured by William's son Rudolf, resulted in Genevan defeat, for on 13 May 1237 William II was forced to accept the judgement of Peter's brother, Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy, condemning him to an indemnity of 20,000 marks and the cession of the strategic Castle Arlod on the Rh√¥ne near its confluence with the Valserine, which commanded the approach to the Lyonnais. The sum of 20,000 marks was beyond William's ability to pay and the value of the fortress he was compelled to give up too high. The count of Geneva and Peter continued to be at war intermittently for the next five years. In 1242 William and le Petit Charlemagne fought a final brief war for control of Arlod. On 26 August, however, meeting his adversary \\"in front of Arlod\\", he was forced to cede it.Cox (1974), 164. In 1250 William II went to war again against le Petit Charlemagne in an effort to check his expansion in the pays de Vaud. Although no contemporary source describes the course of the war, it is evident that William was defeated. He lost the fortress of Les Cl√©es, which commanded the pass into Burgundy, and that of Bourg-du-Four in the centre of Geneva. He was also forced to accept the arbitration of Peter's brother, Philip, Archbishop of Lyon, who in turn imposed a \\"Carthagenian settlement\\" on 28 June: the count was forced to cede to Peter a large gagerie as security against the payment of an indemnity set at 10,000 marks, which was half of the indemnity ordered in 1237.Cox (1974), 193‚Äì94. The gagerie comprised the castles of Geneva, Les Cl√©es, Charousse, Ballaison, Rue; the homages of the Count of Gruy√©re and of the lords of Langin, Oron and Vufflens; and all the jurisdictions William possessed in the Pays de Vaud, the Chablais and in Faucigny, between the Arve and the Dranse and between the Cluse de Gex and the Pont de Bargen.Cox (1974), 436. By this concession the once powerful county of Geneva was reduced to little more than the Genevois. The archbishop further intervened in the dispute between William and Peter over Arlod, deciding that it should remain in Peter's possession until an inquiry could determine if it pertained to the sire of Gex or to the prior of Nantua, who happened at that time to be Boniface, brother of Peter and Philip. William II died at Dom√®ne in November 1252 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Rudolf, while his younger son, Henry, received the fortresses of Vuache and Ternier. Besides his sons Rudolf, Amadeus and Henry, William II had four others.Cox (1974), 82. One Savoyard Renaissance historian described William II as ‚Äúquarrelsome‚Äù.Emmanuel-Philibert de Pingon (1525‚Äì1582), Chronique de Savoie, quoted in Cox (1974), 83‚Äì86.

The first Smyrniote crusade was the brainchild of Clement VI. The threat of Turkish piracy in the Aegean Sea had induced Clement's predecessors, John XXII and Benedict XII, to maintain a fleet of four galleys there to defend Christian shipping but starting in the 1340s Clement endeavoured with Venetian aid to expand this effort into a full military expedition. He commissioned Henry of Asti, the Catholic patriarch of Constantinople, to organise a league against the Turks, who had increased their piracy in the Aegean in recent years. Hugh IV of Cyprus and the Order of the Hospital joined and on 2 November 1342, the Pope sent letters to engage the men and ships of Venice. The Papal bull granting the Crusade indulgence and authorising its preaching throughout Europe, Insurgentibus contra fidem, was published on 30 September. The first Smyrniote crusade began with the naval victory of the Battle of Pallene and ended with an assault on Smyrna, capturing the harbour and the citadel but not the acropolis, on 28 October 1344. In a gesture of over-confidence, on 17 January 1345 Henry of Asti attempted to celebrate mass in an abandoned structure which he believed had been the cathedral of the metropolitan. In the middle of the service Umur Beg swept down on the congregation and the leaders of the crusade were killed, including the Patriarch, Martino Zaccaria, commander of the Papal galleys and the Venetian commander, Pietro Zeno. The precarious situation of the Crusaders in Asia spurred the Pope to organise a second expedition in 1345. In November, under the command of Humbert II of Viennois, the second Smyrniote crusade set out from Venice. In February 1346 it won a victory over the Turks at Mytilene but Humbert did little more at Smyrna than sortie against the Turks and refortify the Christian section of the city. The next five years were occupied by Clement VI with attempts to negotiate a truce with the Turks, who kept Smyrna in a constant state of siege by land and direct financial and military aid to the city. Although Clement's concern with the Crusade ended abruptly in September 1351, the city of Smyrna remained in Christian hands until the Siege of Smyrna by the Timurids in 1402.

The character along with wife Waverley returned for the show's 25th anniversary that aired on 25 May 2017. Creation and casting Whilst creating the soap what was to become, Shortland Street, Caterina De Nave decided to write teenagers into the show so as to draw in a younger demographic. It was decided to have two teenagers, one being Stuart Neilson ‚Äì an articulate homosexual and the other Nick Harrison ‚Äì a drug taking rebel. The two characters were set to be heart throbs and auditions were undertaken for the roles. Sixteen-year-old Karl Burnett whose only other experience was the 1991 film When Love Comes and high school drama classes won the role. Milan Borich got into the final stages of auditioning but instead landed the role of Nick's best friend in the show's first week. Burnett's portrayal of Nick proved to be greatly different than the spunky rebel that had been envisioned and writers began to develop Nick into a more comedic and clumsy character. This worried producers who were scared that the soaps only heart throb was gay and they requested the character of Stuart also be rewritten to be heterosexual. The character of Nick made his debut in the show's second episode on 26 May 1992. In 2005, after 13 years on the show, the character of Nick was axed by producers alongside wife, Waverley Harrison (Claire Chitham). The network reportedly did not think the characters were any longer an \\"asset\\" to the show. The Harrison family made their last appearance on 17 March 2005. Burnett was not surprised at his character's axing and had been ready to move on from the role. Though he was not opposed to returning to the soap for one or two guest appearances, he did not think he would be asked back. Burnett stayed with the show in the role of a boom operator behind the scenes. In 2012, Burnett admitted that he had not been asked to return for the show's 20th anniversary. Following an online campaign and petition to reinstate Nick in 2014, Burnett commented that he was open and willing to return. In honour of the show's 25th anniversary in 2017, Burnett was asked to reprise his role alongside Chitham. The two filmed an appearance for the feature length special which Burnett commented was, \\"definitely going to be a fun watch\\". Burnett made his reappearance on 25 May 2017. Storylines Badboy Nick was accused of stealing a boat and fell out with best friend, Stuart (Martin Henderson) when their mutual friend Miles Lucas (Hamish MacFarlane) committed suicide and the two struggled to withhold their emotions. Nick started to date punk girl, Serena Hughes (Willa O'Neill) to anger his mother Jenny (Maggie Harper). However the plan backfired when Serena and Jenny got on famously and Nick fell for her. However the two eventually broke up and Nick developed unrequited love for Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield). Nick grew jealous when Rachel got together with Stuart and got in a serious accident when he stole Stuart's motorbike in a fit of rage. Whilst Nick dated a girl called Olivia, he learned that he may not be Jenny's real son, with the possibility of being swapped at birth with Adam Brady (Jeremy Brennan) arising. Undergoing an identity crisis, Nick nicknamed himself \\"Slash\\" and took up smoking. However Adam was soon revealed to be mentally ill and was sent to a psychiatric ward, and Nick realised how much he loved his mum, dropping his bad boy persona. Nick cleaned up his act and developed a crush on new girl, Waverley Wilson (Claire Chitham) after he broke up with Olivia. Waverley used Nick for sex but the two eventually started to legitimately develop feelings. Waverley had a pregnancy scare which saw Nick nervously propose. He married Rachel in a protest on student loans which upset Waverley to the point where she fled the country. After setting off fireworks, a damaged one hit Nick in the face and temporarily blinded him and in the aftermath, he dated Ramona (Ashleigh Seagar) but they broke up when Nick clumsily misplaced her baby, Lucy. Nick started an awkward fling with Rachel when she was struck by lightning which soon ended when Rachel recovered. Nick dated a woman named Vanessa but when Waverley returned to town, the two finally reconciled. Nick forgave Waverley when she cheated on him but couldn't accept her when she cut his hair without consent. The two broke up. Nick saved good friend Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) from entering prostitution and the two entered a relationship however it ended when Nick slapped her in a fit of rage. Nick started to date Angela Weaver (Katherine Hubbard) and she fell pregnant. However Angela was revealed to be terminally ill but decided to go through with the pregnancy. They married in an unofficial ceremony and Angela gave birth to a son they named Lucas (Christopher Preece) shortly before she died. Nick struggled to accept Lucas but with the help of Rangi (Blair Strang) and Donna (Stephanie Tauevihi), Nick finally felt love for his son. Nick soon realised he still loved Waverley but she felt obliged to Adam (Leighton Cardno) and Nick departed to London with Lucas. When he returned months later, he and Waverley finally reconciled. The two got engaged but on the eve of the wedding Waverley was kidnapped by his ex fianc√© Fergus (Paul Ellis). The two finally wed in but the legitimacy of the marriage was put into question when Nick forged the certificate after he misplaced the original. Nick helped Waverley through cancer and she fell pregnant. However Waverley had a miscarriage but soon fell pregnant again. Nick won the local bar in a poker match but was shocked to discover the previous owner Geoff Greenlaw's (Andrew Laing) dead body in the freezer. Waverley gave birth to a daughter that she and Nicknamed Tina-Anne (Libby Reber). Nick grew paranoid when a home invader struck the homes of Ferndale, the family moved to Taranaki to ensure their safety. Nick and Waverley returned for Chris' 50th birthday and revealed that they had since had 3 more children since Tina-Anne. Arguing over Waverley's wish for Nick to undergo a vasectomy, the couple helped out as Ferndale was hit with a volcanic eruption. The two were shocked to discover that Waverley was again pregnant but came to be happy following wisdom from Marj (Elizabeth McRae) before she died moments later. Character development =Relationship with Waverley Wilson= In 1994, the character of Waverley Wilson (Claire Chitham) was introduced to the soap as a love interest for Nick. Waverley at first used Nick to get to Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson), but it was not long before something more serious developed. In 1995 the couple had a pregnancy scare and Nick nervously proposed to Waverley before they found out it was a mistake and he retracted his action. Waverley was devastated to learn Nick had married her cousin Rachel (Angela Bloomfield) during a protest on student allowance and she fled the country. Chitham and Burnett got on well, something which benefitted the couples onscreen relationship, Chitham stated, \\"Karl's lovely. He's very good to work with... I think we've got a really good rapport going ‚Äì you have to if you're playing a couple on screen.\\" Upon returning after 3 years in 1998, Waverley hoped that Nick had made a substantial change, Chitham stated, \\"Waverly wants him to have grown up and sorted himself out, have a respectable job and be a man ‚Äì a suitable man to be her partner and she won't settle for anything less. She sticks to her morals really strongly and that is one of the aspects in which I think she's grown up a lot.\\" Speaking of Nick's attempts to meet Waverleys demands, Chitham said, \\"He makes an effort to meet her requirements. We get there in the end.\\" The two became engaged but Nick was devastated when Waverley cut his trademark hair whilst they slept and they broke up. Just over a year later, Nick's partner Angela Weaver (Katherine Hubbard) died, leaving him with the care of their son, Lucas (Joshua Adams). Waverley looked after the baby alongside Rachel. As 2001 came to an end, Nick announced his love to Waverley. Waverley turned him down and Nick left Ferndale for England so that Burnett could take a sabbatical. When he returned, Nick and Waverley finally reconciled and got engaged. The marriage was cancelled however when Waverley's ex fiance, Fergus Kearney (Paul Ellis) kidnapped her on the day of the ceremony. She was rescued however and the two finally married in an episode marked by the return of original characters, Jenny Harrison (Maggie Harper) and Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae). The following year Waverley was diagnosed with breast cancer and did not tell Nick. Waverley recovered and soon fell pregnant, giving birth to a daughter, Tina-Anne Harrison (Damikah Chancher) on the shows 3000th episode. A fire at Nick and Wave's bar, 'The Dog's Day Inn', nearly saw an end to Lucas and Tina-Anne, but both were rescued by Wave's cousin Eltham Wilson (Kip Chapman). In 2005, the couple's home was struck by a home invader and an increasingly paranoid Nick mistook Wave for a burglar and shook a gun at her. As a result of their insecurities, the Harrison's left Ferndale for Taranaki. Reception During his time on the show, Nick was one of the show's most popular characters and one of the most recognisable faces on New Zealand television. He has also been praised as one of the show's most successful comedic characters. Upon the show's initial screening, the character of Nick received the worst response of the original cast due to his depiction of a typical \\"Westie\\" (West Aucklander). However upon the vast character change, fans of the show praised Nick's comedic writing and scenes and he soon became a scene stealer and fan favourite. Michael Galvin (Chris Warner) enjoyed the characters development, stating; \\"When the show started, people wondered what this creature was all about. Now he's, like, this comic genius ‚Äì a Buster Keaton who talks, crossed with Bart Simpson. He's just great, so deadpan...\\" Galvin and Angela Bloomfield (Rachel McKenna) later both went on to name Nick as their favourite character to star on the show. Producer Steven Zanoski listed Nick as one of the best features of the soap, stating: \\"Every Nick story is fantastic to write, made more so by the reliability of Karl Burnett's performance. It's a case of a character evolving to capitalise on the unexpected qualities of the actor.\\" He went on to say: \\"Much of the comedy and pathos we got from Nick over 10 years defined the Shortland Street style, setting it apart from other fast-turnaround tele- drama.\\" The New Zealand Woman's Day magazine listed Nick as the 4th best character of the soap's first 25 years. A 1999 storyline saw Nick incorporate Apple computers into the clinic as part of a new administration scheme. Television New Zealand had not entered into any agreement with Apple and was rather portraying the computers due to their \\"sexy\\" looks and for storyline development; a move praised by Apple. However shortly into the storyline's progression, the computers were infected with viruses. Apple was shocked at how their computers were portrayed and confessed that future storylines involving the computers would require consultation so as to provide \\"more appropriate\\" scenarios. In 2002, when the actor took a sabbatical from the show, The New Zealand TV Guide ran a 'Bring Back Nick' campaign demanding that the iconic character be reinstated. Throughout 2001 and 2002, Burnett lost 18 kilos by going on a healthy diet. To explain his weight loss on screen, Nick was shown to eat more balanced meals and healthy alternatives replaced junk food in the hospital cafeteria. Health experts praised the show and Burnett for the initiative. The pairing of Nick and Waverley was described as \\"totally right\\" and was compared to the marriage of Ken and Deirdre Barlow in Coronation Street. Nick's exit in 2005 was celebrated by Frances Grant, who labelled the character \\"gormless\\" and \\"boring\\", comparing him unfavorably to the Coronation Street character Ken Barlow. However following Burnett's appearance on the weight loss show Downsize Me in 2008, Grant criticised the shows writers for axing the character and suggested Burnett's weight loss could have been a potential storyline for Nick. The Edge broadcaster Dom Harvey had been an avid viewer of the soap but following the axing of Nick, refused to watch another episode until he was reinstated, ultimately campaigning for his return 9 years later. In 2006 Galvin campaigned for the return of Nick and named him as a \\"comic gift\\" and his favourite character. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. The storyline that saw Nick marry Rachel and the 2002 marriage of Nick and Waverley, have been voted by fans as two of the show's most iconic moments. In 2016 a stuff.co.nz reporter named Nick as the 5th character he most wanted to return to the show. They believed reuniting Nick and Rachel would \\"no doubt be a winner\\".

Fr. Jacome Gonsalves arrived in Ceylon during the Dutch occupation, when the Dutch were imposing Calvinism as the official religion after taking over from the Portuguese. He also helped St. Joseph Vaz in services. He did a massive service using his knowledge on Sinhala and Tamil Languages. He is also known as the \\"Father of Catholic Literature in Sri Lanka\\" because of the massive service he had done. He had written many books, prayers, hymns and translated many hymns. Some of those hymns and prayers are in popular use among Sinhala and Tamil Catholics.  Life  = Birth = Jacome Gonsalves was the eldest son of Thomas Gonsalves and Mariana de Abreu, living in the parish of Our Lady of Piety (Piedade, Goa). He was born on 8 June 1676. He was a Konkani Brahmin by lineage. His family had been Christian for 2 or 3 generations, being among the first converts at the beginning of Portuguese rule in Goa.Anthony Fernandopulle, Father Jacome Gonsalves: Sinhala Christian Literary Hero: A Study of the Sinhala Literary Works of Fr Jacome Gonsalves (1676-1742), (Colombo: St Peter's College, 2000) 8-13. = Education = Gonsalves studied at the Jesuit College of Goa. He enrolled in the University of Goa [probably Saint Paul's College, Goa], and obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts. In 1696 he began theological studies at the Academy of St Thomas Aquinas in Goa, where he also held the post of organist.J. Clemente Vaz, Profiles of Eminent Goans 114. This seems to have led him to develop a taste for poetry, prose and music. = Ordination = He was ordained to the priesthood by Rt. Rev. Agostinho de Anuncia√ß√£o, Archbishop of Goa, in April 1700 at the Cathedral of St. Catherine. He decided to enter the Oratorian Congregation of Goa. He was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of St Paul's in Goa [probably the Collegio S√£o Paulo]. He took up his post in January 1705, but relinquished it the same year to go to Sri Lanka. = At Sri Lanka = An ivory statue of Mary, Presented to Fr. Jacome by the King He left Goa on 9 May 1705 and reached Sri Lanka on 30 August 1705, arriving at Talaimannar. At the time, he knew Konkani, Portuguese, Latin and Spanish. During the long journey he studied Tamil. He mastered this language during his first assignment on the islands of Mannar, Arippu, Musali and other places in the Munnar district. He also learnt Dutch. Fr Joseph Vaz sent him to Kandy to learn Sinhala. Fr Gonsalves studied with the Buddhist monks at the Malwatta chapter, known for their high and elegant Sinhala. Then after, he conducted his services in areas around Negombo, Colombo, and Kalutara from February, 1709. In the same year, he converted more than 1300 to Catholic. First months of 1710, he stayed at Kandy. While he was servicing between Sitawaka and Colombo, he was tortured by Dutch, who were controlling the coastline of Sri Lanka. Because of the extreme illness of St. Fr. Joseph Vaz, he came back to Kandy. There he gave him extreme unction and did his funeral.

It is the methyl ether of eugenol and is important to insect behavior and pollination. It is found in various essential oils. Methyl eugenol is found in a number of plants (over 450 species from 80 families including both angiosperm and gymnosperm families) and has a role in attracting pollinators. About 350 plant species have them as a component of floral fragrance. Their ability to attract insects, particularly Bactrocera fruit flies (particularly, Bactrocera dorsalis male flies) was first noticed in 1915 by F. M. Howlett. The compound may have evolved in response to pathogens, as methyl eugenol has some antifungal activity. It also repels many insects. As of October 2018, the US FDA withdrew authorization for the use of methyl eugenol as a synthetic flavoring substance for use in food because petitioners provided data demonstrating that these additives induce cancer in laboratory animals. FDA noted the action was despite its continuing stance that this substance does not pose a risk to public health under the conditions of its intended use.

Early life He was born on June 28, 1884 in Oakland, California to Ada L. and William H. Cooke.1910 US census in Oakland, California Cooke grew up in Lockeford, California. Cooke's grandfather, Dr. Dean Jewett Locke, was the founder of the town of Lockeford. Cooke attended the University of California where he graduated from the California School of Mechanical Arts and the College of Electrical Engineering. In 1910, Cooke was racing cars and living in Oakland.  Aviation career  In 1910, Cooke built and flew a Montgomery- type glider. In 1911, barge captain Lan Maupin and shipyard owner Bernard Lanteri constructed a biplane of their own design in Pittsburg, California that they named 'Black Diamond' after the nearby coal mines. In June 1911 Maupin and Lanteri took a few test hops in their aircraft and decided they needed a professional pilot and hired Cooke, even though Cooke had never flown a powered aircraft. Throughout the summer of 1911,Cooke practiced in the Black Diamond several times a day and made his exhibition flying debut at the Walnut Creek Grape Festival on October 6,7 1911. On 19 December 1911 Cooke was the first person to overfly Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California in the Black Diamond. The flight ended in Mill Valley, California in-route to Oakland after an engine failure and glide to landing from 2000 ft of altitude. In early 1912, Cooke passed his test for his pilot's license, which was presented to him by Oakland Mayor Frank K. Mott on Jan. 13, 1912. He received Aero Club of America's pilots license # 95, making him the second licensed pilot in California. Cooke flying a floatplane on 6 July 1913Cooke's Black Diamond exhibition flying culminated in its appearance in the January 1912 Los Angeles International air meet at Dominguez Field. Cooke's flying was outstanding, setting the meet record for endurance and altitude, winning $7,400 in prizes. In 1911 and 1912, including the Los Angeles prize money, Cooke's flying earned Maupin and Lanteri's now named 'Diamond Airplane Co.', a total of $14,800. The Los Angeles meet was the last flight of the Black Diamond. The Black Diamond was disassembled and put into storage and, in 1948, the Maupin family donated it to the Smithsonian. In 1998, it was offered to the Hiller Aviation Museum where it was restored and put on display. At an exhibition on December 31, 1911 ‚Äì January 1, 1912 in Santa Rosa, California, Cooke took a test flight in a biplane that had been constructed by Fred J. Wiseman that Wiseman had used for the world's first airmail flight from Petaluma, California to Santa Rosa. After the Los Angeles meet, Cooke no longer had an aircraft to fly, so he arranged to purchase the Wiseman biplane and had it crated up and sent to Emeryville, California for an exhibition where he was to race Lincoln Beachy. Compared to Beachy's aircraft, the Wiseman biplane was under powered and Beachy beat him easily in all five days of the event. To improve the performance, Cooke replaced the Hall-Scott A-2 with a Roberts two-stroke motor. Cooke continued to modify this aircraft as he used it for exhibition flying across the United States during 1912. The modified aircraft became known as the Wiseman-Cooke biplane. This aircraft became the second Cooke piloted aircraft donated to the Smithsonian where it was restored and put on display at the National Postal Museum. By late 1912, Cooke had arrived in Sandusky, Ohio where he formed the Cooke Aeroplane Co. to build aircraft of his own design. The Roberts Motor Company let him use a portion of their facility to work on his aircraft. When Cooke participated in the 1913 Great Lakes Reliability Cruise his address was listed as Sandusky, Ohio. In May 1914, Cooke was back in the San Francisco Bay Area where he was the pilot of Silas Christofferson's 'Aeromaid' flying boat. Christofferson tried to start an aerial ferry service between Oakland and San Francisco, but gave up after just a few flights. Cooke died on September 6, 1914 in an aircrash in Pueblo, Colorado.

The general effect of elevation depends on atmospheric physics. However, the specific climate and ecology of any particular location depends on specific features of that location. This article provides a list of life zones by region, in order to illustrate the features of life zones for regions around the globe.

Murder and trial On April 9, 1993, Gary Gauger called the U.S. emergency number 9-1-1 after finding his 74-year-old father's body. Paramedics were summoned, as well as the McHenry County Sheriff's Department, who soon found the body of 70-year-old Ruth Gauger in a trailer on the property.\\"Gary Gauger\\". The Justice Project. Web. 09 Nov. 2010. Gauger told officers he was asleep when his parents were murdered. Despite this, Gauger was interrogated for 21 hours by the police. Officers lied to Gauger and told him that they had found evidence against him. \\"They told me that they had found bloody clothes in my bedroom; they found a bloody knife in my pocket,\\" he said. After showing Gauger gruesome photographs of his parents, Gauger broke down and confessed. Though Gauger had no memory of the crime, he believed what police had told him. \\"I thought I must have done it in a blackout,\\" he said. Though he had given a confession, there was no physical evidence held against him in court. Gauger was found guilty of the double murder, and was sentenced to death.\\"Why Innocent People Confess to Murder\\". ABC News. 09 Nov. 2010. In 2004 two Wisconsin Outlaws Motorcycle Club members, Randall E. Miller and James W. Schneider were charged in double-murder of Morris and Ruth Gauger. Exoneration On March 8, 1996, the Second District Illinois Appellate Court unanimously reversed and remanded the case for a new trial on the ground that Cowlin erred in failing to grant a motion to suppress Gary‚Äôs allegedly inculpatory statements. In an unpublished opinion written by Judge S. Louis Rathje, with Judges Robert D. McLaren and Fred A. Geiger concurring, the court held that the statements were the fruit of an arrest made without probable cause and therefore should not have been admitted at the trial. Without the confession, McHenry County State‚Äôs Attorney Gary W. Pack had no choice but to drop the charges, and set Gary free. Pack continued to suggest publicly that Gary had in fact committed the crime and was freed only because the prosecution could not meet its burden of proof without the confession. He was pardoned in 2002 after two motorcycle gang members were ultimately convicted of the crime. Despite this, Pack continues to profess that Gary had committed the crime. Gauger was denied the right to receive compensation for his imprisonment, citing immunity to the police, detectives, and prosecutors. Post-prison life Gauger gained national attention following his exoneration, and was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, 60 Minutes, 20/20, Connie Chung Tonight, A&E; Investigative Reports, and Court TV. Gauger is one of six people whose stories were dramatized in the acclaimed play The Exonerated, portrayed by Penn Jillette. The play, written by Eric Jensen and Jessica Blank, details how each individual was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, in addition to their exoneration after varying years of imprisonment. The Exonerated is a film adaptation, which first aired on the CourtTV cable television station on January 27, 2005. Gauger is portrayed by Brian Dennehy in the film. At the end of the film it fades from the actor to Gauger himself who talks about his wife, his work and his freedom. Gauger's story is also featured in 'Deadline', a 2004 documentary on the death row prisoners Gauger has since published a memoir of the ordeal entitled In Spite of the System with Julie Von Bergen.\\"Gary Gauger\\". garygauger.com.

History  =Background = The first plans to build a direct rail link between Hamburg and L√ºbeck were put forward in 1831 by the L√ºbeck merchant Emil M√ºller and his father Nicholas Hermann M√ºller. After the French occupation of L√ºbeck, Nicholas Hermann Muller had been committed to improving its transport links. He established the first steamship company in L√ºbeck, operating regular service between L√ºbeck and Copenhagen. Emil M√ºller proposed in 1831 the construction of a railway line between Hamburg and L√ºbeck, connecting the North and the Baltic Seas, but finding little support in L√ºbeck, he travelled to London in 1833, where he eventually found investors. M√ºller recruited as senior engineer Francis Giles, the Chief Engineer of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway (1829‚Äì1836). Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the designer of London's Thames Tunnel (1825‚Äì1843) also offered their services to M√ºller. In September 1833, Giles' assistant William Lindley travelled to Hamburg. He would later lead the successful construction of the Berlin-Hamburg Railway and the Hamburg urban drainage scheme. He began surveying the line on 6 November 1833. Although the line would have to run through Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt, which was ruled by the King of Denmark, Lindley decided not to submit an application to the Danish authorities for approval for this survey work prior to carrying it out in order to save time. 1834 Giles went to Copenhagen, where on 10 August he submitted the projected railway for approval. Only on this occasion, did he inform the King of Denmark of the survey work that had taken place; this upset the court and affected the simultaneous negotiations on the construction of the Hamburg‚ÄìL√ºbeck highway. The railway company was established and investors were sought (with the intention of issuing 15,000 shares at ¬£ 20 sterling each), but share subscription was slow and in 1839 M√ºller abandoned the project, dissolving the first L√ºbeck railway company. A new start was made in 1843, when L√ºbeck Council decided that it would lead a project to build a railway to Hamburg and took the issue up with the Danish government. The Holstein area lying between Hamburg and L√ºbeck, however, was under the rule of the Danish king and the Danish court refused to allow the building of a direct connection between the two cities. This was probably at the urging of Holstein and especially of the Kiel district, which considered that the trading activities of Hamburg and L√ºbeck and their tax and customs laws discriminated against Kiel. Following pressure from the other states of the German Confederation, as well as Russia and France, the Danish government committed itself on 23 June 1847 to the construction of a railway from L√ºbeck to B√ºchen in the Duchy of Lauenburg to connect with the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg Railway. Among the supporters for L√ºbeck's proposal were such renowned figures as Alexander von Humboldt, Klemens von Metternich and the King of Prussia, Frederick William IV. Consent was given three days before the beginning of the German- nationalist public song festival in L√ºbeck, and three months before the start of the Germanists‚Äô day (Germanistentag) in L√ºbeck (27‚Äì30 September 1847), chaired by Jacob Grimm, following the first Germanists‚Äô day meeting in the previous year in Frankfurt am Main. The Germanists‚Äô days were part of a political movement in opposition to Denmark's control of Schleswig-Holstein, which gave rise to the Schleswig-Holstein Question. Among other reasons for the selection of the venue for the Germanists‚Äô day had been that the blocking of rail services to L√ºbeck by Denmark was seen as a \\"national question\\", despite the remote location of L√ºbeck in Germany and the poor accessibility of the missing rail link. The line was to be an indirect, 35 km-long connection from L√ºbeck to Hamburg. This compromise meant that the competing Altona-Kiel Railway Company (Altona-Kieler Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) had an advantage in that the connection from L√ºbeck to Hamburg via B√ºchen now had about the same track length as the rail link between Altona and Kiel (both then in Holstein). =Construction of the network = The old L√ºbeck station, ca. 1865 The station interior with only one track and platform. LBE network in 1861 LBE network in 1899 Streamlined bi-level rail car LBE-DW 8 After the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company was established on 27 February 1850, work began on the construction of the line from L√ºbeck via Ratzeburg and M√∂lln to B√ºchen. A labour force of 2,500 mostly unskilled workers were engaged on the line's earthworks for a total of 400,000 working days up to April 1851. On 15 October 1851 the line went into operation, although the Danish concession for operations from 1848 to 1857 was granted late because of the revolutions of 1848. The LBE station in L√ºbeck was close to the Holsten Gate (Holstentor). The line ran by the ramparts of the L√ºbeck city walls. The felling of numerous street trees and the originally planned demolition of the Rehbock and Scheune bastions met resistance from L√ºbeck's population. The Council and the B√ºrgerschaft (L√ºbeck's parliament) therefore decided that of the felled trees would be sold with their value going to a fund to be used by the Potsdam landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenn√© to improve the remaining ramparts artistically. The division of the M√∂llner lake by a railway embankment was met with little enthusiasm by L√ºbeck's residents. Economically, the operation of the railway proved to be a success, so that the LBE was able to use its profits to build the L√ºbeck port railway and a coking plant to supply its locomotives with coke. In 1852 the total route length of the LBE was 47.45 km. In 1863 the LBE was permitted to build a direct line to Hamburg, which opened on 1 August 1865. The approximately 63 km-long route ran from L√ºbeck via Reinfeld, Oldesloe, Ahrensburg, Rahlstedt and Wandsbek to L√ºbecker Bahnhof (L√ºbeck station) in Hamburg. The LBE's route network in 1870 was 111.27 kilometres long. Heavy traffic on the line to Hamburg meant that a second track was built in 1875-76. On 1 August 1882 the LBE opened a line from L√ºbeck to Travem√ºnde. On 1 July 1898 the line opened from Travem√ºnde‚Äînow called L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Hafen (port)‚Äîto L√ºbeck-Travem√ºnde Strand (beach). In 1902 took the LBE opened a connection for freight from Wandsbek via Hamburg- Rothenburgsort to the Berlin-Hamburg line, the origin of the modern Hamburg freight bypass. With the opening of the branch line from Travem√ºnde Hafen station to Niendorf (Ostsee) in 1913, the network of the LBE achieved its maximum length of 160.87 kilometres. =Connections to other lines= Simultaneously with the opening of L√ºbeck‚ÄìB√ºchen line by the LBE in 1851, the Berlin-Hamburg Railway Company opened a line from B√ºchen to Lauenburg. The LBE had already established a committee in 1850 with funds of 7,000 Prussian thalers to carry out technical tests on the building of a crossing over the Elbe near Lauenburg. After lengthy negotiations between the governments, it was finally decided to build a train ferry. The operation required a steam ship, commissioned from the engineering office of the Hamburg-Magdeburg Steamship Company (Hamburg-Magdeburger Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft) and put into service in 1864. In February 1869, the high traffic level led to a second ferry being put into service. Numerous breakdowns due to icing in winter and several accidents, however, showed clearly that the ferry would provide no lasting solution. With the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover by Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the military objections to a fixed Elbe crossing was removed. It was finally decided to build a swing bridge, which was opened in 1878 after two years of construction, allowing through trains from L√ºbeck to L√ºneburg. On 1 July 1870, the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway's L√ºbeck‚ÄìBad Kleinen line was opened to the LBE station in L√ºbeck, and in 1871 the first continuous services operated between Hamburg and Stettin (now Szczecin). The Eutin-L√ºbeck Railway Company established a line to Eutin in 1873, completing a link between L√ºbeck and Kiel. In 1916, L√ºbeck-Segeberg line opened to Bad Segeberg. From the beginning it was operated by the LBE; it only acquired its own rolling stock after the Second World War. An important railway junction was at Bad Oldesloe, which was connected to Neum√ºnster by the Altona-Kiel Railway Company (Altona-Kieler Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, AKE) in 1875. In 1884 the AKE was nationalised and became part of the Prussian State Railways (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Staatseisenbahnen (K.P.St.E)). In 1884, K.P.St.E opened a line to Schwarzenbek and in 1897 a line from Ratzeburg to Hagenow (the Kaiser Railway), creating two additional connections to the Berlin-Hamburg line. The opening of the Elmshorn-Barmstedt-Oldesloe line in 1907 created another connection to Oldesloe. In 1899, a line to Hollenbek was opened from M√∂lln by the Prussian State Railways, connecting with the Ratzeburg‚ÄìHagenow line. In 1903, the Ratzeburg Light Railway (Ratzeburger Kleinbahn) was opened from Ratzeburg and in 1904 the Alt-Rahlstedt‚ÄìVolksdorf‚ÄìWohldorf Electric Light Railway (Elektrische Kleinbahn Alt-Rahlstedt‚ÄìVolksdorf‚ÄìWohldor) was opened from Rahlstedt, where it connected with the L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg line. There were numerous industry sidings, especially in the urban areas of L√ºbeck, Hamburg and Wandsbek. In the 1910s the LBE refused to agree to connection at Ahrensburg station with the proposed Hamburg Forest Villages Railway (Waldd√∂rferbahn), with the result that this line, which is now part of line U 1 of the Hamburg U-Bahn runs through the southern part of the town, without connecting to the L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg line station. =New stations = In the area of L√ºbecker Bahnhof in Hamburg, in the early 20th century, there were three stations (Berliner Bahnhof, Hann√∂verscher Bahnhof and the Bahnhof Klosterthor), none of which had a direct connection to the LBE line. On 6 December 1906, they were replaced by the new Hamburg Hauptbahnhof (central station), when the LBE also extended its line to the station and closed its former station. The LBE also created a new station east of the Hauptbahnhof at Berliner Tor. In L√ºbeck, a new station, called L√ºbeck Hauptbahnhof, was built to the west in the Retteich Meadows. On 1 May 1908, the first train ran to the new station. At the nationalisation of the LBE, the L√ºbeck Hauptbahnhof was the largest private railway station in Germany. =Nationalisation = On 1 January 1938, the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company was acquired by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German State Railways), which since the beginning of 1930 had held a majority of its shares. The state of L√ºbeck had held a majority of shares in the company since 1883. During the 1921‚Äì1923 hyperinflation, the national Ministry of Transport had acquired shares in the LBE. By 1937 the German government held about 86 percent of its shares. It justified its decision to nationalise the company on the basis of the importance of the lines that were connected by the LBE. The company was dissolved on 1 January 1938.
