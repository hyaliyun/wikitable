She was the first regular president of Shimer College after the acrimonious departure of Thomas Lindsay in 2010. Shortly after assuming the presidency, Henking wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times: \\"Although liberal arts colleges serve smaller populations than do larger public institutions, we can be a valuable resource for our communities. We have the flexibility as institutions to develop and implement new ways of improving access and fixing costs. And we have the responsibility. I call on other liberal arts colleges in the Chicago area and across the country to join Shimer College in this effort.\\"  Selected works  *1992: \\"Protestant Religious Experience and the Rise of American Sociology,\\" Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 28(4): 325-339. *1993: \\"Rejected, Reclaimed, Renamed: Mary Daly on Psychology and Religion,\\" Journal of Psychology and Theology 21(3): 199-207. *1996: \\"The Open Secret: Dilemmas of Advocacy in the (Religious Studies) Classroom.\\" pp. 245‚Äì259 in Advocacy in the Classroom: Propaganda versus Engagement, Patricia Meyers Spacks ed.

Museum of Modern Art, New York City. Detail of Flag (1954-55). Museum of Modern Art, New York City. This image illustrates Johns' early technique of painting with thick, dripping encaustic over a collage made from found materials such as newspaper. This rough method of construction is rarely visible in photographic reproductions of his work. Flag is an encaustic painting by the American artist Jasper Johns. Created when Johns was 24 (1954‚Äì55), two years after he was discharged from the US Army, this painting was the first of many works that Johns has said were inspired by a dream of the U.S. flag in 1954. It is arguably the painting for which Johns is best known. Sources of inspiration The US flag was in the news repeatedly in 1954. The McCarthy hearings came to a close on 17 June 1954, only three days after Flag Day. On Flag Day, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an amendment to the pledge of allegiance to add the words \\"under God.\\" The New York Times ran article on facts and myths associated with the flag on the day before Flag Day, and then an article on the \\"discipline\\" of the flag on Flag Day itself, saying, with reference to a national air-raid drill \\"we are all soldiers now\\". Francis Scott Key, composer of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", was born in 1779, 175 years before 1954. The Iwo Jima Marine Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, with its large US flag, was dedicated on 11 November 1954. Johns and his father were both named after Sergeant William Jasper, who saved the fallen flag of the Americans at Fort Moultrie in the American Revolutionary War. Description The work measures by . It is made using encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, mounted on a plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes. Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, it is clear that the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough- textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse. Johns's selection of the US flag allows him to explore a familiar two-dimensional object, with its simple internal geometric structure and a complex symbolic meaning. Johns was attracted to painting \\"things the mind already knows,\\" and claimed that using a familiar object like the flag freed himself from the need to create a new design and allowed him to focus on the execution of the painting. Critics were unsure whether it was a painted flag or a painting of a flag; Johns later said it was both. His work is often described as Neo-Dadaist and anticipates aspects of pop art, minimal art, and conceptual art. History The painting was included in Johns's first solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery in early 1958. Alfred Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art, wanted to buy the work, but was concerned that it might be considered unpatriotic. He persuaded a friend, Philip Johnson, to buy it instead; Johnson bought it, and donated it to the Museum of Modern Art \\"in honor of Alfred H. Barr, Jr.\\" when he retired in 1968. Flag Series Johns made over 40 works based on the US flag, including a large and monochrome White Flag in 1955, and his 1958 work Three Flags with three superimposed flags showing a total of 84 stars. Jasper Johns' 48-star Flag from 1958 was purchased in 2010 by hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for an estimated $110 million, making it the most expensive painting ever by a living artist. In November 2014 the encaustic Flag (1983) was auctioned off for $36,000,000 at Sotheby's New York.

He is best remembered as the namesake of the Washington legislature's Canwell Committee to investigate communist influence in Washington state, patterned after the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) of the United States Congress. Background Albert Franklyn Canwell, known as \\"Al\\" to his friends, was born January 11, 1907, in Spokane, Washington. His paternal grandfather, James Canwell (1840-1876), was a farmer from the New England state of Maine who served on the Union side in the American Civil War in the 1st Maine Cavalry before being taken as a prisoner-of-war. His father also served in the U.S. Cavalry as a member of the 1st Cavalry Regiment and later of the 4th Cavalry Regiment. He served at various cavalry forts in the Arizona Territory and Territory of Alaska as well as at Fort Walla Walla in Washington state. His father mustered out of the cavalry in 1900 and with his wife, Ingeborg Christina Espelund Canwell (1876-1967), the Norwegian daughter of immigrants to the United States, decided to settle in a rural part of Eastern Washington near the city of Spokane. Due to their physical distance from the facility Canwell was held out of the local one-room school until the age of 8, being taught to read and write at home under the tutelage of his mother. The family moved to Spokane in 1916, where his father would ultimately become a member of the Teamster's Union. Albert passed the years of World War I as a schoolboy in various public schools of the city. Career The Seattle General Strike of 1919 shook up the rather progressive Seattle area (here, cover of the Union Record for Monday, February 3, 1919) In the years after the war, the young Canwell took time off school to work as an itinerant fruit picker, earning money and traveling to see the states of the Pacific coast. He also worked briefly as an assistant to an explosives specialist in the construction of a dam on the Hood River. He would continue traveling seasonally, working somewhat more lucratively as a fruit and produce packager until 1928 ‚Äî a trade which included short stints riding freight trains and staying for a day or two in hobo camps. It was in this period that Canwell was first exposed to radical industrial unionism in the form of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), commonly known as \\"Wobblies.\\" Canwell later recalled: > The Wobbly organization or IWW was very, very prominent and very active. In > general they were not a very desirable lot. I remember one incident. I was > coming home from the Kennewick area. I had worked down there and ended up > with a little money ‚Äî not very much ‚Äî and decided to ride a freight train > back to Spokane. I boarded a flatcar and somewhere along the line a couple > of fellows were working the train. You either had to have a Wobbly card or > get off the train. That's cold turkey ‚Äî supposed to pay a dollar for a red > card, and that wasn't the sort of think I was likely to do. In Kennewick, I > had bought a regular horse pistol. It was a .45 Colt; badly worn and > dangerous to shoot, but I bought it for five dollars and I had this. When I > was confronted with 'Either pay for this red ticket or get off the train!' I > decided that wasn't the way it would be and I displayed this firearm that > should have had wheels on it. Anyway, these two guys just took off, jumped > off the train into the sagebrush head-over-heels. That's all I saw of them. > That was one of my experiences with labor organizing. After 1928, Canwell left produce packing for good, taking a job as an employee of a large Spokane bookstore for two years before going to work for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Montana selling books door-to-door. In 1932 Canwell moved to Yakima and later to Ellensburg, where he worked for a regional advertising newspaper and in job printing. He soon made his way to Western Washington, settling in the Seattle area, where he made important contacts with the publisher of the Seattle Star and the Seattle Post- Intelligencer. Canwell became a general assignment news reporter for International News Service (INS), for whom he covered such fare as ongoing labor disputes in the Detroit auto industry and the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. He continued to maintain a home base in Yakima throughout this period. In covering the sometimes sensational labor strife in the Upper Midwest during the Great Depression era, Canwell again came face to face with radical labor organizers, this time in the orbit of the Communist Party, USA. In the process of interviewing auto workers, Canwell began to observe what he believed was dissonance between the actual perspective of rank-and-file workers, who in general did not express \\"any resistance to management that had substance\\" and the agenda of the union leadership. Canwell felt that the turmoil was \\"created by professional radicals who were, in general, Communists and Communist- trained labor leaders.\\" He later declared: > I don't think there would be any organized activity back here in the labor > field in the way of strikes without the Communist experts working there. I > remember discussing the thing with John L. Lewis...[and] he, among others, > said that the ablest organizers and the ablest leadership in labor was > provided by the Communist element; they specialized in it.\\" Canwell emerged as a dedicated conservative Republican, viewing the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as \\"a socialist venture and a repudiation of our free-enterprise, capitalist system.\\" He would remain a committed anti- communist for the rest of his life. In 1938, Canwell returned to his native Spokane, motivated to do so by his co-thinker Ashley Holden, political editor of the Spokane Spokesman-Review. In addition to his written journalism, Canwell began developing as a photo-journalist, taking numerous photographs of prominent people. He also began systematically collecting and organizing files of radical publications and maintaining research notes on leading participants in the radical movement. In the early 1940s, Canwell worked as the chief of the Spokane County Identification Bureau, attached to the Spokane County Sheriff's Office, replacing an individual who had been called up for military service during World War II. He also simultaneously worked for one year with the Identification Office of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Although he anticipated being drafted himself, Canwell was never called into military service during the war years. With the end of the war Canwell left the employ of the Sheriff's Office and took up life as a small scale cattle rancher. =Washington House of Representatives= Washington House Speaker Herbert M. Hamblen (1947) appointed Canwell as Canwell Committee chair Canwell was elected to the Washington state House of Representatives in November 1946. He made two primary promises to the voters of his Spokane district during the 1946 campaign ‚Äî to oppose new taxes and to take action against the spread of Communism in America. In an effort to fulfill this campaign promise, Canwell actively participated in helping to write the House resolution which established a Washington State legislative committee to investigate the activities of the Communist Party USA in the state. =Canwell committee= On March 8, 1947, the legislature's House Concurrent Resolution No. 10 established a Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. Speaker of the House Herbert M. Hamblen ‚Äî also hailing from the Eastern Washington city of Spokane ‚Äî tapped Canwell as the chairman of this interim committee. The committee consisted of 5 Republicans and 2 Democrats. The committee consequently became known as the Canwell Committee among the public and in the press. The committee was funded by the private donation of Fritz Jewitt, a wealthy lumberman and conservative political activist. The Canwell Committee met for the first time on January 27, 1948, at the Seattle Armory. Canwell's national supporter was China Lobby leader Alfred Kohlberg of New York City. \\"We had become, I‚Äôd say, good friends or people who respected each other, as the years progressed.\\" =Subsequent political career= In the election of 1948 Canwell attempted to move from the House to the State Senate, running as the Republican nominee in the November general election. He was defeated in that bid. Not deterred by his 1948 loss, Canwell ran for the United States Senate in 1950, but fell to defeat in the Republican primary. In 1952, Washington was awarded another seat in Congress as a result of the census of 1950 and Canwell ran for the new at-large seat. Although he emerged victorious in the Republican primary, he was defeated by Democrat Don Magnuson in the November general election. =American Intelligence Service= Canwell supported US Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s Following his electoral defeat Canwell continued as a professional anti-communist, launching a business called the American Intelligence Service from a downtown Spokane office. In this capacity he published an anti-communist newsletter called The Vigilante and emerged as a leading West Coast supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the Second Red Scare. In 1963 Canwell was the subject of a $225,000 libel suit when he intimated that Washington state representative John Goldmark and his wife were Communist agents. The suit gained national media attention and resulted with the jury finding in favor of the defendants on 5 of 9 primary claims and awarding $40,000 in damages ‚Äî at the time one of Washington's largest defamation verdicts. Death Canwell died age 95 on April 1, 2002, in Spokane of an unspecified illness.

Early life Margolese was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. He attended the University of British Columbia, dropping out after one year. His father, Leonard, also dropped out of college, to sell television sets in the early 1950s, ultimately building a successful television store. Cellular =Rogers Wireless= In 1978, at the age of 20, Margolese founded Canadian Telecom, a Vancouver-based radio paging company.Bethany McLean, ‚ÄúSatellite Killed The Radio Star,‚Äù Fortune, January 22, 2001, pp. 94-100. He struggled in his early years as an entrepreneur. In 1980, he changed his company's focus to what would become the future cellular market. He prognosticated in his 1980 position paper, years before the commercial introduction of cellular and at a time when computers were in use by less than one percent of the public, that cellular \\"has the potential to become all pervasive.\\" He also envisioned that it would \\"be used for much more\\" than just phone calls.Caroline Van Hasselt, High Wire Act: Ted Rogers and the Empire That Debt Built, Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley & Sons, 2008, Chapters 12 and 14. When cell phones became widely available, it paid big dividends for Margolese.Katy Bachman, \\"Space Invaders: The Next Wave,\\" Mediaweek, April 12, 1999. His company joined with Rogers Communications to form Cantel (a contraction of the name Canadian Telecom). Cantel would ultimately become Rogers Wireless, as of 2012 the largest cellular company in Canada, with over 9.3 million subscribers and revenues over $7 billion.Ian Hardy, ‚ÄúRogers Q2 2012: Wireless subscriber base reaches 9.351 million, revenue increases 1%,‚Äù Mobile Syrup, July 24, 2012.Hugh Thompson, ‚ÄúRogers reports year end results,‚Äù Digital Home, February 18, 2011.

He served as chairman and CEO of the satellite radio company. Margolese believed that, like cable TV, satellite radio would find an audience willing to pay for variety. The primary obstacle faced by CD Radio and then Sirius was resistance from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), who were under pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters, who felt threatened by the competition. In 1997, the FCC granted both CD Radio and XM Satellite Radio licenses to use a part of the S-band spectrum, costing CD Radio $83 million. In 1999, Margolese changed the name of CD Radio to Sirius Satellite Radio, so as not to be identified with the outdated technology of compact discs.Steve Warren, Radio: The Book, 4th Edition, Burlington, MA: Focal Press, 2005, p. 166.

Manuel de Ordiera was a Mexican caudillo and military officer serving in the armies of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and for the Mexican rebels during the Mexican War of Independence. He is perhaps best known for his command of besieged Mexican forces during the Siege of Cuautla in 1812 at which time he was a captain.  Role in the Siege of Cuautla  The royalist Spanish general, Ciriaco del Llano was marching with about 2,000 soldiers to the aid of F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja who was laying siege to Cuautla, Morelos. The leader of the Mexican insurgency, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n, who was consequently trapped in the city, heard the news that Llano was marching on Cuautla. Llano entered the Tierra Caliente on 28 February. Morelos decided to delay the arrival of these reinforcements and sent a sizable force first to be commanded by Jos√© Antonio Galeana to occupy the Barranca de Tlayacac with orders to ambush Llano's army. These orders were changed at the last minute and the surprise force was placed under the command of Manuel de Ordiera due to his knowledge of the terrain.\\"Morelos dio la comisi√≥n que pretend√≠a Galeana a D.

Pickford Collection: 1902-1986\\", Hiram College Library (last visited Aug. 16, 2012). Life and career Pickford was born in Bournemouth, England, in 1902. She studied at Newnham College, Cambridge University, where she was a founding member of the Cambridge University Biological Tea Club.Lawrence B. Slobodkin and Nancy G. Slack, \\"George Evelyn Hutchinson: 20th Century Ecologist\\", Endeavour, v.23, n.1 (1999). She received the equivalent of a B.A., a \\"National Sciences Tripos, Pt.I\\", since Cambridge University did not grant B.A.s to women at that time. She then traveled to South Africa, collecting and studying earth worms (oligochaetes). In 1931 she earned her Ph.D. at Yale under Alexander Petrunkevitch based on studies of her South African oligochaete worm collections. Pickford joined the Bingham Oceanographic Laboratory at Yale in 1931, where she worked for the next forty years. She taught at the assistant professor level from 1934 to 1959, when she was promoted to associate professor, and finally made a full professor of biology at Yale in 1969, retiring shortly thereafter in 1970. Pickford also taught at the women's college Albert Magnus, hired by Marcella Boveri.Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science, p.1135 (in \\"Dorothea Rudnick\\" entry). Pickford was a member of various research expeditions, including the 1951 Danish Galathea expedition, and carried out research in a wide variety of organisms. She is perhaps best known for her foundational work in the field of comparative endocrinology. She did extensive studies of the pituitary hormone prolactin, discovering that in killifish prolactin is required to maintain osmotic balance in fresh water; this work was the underpinnings for most research on prolactin in vertebrates.Patricia Stocking Brown, \\"Early Women Ichthyologists\\", Environmental Biology of Fishes, v.41, pp.9-30 (1994). Pickford's 1957 monograph on the topic, \\"The Physiology of the Pituitary Gland of Fishes\\", is \\"considered an early and still enormously useful classic\\" in the field of comparative endocrinology,Brown 1994, p.17. the \\"bible for scientists on the endocrinology of lower vertebrates.\\"\\"Pickford, Grace Evelyn (1902-1986)\\", Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science, pp.1020-1021. In the course of this work Pickford developed a number of important techniques still used today in endocrine studies. Similarly, she showed that Latimeria, like sharks, uses urea to regulate the osmotic pressure of its blood. On the 1951 Galatea expedition to the Indo- Malay region, she completed a study of Vampyroteuthis, a deep sea cephalopod that resembles both an octopus and a squid, developing \\"ingenious\\" technologies to handle the technical problems of studying in deep seas. Her large collection of water beetles is today stored at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. Pickford was married for a short while (approximately 1931 to 1934) to fellow biologist George Evelyn Hutchinson.

It is the sole genus in the family Trogloraptoridae, and includes only one species, Trogloraptor marchingtoni. These spiders are predominantly yellow-brown in color with a maximum leg span of . They are remarkable for having hook-like claws on the raptorial last segments of their legs. Trogloraptor belongs to one of only three new spider families described since 1990. The specific name is in honor of the amateur cave biologist and deputy sheriff Neil Marchington. Discovery The spiders were first collected in 2010 by Geo Graening, Neil Marchington, Ron Davis and Daniel Snyder, cave conservationists from the Western Cave Conservancy. They were described in 2012 by a research team consisting of arachnologists Charles Griswold, Tracy Audisio and Joel Ledford of the California Academy of Sciences. The male holotype was recovered from the M2 cave near Grants Pass, Oregon, on July 29, 2010. The female holotype was recovered from a cave in Josephine County, Oregon, on September 16, 2010. Lead researcher Griswold claimed that Trogloraptor might explain the legends of giant cave spiders in the area. The discovery is also notable because only two other new spider families have been described since 1990. The American arachnologist Norman Platnick commented that it was \\"...as fascinating to arachnologists as the discovery of a new dinosaur is to paleontologists.\\" Taxonomy Trogloraptor includes only one species, Trogloraptor marchingtoni, and is the only genus in the monotypic family Trogloraptoridae. It was initially suggested that Trogloraptor was a primitive member of the six-eyed spider superfamily Dysderoidea. However, Trogloraptor exhibits several unique features, including primitive respiratory systems, that justify its assignment to a separate family. The family probably diverged from other spiders about 130 million years ago, which would make it another notable relict taxon from North America. A 2014 study based on ribosomal DNA found that Trogloraptor fell outside the Dysderoidea and concluded that it should not be included in this clade. The specific name is in honor of Neil Marchington. The generic name Trogloraptor means \\"cave robber\\", in reference to the spider's habitat and hooked raptorial tarsi. Distribution Additional live specimens recovered in 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves. Except for a single juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of old growth redwood forests of northwest California, none have been found outside the caves. This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and may represent a new undescribed species. The family Trogloraptoridae may have had a wider distribution given that redwood forests encompassed a far greater area in North America during the Pliocene (about 5 mya). Other species may still be present in other caves. Description Hook-like claws on the raptorial tarsus IV of a female specimen Adult Trogloraptor have six eyes and a body length of about in males and in females. With its legs outstretched, the spider can reach up to in length. The entire body is yellow-brown, except for a dark brown V-shaped mark on the cephalothorax, the orange-brown chelicerae, and the purple-brown abdomen (opisthosoma) with a series of faint light- colored chevron markings. The cephalothorax carapace is pear-shaped with a heart-shaped sternum. The abdomen is oval and sparsely covered with small bristles (setae). The males possess enlarged piriform pedipalps. The spiders are unique in the flexible and teethed hook-like claws on the last segments (tarsus) of their legs. These elongated claws resemble those of spiders in the family Gradungulidae of Australia and New Zealand, but the two families are only distantly related. Hooked tarsal claws are also present to a lesser extent in the unrelated genera Doryonychus of Tetragnathidae, Hetrogriffus of Thomisidae and Celaenia of Araneidae. Ecology Trogloraptor spin simple webs with only a few strands, hung from the roofs of caves. Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a significant function in capturing prey. Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand (Spelungula cavernicola, a gradungulid), Trogloraptor probably dangle upside down from their webs, snatching at passing flying insects with their claws. However their exact prey remains unknown. Captured live specimens were raised in climate-controlled laboratory conditions in an effort to find out. These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey. Like most spiders, Trogloraptor possess venom glands. However, the venom is not known to be harmful to humans. The spiders themselves are very shy and unaggressive. They immediately flee illumination.

It was described by in The Guardian in 2011 as \\"Satan holding court in what looks like a solo performance in the Albert Hall (decades in advance)\\". Popular success of John Martin's religious paintings, particularly Belshazzar's Feast (first exhibited at the British Institution in 1821, and published as engravings in 1826), led to a commission in 1823 from London publisher Septimus Prowett for Martin to illustrate a new edition of Milton's Paradise Lost. Martin made mezzotint engravings of 24 subjects in two sizes, 48 plates in all, with large prints measuring and small prints . The engraving of Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council illustrates the debate among Satan's \\"Stygian Council\\" in the council-chamber of Pand√¶monium at the beginning of Book II of Paradise Lost. In the engraving, Satan is depicted enthroned at the heart of the hall of his Palace of Pand√¶monium, at the centre of a rotunda filled with onlooking throngs of fallen angels, illuminated by the new technology of gaslight. His throne is placed atop a black hemisphere. The composition may be inspired by an illustration in the 1782 edition of William Beckford's novel Vathek. The prints were published by subscription from 1825 to 1827, with two prints and accompanying text published each month, to be bound together by the subscriber. The engravings were also available to buy separately as sets or single prints. The book and the engravings were considerable critical and commercial success, with Martin's original compositions praised for their invention and power. Martin was encouraged to start work on engraved illustrations of the Bible, and published a further large format print of Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council in 1831, measuring . According to musicologist Edward Lockspeiser, this engraving had a singular effect and a lasting influence on the composer Hector Berlioz.Lockspeiser, Edward: Music and Painting: A Study in Comparative Ideas from Turner to Schoenberg. Icon Editions, Harper & Row, p. 28 (1973) (Lockspeiser devotes and entire chapter to Berlioz and John Martin) The bold iconography and design of Martin's engravings were inspirations for scenes in D. W.

It has also been interpreted as a late version of the Nabataean Arabic language in its transition to Arabic. It has been described by Irfan Shahid as \\"the most important Arabic inscription of pre-Islamic times\\"Irfan Shah√Æd, Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century, (Dumbarton Oaks, 2006), 31. and by Kees Versteegh as \\"the most famous Arabic inscription\\".Kees Versteegh and C. H. M. Versteegh, The Arabic Language, (Columbia University Press, 1997), 31. It is also an important source for the relationships between the Romans and the Arabs in that period. Differences from Arabic The inscription is written in the Nabatean Aramaic script, but there are ambiguities, as the script has only 22 signs (some with added annotations), and the Arabic dialect had 28 or 29 consonants. The script has ligatures between some letters that show a transition towards an Arabic script. Some of the terms used in the text are closer to Aramaic than Arabic; for example, it uses the Aramaic patronymic \\"b-r\\", rather than the Arabic term \\"b-n\\". However, most of the text is very close to the Classical Arabic used in the Qur'an in the 7th century. Discovery The inscription was found on 4 April 1901 by two French archaeologists, Ren√© Dussaud and Fr√©d√©ric Macler, at al-Namara (also NamƒÅrah; modern Nimreh) near Shahba and Jabal al-Druze in southern Syria, about south of Damascus and northeast Bosra, and east of the Sea of Galilee. The location was near the boundary of the Roman Empire at the date it was carved, the Limes Arabicus of the province of Arabia Petraea. Al- Namara was later the site of a Roman fort. History The inscription is carved in five lines on a block of basalt, which may have been the lintel for a tomb. It is the epitaph of a recently deceased Arab king of the Lakhmids, Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr, and dated securely to AD 328. Imru' al-Qays followed his father 'Amr ibn Adi in using a large army and navy to conquer much of Iraq and the Arabian peninsula from their capital at al-Hirah. At this time, they were vassals of the Persian Sassanids. Raids on Iran triggered a campaign by Sassanid emperor Shapur II which conquered the Iraqi lands, and Imru' al-Qays retreated to Bahrain. He moved to Syria to seek help from the Roman emperor Constantine. Imru' al-Qays converted to Christianity before his death in Syria and was entombed in the Syrian desert. His conversion is mentioned in the Arab history of Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi, an early ninth century scholar, but Irfan Shah√Æd notes \\"there is not a single Christian formula or symbol in the inscription.\\" While Theodor N√∂ldeke argued against a Christian affiliation of Imru' al Qays bin 'Amr, Shahid noted that his Christian belief could be \\"heretical or of the Manichaean type\\". The first tracing and reading of the Namara inscription was published in the beginning of the twentieth century by Ren√© Dussaud. According to his reading, the text starts by informing the reader that this inscription was the burial monument of the king, then it introduces him and lists his achievements, and finally announces the date of his death. Many other scholars have re-read and analyzed the language of the inscription over the last century but, despite their slight differences, they all agreed with Dussaud's central viewpoint that the Namara stone was the burial monument of King Imru' al-Qays. In 1985, James A. Bellamy offered the first significantly different tracing of the inscription since Dussaud, including a breakthrough tracing correction of two highly contested words in the beginning of the third line (pointed out on Dussaud's original tracing figure as words 4 and 5). However, despite Bellamy's new important re- tracings, his Arabic reading fully agreed with the general theme of Dussaud's original reading. Bellamy's widely accepted new translation of the inscription reads: James A. Bellamy, A New Reading of the Namara Inscription, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 105.1 (1985), pp. 31‚Äì48. The original tracing and reading of the Namara inscription that was published by Ren√© Dussaudin 1905 (numbers added to facilitate discussion in this article) > This is the funerary monument of Imru' al-Qays, son of 'Amr, king of the > Arabs, and (?) his title of honour was Master of Asad and Nizar. > And he subdued the Asadis and they were overwhelmed together with their > kings, and he put to flight Madhhij thereafter, and came > driving them to the gates of Najran, the city of Shammar, and he subdued > Ma'add, and the dealt gently with the nobles > of the tribes, and appointed them viceroys, and they became phylarchs for > the Romans. And no king has equalled his achievements. > Thereafter he died in the year 223 on the 7th day of Kaslul. Oh the good > fortune of those who were his friends! Below is Bellamy's modern Arabic translation of the Namara inscription, with brief added explanations between parenthesis: > The mention of the date ‚Äì the 7th of Kaslul in the year 223 of the Nabatean > era of Bostra ‚Äì securely dates his death to the 7th day of December in AD > 328. Ambiguities in translation Parts of the translation are uncertain. > For example, early translations suggested that Imru' al-Qays was king of all > the Arabs, which seems unlikely after he moved to Syria. It is also not > clear whether he campaigned towards Najran while he was based at al-Hirah or > after his move to Syria and, in either case, whether he did so alone or with > assistance from the Sassanids or the Romans.

Kennedy serves as managing director of the California Clean Energy Fund, a non-profit dedicated to optimising the clean energy transition. He co-founded Sungevity, a rapidly growing residential solar power company, and Powerhouse, the primer solar incubator in Oakland. While at Sungevity, Kennedy won a Planet Forward Innovator of the Year award from the PBS program Planet Forward.  Early life  Kennedy was born in Los Angeles to Australian parents. Kennedy and his family moved between the United States, Europe, and Australia until he was 11 years old, when his family settled in Sydney, Australia. Kennedy attended St. Aloysius School. As a youngster Kennedy was a community organizer, fundraiser, journalist, and youth activist. At the age of 12 he was involved with a successful campaign to prevent construction of a dam in Tasmania. From 1983 he worked with the Australian Conservation Foundation on various projects including forestry protection and ozone depletion. In 1990 Kennedy was a representative at the Montreal Protocol Negotiations in London, where he met Alec Guettel (with whom he would later found Sungevity). In 1992 Kennedy organized around the first Rio Earth Summit and worked for the UN Conference on Environment and Development.  Career  Kennedy began working with Greenpeace in the early 1990s, as a researcher seeking to end new oil exploration in Papua New Guinea. He almost died of malaria in the process. He left Greenpeace in 1995. In 1996 Kennedy founded and directed Project Underground, an organization focused on human rights and committed to protecting people threatened by mining and oil operations. Kennedy became the Director of the USA Clean Energy Now Campaign in 2000, and forged the California Clean Energy Now Campaign in 2001 and 2002; this campaign helped create the state‚Äôs California Solar Initiative, which provides substantial market support that has helped many citizens go solar. He moved back to Australia in 2003 and was the Campaigns Manager for Greenpeace Australia Pacific from 2003 to 2006. Kennedy is an acquaintance of actress, Cate Blanchett, helping her in a project to green the building of the Sydney Theatre Company. In December 2006, Kennedy left Australia and moved to Oakland, California, where he currently lives with his wife and his youngest daughter, Ena Kennedy Yoshitani, to start Sungevity Inc., a residential solar power company, with colleagues Andrew Birch (CEO) and Alec Guettel (Chairman of the Board). The company designs home solar systems; finances new systems with its Solar Lease program; and manages system installation, maintenance, and performance. Kennedy founded Sungevity to promote the use of clean energy and eliminate the world‚Äôs dependence on fossil fuel. In 2010 Kennedy offered to install solar panels on the roof of the White House. He also installed 48 solar panels on the roof of the residence of the president of The Maldives. In 2015, Kennedy became managing director of the California Clean Energy Fund, a non-profit dedicated to optimizing the clean energy transition by connecting money to investments, ideas to support and issues to solutions. Its family of initiatives seeks to bring about the energy transition that is already underway, but sooner and better. The initiatives include CalCharge, a consortium of energy storage experts working together to develop breakthrough technologies (Kennedy serves as President); New Energy Nexus, an international network of clean energy accelerators and incubators providing the support global startups need to succeed, and; CalSEED, a seed-stage grant making fund providing early-stage financial support to promising energy concepts. Kennedy is dedicated to helping solar technologies spread. He co-founded Powerhouse, the only incubator and accelerator solely focused on supporting solar entrepreneurs to succeed. Additionally, Kennedy serves on the board of The Solar Foundation, a global research and education organization in Washington, DC, VoteSolar, and several solar start-ups including Powerhive, a solar utility in Kenya, and Sunergise, a Fijian company taking solar as a service across the South Pacific, and was a founding board director of Mosaic, a solar-focused, crowd-funding start-up in Oakland, California.

A coal exchange was established in 1770 on Thames Street in the City of London, near the site of Smart's Quay and close to Billingsgate Market; the main trades at Billingsgate Dock were fish and coal. The market was established by the main coal merchants as a private body to regulate the trade of coal in the capital, and was controlled by private coal merchants until the old Coal Exchange was bought by the Corporation of London in 1807. A new building had been built in 1805, with a recessed classical portico supported by small Doric pillars and triangular pediment above, with stone steps leading to a quadrangle within. Under the control of the City Corporation, the Coal Exchange became a free and open market, regulated by various Acts of Parliament, including Acts in 1831, 1838 and 1845. At this period, London was heated almost entirely by coal. By 1848, approximately 3.5 million tons of coal was being transported each year from the coalfields in Northumberland and Durham to London, with over 12,000 shiploads carried on nearly 3,000 vessels. The coal trade was also an important source of tax revenue for the city. The duty on coal funded Wren's rebuilding of more than fifty city churches and St Paul's Cathedral after the Great Fire of London in 1666, and also funded for other building works in the metropolis, such as the Thames Embankment. Historically, coal taxes (metage, payable on each chaldron of 35 bushels or the imperial ton) were charged by the City based on volume measurements. A coal duty of 4 pence was confirmed by James I, with a duty of 8 pence more added under William III and Mary II, and an additional 1 pence added to fund the construction of the new Coal Exchange. From 1831, the City of London charged a duty of 13 pence per imperial ton before coal could be unshipped, and a certificate was sent to the Coal Exchange stating the date of shipment, name and owner of the ship, quantity of coal, where it was mined, and the price paid. The coal trade was dominated by sea transport until 1845, but railway transportation increased in importance in the 1850s and 1860s, with similar quantities carried on the rails, and the coal duty was extended to coal brought within 20 miles of London by any means in 1862. By 1875, five million tons of coal were being brought to London each year by rail and three million tons by sea. Thousands of workmen of various grades were employed to move the coal from the ships to a customer's coal cellar, with \\"coal-whippers\\" carrying sacks of coal by hand from a ship to a coal merchant's lighter, and then taken onshore by \\"coal-backers\\". The coal was sorted by \\"coal-sifter\\" and put into coal-sacks by a \\"coal-filler\\", then transported by \\"coal-waggoners\\" and delivered by a \\"coal-trimmer\\". The work was heavy manual labour, but the trade was essential and workers were reasonably well paid for the period. In the Coal Exchange, coal factors acted as agents between sellers and buyers. Factors agreed with coal sellers how much coal is available on a particular day, based on the ships available and the market price, with the market meeting on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 12 noon to 2:30 pm. All sales were agreed privately, with no public auction, and factors would take a 0.5% commission. By 1845, a petition was made to build a new exchange, and the City Clerk of Works, James Bunstone Bunning, produced a design. Construction started in December 1847 and the new Coal Exchange was formally opened by Prince Albert on 30 October 1849. The Lord Mayor and City MP, James Duke, was made a baronet in honour of the occasion. Description Interior of the 1805 London Coal Exchange. C.1808 The new Coal Exchange was built on the north side of Thames Street, on the east side of its junction with St. Mary-at-Hill, with four floors. A Roman hypocaust was found during the excavation of the building's foundations, part of the Roman house at Billingsgate, and preserved in its basement and is now a scheduled ancient monument. The south and west fronts, facing the streets, were built in Italianate style from Portland stone, with four floors, measuring wide and high. At the southwest corner was an unusual high semi- circular portico with Doric columns and entablature, surmounted by a tower of Portland stone high, with a conical roof topped by a gilt ball. Within the tower was a staircase providing access to the upper floors. The ground floor portico provided access to an entrance vestibule leading to a large central circular vaulted hall. The central rotunda was in diameter, with a wooden floor inlaid with a large mariner's compass. The rotunda was covered by a glazed cast iron dome with its centre above the ground, held up by 8 cast iron piers, supported by 32 ribs 42 ft 6in long. The dome design was based on that of the Bourse de commerce of Paris by Fran√ßois-Joseph B√©langer and Fran√ßois Brunet, completed in 1811. The dome was decorated with \\"Raphaelesque\\" encaustic panels by Frederick Sang on a coal-related theme, depicting fossils of ferns, palms and other plants, and images of collieries and mining operations, and views of North Shields, Sunderland, Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham together, with cast iron decorative features. The piers also supported three tiers of cast iron galleries which opened on to offices around the exterior of the building which were occupied by coal factors and other agents and merchants connected with the coal trade. Demolition The building suffered some damage in the Second World War, and it ceased to be used as a coal exchange after the war when the coal industry was nationalised. It was then used as offices, but the City of London did not proceed with plans to refurbish the building in the 1950s because its demolition had been suggested to allow widening of the road from Blackfriars to the East End, and it became progressively more dilapidated. Nonetheless, in the 1950s, Professor Richard Hitchcock described it as \\"the prime city monument of the early Victorian period\\". In September 1956, John Betjeman (a founding member of the Victorian Society and a passionate defender of Victorian architecture) gave a speech to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in the rotunda of the Coal Exchange to argue for its preservation. It became a Grade 2 listed building in 1958. A letter published in The Times and signed by Walter Gropius, Sigfried Giedion, Josep Llu√≠s Sert and Eduard Sekler described the Coal Exchange as \\"a landmark in the history of early iron construction\\". Various alternatives were proposed. The Georgian Group and the Victorian Society both favoured preservation of the Coal Exchange, even if that meant that the \\"very dull, plain and ordinary\\" rear parts of the nearby Grade-1 listed Custom House (then the headquarters of HM Customs & Excise) were removed. Others suggested a scheme in which a walkway would be added in arches under the Coal Exchange. There was also a suggestion that the dome could become part of the new Royal School of Music in the Barbican, or shipped to Australia to become part of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but funds were not available. MP Tom Driberg made a speech in an adjournment debate in February 1961, quoting a statement by Sir Mortimer Wheeler published in The Times the previous day, saying that \\"Professor Pevsner has placed the threatened London Coal Exchange among the twelve irreplaceable buildings of 19th century England ... It expresses an era of urban revolution as no other surviving building is capable of doing ... The Coal Exchange is a national monument in the fullest sense of the phrase, and its destruction would be unforgivable.\\" The Corporation was uncooperative, and declined to allow any respite. One member remarked that \\"We cannot spend time on the preservation of a Victorian building\\". Despite campaigns and protests, it was demolished in November 1962 to make way for a \\"vital\\" widening of Lower Thames Street. The demolition of the Coal Exchange was described by author Hermione Hobhouse as \\"one of the great conservationist horror stories\\" and its loss has been compared to the demolition of the Adelphi in 1936 and of Euston Arch shortly before, in 1961. The cleared site was then left empty for 10 years while other land was acquired for the road widening scheme. Cast iron dragons which were mounted on the eaves parapet above the entrance to the Coal Exchange were preserved and were erected as dragon boundary marks in October 1963 in Temple Gardens on Victoria Embankment. Half-sized replicas were erected at the other main entrances to the City, in preference to the more fierce dragon at Temple Bar.

It flies relatively low over the ground and hovers. Habitat, diet, hunting They live in forests, mines, caves and tunnels, and occasionally in buildings. Normally, they live alone or a few together, rather than in large colonies. They are insect eating, living on moths and beetles. IUCN red list assessment In 2008 the IUCN reported: \\"It is widespread, but naturally rare species. In Japan it is considered Vulnerable because of loss of old-growth forests, but at present it is not suspected that the species is declining throughout its range at a rate that would warrant listing in a threatened category. However, as logging activity increases, habitat loss may pose an increasingly great threat in the future.

At that point, Frederik sent him abroad to learn more about chemistry and pharmacy in a number of European countries. While in England, in 1713, he learned of the death of his royal patron and of the consequent termination of his patronage. For the next three years, he found work in London with a wealthy and renowned Dutch surgeon, Abraham Cyprianus, a Fellow of the Royal Society. At this time he became acquainted with several members of the Royal Society, including Isaac Newton and Hans Sloane. In 1716 Neumann return briefly to Germany in the entourage of George I.

The film was intended to be released in Malaysian cinemas on 13 September 2012 but the release was delayed until 29 August 2013 due to some controversy regarding the portrayal of the racial riots being the plot point of the film.

Reception  = Critical response = Aidil Rusli writing for The Star calls the film \\"an engaging experience\\" despite its \\"niggling faults\\" - its approach to an episodic narrative \\"having to cram everything into a two- hour movie\\", and \\"less-than-believable\\" CGI shots to illustrate the period the film was set in. Umapagan Ampikaipakan, of radio station BFM 89.9, on the review website UmaandJoe.com says that the film glorified Abdul Razak and Dr Ismail at the expense of their predecessor Tunku Abdul Rahman; that it had \\"made Tunku look like a blithering fool. It made him look toothless. [...] when you tell the story, you don‚Äôt undermine another leader. You don‚Äôt say Bill Clinton was great but JFK was a loser.‚Äù His co-host Johanan Sen observed on the production aspect of the film where its first half \\"looks like an unfinished History Channel special without voiceovers done or without any proper historians being interviewed. [...] ...a re-enactment footage arranged together without proper narrative.\\" Erni Mahyuni of Malay Mail, in a scathing commentary of the film that was widely circulated online, also stated of its seemingly lacking of a coherent narrative; with the ensemble cast's performance having \\"the collective expressiveness of IKEA furniture\\". The performance of lead actor Rusdi Ramli in particular was derided for his \\"unconvincing\\" expressions and \\"forced\\" chemistry with co-actor Zizan Nin, the latter aspect coming across as \\"a parody of bromance\\". Erni further wrote that the movie appeared to have negationist undertones against the 1969 riots and it negatively portrayed the two statesmen protagonists \\"as pompous idiots who do not trust their wives\\". There was also some common ground regarding how the central characters of Abdul Razak and Ismail, and their wives had been miscast by more younger actors. = Box-office = The movie failed to collect back its budget, affected by the Penang screening ban and intense competition with other international movies that were also showing in cinemas at the time such as Kick-Ass 2 and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. In addition, another local movie that was released at about the same time titled KL Zombi surpassed it and the aforementioned international films to hit second place in opening weekend takings between 29 August and 4 September alone, with only Elysium beating it at first place. Controversy = Penang ban, viewing advisory and screening = Before the release of the film, it sparked controversies about the accuracy of its contents after the release of the trailer in relation to the 13 May riots. Opposition lawmakers alleged that the film portrayed the Chinese and the Democratic Action Party (DAP) in a negative light. Further controversy was caused after there were allegations that the film's official Facebook page featured a picture of opposition lawmaker Lim Kit Siang being carried away by a group of uniformed officials with captions claiming that Lim had urinated on the Selangor flag in the house of former Selangor chief minister Harun Idris. Lim denied the allegation in response and said that the picture featuring him in the Facebook page was actually taken in Sabah in 1984. The director Shuhaimi Baba also denied that Lim was to be featured in the film. On 28 August 2013, the Penang state government had sent out advisory directivesMok, Opalyn (29 August 2013); \\"Penang cinemas pull plug on ‚ÄòTanda Putera‚Äô\\"  Malaysia. The Malay Mail Online. Retrieved on 8 January 2014. to all cinema operators in the state to not screen the movie. Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng had claimed that there are slanderous scenes that could provoke racial hatred. However, less than 24 hours after the directives were issued on 29 August, the state government issued another contradictory letter stating they were merely \\"advised\\" against screening it, instead of otherwise banning it. Cinemas in Penang eventually screened the movie despite the state government's advisory. Communications and Multimedia Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek said the movie would reach cinemas in Penang starting 31 August 2013.

He presently serves as the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). Donaldson was originally appointed to the position in 2010, and President Barack Obama reappointed him in August 2013 for another four-year term. Formerly the State Historic Preservation Officer of California, Donaldson has been practicing preservation architecture as a profession for more than 40 years.  Early life and family  Donaldson was born in August 13, 1943 at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune to Milford \\"Don\\" Donaldson, a U.S. Navy corpsman and Jean Donaldson, a Navy nurse. Immediately after his birth Donaldson's parents were ordered to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The Donaldsons lived in a Quonset hut on base for three years before moving to Oceanside, California, in San Diego County, where Wayne grew up with his younger brother, Robert \\"Bob\\" Calvin Donaldson. During his early life Donaldson, a Boy Scout in Troop 739, San Diego-Imperial Council, Oceanside, eventually to become an Eagle Scout. By the middle of the 20th century Milford Wayne Donaldson knew he would be an architect.  Education  After high school, Donaldson earned his Bachelor of Architecture from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, California, in 1967; a Master of Science in Architecture from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, and a Master of Arts in Public History and Teaching from the University of San Diego. From 1966 to 1968, he attended undergraduate studies at Uppsala University in Sweden. In 2007, Donaldson received an honorary Master of Architecture from the NewSchool of Architecture and Design in San Diego, which in 1980, he founded with Dick Welsh.  Professional career  Donaldson‚Äôs architectural knowledge unites historic building methods and archaic materials with state-of-the-art twenty-first century construction technologies. His architectural specialty is adobe, sod, stone, and earthen structures. Licensed to practice architecture in California, Nevada and Arizona, Donaldson began his professional career as an associate for the San Diego architectural firm of Robert Mosher and Roy Drew, \\"Architects Mosher Drew,\\" from 1972 to 1978. He and his former wife and partner Nancy founded their own firm, \\"Architect Milford Wayne Donaldson, FAIA\\" (Fellow of the American Institute of Architects) in 1978, specializing in historic preservation and renovation and adaptive reuse of existing structures. In 2004, before his appointment as CA SHPO, Donaldson renamed and sold his firm Heritage Architecture & Planning which is still located in San Diego. In 2007, Donaldson began and incorporated a new architectural firm, \\"Architect Milford Wayne Donaldson, FAIA, Inc., A Professional Corporation,\\" which is still an active. In 1991, the California Council of the American Institute of Architects (CCAIA) acknowledged Donaldson for his statewide leadership in historic preservation and in the interpretation of the State Historical Building Code which allowed the rehabilitation of historic buildings. In 1992, Donaldson was inducted into the AIA College of Fellows. Later, following the 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes and 1994 Northridge earthquake, Donaldson lent his expertise to save historic buildings from unwarranted demolition. His efforts continue today as a ‚ÄúTrainer in Emergency Response‚Äù for the California Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA) Service Worker Volunteer Program. Donaldson has also instructed classes in architecture, first at California Polytechnic State University from 1969 to 1970, and later at Southwestern Community College from 1976 to 1984. Donaldson continues to lecture on preservation architecture at various schools, colleges, and universities.  California Office of Historic Preservation  Donaldson served as California‚Äôs State Historic Preservation Officer from April 2004 until his retirement in September 2012. The first architect to serve as a CA SHPO, Donaldson was appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in April 2004. The SHPO serves as chief administrative officer of the California Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) in Sacramento and also as Executive Secretary of the State Historical Resources Commission (SHRC). Meeting four times a year, the SHRC is a nine- member state review board, appointed by the governor, responsible for identifying, registering, and preserving California‚Äôs cultural heritage.

History Brabag, sometimes called 'BRABAG', is a portmanteau acronym () denoting the firm's chief inputs and outputs: brown coal (lignite) and gasoline ('benzine'). Upon the ramp-up of the Nazi program of industrial autarky that marked the approach of war, Berlin saw that one of its weakest points was the almost complete absence of crude oil production within German borders; this insight coincided with the emergence in both Hitler's Chancellery and the General Staff of a belief in a blitzkrieg war-fighting strategy that centered on Panzer warfare, buttressed by warplanes carrying out tactical air support. This strategy needed synthetic petroleum products. Berlin therefore in October 1934 ordered the German chemical conglomerate I.G. Farben to join with a cartel of lignite mineowners and other firms to invest 100.0 million Reichsmarks as an initial tranche of venture capital; these funds were used to set up a new firm, Brabag. The new firm was ordered to distill gasoline and other synthetic petroleum products, of which Germany had very little, from lignite, of which the Germans had an ample supply. Chemists had invented the Bergius process and the Fischer-Tropsch process to accomplish this goal. Soon plants were built. In 1937, for example, Brabag completed the Brabag II facility in Ruhland- Schwarlheide (the 4th Nazi Germany Fischer-Tropsch plant) to produce gasoline and diesel fuel from lignite coal. =Forced labor= As Germany deepened its commitment to World War II, Brabag's plants became vital elements of the war effort. Like other strategic firms under the Nazi regime, Brabag was assigned a significant quota of forced labor of conscripts from the occupied nations. One estimate counts 13,000 Nazi concentration camp laborers working for Brabag. Brabag plants were a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II. Production of synthetic petroleum products had been severely damaged by the end of the war in 1945.

It developed on February 25 near the southwest coast of Madagascar, and initially moved to the northwest before turning to the southwest. With favorable conditions for development, Japhet quickly intensified in the Mozambique Channel, reaching maximum winds of , sustained over 10 minutes. After stalling briefly, the cyclone turned to the northwest, weakening slightly before striking Mozambique just south of Vilankulo on March 2\\\\. Japhet slowly weakened while progressing inland, dissipating over Zambia on March 6\\\\. Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy rainfall that caused widespread river flooding. The rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore. In two provinces in Mozambique, the cyclone damaged or destroyed 25,000 houses, leaving at least 23,000 people homeless. Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise in Mozambique several days after the storm's passage. There were 17 deaths in Mozambique. Further inland, remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in Zimbabwe, killing eight people. Meteorological history On February 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of convection in the Mozambique Channel. On February 25, M√©t√©o France (MF) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 13 when the system was located along the southwest coast of Madagascar. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, noting that environmental conditions favored development, including weak wind shear. The system developed organized convection in a circular pattern, and on February 26, the MF and JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 13 and Tropical Cyclone 19S, respectively. With a mid-level ridge to the south, the depression moved generally westward, and after intensifying further, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Japhet by the Direction de la M√©t√©orologie et de l'Hydrologie of Madagascar late on February 26. After attaining tropical storm status, Japhet quickly intensified while it began moving to the southwest, due to a break in the ridge. At 0000 UTC on February 28, the MF assessed that the storm strengthened into a tropical cyclone ‚Äì a storm with 10 minute sustained winds of . This was about 12 hours after the JTWC upgraded Japhet to the same intensity but with 1 minute sustained winds. About 18 hours after designating Japhet as a tropical cyclone, MF estimated the storm attained 10 minute sustained winds of and upgraded the storm to an intense tropical cyclone; this made Japhet only the sixth such cyclone in the Mozambique Channel in 24 years. After further intensification, the cyclone peaked in intensity on March 1. The JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of with gusts to , while MF estimated 10 minute sustained winds of . Cyclone Japhet maintained its peak winds for about 24 hours, during which it remained nearly stationary. Subsequently, the storm began a northwest track toward the Mozambique coast, gradually weakening due to decreased outflow and dry air. At about 1700 UTC on March 2, Japhet made landfall just south of Vilankulo, Mozambique, with winds of as estimated by the JTWC. The cyclone gradually weakened over land, decreasing below tropical cyclone status by early on March 3\\\\. Japhet crossed into southern Zimbabwe, and both JTWC and MF discontinued warnings before Japhet dissipated on March 5. Impact and aftermath Satellite-estimated rainfall for Cyclone Japhet While Japhet was developing, the pressure gradient between it and a ridge produced winds of 93 km/h (58 mph) on Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel. Heavy rains affected southwestern Madagascar, but there was no major damage. Before Japhet struck Mozambique, the local Red Cross office mobilized volunteers, including 100 people in Inhambane Province who assisted local officials in preparations. The cyclone affected the same region that Cyclone Delfina struck two months prior. Japhet produced high winds and heavy rainfall in southern and central Mozambique into southern Zimbabwe. The rains were beneficial in alleviating drought conditions, and dry grounds absorbed much of the excess rainfall. After entering Zimbabwe, Japhet's rainfall caused the Save River to rise, causing flooding in southern Mozambique several days after the storm passed the area. The resulting floods affected 50,000 people in several villages. The Limpopo River also rose to above-normal level. High rains also caused some crop damage, destroying 237,000 hectares (585,600 acres) of crop fields. (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) This included 12,325 downed cashew trees, 6,955 wrecked banana plants, and 2,495 killed livestock, all in Vilankulo; however, the rains allowed farming conditions to improve due to wetter conditions in drought areas. Before Japhet moved ashore, Vilankulo reported sustained winds of , with gusts to . There, the winds destroyed the roofs or damaged the doors and windows of 95% of brick houses. In Inhambane Province in southern Mozambique, the cyclone destroyed several boats, cut power lines, and disrupted roads with flooding or downed trees, which prevented communication with the province. The storm destroyed 500 classrooms, 35 government buildings, and 7 health facilities. The cyclone damaged or destroyed 25,000 houses in Inhambane and Sofala provinces, (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) leaving about 23,000 people homeless in Inhambane alone, which was the worst-affected province. Three people were injured in Morrumbene by a fallen tree. There were 17 deaths in the country, (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) which was less than from previous cyclones due to advance warning and coordinated government action. The Zambia Meteorological Department warned of the potential of intense precipitation before Japhet moved into the region. (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) In neighboring Zimbabwe, ten hours of high rainfall nearly overtopped the Manyuchi Dam and destroyed a bridge. (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) The storm also damaged crops and destroyed houses in the country, (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) killing eight people. (accessed via Lexis Nexis on August 16, 2012) After the storm struck Mozambique, the World Food Programme distributed more than 4,300 tons of food to affected citizens. The agency had to transport goods via helicopter due to damaged or flooded roads. The country's primary north-south highway, which was damaged by the storm, had emergency repairs and was reopened within three days.

San Gabriel's latitude is 30.694 North by longitude -97.196 West and has an elevation of 417 feet above sea level. San Gabriel appears on the San Gabriel U.S. Geological Survey Map and is in the Central Time Zone (UTC/GMT -6 hours - UTC/GMT -5 hours during Daylight Saving Time). San Gabriel is named after the San Gabriel River in Central Texas. San Gabriel is located about 30 miles downstream from the site of the Battle of the San Gabriels in 1839, a battle fought during the Texas-Indian Wars that followed the Texas Republic's successful Revolution after the suspension of the 1824 Constitution of the United States of Mexico in favor of a centralist oriented constitution that led to the dictatorship of President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Several Spanish missions were established near the site in an effort to Christianize the Indian tribes living in the area, but these projects were abandoned by the mid-1750s. The mission buildings soon fell into ruin, and by the end of the 19th century little trace of them remained. The town of San Gabriel was formally established in 1843 or 1844, when Jesse and Peter Mercer built cabins on the San Gabriel River. Peter Mercer was killed by Indians on June 17, 1844, and was buried in Locklin Cemetery at San Gabriel, not far from where he was killed. The area on the San Gabriel River where he was killed is still called Mercer's Bluff. The community was granted a post office in 1850. By the mid-1880s San Gabriel had a steam gristmill-cotton gin, a church, two schools, and 130 residents. Cotton, corn, and oats were the principal crops grown by area farmers. Population estimates for San Gabriel ranged from a low of twenty-five in 1890 to a high of 350 in 1929. The number of residents fell to 200 by the early 1940s, and to seventy-five by the late 1950s. San Gabriel served as the center of a common-school district until 1960, when the school was consolidated with the nearby and academically well respected Thorndale Independent School District. The San Gabriel post office was discontinued in the late 1960s. Two churches, a business, and a community hall were marked at the site by county maps in the 1980s. The population in 1990 was 100. The population remained the same in the 2000 Census. On April 6, 2019, an EF0 tornado struck the community, severely damaging a business.Possible tornado leaves trail of damage in San G; KVUE; April 7, 2018.

It is native to South America but it has become both a pest and a health hazard in the southern United States as well as a number of other countries. Introduction In the 1930s, colonies were accidentally introduced into the United States through the seaport of Mobile, Alabama. Despite earlier views that cargo ships from Brazil docking at Mobile unloaded goods infested with the ants, recent DNA research confirmed that the likely source population for all invasive S. invicta in the United States occurred at or near Formosa, Argentina, and virtually every analysis ruled out all sampled Brazilian populations as a potential source. Biologist E.O. Wilson says that he reported the first colony, in the Mobile area, when he was 13.Lecture, E.O. Wilson, Trinity University, 25 Oct 2010. The ants then spread from Alabama to almost every state of the American South, from Texas to Maryland and a few other Mid- Atlantic states. Since the 1990s infestations have been reported in New Mexico and parts of Arizona in the Southwest. They have also been reported in California in the West, but probably arrived via ship or truck rather than by spreading. In a similar way, the ants were accidentally introduced into Australia in 2001. Spread In the United States, RIFAs have gradually spread north and west despite intense efforts to stop or eliminate them. in the United States they were found in most of the southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also lists the entire island of Puerto Rico as infested.USDA Quarantine Map RIFAs were still on the move in the US in the early 21st century, often traveling from one area to another in turf, root balls of nursery plants, and other agricultural products. They could be controlled, but not eradicated. A number of products are available, which can be used on a mound-by-mound basis to destroy ant colonies when they appear. With all such efforts, it is important to reach and kill the queens, which may be as far as six feet (2 m) underground; otherwise, some queens may simply move a short distance away and quickly re-establish the colony. However, during the past few years, even this technique resulted in failure to control colony growth. Scientists then discovered that an adaptation in RIFAs had resulted in many populations having multiple queens in mounds over a large area. In areas where Solenopsis invicta (red imported fire ants) founded colonies, larger colonies of Tetramorium caespitum (pavement ants) have destroyed them, leading entomologists to conclude that this conflict between the two species would decelerate the northward spread of Solenopsis invicta. Economic impact The RIFA's introduction to the United States was in the late 1930s. Traveling in soil used as ballast on cargo ships, they came in through the seaport of Mobile, Alabama. They build mounds, usually no larger than in diameter and in height, although in Alabama some mounds have been reported to be over high and larger, especially in fields where cattle graze. They build on soil close to homes and other buildings, and sometimes forage indoors for food and moisture. They are a nuisance, and can threaten sleeping or bedridden individuals and pets. Occasionally, they feed on vegetable plants in home gardens. The worst damage usually occurs during hot, dry weather, when they invade flower beds while seeking warmth and moisture. If disturbed, fire ants bite and sting the intruder. They are apparently attracted to electrical equipment, and crawl into air conditioning units and the electrical wiring of stop lights, shorting them out. This is the leading cause of traffic light shorts in Texas, where the ants cause more than US$140 million in damage each year. Several ant species, including fire ants, have been shown to contain ferromagnetic nanoparticles that may contribute information about the geomagnetic field for orientation during foraging or migration. However, it has not been found that electric or magnetic fields attract the ants. Rather, when wandering ants cause electrical shorts, they attempt to sting the wire and produce powerful semiochemicals, including defensive and recruitment pheromones. The chemical signals draw additional ants to the short. The only effective protection is to bar ants from the equipment physically or with insecticides. The FDA estimates more than US$5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in RIFA-infested areas. Further, the ants cause approximately US$750 million in damage to agricultural assets, including veterinary bills and livestock loss, as well as crop loss. It has been proposed that modern insecticides are not effective in large-scale control of fire ants, therefore a number of new strategies are proposed. These include the use of entomopathogenic fungi and even specific viruses.

It is near the monumental Cemetery of Poggioreale, which was built on top of the ruined villa. The architect was the Florentine Ferdinando Fuga. History The goal of the cemetery was to systematize the burial of the poor; those who died in Neapolitan orphanages, poorhouses such as the nearby Albergo dei Poveri (built in 1751 also by Fuga), and hospitals such as the Ospedale degli Incurabili. The rationale was intended to reconcile a mathematical logic with a pious compassion for the underclass. Confronted with the increasingly crowded city of Naples, as destitute peasants from the countryside moved into the city, the authorities had to find ways not only to house the masses alive, but also in proper Christian burial. Prior to the construction of this complex, the masses of dead were often buried in haphazard pits in rural or suburban areas of the capital. Thus some impetus for the project came from the desire to create efficiency in the disposal of corpses. Fuga, under the regency of Ferdinand IV, designed this cemetery; it consists of a large square yard surrounded by high walls. Under the surface of the yard are 360 adjacent brick receptacles (4 meters square), seven meters deep (with a grate set two meters from the bottom), rectangular with an arched ceiling that opens at the surface to a narrow central square portal stone, 80 cm to each side, marked with a number from 1 to 360. The vaults are arrayed in such that each number corresponded to a specific day of the year, starting with January 1st as number one. Six more tombstones are inside the entrance building. The central spot is empty, and the vaults were arrayed in 19 rows and 19 columns. The numbers ascend from left to right in the first row, then right to left and so on. Thus each day corpses were deposited in the adjacent vault. One vault was reserved for the extra day of the leap year. On average, twenty five persons were deposited in a vault each day. In 1794, after an earthquake, the numerous dead were buried in the less used leap year vault. The cemetery functioned from 1762 till 1890. It is presently in a semi-decrepit state. Based on calculations, it was likely the site for the burial of well over one hundred thousand persons.Le \\"anime pezzentelle\\" delle \\"Trecentosessantasei fosse\\" tra rigore matematico, pratiche statistiche e l'imprevedibile caso domenica, 20 gennaio 2008 / Giuseppe Gesano / IRPPS-CNR An iron winch is still on the premises, and is said to have assisted with lowering corpses. Prior to the invention of this machine in 1875, the corpses were unceremoniously dumped into the pits. The entrance with a skull and crossbones in the tympanum has a plaque announcing in Latin that, \\"The just and liberal king Ferdinand IV, of the kingdom of the two Sicilies built this common cemetery divided into individual cells for his beloved populace, in order to avoid the congestion of cadavers and their odors from harming his people, and to provide proper burial.\\" Ultimately, a morbid fascination with catacombs (such as the Catacombs of San Gennaro and San Gaudioso) and the dead such as the skulls of Fontanelle cemetery, is not alien to the ultra-pious Catholicism of Naples. In this cemetery, that medieval religious requirement for proper burial encounters the rationalistic momentum of the Age of Enlightenment.

The Imperial troops were from the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of small German states that were allied to Napoleon. Part of a division led by Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer, Schwarz's brigade was almost completely wiped out, most of its soldiers being taken prisoner along with its commander. One of the few Allied casualties was the capable O'Donnell, wounded in the foot. The battle occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. The action occurred amid the events leading up to the Siege of Tortosa in December 1810 and January 1811. As Louis Gabriel Suchet prepared to attack Tortosa, Marshal Jacques MacDonald was ordered to support him. The marshal cooperated by advancing into southern Catalonia with a large force. To distract MacDonald from his mission, O'Donnell determined to raid northern Catalonia. The raid was a brilliant tactical success but it failed to deter the marshal from assisting Suchet. Finally, a logistical crisis forced MacDonald to withdraw to northern Catalonia. Background In June 1810, Marshal Pierre Augereau was replaced in command of VII Corps by Marshal Jacques MacDonald.Gates (2002), 289 Orders soon came from Paris. MacDonald was instructed to drive toward Tarragona while his colleague General of Division Louis Gabriel Suchet was to lead the III Corps to capture Tortosa.Gates (2002), 292 Suchet's corps had successfully concluded the Siege of Lerida on 13 May and the Siege of Mequinenza on 5 June.Smith (1998), 342-343 Located on the Ebro River, Tortosa lay on the main highway between the provinces of Catalonia and Valencia. By seizing the city, Napoleon hoped to sever the link between the two areas. Before Suchet could implement the plan, he was compelled to return to Aragon to suppress the guerillas. MacDonald also had difficulties. He first needed to restock his empty depots with supplies from France. It was August before either commander was ready to carry out their emperor's strategy. MacDonald marched his field army of 16,000 troops south to support Suchet's operations against Tortosa. MacDonald left General of Division Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers with almost 10,000 soldiers to garrison Barcelona. In addition, there were 18,000 troops manning the defenses of other cities and holding open the road to France.Oman (1996), III, 495-496 Captain General Henry O'Donnell commanded the Spanish Army of Catalonia. Seeing that MacDonald was too strong to directly confront, O'Donnell resolved to operate against the unsuspecting Imperial forces in the north.Oman (1996), III, 497-499 By doing so, he hoped to draw MacDonald away from Tarragona and Tortosa.Gates (2002), 293 O'Donnell decided to leave the divisions of Generals Juan de Courten, Pedro Sarsfield, and Joaqu√≠n Ib√°√±ez Cuevas y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles to hold Tarragona and take the division of General Luis Gonz√°lez Torres de Navarra, Marquess of Campoverde north. He planned to avoid the large Barcelona garrison and attack General of Division Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer's German division which was holding the area between Girona and Palam√≥s on the Mediterranean coast. Meanwhile, Colonel Charles William Doyle sailed north with 500 foot soldiers aboard the British frigate , the Spanish frigate Diana, and other vessels. Captain Francis William Fane of the Cambrian commanded the Allied naval squadron. In early September, O'Donnell managed to elude the garrisons of Barcelona, Hostalric, and Girona without being noticed. Battle 6th Confederation of the Rhine Regiment Fane's Anglo-Spanish naval expedition struck first on 10 September. An amphibious force rowed ashore at Begur and captured 50 men and a coastal artillery emplacement. Alerted by this raid, General of Brigade Fran√ßois Xavier de Schwarz ordered his coastal units to beef up their defenses. His brigade comprised two battalions each of the 5th Confederation of the Rhine (Anhalt-Lippe) and 6th Confederation of the Rhine (Schwarzburg-Waldeck-Reuss) Regiments. The brigade numbered 1,700 men with 18 artillery pieces.Smith (1998), 345 Schwarz posted 800 men and his headquarters at La Bisbal d'Empord√† while the remainder of the brigade was spread out to defend Begur, Calonge, Palam√≥s, and Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols. Still undetected, O'Donnell arrived at the village of Vidreres with 6,000 foot soldiers and 400 cavalrymen on 13 September 1810. Another authority counted 6,600 men in the Spanish force, including the Kayser Swiss Regiment, Numancia Dragoons, and miquelets. On the morning of the 14th, O'Donnell attacked La Bisbal in overwhelming force. As his pickets were driven in, Schwarz sent a courier with orders to his detachments to concentrate. Shortly afterward, La Bisbal was surrounded and its defenders fell back to an old castle. Unfortunately, the structure was dominated by a nearby hill and a church tower from which snipers picked off a few Germans during the day. Schwarz held out until evening; he surrendered after the Spanish began massing for an assault. The French commander did not put up much of a battle, losing only one officer and four men killed, and three officers and 16 rank and file wounded. While the action in La Bisbal was going on, Schwarz's other outposts were being snapped up. Fane and Doyle landed their troops at Palam√≥s and captured it. Colonel Aldea's column overran Calonge while Colonel Fleires's column seized Sant Feliu. Rouyer at Girona was unable to intervene because O'Donnell called out the local miquelets to harass his garrison. Schwarz, two colonels, 56 officers, 1,183 men, and 17 guns were captured for a total of 1,242 prisoners. The Germans also lost approximately 400 killed and wounded. Spanish losses were not reported but were probably light. However, they included O'Donnell who was badly wounded in the foot at La Bisbal. The Spanish general and the German prisoners were taken aboard Fane's squadron before it sailed back to Tarragona. Schwarz was held in captivity until the end of the war in 1814.Six (1934), Schwarz A number of German prisoners were transported to Edinburgh,'Register of French POWs, Edinburgh and Greenock, 1811-1812', The National Archives of the UK (TNA), ADM 103/112, accessed via Findmypast. with the officers being paroled to various towns in the Scottish Borders,'French POWs Released on Parole 1800-1815', The National Archives of the UK (TNA), ADM 103/611, accessed via Findmypast. including some who joined the Masonic lodge in Hawick.Archives of Lodge St John, No. 111, Hawick, Scotland. O'Donnell's wound became infected and he nearly died before being sent to Majorca to recover. Until his injury healed, the high command in Catalonia passed into the less capable hands of Lieutenant General Miguel Iranzo.Oman (1996), III, 501 O'Donnell later received the title 1st Count of la Bisbal in recognition of his victory. Aftermath Campoverde took command of the land force and headed north past Girona before Rouyer or Baraguey d'Hilliers could react. He captured Puigcerd√† in the Cerdanya and crossed the Pyrenees into France. His troops clashed with the garrison of Mont-Louis and extorted funds from French villages. Recrossing the border, Campoverde's division moved down the Segre River valley and took position at Calaf and Cardona. Because he was so isolated from northern Catalonia by the guerillas, MacDonald did not hear of the La Bisbal disaster until three weeks later. Nevertheless, he initially maintained his position in support of Suchet.Oman (1996), III, 499-501 By holding his ground MacDonald nullified O'Donnell's strategy. Other events would finally distract the marshal from his position in the south. When Campoverde moved south to Cardona, the marshal took two French and two Italian brigades to attack him. An Italian brigade attacked at once on 18 October and took a beating. MacDonald declined to press his enemies further because provisions in Barcelona were getting low. Instead he lumbered off to Girona so he could protect his supply convoys. Suchet was not able to begin the Siege of Tortosa until 16 December 1810.Smith (1998), 353 Notes References  * * Category:Battles of the Peninsular War Category:Battles in Catalonia Category:Battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Battles involving Spain Category:Battles involving France Category:Conflicts in 1810 Category:September 1810 events ","title":"Battle of La Bisbal"},{"id":"36742947","text":"Juan de Dios Bosque (1829‚Äì1890) was a Bolivian politician who served as the acting President of Bolivia on the 27 and 28 November 1873.

Based on a story by Jesse Lasky Jr. and Richard Murphy, the film is about a singing cowboy and foreman of a ranch that may be sold to an unscrupulous banker by the young madcap heiress who is unaware that the sale will result in the local ranchers losing their free grazing land and their ranches.Magers 2007, pp. 187‚Äì188. In the film, Autry introduced the song \\"Blueberry Hill\\" which would become a standard recorded by such artists as Louis Armstrong (1949), Fats Domino (1956), and Elvis Presley (1957). The song became one of Autry's best-selling recordings.Magers 2007, p. 188. In 1987, \\"Blueberry Hill\\" received an ASCAP Award for Most Performed Feature Film Standards on TV. Plot Singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) is the foreman of the Circle R Ranch, which has been in the Adams family for generations. The ranchers in the area have enjoyed free grazing rights on the Circle R for years. Recently, the madcap heiress of the ranch, beautiful Jo Adams (Virginia Dale), negotiated the sale of the ranch in order to pay off some of her debts. She accepted a $25,000 down payment, with an option to purchase in 60 days, from unscrupulous cattle broker John Ramsey (George Meeker) who is conspiring with Adams' business manager James Morgan (Harry Stubbs) to buy the ranch and cut off grazing rights to the ranchers. As the head of the cattlemen's association, Gene is accused of betraying the ranchers after they learn that the Circle R is being sold and that their grazing rights, bequeathed to them by Jo's late grandfather, will be taken away. Without access to the Circle R pasture lands, most of the ranches in the area will go bankrupt. Determined to persuade Jo to change her mind, Gene and his pals, Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette), Cactus Mack (Cactus Mack), and Patsy (Mary Lee), drive to Jo's palatial house in the city. The scatterbrained Jo mistakes them for the band hired to play at her birthday party that evening, and they perform in order to stay. After the party, Gene explains who they are and urges Jo to return to the ranch and run it the way her grandfather did. The frivolous heiress, however, has no intention of changing her extravagant lifestyle. With few options available to him, Gene abducts Jo and her butler, Dada (Gerald Oliver Smith), and takes them back to the Circle R Ranch, where Pop Sloan (Wade Boteler), a rancher who has known Jo all her life, has organized a welcoming party for her. Despite her appreciation, Jo tells Gene that she is broke and has to sell the ranch to pay her debts. Soon after, Gene approaches Judge Henry Starbottle (Spencer Charters) and explains the impact the sale of the Circle R would have on the ranchers in the area. They conspire to have Jo declared legally incompetent in order to buy some time. At the hearing, Henry rules that she is to become a ward of the court, and Gene is placed in charge of the ranch until Jo can prove her competency. In order to raise enough money to repay Ramsey his down payment, Gene and the ranchers drive their cattle to market. When Ramsey learns of their intentions, he sends his henchmen to blow up a dam and flood the valley through which the cattle are passing. The dam is destroyed and the cattle stampede. In the ensuing chaos, most of the cattle are drowned or dispersed, and Gene is barely able to save Pop from drowning. Meanwhile, Jo wins her competency hearing, regains control over the ranch, and quickly fires Gene and the other Circle R cowboys. As the men are packing to leave, Jo arrives to say goodbye to the men, but is distressed to see families who will be displaced because of her actions. She drives away, but is stopped on the road by Judge Henry, who tells her that she must say goodbye to Pop before she leaves. Jo is overcome with grief when the judge brings her to the old man's funeral; the old man did not survive his ordeal. Later, after Jo reveals that she told Ramsey about the cattle drive, Gene realizes that Ramsey was behind the dam explosion. When Jo tells him that she now intends to keep the ranch, Gene devises a plan, sending her to Ramsey's office where she tells him that Gene is holding Morgan in an attempt to get information from him. Worried that Morgan will implicate him in the dam explosion, Ramsey hires a group of gunmen to kill Gene. When the hired guns sneak onto the Circle R that night, they are beaten and captured by Gene and the ranch hands. Gene himself apprehends Ramsey after giving the corrupt cattle broker a beating. Afterwards, the ranchers are promised a good deal on their next herds, and Jo keeps Gene as her foreman.

The first owners of the house were Louis Parthenais and Augustin Perrault. The Maison Cartier was originally connected to the Nelson Hotel. Though it is located next to Montreal's oldest public monument - Nelson's Column - it was apparently named the Jardin Nelson for Wolfred Nelson, a Patriote in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, and the ninth Mayor of Montreal. Today a restaurant operates in the building.

Devipattinam is an ancient coastal town and a port, located in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. It was a flourishing sea port and a gateway to places as far as Madurai until the early 20th century. The famous pearl belt known as the Gulf of Mannar in the Bay of Bengal is dotted with small islands; Appa Tivu, Nallathanni Theevu, Shuli Tivu, Uppu Tanni Tivu, Talari Tivu and Musal Tivu. The coastal line of Devipattinam is formed by series of small bays and finest coral reefs in Thiruppaalaikudi. The prime occupations of the people were pearl, conch, sea trade and transport. The mid-20th century saw a decline in the occupations of the people of Devipattinam. With the advent of the surface transport the Merchant Navies faded away and Devipattinam ceased to be a harbour and port. The cultured pearl industry and the mindless dragnet fishing that destroyed the coral reefs, choked the once robust pearl trade or Muthu Salabam. The conch and coral industries declined due to new regulations and restrictions. Devipattinam is renowned for its communal harmony. The majority of the population here is Muslim with people of other faith Hindu, Christians living together. Devipattinam has 7 Masjids. They are Periya pallivasal, Mela pallivasal, Thaqua pallivasal, Bukhariya pallivasal, Masjid Al Aqsa, Towheed Pallivasal and Darul Uloom Haqqaniyya pallivasal. Arabian Traders during the sea trade era settled here and adopted the local language. They developed a dialect called ‚ÄòArwi‚Äô which is a combination of Arabic and Tamil. Arabian food and traditions are still followed. Islam is the dominant religion and they mostly practice the ‚ÄòSha'fi school of thought. The Arab descendants are called Maraikayars and are found all over the coastal regions of India and Sri Lanka. The migration of the people after the decline of the marine trade and industry resulted in people exploring the other parts of the globe. Devipattinam has a large expatriate population and a very high literacy rate.[2] This enabled the people of Devipattinam to span the globe and find new riches in the Gulf, Far East, Americas and Europe. http://www.rameshwaramtourism.co.in/devipatnam- rameshwaram References External links * Devipattinam Location in Wikimapia * http://ramanathapuram.nic.in/tourism.htm#DEVI PATINAM Category:Villages in Ramanathapuram district ","title":"Devipattinam"},{"id":"36743151","text":"Samantha Davon James (born December 18, 1986), better known by her stage name 3D Na'Tee, is an American rapper, songwriter, and video director. She was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and grew up in the 3rd Ward. 3D Na'Tee has been featured on several national media outlets such as MTV, The Source Magazine, XXL Magazine, The Fader Magazine, RapRadar and RapRehab. She has also received attention from Louisiana newspapers and music magazines. Early life In middle school, 3D Na'Tee improved her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing), better known as playing \\"the Dozens\\"; a word game, characteristic for black US communities, with two players insulting each to the point of surrender of one of them. In 1999, she began recording with local label called Clientell Records. Over the next five years, she recorded multiple mixtapes under the \\"Snypa Squad\\" and got featured on other projects by Clientell Records. However, in 2006, a year after Hurricane Katrina, Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project 3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva followed by Volume 2 in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on The Kush 2 DVD which was produced by YMCMB president Mack Maine. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Birdman as well as Curren$y of Warner Bros. Records. Career After the local success of her first two releases and her appearance on The Kush 2, she released her third mix tape Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown followed by a music video for a song she titled, Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner. That video piqued the interest of G-Unit Records affiliate and Shade 45 Sirius XM radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to New York for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper 50 Cents' ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by Benzino, former co-owner of The Source Magazine. Because of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive. That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010. Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards. She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for Lyricist of the Year, Mixtape of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year. The mixtape included collaborations from Curren$y (courtesy of Warner Bros. Records), Ebony Eyez, and Babs Bunny (formally of Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs) founded group, Da Band. In early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on MTV's SuckerFree Freestyle hosted by DJ Envy. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called Go Head. July 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for Switch which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer Timbaland. This video gained her a nomination for Director of the Year and an award for Video of the Year. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to Miami's Hit Factory Studio to work with her on her next project, The Coronation. After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company Mosely Music Group and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via Twitter that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon. Exactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album The Coronation which featured artists like Keri Hilson, Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's Lex Luger, Maybach Music Group's Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others. In August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled NO LOVE produced by MMG's Young Shun was the #9 most requested song in the country. The Coronation's second release, Lil Kim produced by Casa Di gained recognition as well as being featured on both The Source and The Fader Magazines websites. Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and \\"fell in love\\" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like Trina, Missy Elliott, and Chamillionaire, who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his social site chamillionaire.com.

Background The attacks occurred about eight months following the withdrawal of the United States military forces from the area, leaving the security of the country in the hands of the Iraqi security forces. Several major attacks took place in the months of June and July, following a statement released by Islamic State of Iraq to announce the start of a new \\"offensive\\". Attacks Numerous attacks were conducted within hours of each other on 16 August 2012 across Baghdad and several central and northern provinces in Iraq. At least 52 people were killed and 177 injured in attacks across Baghdad, with most casualties from two car bombings in the predominantly Shi'ite districts of Zaafaraniya and Sadr City.

He was involved in judo for more than 70 years, and was ranked hachi-dan (eighth-degree black belt), making him one of the highest ranked Canadian judoka. In 2002 he was decorated by the Emperor of Japan with the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Rosette, in recognition of his service to improving the status of Japanese Canadians through his lifelong commitment to the promotion and development of Judo in Canada. He was inducted into the Judo Canada Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2005 Takahashi co-authored a book, Mastering Judo, with his family. Biography Born in Stave Falls, British Columbia, Takahashi moved to the Kitsilano neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia with his family in the late 1930s, where his father worked in a saw mill and his mother opened a day care centre. He was an outstanding athlete in high school, but his activities were limited following the outbreak of the Second World War. In March 1942, the government forced the family to give up their belongings and relocate as part of the internment of Japanese- Canadians due to fears that they would act against Canada on behalf of Japan. The Takahashis were moved to Raymond, Alberta to work as cheap labour in the sugar beet industry. The family stayed on a farm in a small house with no plumbing, and the children were prohibited from going to school. Takahashi and his friends continued to practice Judo during their years in Raymond under Yoshio Katsuta's supervision at a small Japanese Buddhist church. After the war was over, he returned to high school and graduated in 1948. In 1949, Takahashi joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, where he spent the next 22 years of his life. He retired from the Air Force in 1969 and began a second career by opening his dojo in Ottawa. Family Takahashi's wife and four children are also accomplished judoka who have made significant contributions to the development of Judo in Canada. His wife, June Takahashi, was one of the first women in Canada to earn a black belt in Judo, and is now ranked roku-dan (sixth-degree black belt), making her one of the highest-ranked women in the country. She coached Cameroonian judoka Fran√ßoise Nguele, who competed in the 2000 Olympic Games, and her approach to Judo is heavily influenced by the highest-ranked female judoka in history, Keiko Fukuda. Masao and June's children Allyn Takahashi, Phil Takahashi, Ray Takahashi, and Tina Takahashi, are all black belts who have been highly successful in competition, and three of them have participated in the Olympics: Phil as a competitor and Tina as a coach in Judo, and Ray as a competitor in wrestling. Awards In 2002, Takahashi was decorated by the Emperor of Japan with the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Rosette, in recognition of his service to improving the status of Japanese-Canadians through his lifelong commitment to the promotion and development of Judo in Canada. Popular culture One of Takahashi's most famous students was former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau began practicing Judo at Takahashi's sometime in the mid-1950s when he was in his mid-thirties, and by the end of the decade he was ranked ik-ky≈´ (brown belt). Later, when he traveled to Japan as Prime Minister, he was promoted to sho-dan (first-degree black belt) by the Kodokan, and then promoted to ni-dan (second-degree black belt) by Takahashi before leaving office. Trudeau's three sons (Justin, Alexandre, & Michel) and the children of his successor, Brian Mulroney, also took lessons at Takahashi's dojo.

It is the oldest professional association in Puerto Rico, and among the oldest bar associations in the world. The Bar Association of Puerto Rico is to be distinguished from the Puerto Rican Bar Association, which is a private association. History Although Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain, a country with associations of lawyers as early as the 16th century, it was not until May 8, 1840, that the Royal Court of Puerto Rico issued an order authorizing the establishment of a Bar Association there. There were at the time 22 lawyers practicing in Puerto Rico. Its first bar examination was given on May 13, 1841. The Bar Association published the first book of the law of the Royal Court of Puerto Rico in 1857. Bar operations were suspended when, following the surrender of Puerto Rico to the United States at the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Military Government suppressed the profession of Attorney. After the Statute of the Bar Association of Puerto Rico was restored, debate ensued among Bar members as to the correct structure of the Bar, due to the transition from Spanish colony to Commonwealth of the United States. The Puerto Rico Bar Association changed in 1911 to be a voluntary association similar to that in many States. In 1932, following lengthy discussion, the voluntary association was converted to a mandatory association; since then all practicing attorneys must be members in order to practice law in the United States territory of Puerto Rico, with a number of exceptions, e.g. Federal judges may voluntarily withdraw from the organization. Structure The Bar Association, headquartered in the Miramar section of San Juan, Puerto Rico operates a number of programs, including a pro bono legal services program, offers life insurance to its members and makes its meeting rooms available to community organizations. The association is managed by a governing board, which has met regularly for over 130 years. The association holds its annual convention in the month of September, when its president and board of directors are elected by those physically present. Legislation has been approved, converting it into a voluntary membership organization. Other bills have been filed to allow the election of the president by mail-in referendum, rather than an assembly where physical presence is required. Criticism Many criticize the bar because, notwithstanding its compulsory nature, it shows an activist tendency towards political matters, openly supporting specific candidates during elections. They believe that a compulsory, government-sponsored institution such as itself should maintain a politically neutral position, so as not to offend its members or taint the institution's honor by involving itself in petty politics. The bar's compulsory membership has also come under intense scrutiny because of concerns that it violates the First Amendment. In 2009, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly passed a law mandating that membership in the Bar Association would thereafter be voluntary, and although the Bar Association filed suit to challenge the law, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals upheld the law's constitutionality; subsequently, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court each decided in succession not to hear the case on the merits, which had the effect of leaving intact the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals' ruling upholding the law. More recently, on July 28, 2014, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly passed a new statute that, among other things, repealed the 2009 statute and reinstated the requirement of mandatory bar membership. On the same day that the law was signed by the Governor, a local senator filed a lawsuit in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance challenging the law's constitutionality. Two days later, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court granted the senator's motion for intra-jurisdictional certification and agreed to take up the case directly, thus removing it from the trial court's docket and setting an expedited briefing schedule.

MNAC, 2004. The artwork at MNAC's Website  Description  MNAC. The altar from Sant Serni de Tav√®rnoles stands out on account of its size, the composition and the subject depicted, a series of bishop saints. The dimensions of this item are larger than is usual in known altar frontals. This suggested the possibility that it was a sarcophagus or an altarpiece, but the size and importance of the monastery it came from allowed large liturgical celebrations that would have required an altar of these proportions. The work depicts nine bishop saints, of which the central figure is possibly St Sernin, patron of the monastery the item comes from and bishop and martyr in Toulouse. This subject is very uncommon in panel painting, which used to concentrate the decoration around a central figure and arrange the scenes or figures in registers. On the sides, which were obviously painted by a different artist, are the bishops Martin and Bricius, identified by inscriptions. The little we know about this altar has made stylistic analysis of the frontal our main source of information and there are various interpretations of it. The stylisation of the figures and the ornamental effect of the almost seriated rhythm of the personages have associated it with the resources used in mural painting, while such aspects as the precision of the line in defining the drapery have linked it to the decoration characteristic of miniaturists. However, the work could have belonged to a workshop connected with La Seu d'Urgell, for which reason it has been installed - inside de Museum - in the apse of La Seu d'Urgell.

It has distinctive, long ears, hence its Japanese name, the 'rabbit bat'. Formerly included as a subspecies of the European bat Plecotus auritus, genetic studies now indicate Plecotus sacrimontis is a separate species.Ohdachi, Satoshi D. I; Ishibashi, Yasuyuki; Iwasa, Masahiro A.; Saitoh, Takashi (2009): The Wild Mammals of Japan, Shoukadoh, Kyoto, C0645 Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1908 by American zoologist Glover Morrill Allen. The holotype had been collected in December 1906 by Alan Owston on Mount Fuji. Allen received the specimen from Thomas Barbour. Allen noted that it resembled the brown long-eared bat, Plecotus auritus. Its species name \\"sacrimontis\\" is from Latin sacer meaning \\"sacred\\" and mons meaning \\"mountain.\\" In 1929, Nikolay Alekseyevich Bobrinski published that he considered P. sacrimontis as a synonym of P. auritus. In 1938, Allen himself expressed doubts about P. sacrimontis as a species, saying \\"Bobrinski...is very likely right in believing the name a synonym of P. auritus.\\" In 1942, George Henry Hamilton Tate published that he considered P. sacrimontis as a subspecies of P. auritus, with a trinomen of P. auritus sacrimontis. This was largely maintained until 2006, when Spitzenberger et al. revised the genus Plecotus. They found that P. sacrimontis had a high genetic distance from other Plecotus species, and thus determined that it should be considered a full species rather than a subspecies of P. auritus. Description It has woolly fur and a \\"mask\\" of darker fur on its face. Range and habitat Its range includes several islands of Japan, including Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Rebun, and Rishiri. It is also found on the Kuril Islands, specifically Iturup and Kunashir. It has been documented at a range of elevations from above sea level. Conservation As of 2019, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification because its geographic range is relatively large; it is found in a variety of habitats; and no major threats to its existence are known.

Carter is a US secret agent, code-named N-3, with the rank of Killmaster. He works for AXE ‚Äì a secret arm of the US intelligence services. Publishing history The book was first published in 1966 (Number A182F) by Award Books part of the Beacon-Signal division of Universal Publishing and Distributing Corporation (New York, USA), part of the Conde Nast Publications Inc. The novel was written by Valerie Moolman. Copyright was registered on 1 February 1966.Catalog of Copyright Entries. Third Series: 1967: July‚ÄìDecember. By Library of Congress. Copyright Office, p1897 Plot summary Officers of the US Special Forces discover a secret camp in North Vietnam near Hanoi. The camp is guarded by Chinese soldiers and houses a group of German scientists, led by Ulric Krutch, who are working on a top secret rocket programme. A new rocket has been perfected that can deliver a payload into earth orbit. The team of scientists is waiting for Dr Erich Burgdorf to arrive from Buenos Aires with plans for a triggering device that will release a secondary component carrying a secret payload after the rocket has reached orbit. When it is discovered that none of the scientists has ever met Burgdorf, secret agent Nick Carter is sent to impersonate Burgdorf, infiltrate the camp and neutralize the rocket programme. Carter parachutes into North Vietnam and enters Hanoi disguised as a peasant on his way to market. There he impersonates Anton Zavodna ‚Äì a locally known Czechoslovak diplomat and spy. As Zavodna, Carter keeps watch at the airport and observes Burgdorf arriving on a Chinese cargo flight disguised as a crew member. Carter intercepts Burgdorf and convinces him that the expected arrangements have been altered at the last minute and that Carter will help him deliver the plans. Burgdorf accompanies Carter and is promptly captured and transported to Saigon for interrogation by AXE agents. Carter quickly learns about triggering devices from AXE specialists and returns to the camp posing as Burgdorf. Carter learns that the secondary capsule contains an array of small steel balls containing Metaplast - a type of radioactive explosive that will be jettisoned to create an orbiting minefield. The group's first target is Petrovsk I - a Russian space mission - scheduled to launch in the next few days. In this way, Krutch intends to blackmail Russia and America by jeopardizing the safety of all future space missions unless his demands are met. Krutch and scientists Wulff and Wiesner do not entirely trust Burgdorf and keep him under close surveillance. Ilse Benz (Wiesner's step-daughter) and Lin Suy are used to try to trap Carter into revealing himself as an imposter. As the rocket assembly nears completion Carter tries to sabotage the launch. He sends a coded message to the Green Berets to attack the base. Carter kills all the off duty guards in their barracks by gassing them with Pierre ‚Äì the poison gas bomb. Then he dupes many of the remaining guards into accepting exploding cigars primed to explode within 90 seconds. With a 10,000-watt laser pistol (smuggled into the camp disguised as one half of a pair of binoculars) Carter breaks into the ammunition store and plants bombs. However, Carter is unable to damage the missile itself or the Metaplast which is held in an armored vault prior to loading into the rocket. Instead he single-handedly destroys the rocket command center. The Green Berets arrive to destroy the rocket and the Metaplast. Wiesner, Ilse Benz and Lin Suy are captured and taken to the US for debriefing. After the mission is complete Carter makes love to Ilse Benz in his New York City apartment.

The change of the \\"u\\" to a \\"v\\" was due to legal issues with Gre√±as. Huizar, and many fans, consider Lvzbel as a continuation of Luzbel. Huizar is able to perform old Luzbel songs in shows because he wrote most of them; even old Luzbel albums are shown in the band's website as part of their discography. Biography After legal problems with the name and personal differences with Huizar, Raul Fernandez Gre√±as disbanded Luzbel. In 1996 Arturo Huizar founded Lvzbel with Richard III as lead guitarist, Alejandro Vazquez on the drums (not on the recordings), Guillermo Elizarraras on the rhythm guitar, Carlos Hernandez on the bass, and Ivan Ramirez on the drums. After extensive production, Evangelio Nocturno was recorded in 1998. The album included songs like \\"Angel de Sodoma,\\" \\"El Hambre\\" and \\"Bienvenidos al Apocalipsis.\\" The album was received well by fans. In 1999 Lvzbel appeared performing songs from the old band in Vivo y Desnudo Vol 1 and Vol 2, an album recorded live at the Rockotitl√°n music festival. Lvzbel composed the soundtrack of the film Guerrero Callejero and released an album called Pistas Musicales, the latter which disappointed many fans as it turned out to be a remake of his previous album. In 2000 they released Tiempo De La Bestia, with a great deal of distribution in Mexico, Central America, South America and the southern United States.

On February 19, Hamilton became the first to fly an airplane in Tucson, Arizona. In San Diego, he became just the third American flier to remain aloft for at least an hour, crossing the ocean to Mexico and back. Hamilton became the first to fly in the state of Washington, when he piloted the Reims Racer over Seattle on March 11. The very next day, he went up again, drunk, and \\"Swooping like a rapacious bird from a height of 500 feet [150 m], the Curtiss biplane, with Charles K. Hamilton, dived into the newly formed lake at The Meadows\\". He had to be fished out of the lake, but suffered only minor injuries. Hamilton (left) with fellow aviator Hubert Latham, c. 1910. Undaunted, he flew at Tacoma, Washington, and crossed the border to become the \\"First Air Visitor to Vancouver, B.C.\\" on March 25. The next day, he flew to New Westminster and back, covering in 30 minutes. He participated in an air meet in Spokane, Washington between April 1‚Äì3. On April 9, he flew over Mercer Island and Lake Washington. In San Antonio, Texas, he set a record for the quickest takeoff: in 3.8 seconds, breaking Glenn Curtiss's mark of in 5.25 seconds. In May, he performed in Atlanta and Augusta, Georgia, before heading to Mineola, New York, Curtiss's headquarters. On June 13, 1910, Hamilton won a prize of $10,000, sponsored by The New York Times and the Philadelphia Public Ledger, for being the first to fly from New York City to Philadelphia and back, the first flight between two major US cities. He departed from Governors Island in New York harbor at 7:30 am and reached Philadelphia at 9:26 am. With a stopover in Philadelphia, the round trip took a little over 11 hours, at an average speed of nearly . He received a hero's welcome in his hometown of New Britain, and, on July 2, 1910, made \\"the first public flight in the State\\" there. It was also the first in New England. Between June and August, he performed at Knoxville, Nashville and Atlantic City. In Nashville, he made the first night flight in America, remaining aloft 25 minutes before developing engine trouble. When Hamilton fell behind on payments, Glenn Curtiss repossessed the Reims Racer. Hamilton then had a new airplane built by Walter Christie, who had a car and engine factory in Manhattan. Finished on August 31, it was reputed to have the most powerful airplane engine yet, boasting 110 hp. Hamilton named his new airplane the \\"Hamiltonian\\". In September, however, the Hamiltonian stalled and crashed during a demonstration flight outside Sacramento, California; Hamilton was \\"badly cut, bruised and burned\\", but was flying again in a week. \\"On September 28, he was issued American pilot license no. 12.\\" He then joined John Moisant's exhibition team, performing with them in Richmond, Chattanooga and Memphis. In Memphis, he broke his own speed record of by going . In February 1911, he and Moisant parted company, with Moisant keeping his airplane. He pioneered flying in Cleveland, Tennessee in October 1911, piloting a Curtis biplane. Hamilton died of tuberculosis or \\"a lung hemorrhage after a long bout with tuberculosis\\" on January 22, 1914. He was buried in Hartford, Connecticut on January 26. Those familiar with his short career claimed he had earned a quarter of a million dollars, but he spent it and died almost broke. Hamilton married twice. He was divorced by his first wife and was survived by his second, Gussie, whom he had married the summer before his death.

Leir wrote books such as The Aliens and the Scalpel, and appeared on various radio and television shows, including Coast to Coast AM, claiming he had discovered proof of \\"non-terrestrial experimentation on man\\". Career Leir was born in the San Francisco Bay area in 1935. He moved to southern California at age 13. He described his childhood imagination as ‚Äúwild and vivid‚Äù, often fantasizing that he was able to fly. He attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Science in 1961. In 1964, he qualified as a podiatrist, and later became involved with the local chapter of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). At a MUFON conference in 1995, Leir examined X-rays from a woman who believed she was an abductee. He later extracted two small metallic foreign objects from her, and also from a second patient. The objects were analyzed by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, which determined that they were \\"composed of commonly found elements\\", such as iron or aluminum. In describing some of these elements, the lab report made reference to the composition of meteors. Leir interpreted this to mean that the objects removed from his patients were \\"of extraterrestrial origin\\". He came to believe the objects were devices implanted by aliens and \\"scientific proof of non-terrestrial experimentation on man\\". Leir soon became prominent in the alien abduction and UFO communities. He hired a dentist, a radiologist and a general surgeon to assist him in his practice. Leir claimed the objects he removed from patients emitted ‚Äúdeep space frequency radio waves\\", had strange magnetic properties, or contained odd crystalline structures. According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, the \\"implants\\" Leir claimed to have discovered were most likely ordinary objects such as shards of glass or fragments of metal that become lodged in arms, hands, legs and feet due to accidental falls or barefoot walking. When asked to provide a forensic medical institute with specimens or photos for analysis, Leir's associate, Derrel Sims, refused. Leir wrote The Aliens and the Scalpel in 1999, describing his ‚Äúimplant‚Äù surgery. His next book, Casebook: Alien Implants, was published in 2000. He began appearing on various radio and television shows, and spoke at UFO conferences. In 2001, a journalist visiting his office in Ventura, California reported that it contained UFO magazines and a shelf full of ‚Äúbug-eyed alien dolls‚Äù. In 2003 he traveled to Varginha, Brazil to investigate the alleged crash of an alien spacecraft, and produced a book in 2005 titled UFO Crash in Brazil. Dr. Leir wrote \\"The Smoking Gun\\" article for Un-X News Magazine which was published on March 2, 2014, just days before his death. Leir told the publisher that it was the most detailed article he had written to date. Death Leir died six days before his 79th birthday on March 14, 2014. The cause of death was determined as a heart attack. References  External links  * Archived copy of Leir's website, alienscalpel.com.

Naval design  Johan Neerman, Brussels Metro 5th series Johan Neerman worked on different naval designs in collaboration with German Naval architect Herward Oehlmann. Johan Neerman designed a low-draft ferry boat for Royal denship in Denmark in 2000. The boat carry 366 passengers and 45 metres long. The main idea was to give the ferry boat a private yacht look. The ferry boat is about 45 metres long. His next work \\"Trimaran\\" is 99 metres long and 45 metres wide with a cruising speed of 35 knots and autonomy of 7500 nautical miles. The entire ship is designed like a PlayStation, where inside and outside spaces contribute to the playfulness of open, semi-closed and open spaces. The length of the ship was determined by the wish to integrate the tender for 36 people and crew in the stern of the rear central hull part and to allow harboring of the tender while the master ship cruises and 30 knots inside the main hull. The length of the boat also allowed any steps to be avoided, making use only of slopes. All glass windows are bullet-proof and the hull has been compartmentalized.

Company has a background in transport design business since 1967 IDPO Philippe Neerman. Concept The Johanson3 electric scooter concept is to replace current polluting and inefficient means of transportation in suburban and urban areas . It is the first light stable vehicle with high payload capacity also designed for women and children. Johanson3 range Range of Johanson3 trikes consists of 5 vehicles. The design is a stable three-wheeler, with the driver leaning back rather than sitting (though sitting is an option). Feet rest on a plate, and pressing down on that plate creates a lean on the front wheel, turning the vehicle while the rear wheels remain solidly on the ground. Various models accommodate single riders with their payload. The commuter models are not much wider than the elbows of a rider hunched over a pair of mountain bike handlebars, and can slip through a standard doorway. The overall mobility concept is allowing the latest technology in terms of propulsion. The frame allows also the fitting of different tires such as: off-road tires, spike tires, or balloon tires for soft surfaces. History Johanson3 SA emerged from a family business with numerous prestigious references in the design of public transport systems with more than 40 original vehicles designed worldwide. His father, Philippe Neerman, was Belgian industrial designer. Johan Neerman, famous for his most innovative transport systems in Europe, had his work materialized in some of the European‚Äôs most representative cities such as Marseille, Grenoble, Strasbourg, Brussels, Dublin, Tignes, Lyons, Nantes, Paris, Porto, etc. Several prototypes were made prior to the creation of the company. Most of them were made in Italy and corrected in northern France.It took several years to validate the concept the business model and define the right functionalities. The first mule was designed to validate the propulsion and the ergonomics. The second prototype was materialized in a shorter version and was equipped with two rear engines and was tested successfully. Speeds up to 60 km/h were reached with a range of 40 km in full charge. Springs were added making the tilting more efficient and responsive. Many more ergonomic studies and refinement were made on the design side before another prototype was made.

The work was commissioned, directed and partially written by Crown Prince Mangkunegoro, later enthroned as Pakubuwono V of Surakarta, with contributions from three court poets from different palaces. Chronology The events depicted in Serat Centhini take place in the 1630s, when Sultan Agung of Mataram's army besieged and captured the city of Giri Kedaton in Gresik, East Java. Giri Kedaton had a religious school that was founded by Sunan Giri, one of the Wali Sanga. The school grew and became famous as a center of Muslim teaching, which gave it political influence in the surrounding region. It attracted learners from multiple societal groups and from regions as far away as Ternate Sultanate. Giri Kedaton reached the peak of its influence under Sunan Giri Prapen who ruled it from 1548‚Äì1605. Sultan Agung of the larger Mataram Sultanate regarded this as a threat, so in 1630 he sent an army under his brother-in-law, Pangeran Pekik to capture Giri Kedaton. Giri Kedaton finally surrendered in 1636. Sunan Giri Prapen was captured and brought to Mataram's capital Kota Gede, known today as Yogyakarta. The main characters of Serat Centhini are Sunan Giri Prapen's three young children who escape Giri Kedaton overnight, hours before the city falls to the army from Mataram. The children become separated in the confusion as inhabitants flee the city. They each spend several years wandering around Java, only to be re-united many years later. Main characters The main characters of the story are: * Jayengresmi, son of Sunan Giri Prapen (later called Syeh Amongrogo) * Jayengsari, son of Sunan Giri Prapen (later called Mangunarsa) * Rancangkapti, daughter of Sunan Giri Prapen * Ki Akadiat, an old man who adopts Jayengsari and Rancangkapti * Mas Cabolang, son of Ki Akadiat (later called Anggungrimang) * Nyi Tembangraras, wife of Jayengresmi * Ki Bayu Panurto, father of Nyi Tembangraras * Centhini, maid of Nyi Tembangraras * Gathak and Gathuk, servants of Jayengresmi (later called Jamal and Jamil) * Buras, servant of Jayengsari and Rancangkapti (later called Montel) Story outline The Centhini story is separated by phases of its characters' lives (pre-adulthood, adulthood and post-adulthood) and by the adventures of each character (Jayengresmi, Jayengsari, Rancangkapti and Mas Cabolang). In the pre-adulthood journey, geographic locations still can be identified on the real-world map. But in the post-adulthood journeys, the locations become mystical and imaginary, as though in a different realm. The mixture of real- world and imaginary locations is similar to that of Homer's Odyssey. As adults, the characters changed their names to avoid capture by Sultan Agung's spies. =Pre-Adulthood journey= After fleeing the conquered city the oldest son, Jayengresmi wanders in the southern part of Java and then to its westernmost part. The second son, Jayengsari, and his sister, Rancangkapti, flee to the east, later travelling by ship to central Java. Journey of Jayengresmi Jayengresmi's travels take him and his servants Gathak and Gathuk through mountainous terrain where hermits live. Their journey passes through historic areas including: ::1. Majapahit Kingdom ruins in Trowulan, East Java. :::Majapahit's golden age was in the 14th century. Close to the ruins they visit Hindu temples from the same era, such as the Naga and Panataran temples. ::2. Medang Kamulan Kingdom, Central Java :::Medang Kamulan is a semi- mythological kingdom believed to have been in the Purwodadi Grobogan region in the 7th and 8th centuries. It preceded the Medang Kingdom, which moved its court several times around Kedu Plain, Central Java and later to East Java. ::3. The Chronicles of Kyai Ageng Selo, 16th century forefather of the rulers of the Mataram Sultanate, the Mataram Kingdom after adoption of Islam. :::The capital of the Mataram Kingdom and Mataram Sultanate was Kota Gede, Yogyakarta. ::4. Demak Sultanate :::Demak was the first kingdom in Java to adopt Islam. It was founded in the 15th century on the north coast of Central Java. ::5. The story of Syekh Siti Jenar :::in a hermitage, Jayengresmi is told the story of the sufi Seh Lemah-Abang (Syekh Siti Jenar). Walisanga Muslims considered Sufism to be heresy. During a conference of Moslem saints, he argued with other saints over the perception of Truth as mystic union with the Creator/Manunggaling Kawula Gusti. He was executed - which is depicted as mere transition to an incorporeal world. ::6. Introduction of the Javanese Almanac :::In another hermitage, Jayengresmi is introduced to the Wuku, the Javanese Almanac. ::7. Muslim Teachings :::In several hermitages Jayengresmi teaches the Islamic practices Tahajjud (optional late night prayers) and Martabat Tujuh (the Seven Stages of Creation). In return his servants are taught the secret of longevity through Puja Dina, a Muslim prayer ritual. ::8. Ruins of Pajajaran/Sunda Kingdom :::The kingdom of Pajajaran in West Java was a rival to the kingdom of Majapahit in the 13th century. The ruins of its capital are in the present-day region of Bogor. ::9. Jayengresmi ends his first journey in Karang Hermitage, Banten, West Java. :::Seh Ibrahim ibn Abubakar, also known as Kyai Ageng Karang, is the hermit of Karang, and comes originally from Arabia. After losing his son it was prophesied that the son of Sunan Giri would come to him and become his son. He adopts Jayengresmi as his son. Journey of Jayengsari and Rancangkapti Jayengsari and Rancangkapti are accompanied by their servant Buras. They visit the sites of old Javanese kingdoms and learn legends. ::1. Singhasari/Singosari Kingdom in East Java, 13th century. :::Singosari is a Kingdom which precede Majapahit Kingdom in the Hindu Era. Its heritage is Temple Singosari and Kidal. ::2. Hindu Society in Tengger, Bromo and Semeru mountain. :::Tengger is a region that still has Hindu religion, even today. Hindu teachings were introduced by a hermit in the Semeru Mountains. ::3. Muslim teachings and introduction to celibacy :::During their journey in Probolinggo they were introduced to several Muslim teachings. They met a holy maid who taught them the joy of celibacy. ::4. Banyuwangi and Ijen Mountain and Blambangan Kingdom :::Ijen mountain is famous of its tosca color crater. Nearby they found the marble temple of Candi Sela Cendhani (that no longer exists), which was King Menakjinggo's palace during the Majapahit era. Menak Jinggo is a King of Blambangan Kingdom, a rival to the Majapahit Kingdom. Menak Jinggo would later rebel against its Majapahit rulers. Blambangan Kingdom survived for two centuries after Majapahit's demise. :::In Banyuwangi, Jayengsari and Rancangkapti would met Ki Hartati, who would become their temporary adopted father. From Banyuwangi, he took them to Pekalongan via North Java Ocean route. ::5. The harbour of Pekalongan :::Jayengsari and Rancangkapti arrived at Pekalongan and stayed with their adopted parents. Two years after their adopted mother's death, they were told by their adopted father to continue their journey to the next destination, the hermitage of Sukoyoso in Dieng Plateau and to study with its hermit, Ki Ageng/Seh Akadiyat. Soon afterwards, Ki Hartati also died. ::6. The end of Jayengsari and Rancangkapti journey in Sokoyoso, Dieng Plateau :::The brother and sister met Ki Ageng, the hermit of Sokoyoso, and his wife Nyai Wuryan. They welcomed the youngsters in delight because their own son, Mas Cabolang, left home for his own interest. Jayengsari and Rancangkapti were then adopted as their children and stayed with them for the next several years. Journey of Mas Cabolang Mas Cabolang is the son of Ki Ageng/Seh Akadiyat, the hermit of Sokoyoso Hermitage in Dieng Plateau. He left his parents' house without asking their permission. His objective is to have his own adventure in order to understand more of the world. His journey began to the south-west route to Cilacap Region and then turned to the east, through Mataram Sultanate's capital (Kota Gede) and move on the eastern part of Java Island before finally going back to Sokoyoso. ::1. Journey throughout Banyumas, Serayu River to Cilacap and the story of Wijayakusuma Flower in Nusakambangan Island :::Mas Cabolang visited several hermitages throughout Banyumas region which are being described as having beautiful pristine waterfalls which forms the headwaters of Serayu River. The river flows to the southern coast of Java Island, towards Karang Bolong-Ujung Kalang caves, in Cilacap region. The teachings of Islam have been spread throughout the region that the caves were used as a natural structure mosque. From on top of the nearby Curiwing mountain, Mas Cabolang could see Nusakambangan Island. He is being told about the legend of Wijayakusuma Flower. Nusa Kambangan Island is a place where Kresna hide Wijoyosukumo Flower (A flower that have the magic of resurrecting the dead). Any Javanese Princes who is about to be crowned, has to dispatch a messenger to the island to retrieve the flower. In case the deity disagree, the messenger will be swallowed by the south ocean. ::2. Kedu Plain, Progo River and Mas Cabolang's marriage to his four wives :::From Cilacap, Mas Cabolang continued his journey to the east toward the mountainous area of Sundoro in Kedu Plain, Central Java. From on top one mountain area, he could see southern Java Ocean. There is a spring which become the headwater of Progo river. The Spring still become an important site for Buddhist procession which is being held until today.

The next day, Puppet Show (wayang kulit) with King Partodewo story is being performed. :::While in Mataram, Mas Cabolang also took a look at several canons which are the gifts from Europeans (Portuguese). They continued their journey to some places whilst getting more insights ie. the story of the pauper, the meaning of the religious lyrics played by rebanas and the teaching of sastra cetha. ::5. The knowledge of Javanese marriage and family life. :::Finally, Mas Cabolang and his santris left Mataram and on the next stop, Kepurun Village, a new friend would teach Mas Cabolang about the Javanese way of finding a good wife, how to safeguard marriage, the science of lovemaking, how to have a decent sex relationship, the conception and determining the gender and character of a baby in the womb. ::6.

In one of the hermitage, they learned about the 4 stages of knowledge and its analogy: the first knowledge is the one being practiced by the body (analogy of having a boat), it is being practiced by the spirit (analogy of one has the knowledge of a sailor), it is being practiced by the soul (analogy of one would understand which depth of ocean where precious pearl lies) and the last one is the sum of all that knowledge. ::8.

Pajang and Jayabaya Prophecy :::The wayfarers arrived at the old site of Pajang Kingdom whose King has the same genealogy with Mataram's from King Brawijaya's lineage. The story went on explaining King Brawijaya's lineage which went down to Joko Tingkir who became the King of Pajang titled Sultan Adiwijoyo. Also being explained, other sons of King Brawijaya from his Chinese wife, Raden Patah, became the first King of a Muslim Kingdom in Java Island.

Mas Cabolang and Nurwitri went too far in creating chaos by having affairs with the women of Wirosobo. The scandal made the husbands and the Regent of Wirosobo extremely angry and ordered their arrest. ::12. The end of Mas Cabolang adventure, in Semeru Mountain and the knowledge of Roh Ilapi. :::After the scandalous adventures, the wayfarers were feeling full with regrets. They realized that they had gone through the wrong way of living their life. Therefore they determined to go back home and repent their sins. The oldest santri advised them to meet a hermit nearby the region, in Semeru Mountain before returning to Sokoyoso. The hermit taught them with the knowledge of Roh Ilapi. ::13.

Before let them leaving his hermitage, his adopted father suggest them to change their names: Jayengresmi became Ki Amongrogo, Gathak and Gathuk became Jamal and Jamil. ::1. Amongrogo's wedding and new family at Wonomarto :::Ki Amongrogo and his attendants went eastward through the middle mountainous part of Java Island, through Sindoro Mountain and finally arrived at Wonomarto and met Wonomarto's hermit, Ki Bayi Panurto. Ki Amongrogo determined to stay and to study with Ki Bayi. It is in this hermitage that Ki Amongrogo finally married Ki Bayi's eldest daughter, Ni Ken Tembangraras. Within this section, the details of Javanese wedding ceremonies and celebration are being explained quite extensively. :::Within their first 40 days, Amongrogo taught her new bride Islam teachings and perfect prayers. While in between, her mother taught her the right behavior toward her husband for successful marriage and misbehaviors which lead to a failure of marriage. :::Centhini is being introduced for the first time within the story, Ni Tembangraras' maid who faithfully also listen to Amongrogo's teachings. :::On the day after the 40th night, Amongrogo began to think about his sibling again and therefore asked permission from his wife to leave and to find his sibling. He promised to come back after he found his siblings and if he fails, he gave her permission to remarry. But Tembangraras could not bear his request and begged him to go with him. When the night came and she fell asleep, Amongrogo left the house and wrote her letters explaining why he should leave. Ni Ken Tembangraras and the whole family later realized Amongrogo's departure. They were all overwhelmed with sadness. ::2. Amongrogo's quest to the eastern and southern part of Java Island. :::From Wonomarto, Amongrogo and his attendants went eastward through Semeru Mountain and went all the way to the most eastern part of Java island (Blambangan region) before turned westward through southern coastal regions of Java Island. At one beach in Lumajang region, he saw an island in the Indian Ocean and decided to check it out. As they found out that the island, namely Nusabarong, gave them convenient food supply, they stayed there for 40 days. They went back to Java Island and continued their journey through several caves on the mountainous area in the southern part of East Java, through Mount Kelud to Mount Willis. In every meditation session, Amongrogo received a Lotus flower vision. ::3. The legend of King Arjuna Sasrabahu :::They arrived at Srobojo, a shortened name of Sosrobojo (another name of King Arjuna Sosrobahu). The legend says that King Arjuna arrived in the region from India while bringing his 800 wives and along the way, he selected more women to join his harem. King Arjuna then settled and built a Kingdom in Kabarehan, whose ruins became the city of ghosts and demons. ::4. Introduction to the concept of reincarnation. :::Amongrogo arrived and managed to climb Lawu Mountain. Succeeded in reaching the top, they went on to Condrodimuko Crater, a legendary place for torturing the sinners. Near the crater, Amongrogo meditated and he received a sign that he and his wife would live at a place called Terate-Bang. On their descending way, they visited Pringgodani, a legendary place (Arimbo's Kingdom) mentioned in Mahabarata Epic Javanese version. He met a Hindu hermit who introduced him to the concept of reincarnation. ::5. Amongrogo's first followers from Lemah Abang village :::Amongrogo and his attendants arrived at Lemah Abang Village. They spread Islam teaching and helped the locals to build a mosque. Amongrogo became the local's guru, called Kyai Ageng, and his followers grew in numbers. :::However, his meditations along his journey gave him clues that in order to attain the perfection of his life, he has to meet his father's capturer, that is, Sultan Agung himself. Therefore, Amongrogo decided to continue his journey. He brought 300 santris with him to the southwest, to Mataram region. ::6. Anticipation of encounters with Sultan Agung :::Amongrogo, in anticipation of meeting with Sultan Agung, tried to reach him in his meditation places. Yet every time he arrives there, Sultan Agung would have just left the place. ::7 The Mosque of Kanigoro :::Failed to meet Sultan Agung several times, Amongrogo decided to get his attention. He built a mosque in Kanigoro region and performed magical shows in order to attract larger followers. The mosque indeed grew larger and gathered thousands of followers. Journey of Jayengresmi, Jayengrogo and Kulowiryo Fourteen months had passed since Seh Amongrogo left his father in-law (Ki Bayi) and his wife (Nyi Tembangraras). Finally came a decisive moment when Ki Bayi's brothers (Ki Jayengresmi and Ki Jayengrogo) and their uncle (Ki Kulowiryo) determined to look for and to catch up with Amongrogo. They departed, accompanied by Kulowiryo's attendant, Nuripin. Within their journey, they passed several villages, hermitages and caves. Ki Jayengrogo and Ki Kulowiryo are the morally loose characters as they did a lot of debauchery with the villagers, widowers and ronggeng dancers. Their carelessness sometimes brought them misfortune such as the loss of their possession. Ki Jayengresmi, being the only religious character among the group, always avoid the debauchery while patiently preach his brother and uncle. Nuripin is a character who is always bullied (yet always manage to escape and throw honest mockery on Kulowiryo's debauchery and his misfortune) by Kuliwiryo. The group only have a short distance of journey and they went back to Wonomarto empty handed and only received clues from all the hermits they met, that they would met Amongrogo later on in a place called Wonontoko. Soon afterwards, santri Luci, who previously met Amongrogo, arrived at Wonomarto. Ki Luci told Ki Bayi and his family the summary of Amongrogo's journey and his whereabout. Within Amongrogo's journey, he kept having a vision of a lotus, which means, his search for the perfection of life would only be gained through Sultan Agung's help. Amongrogo tried to catch up with Sultan Agung by visiting his meditational places. But Sultan always leave just when Amongrogo arrives. Amongorogo then has to attract his attention by building a grand mosque at Kanigoro and performing magic show which gathered thousands of followers. The magical shows which drew thousands of followers finally was being noticed Sultan Agung. He concluded that such activity was breaking Islamic law and therefore he sentenced Amongorogo for death penalty by drowning him to an ocean. Amongrogo was being executed. The death penalty is actually what Amongrogo's looking for from Sultan Agung. As by went through death, he wasn't really dead, he only moved to another realm (reverse realm/incorporeal world/jagad walikan in javanase). Therefore, right on entering incorporeal world, he thanked Sultan Agung instead. The debauchery scenes of this section is what makes Serat Centhini famous of its porn contents which unfortunately often overshadow the other knowledge being elaborated. Nyi Selobrangti and Cethi Centhini Reunite Soon after receiving bad news about his husband, Nyi Tembangraras determined to find his husband herself. She changed her name to Nyi Selobrangti and accompanied by her faithful maid, Centhini. Both of them arrived at Wonontoko and accidentally met Ki Amongrogo's long time separated brother and sister, Ki Mangunkarso/Jayengsari and Nyi Rancangkapti. Soon after the surprising reunion, Nyi Selobrangti told them the bad news about Ki Amongrogo's death. The news shocked them and all of them fainted and died. Ki Amongrogo, in his realm, noticed the unfortunate event. He visited Wonontoko and revived everyone. The horrible scene now become a happy ending for the brother and sister and the wife. The couple finally reunited and later on built a hermitage but in the reverse realm.incorporeal world. At this point Ki Bayi's brothers, Jayengresmi and Jayengrogo, left Wonomarto once again to find their niece, Nyi Tembangraras/Selobrangti and Centhini. In the middle of their journey, they received a message from Ki Montel (Amongrogo's attendant) that Tembangraras had met her husband and that they had lived together in Wonontoko in a specific place called Jurang-Jangkung. Jayengrogo and Jayengresmi delighted to hear the news. They decided to meditate at Ardipolo hermitage while Ki Montel delivered the good news to Ki Bayi and his wife. =Post- adulthood journey= A Reunion of Ki Bayu and his wife with their daughter Nyi Tembangraras and Seh Amongrogo Ki Bayi and his wife, Nyi Malaresmi, were eager to meet their daughter therefore they set forth to Wonontoko. By the end of the journey they met Ki Mangukarso (Amongrogo's brother) who told them that they would be able to meet Tembangraras and Amongrogo only in incorporeal world and through a meditation at jurang-jangkung. They went to Jurang- Jangkung and meditate. On the third night, they finally met Seh Amongorogo and Nyi Tembangraras in the incorporeal world. The short reunion however had to come to an end. Ki Bayi and his wife returned to Wonomarto, this time, with a happy and content feeling. The Island of Black Marble Seh Amongrogo and Nyi Tembangraras, within their incorporeal world, made a journey to Banten, West Java. They arrived at a dreadful beach therefore he changed it into a tranquil one. He then built an island made of black marble, filled it with precious stones, built a house and stayed there with his wife. It wasn't long before the news of an island of black marble reached a powerful man from Sumatra Island, Ki Datuk. He confronted Seh Amongrogo by put him into test. If indeed Amongrogo is a generous figure, he won't say no to whatever Ki Datuk is asking, even asking for his wife. To Ki Datuk's surprise, Amongrogo gave away his wife. Tembangraras and Ki Datuk's ship was ready on sail returning to Sumatra but in the middle of the ocean, the weather became fierce and the ship sank. Ki Datuk and his sailors was being rescued and they arrived back home empty handed. Meanwhile, Nyi Tembangraras was being pickekup by Seh Amongrogo and they return to Wonontoko, leaving the Black Marble Island and its beach to its original dreadful state. The Wonder Maggots and the End of Seh Amongrogo and Nyi Tembangraras' Life Journey Serat Centhini ends with a famous story of wonder maggots. Seh amongrogo and Nyi Tembangraras wished to go back to the real world in order to put discipline to the people and that it can be done through Sultan Agung's lineage. In the meantime, Sultan Agung, in his old age, had become a priest namely Priest Anyokrokusumo. Seh Amongrogo and Nyi Tembangraras met him through incorporeal world and the three of them agreed to make an arrangement. The deal was, Seh Amongrogo and Nyo Tembangraras were changed into wonder male and female maggots. The female maggots was eaten by Sultan Agung, while the female maggot was eaten by Pangeran Pekik (Sultan Agung's brother-in-law). Later on, the son of Sultan Agung (the reincarnation of Seh Amongrogo) would marry Pangeran Pekik's daughter (as reincarnation of Nyi Tembangraras) and they would have a son who would become the King of Mataram, namely Amangkurat. In his reign, Amangkurat didn't please his people because of the discipline being applied. One prince, Raden Trunojoyo, rebelled against him, on behalf of Amangkurat's son. Amangkurat was then being exiled to a place which has a fragrant soil (Tegalarum). This means that Seh Amongrogo and Nyi Tembangraras had arrived at the end of their lives' journey, from their birth to their death. Evolution of the Javanese knowledge (kawruh) in the modern time Colonial time Modernity and science that were being brought by the Europeans created a paradigm shift in the kind of knowledge and the way to attain knowledge within Javanese society. The concept of 'time is money' was being introduced in which Javanese society have to adjust to a new regular working culture in contrast to the regularity of an agricultural work. Schools in new institutions in new towns were being introduced to public via Colonial Ethical Policy in contrast with the way ancient schools was being conducted through hermitages or in exclusive royal/palace circles. The kind of knowledge is also shifting from heavily mysticism knowledge to heavily rational kind of knowledge. In Shiva-Hindu Catur Asrama, wanderers are part of the way of life and to attain knowledge. In the colonial period the wanderers become unwanted people in new town such as Batavia. The wanderers often evolve into independent rebels or local heroes such as being popularized by The Legend of Si Pitung or Prince Diponegoro's guerrilla volunteers from Bagelen. During the independence war, the rebels play a bigger role in the guerrilla movement. Post Independence Javanese knowledge remains in the form of traditions that are being passed down through generations. Especially in the area of philosophy, traditional medicine, wedding procession and religion. *Philosophies are actively being passed down by parents, society and leadership/government/military institutions. Sometime they are being popularized via newspaper's satire or comedy talk show by local media. Example of Javanese popular philosophies are: :::*Eling LAN Waspada: Be conscious of who we are in regards to our creator and to the people AND be alert in avoiding any wrongdoings :::*Ing Ngarsa Sung Tulada, Ing Madya Mangun Karsa, Tut Wuri Handayani: In the forefront leaders should give good example, in the middle among the people leaders should work with the people, from the rear leaders should give support and motivation. :::*Bibit Bobot Bebet: In selecting spouse, use the measurement of Bibit (consider his/her family background and good name), Bobot (consider his/her good education and strong morals) and Bebet (Javanese is a paternalistic society, hence, the wife should consider that her prospective husband can be relied as a breadwinner/provider for the family) :::*Alon alon asal kelakon: carefulness and safety should be prioritized, do not do any work in a careless way *Religious ceremonies are still conducted by today's Yogayakarta Sultanate and its people such as sekaten, Satu Suro ceremony, Labuhan ceremony at Parangtritis beach (offering from the Yogyakarta Sultanate to the South Ocean Queen) see the Javanese Wikipedia article Labuhan *Ceremonies of a full life cycle (pregnancy, baby, wedding, after death) are being practiced more widely by Javanese society even in big modern cities. :::*Pregnancy: Mitoni (7 month pregnancy)see the Javanese Wikipedia article mitoni :::*Baby ceremonies: Tedhak Sitensee the Javanese Wikipedia article Tedhak sit√®n :::*Wedding: Midodareni night,see the Javanese Wikipedia article midodaren Siramansee the Javanese Wikipedia article siraman :::*After death: ceremonies of 7th, 40th, 100th and 1000th days after one's death *Arts and traditional performance. Unfortunately throughout modern time, traditional performances gradually have been marginalized by modern and pop culture. They are however still largely being performed throughout Java villages, hence, its connotation with plebeian and tacky performance. The loosely erotic dances in Ronggeng, Gandrung or Tayuban including drinking and being drunk is being partially limited by Moslem-style authorities e.g. the clothing should be more enclosed, saweran (the act of slipping money into the dancer's wardrobe) is handed down through scarf and alcohol is prohibited. Erotic dances, however, transformed in another kind of popular performances namely Dangdut and its subgenre development Dangdut Koplo. :Recently, suffered by cases of claims by neighboring country over some Indonesian local performances, Indonesian had begun to pay more attention and to safeguard Indonesian traditional heritage. More directors and artists start to improvise by packaging traditional arts with modern one e.g. Javanese Bossanova music, Wayang performances are being presented as operas. *Mysticism. As rationality dominate the way of thinking of modern society, mysticism also has been marginalized to mysterious plebeian clubs, fortune tellers and shamman. Popular culture reduce its existence to tacky horror movies. Broadcasting media popularize it through reality TV shows. :However globalization (fueled by the use of internet) and democracy helps grass root who still care on bringing back the honorable meaning of mysticism into Javanese society. *Architecture. Joglo architecture is still being preserve. However, it is more popular for designing public or government building.

This was the nation's eighth time competing in a Summer Paralympic Games. The Faroese delegation consisted of one swimmer, Ragnvaldur Jensen. In his only event, the men's 100 meter breaststroke SB14 he finished seventh in his heat and failed to qualify for the finals. Background The Faroe Islands, a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, first joined Paralympic competition at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. The Faroe Islands do not compete in the Olympic Games under their own flag, rather Faroese competitors at the Olympics must compete in the Danish team. The Islands have participated in every Summer Paralympics since then, but have never participated in the Winter Paralympics. All 13 of the Faroe Islands' medals have been in the sport of swimming. The 2012 Summer Paralympics were held from 29 August to 9 September 2012 with a total of 4,237 athletes representing 164 National Paralympic Committees taking part. The Faroese delegation to London consisted of a single swimmer, Ragnvaldur Jensen. He was the country's flag-bearer during the Games' opening ceremony.  Swimming Ragnvaldur Jensen was 22 years old at the time of the London Paralympics, and was classified as SB14. SB14 is described by the International Paralympic Committee as \\"S14 swimmers have an intellectual impairment, which typically leads to the athletes having difficulties with regards to pattern recognition, sequencing, and memory, or having a slower reaction time, which impact on sport performance in general. Moreover, S14 swimmers show a higher number of strokes relative to their speed than able- bodied elite swimmers.\\" On 6 September, he was drawn into heat one of the men's 100 meter breaststroke SB14, finishing with a time of 1 minute and 13.92 seconds, which put him in seventh place out of eight swimmers in his heat. Only the top eight between both heats could advance to the finals, and Jensen was eliminated from the competition. Yasuhiro Tanaka of Japan eventually won the gold medal, with Artem Pavlenko of Russia taking silver and the bronze went to Marc Evers of the Netherlands. {class=wikitable - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athletes !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - !Time !Rank !Time !Rank - align=center align=leftRagnvaldur Jensen align=left100m breaststroke SB14 1:13.92 12 colspan=2Did not advance }  See also  *Faroe Islands at the Paralympics References Category:Nations at the 2012 Summer Paralympics 2012 Summer Paralympics ","title":"Faroe Islands at the 2012 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"36744006","text":"Mohammed Abdullah Al-Rukn () is an Emirati lawyer and political activist who was born on 26 September 1962.

He was the commander of the Southern Zone since the death of General Ahmed Dlimi. On 13 June 2014 and after reports which stated that he was in poor health and following treatment in France, Bennani was replaced, as the Inspector General of the Moroccan army and commander of the southern zone, by general Bouchaib Arroub. Early life Like other high-ranking officials of the Moroccan military, few personal details about Bennani are known. He was part of a class of military conscripts (The Promotion Mohammed V) who in 1957, followed six- months training in the French military school Saint Cyr, under the supervision of then Crown Prince Hassan, after which they received the officer rank. Family His son Yahya Bennani is the Moroccan ambassador in Kuwait and previously worked in the Moroccan external intelligence service, the DGED. Corruption allegations The Moroccan military is plagued by corruption. A leaked U.S diplomatic cable from 2008, cited that it is particularly prevalent amongst the highest ranks. The cable went on to directly accuse Abdelaziz Bennani of corruption: In his 2006 book, \\"Les Officiers de Sa Majest√©\\" Mahjoub Tobji, a former commandant in the Moroccan army, also accused Bennani, among other high-ranking officers, of corruption and embezzlement. Tobji cited, in addition to fisheries in Western Sahara operated by high-ranking officers, racketeering of Russian and Norwegian ships fishing illegally south of Agadir and bribes in contracts of meat imported from Argentina and Australia for the army. Tobji also reported a number of other alleged corrupt practices. Hospital incident On 18 June 2014, Mustapha Adib a former captain in the Moroccan army who was imprisoned in 2000 for denouncing corruption in his military base of Errachidia and was forced to exile afterwards, visited the Val-de-Gr√¢ce, the hospital where Bennani was following treatment in France. He tried to visit the general but was not authorised to access the room, after which he left him a bouquet of cheap flowers and a message, in which he accused Bennani of being a criminal responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, the impoverishment of thousands of deceased soldiers children and a corrupt who stole state's assets. Through the official press agency, Maghreb Arabe Presse, the Moroccan state protested this incident and stated that Abdelaziz Bennani was \\"assaulted morally\\" [sic], with the tacit complacency of French authorities. The chief of Moroccan external intelligence (DGED), Yassine Mansouri (also a classmate of king Mohammed VI at the Coll√®ge Royal) summoned the French Ambassador in Rabat to protest. The Moroccan ambassador in Paris and former minister of the Interior, Chakib Benmoussa tried to meet the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius to express \\"dissatisfaction\\" over the incident, but was only received by his chief of cabinet. The incident came in a period where Moroccan authorities have been complaining about a number of incidents, including; a lawsuit filed in France against Abdellatif Hammouchi (the head of the Moroccan secret services), for allegedly torturing suspects (such as Zakaria Moumni), which prompted Morocco to suspend judiciary cooperation with France and is currently under investigation by French judges. Then there was an alleged quote by the French ambassador to the UN, in which he described the Moroccan state as a \\"mistress\\" that you don't love but have to defend. The quote allegedly came as an allegorical reply to actor Javier Bardem who inquired of him about France's position on Western Sahara in the security council.

Jean-√âtienne Waddens remained in Switzerland until at least 1755, however by 1757, he was serving in the colonial regular troops of New France. In May of that year, he renounced Calvinism. He remained in the Montreal area after the city's surrender in 1760. Jean-Etienne Waddens married Marie Josephe De Guire on November 23, 1761, in St Laurent near Montreal. Their children were Josepha Waddens and Veronique Waddens. In 1763, he became a property holder in Montreal. Another daughter, from a marriage \\"√† la fa√ßon du pays\\" (in the style of the country), Marguerite Waddens married Alexander MacKay, a prominent fur trader. When MacKay was killed on the Tonquin, Marguerite married John McLoughlin, who is best known for serving as Chief Factor and Superintendent of the Columbia District of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver from 1824 to 1845. Waddens first appeared in fur- trading records as a small independent trader. Beginning in 1772, he was at Grand Portage with eight traders of his traders, who he accompanied. In 1773, he had a licence for two canoes, and an outfit valued at ¬£750, a considerable amount. Between 1773 and 1778, he moved from Lake Winnipeg to the Saskatchewan valley; by 1779 he was on the southern edge of the Athabasca country. In 1779, to counter the idea that separate interests were the bane of the trade, firms trading in the far northwest, including Waddens' joined into one association, known as the ‚Äúnine parties‚Äô agreement,‚Äù a temporary combination usually regarded as the forerunner of the North West Company. At Lac La Rouge, he had a lucrative trade with ‚Äúthe Northward Indians‚Äù coming from Lake Athabasca. In late 1781, he was joined by Peter Pond, a man who too represented the company‚Äôs interests. However, they were on bad terms. In March 1782, Waddens was fatally wounded in a fight, which has been described as murder. In 1783, Mrs Waddens requested Governor of Quebec, Frederick Haldimand to arrest Pond, submitting an affidavit of one of Waddens‚Äô men. Pond was examined in 1785 but was not brought to trial, most likely because Lac La Ronge lay in the territories of the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, beyond the jurisdiction of the Province of Quebec. Not much is known of Waddens‚Äô character. Alexander Mackenzie‚Äôs described him as a man of ‚Äústrict probity and known sobriety‚Äù, however it is possibly a formal phrase. Yet, Waddens succeeded in moving up the social ladder from a private in 1757 to a member of the bourgeois of 1782, although not to the rank of the trader-capitalists, like James McGill.

It was designed and developed by brothers John and Mark McIntyre of Cambridgeshire, England. Development John McIntyre holds a marine engineering degree, and Mark McIntyre is a professional model-builder, both brothers were keen aero- modelers and had a history of building creative contraptions including a sail- propelled-bicycle and a hot-air-balloon which carried a camera. Work on Airglow began after John accompanied Daedalus on its epic flight. Airglow was built over a three-year period to exacting standards, any part not perfect was scrapped and re-built. Testament to this is the fact that airglow is one of the lightest HPA ever built, and has had a flying life longer than any other. Airglow took longer to build than was expected, in John's words \\"We thought that if Dr Who could build a trans-dimensional flux damper in less than one episode that what we wanted to do would be simple\\" Unlike many HPA builders Airglow wasn‚Äôt built to break records or win Kremer prizes. John states that it was built ‚Äòfor delight‚Äô and because ‚Äòit‚Äôs fun to make things‚Äô. Airglow first flew at 6am on 20 July 1990 at Duxford Airfield, England. The pilot was seventeen-year-old Nick Weston. Airglow‚Äôs first performance was impressive, the aircraft flew on only the 2nd attempt, and by the end of the day had managed three more flights, the longest being about a quarter of a mile. Over the next five years airglow made between 50 and 100 flights with no accidents. Typical flights would be the length of the runway, the longest flight was about 2 miles long. In 1992 Airglow was taken to Germany and flown by Peer Frank (designer of Velair 88 and Velair 89) at the Grob airfield at Mindelheim. Peer Frank - Skytech] Pressure of work meant that after 1995 airglow rarely flew. In 2010 it was passed on to the Royal Aeronautical Society. Specifications (Airglow) Design Airglow is a conventionally configured aircraft, the main wing forward, tail and elevator at the back, with a ‚Äòpusher‚Äô prop situated about a quarter of the way down the tail boom. The pilot sits recumbent in a streamlined nacelle with an open side to provide cooling. The drive mechanism is a combination of pedals, a gearbox, drive shafts and chains, powering a 2.95 meter two-bladed propeller mounted concentrically with the boom. Airglow was designed with an all-flying rudder and elevator for yaw and pitch, plus rotating wing tips for lateral stability. The aircraft employs a simple fly-by-wire control system based on lightweight control servos more normally found on radio controlled model aircraft. The rotating wingtips had limited success, and have since been fixed in a single position. The aircraft now relies on the rudder alone for turning, lateral stability is provided for by increased wing dihedral. Power requirements vary from about 450-500 watts on take-off to about 275-300 watts for sustained flight. Power requirements increase noticeably in anything other than nil-wind conditions. Current Status After an over a year in the custodianship of the Royal Aeronautical Society Airglow was brought out of retirement in 2011 and passed on to P&M; Aviation. Despite being left for several years in a shed in the bottom of a garden the aircraft required little more than some oil on the moving parts before being flown again on 29 September at Kemble by Robin Kraike of P&M; Aviation and Dr Bill Brookes from the Human Powered Flight Group of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Airglow flew at Lasham airfield on 13 November 2011 as part of the 50th Anniversary celebrations of Derek Piggott‚Äôs pioneering HPA flight in SUMPAC. Icarus Cup In August 2012 Airglow competed in the Icarus Cup at Lasham airfield against 4 other HPA. Flying in a number of events including duration, slalom, speed, un-assisted take-off and precision landing Airglow won most of the individual events and the overall competition. During the competition airglow achieved flights of well over a kilometer at speeds approaching 9 m/s. These flights were only brought to an end when the pilots ran out of airfield. Ongoing development Airglow is currently being worked on by a small team of pilots and engineers using Airglow as a flying test bed for HPA improvements. Airglows modular design allows refinement of different sections of the aircraft (propeller, rudder, elevator, drive chain, wings etc.) without requiring major work to the rest of the aircraft.

The initiative also participated in the Abu Dhabi Media Summit, where it held and spoke at a panel discussion on crowdsourcing with three of its key international stakeholders: Twitter, Storify and Meedan. Taghreedat also participated at the ITU Telecom World 2012, which was held in Dubai, UAE. The initiative spoke at a panel discussion on Big Data and how crowdsourcing fits into the ever-increasing debate on data ownership.  Partnerships and collaborations  Taghreedat has collaborated with the following international digital content companies and organizations: * Google, globally * Twitter, Inc. in San Francisco, California * TED in New York City * The Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco * Storify in San Francisco * Meedan in San Francisco * Khan Academy in California * WhatsApp in California * GameLoft in Europe * Easy Chirp in California * Coursera in California * Smartling in New York * Amara in New York * Foursquare in New York  Taghreedat's projects  = Twitter Arabization Project = The first of Taghreedat's projects which commenced on October 22, 2011, Taghreedat gathered a group of volunteers to Arabize over 190 Twitter glossary terms from English to Arabic to be then applied on Twitter's Arabic interface. Taghreedat collaborated with Twitter to develop such glossary, through a campaign that the initiative launched under the hashtag #letstweetinarabic to create momentum and awareness and was considered by Twitter as a grassroots step in the eventual launch of Twitter's Arabic interface, which Taghreedat and thousands of Arab volunteers at Twitter's Translation Center have contributed to make it a reality. = Arabic Wikipedia Editors Program = In cooperation of the Wikimedia Foundation, Taghreedat has launched the Arabic Wikipedia Editors Program ‚Äì a regional program which targets regular Internet users to train them (both online & offline) become Arabic Wikipedia editors. The program is composed of two main components: online training as well as offline workshops (training component) in addition to a reward component in the form of official certificates that the volunteer participants will be receiving. The project was launched in mid June 2012 and continues to attract new Arabic Wikipedia editors.Video from the Wikimedia Foundation on the Taghreedat/Wikipedia Partnership = Storify Arabization Project = In mid May 2012, Taghreedat announced that it has started working with San Francisco- based Storify, the online curation social platform, to Arabize its website interface. Crowd-sourced community work on the project continued for 3 weeks until June 7, 2012. Starting July, Taghreedat has started working with Storify on the back-end to ensure the Arabic Storify interface is implemented while taking Arabic text placement in consideration. When launched, Arabic will become among the first 3 languages to be applied to the online curation website interface.The Next Web ‚Äì Storify Working with Middle Eastern Initiative Taghreedat To Translate Storify Into Arabic = First Arabic Tech/Web 2.0 Dictionary = Taghreedat is developing the first crowd-sourced Arabic technology dictionary for technology and social media terms, translated from English to Arabic. The dictionary comprises over 6,500 technology terms in various fields, including: cyber safety, cyber security, graphic design, PC terminology and more. Started in mid June 2012, work is currently ongoing to gather the Taghreedat community votes on all 6500 terms. The dictionary, expected to be launched later this year, has attracted the attention of a number of US and UK media outlets, tipping it as the first crowd-sourced collection of Arabic technology terms in the MENA region. = TED Website Localization Project = On September 4, 2012, Taghreedat announced that it has begun working with the TED headquarters in New York to localize its official website into Arabic for the first time. The project will be carried our by Taghreedat's volunteer base, applying the same crowdsourcing model that Taghreedat has applied in its previous localization projects with Twitter and Storify. = Memorandum of Understanding with Meedan = At its panel discussion session with a number of its international stakeholders including Twitter, Storify and Meedan, Taghreedat announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Meedan, the California based social translation and software NGO. This collaboration focuses on translating Open Education Resources (OER), and hence increasing the availability of educational resources in Arabic language for users worldwide, particularly students. The partnership will promote Taghreedat and Meedan's common goal of providing access to high quality Arabic digital educational content, Open Educational Resources, through online social translation software in the Middle East. This new agreement will allow Meedan, which has been working on building an online translation community since 2008, to focus its resources on program and software design and delivery. Taghreedat will work towards translating all online educational content and dialogue initiatives into Arabic through its active social media community of over 2500 volunteers. = Khan Academy Video Subtitling Project = On November 6, 2012, Khan Academy launched an effort with Taghreedat to localize its educational video library into Arabic, offering an opportunity for all Arabic speaking learners worldwide to access a vast amount of quality open educational resources in their native language for free. The project came as the first tangible outcome of Taghreedat's MoU with California-based Meedan, which was signed in October at the Abu Dhabi Media Summit. The partnership directly falls into Arabizing Open Educational Resources and marks the beginning of a larger call to action to channel Arab users' enthusiasm to enrich Arabic content online into more areas than interface localization. = Arabic Web Days Program = On November 23, 2012, Google announced the launch of \\"Arabic Web Days\\" to enrich digital Arabic content, through a series of activities and initiatives to be implemented by a group of prominent international bodies and regional shows in Middle East and North Africa over a month. Google has partnered with Vinelab, Taghreedat and Wamda to shape the program, which also saw involvement of Twitter, WikiPedia, TED, Soundcloud and YouTube. The program was supported by local expertise from the Media Zone Authority in Abu Dhabi, twofour54 and Qatar Research Institute for Computing (QCRI). = Tajseed: the MENA Region's First Infographics Competition = As part of Arabic web days, Taghreedat has announced on November 26, 2012 that it has partnered with Tajseed, the MENA region's first Arabic infographics competition, to launch the competition in its second round with the goal of amplifying the competition's goal and discovering Arab talent in the infographics field. Tajseed's first round had attracted over 40,000 visits to the website: tajseed.net and over 10,000 views to the competition video when it was first launched. By the end of the first round, over 300 Arabic infographics submissions were received and the winners were all announced in May 2012. = WikiQuote Project = In cooperation with the Wikimedia Foundation, Taghreedat is contributing to Wikimedia's WikiQuote project, a Wikipedia sister project that collects various popular quotes and cultural sayings from around the world. Taghreedat will be contributing with around 2,000 Arabic quotes ‚Äì originating from the Arab world or translated into Arabic to enrich the Repository. The project started in May 2012 and will continue throughout the year. = WhatsApp Localization Project = On January 13, 2013, Taghreedat launched a collaboration with WhatsApp to improve the localization of its applicants on various mobile devices. The project attracted over 2,600 Arab volunteers who joined the WhatsApp Translation Center to suggest variations and add votes to the Arabic strings localized at the Translation Center. The project was followed by a collaboration between Taghreedat and WhatsApp to carry out the translation and localization of WhatsApp on Windows Phone 8. = GameLoft Website Localization Project = On February 26, 2013, Taghreedat announced its latest localization partnership with Gameloft, one of the top global gaming companies and producer of global gaming brands including Batman, Spider-Man, Ice Age, Rayman, Asphalt among others. The project was to localize over 250 strings of which the Gameloft website was comprised. The project marked the first time a global gaming company agrees to localize its website into Arabic to cater to Arabic speaking users particularly in the Middle East. Over 1,000 volunteers joined the project. = Wikimedia Commons Project = On April 6, 2013, Taghreedat announced its latest partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation to increase awareness, build interest and foster participation among Arabic social media users in Wikimedia Commons. Users were encouraged to register Wikipedia usernames and then upload their own work on Commons. More than 1800 volunteers signed up for the project. = Easy Chirp Localization Project = On May 1, 2013, Taghreedat launched a collaboration with Easy Chirp, the accessible Twitter application for the blind and visually impaired. The project entailed localizing all 400 strings of the application to be then delivered to Easy Chirp prior to the launch of the application in Arabic language for the first time. In 10 days, over 1800 Arab volunteers signed up to participate in the project. All strings were completed within 24 hours after the project launch. = Coursera and Taghreedat: Arabic OER Partnership = On May 19, 2013, Taghreedat announced a partnership with Coursera, the world‚Äôs leading Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) provider to translate major international university courses across multiple disciplines for all Arab students around the world, for free.

It was the seventh typhoon and the thirteenth named storm of the 2012 Pacific typhoon season. The storm killed 40 people and caused a sum of US$554.08 million in losses. Kai- tak can be tracked back to the broad area of disturbance embedded in a monsoonal trough that was first spotted, early on August 10. It was only at midnight, on August 16, when the JMA officially declared Kai-tak a typhoon. On the morning of August 17, the windpseed dropped to 60 knots (110 km/h; 69 mph) and was no longer a typhoon. The typhoon caused heavy damage in China's two provinces killing one person and causing a great economic loss. In Vietnam, Typhoon Kai-Tak has stormed across the country's north bringing high winds and floods to several areas including the capital Hanoi. Tropical Storm Kai-Tak slammed the northern Philippines triggering flash floods and landslides and killing at least three people, one week after deadly monsoon rains battered the country. Meteorological history The origins of Kai-tak can be tracked back to the broad area of disturbance embedded in a monsoonal trough that was first spotted, early on August 10. By the next day, the convection deepened and a weak low-level circulation center was spotted with winds of up to . A Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission pass revealed that the convection around the system was very loosely organised and the banding was relatively weak. By midnight, that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system as a weak Tropical Depression with winds under 30 knots. A couple of hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) estimating winds of up to . As the storm was also in the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)'s area of Responsibility, they started issuing advisories on the system, thus naming it Helen. By noon, on August 12, the JMA confirmed that the depression has reached a windpseed of . As opposed to this, in their first advisory on the system, the JTWC said that the storm had winds of up to 25 knots only. Only late that night, did the JTWC confirm winds of 30 knots, based on new microwave imagery and satellite data. The storm was moving to the west at at the moment. At midnight, the JMA reported winds of , stating that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, thus officially naming it Kai-tak. At 09:00 UTC, on August 13, the JTWC confirmed the same. At that time, the system had a broad, partially exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) with deep convection persisting along the western periphery. Later the same day, according to JMA, the storm reached a maximum sustained windspeed of , thus making it a Severe Tropical Storm. The storm continued tracking northwestward and was located approximately northeast of Manila, Philippines. Infrared imagery revealed that deep convection persisted along the southwestern periphery of the LLCC. Though the storm entered warm watered off the Philippine coast, it failed to intensify rapidly as it was located along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge and was experiencing moderate vertical wind shear. The JTWC did not expect the storm to strengthen any further since it would start interacting with the nearby landmass. On August 14, the LLCC of the storm passed under the deepest convection, however, it failed to intensity because an anticyclone that was located to the northeast of Kai-tak. Albeit the ample outflow, no good convection developed to the northern half of the system due to the shear caused by the anticyclone. At this moment, Kai-tak was expected to rapidly drift eastward due to the persistent subtropical ridge. The JTWC expected Kai- tak to become a typhoon within 48 hours due to warm sea-surface temperatures, and then make landfall. By the night of August 14, Kai-tak tracked westward at and the LLCC became embedded within central dense overcast convection. The storm became more consolidated as a result. Fragmented concentric deep convection surrounded the LLCC. Also, the anticyclone to the east of the system weakened thus reducing the wind shear affecting Kai-tak. The windspeed then rose to approximately . By the next day, the Kai-tak accelerated towards the Philippines. The LLCC started interacting with the northern coast of the island nation. The deep convection continued to build along with the strong equatorward outflow. The storm, however, produced no poleward outflow. Due to the sudden rise in trackspeed, the JTWC estimated a landfall within 12 hours. On the night of August 15, the infrared satellite imagery showed that convective bands have deepened and wrapped tighter into the LLCC and an excellent equatoward outflow. The windspeed was estimated at , which is equivalent to a minimal category 1 tyhoon on the SSHS. Kai-tak was expected to continue intensifying before making landfall over China, and then decay rapidly due to land interaction. According to reports the next morning, Kai- tak continued drifting westward at about . Though the bulk on convection remained to the southern semi-circle, deep convective rainbands have developed over the northern periphery. Over the past 12 hours, the storm rapidly moved west, into china and was expected to make landfall soon. Kai-tak was located along the southern periphery of a deep subtropical ridge positioned over southeast China. The storm continued speeding towards China and by the night of August 16, it was drifting west at nearly . Infrared imagery showed that the cloud-top temperatures were starting to drop. The vertical wind shear near Kai-tak had weakened dramatically. However, the storm maintained the same windspeed. The JTWC announced that the storm would start weakening rapidly within 12 hours due to land interaction. It was only at midnight, on August 16, when the JMA officially declared Kai-tak a typhoon. By then, the system sped up towards landmass. It was drifting west at over , poised to make landfall over the Leizhou Peninsula over the next 12 hours, cross the Gulf of Tonkin, before making a second and final landfall into northern Vietnam to the east of Hanoi. At the same time, the PAGASA issued their last warning on Kai- tak, otherwise known as Helen, locally, as it left the Philippine area of Responsibility. On the morning of August 17, Kai-tak made landfall over the Leizhou peninsula, as expected. It maintained the same intensity and was expected to track west-northwestward under the influence of the subtropical ridge. Within 6 hours, Kai-tak made a second landfall over the northeast coast of Vietnam and has weakened slightly. The windpseed dropped to and was no longer a typhoon. Kai-tak was expected to weaken rapidly thereafter. Later that night, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system as it weakened further and sped up inland. They expected the system to dissipate within 24 hours. However, the JMA stopped tracking the storm early the next morning, no longer considering it a tropical cyclone. Preparations =Hong Kong= On August 15, The Hong Kong Observatory issued the Standby Signal, No. 1 warning regarding Kai-tak as an advisory to the public to closely follow weather reports before flying. The next day, the observatory hoisted the Strong Wind Signal, No. 3 for strong wind, as the storm came within 500 km of the region. At 22:15 the Typhoon signal Number 8 was issued which means winds speeds from 63‚Äì117 km/h were expected in Hong Kong. At 6:20AM the typhoon signal was lowered to Signal number 3 as Kai-Tak was moving away from Hong Kong. Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific also announced that they will be temporarily suspending services to the region due to the typhoon. Hong Kong International Airport had some flight cancellations during Typhoon Kai-Tak. =China= On August 15, The national disaster relief authority of China issued a fourth-level alert, predicting that the storm may hit the coastal areas of the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. Warnings have been issued to the Pearl River Delta forecasting rainfalls up to . The agency asked all ships to return to port, reinforce outdoor structures, and evacuate workers from offshore oil platforms. =Vietnam= On August 16, The Central Steering Committee for Flood and Storm Prevention and Control stated that preparations need to be made regarding the approaching storm. The committee asked all boats at sea to remain well informed about the storm. They predicted winds of up to . Impact =Philippines= Tropical Storm Kai-tak affecting Luzon on August 15 Early on August 16, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak slammed the northern Philippines triggering flash floods and landslides and killing at least three people, one week after deadly monsoon rains battered the country, disaster relief officials said. Twenty northern provinces had been placed under storm warnings before the storm hit. The Office of Civil Defence said one man drowned when he suffered a seizure and fell into a flooded rice field in the province of Pangasinan and another drowned while crossing a swollen river on Tuesday in Ilocos Norte province. Another man died from electrocution in Naguilian town in nearby La Union province, said Superintendent Jovencio Badua, a regional police spokesman. At least 3,555 people were evacuated from their homes in La Union and Pangasinan because of flash floods while several highways were cut off because of landslides, Badua said. By that night, the storm left behind seven dead and two missing in the Philippines. The storm blew out of the Philippines offering some relief for millions of people struggling to recover from a few weeks of monsoon rains that earlier claimed 109 lives. But more than the death toll, a foreign organisation warned the floods posed a continuing and major problem to the three million people who were displaced from their homes, almost one million of whom had sought refuge in temporary evacuation centres. The NDRRMC said it was still providing relief aid to nearly a million people impacted by last week's floods, including more than 216,000 at evacuation centres. ‚ÄúThe need is massive and urgent, millions of people are suffering the miserable consequence of these floods and we must try to reach them before the rains hit again,‚Äù Anna Liendfors, the country representative of Save the Children appealed. At the same time, weathermen warned residents living in low-lying and mountainous areas against possible landslides and flash flood due rains ranging from heavy to intense. In Pampanga, the home province of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in Central Luzon, officials ordered the pre-emptive evacuation of residents in villages along one of the major river systems. =China= At about 12:30 am on August 17, Kai-tak made landfall at Huguang township in Guangdong province, bringing extreme downpours and gales. Off the eastern Zhanjiang coast, the violent weather triggered waves as high as four metres. In Zhanjiang city, trees and billboards could be seen scattered along the roads while most of the shops and restaurants remained closed. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at an airport in Beihai city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, after 16 flights linking Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, and Changsha areas were cancelled. Sources from the Maritime Search and Rescue Center of Qinzhou city said, six people were still trapped after their ship was marooned in Qinzhou Port, Thursday evening. Helicopter, tugs and patrol boats were dispatched to the site for rescuing the trapped people, said the city authorities. According to fishery departments of the coastal cities of Beihai, Qinzhou and Fangchenggang, as of 1 p.m., more than 10,000 fishing boats had been called back to harbours for shelter, and over 40,000 fishermen and seafood farmers have gone ashore to avoid heavy rains, gales and waves. Elsewhere, the typhoon also led to delay and cancellation of 14 incoming flights and seven outgoing flights in Meilan International Airport, in Haikou, capital of the Hainan province. Also, in Hainan, where the heavy rains lashed, 23 flights had been cancelled and 18 others delayed at the Sanya Phoenix International Airport in Sanya City at 10:30 a.m., leaving 3,000 passengers helpless. Officials supervising flood control and drought relief efforts said relief materials and rescue personnel were fully prepared to mitigate the impact of Kai-Tak. In addition to airports, railways were affected. A total of 16 high-speed trains linking Sanya and Haikou were suspended. In Haikou, there were reportedly few pedestrians spotted in the city, where slow-moving cars were seen clogging the rain-hit roads. Officials supervising flood control and drought relief efforts said relief materials and rescue personnel were fully prepared to mitigate the impact of Kai-Tak. As of August 18, more than 700 villagers in Qinzhou, a city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have been trapped in their homes by typhoon-triggered flooding, the local government said. In Qinzhou, heavy rains have swept the city inundating three villages in Dazhi Township, Qinbei District. The local government sent rescue boats and relief materials to the trapped villagers. Two people remained missing after falling into a river in Shangsi County. More than 300 police officers and firefighters have been organized and dispatched to carry out relief efforts across the city, the flood control and drought relief bureau said. In South China, 4 people were killed, and total economic losses were counted to be CNY 4.85 billion (US$765 million). It also affected 1.74 million people in nearby Guangdong province before moving to Guangxi. An oil ship anchored near Beihai, a coastal city in Guangxi, drifted and collided into the bank, spilling five tonnes of oil. The local government initiated an emergency response plan and sent a work team to clean up the spill and cordon off the contaminated area to prevent the pool from expanding. Clean up efforts have ended and marine authorities have taken samples of the sea water to test the pollution level around the location of the accident, the report said. =Vietnam= Meanwhile, in Vietnam, Typhoon Kai-Tak has stormed across the country's north bringing high winds and floods to several areas including the capital Hanoi. Among the victims was a taxi driver who was killed when a tree fell on his car in Hanoi, while two others died from electric shock after a cable fell in northern Son La city. Another victim died in a landslide. Earlier more than 11,000 boats, including several hundred used by tourists at Halong Bay, were ordered to stay close to the shore. The Vietnamese army put 20,000 soldiers backed by helicopters, rescue boats and canoes on standby to handle any incidents.

It is named after John Henry Pepper who implemented a working version of the device in 1862. Dircks also investigated attempts at the invention of a perpetual motion device, writing that those who sought to create such a thing were \\"half-learned\\" or \\"totally ignorant\\". Life and career Dircks was born in Liverpool on 26 August 1806. He was apprenticed to a mercantile firm and spent much of his free time studying practical mechanics, chemistry, and literature. Around the mid-1820s he began lecturing about chemistry and electricity while writing literary articles in the local press and scientific papers in the Mechanics' Magazine and other journals. In 1837 he became a life member of the British Association, and afterwards contributed papers to its proceedings. Two years later he wrote a pamphlet regarding a proposed union of mechanics' and literary institutions. He also wrote a short treatise entitled \\"Popular Education, a series of Papers on the Nature, Objects, and Advantages of Mechanics' Institutions\\", first printed in Liverpool in 1840. He became a practical engineer, conducting railway, canal, and mining works, before progressing to the role of consulting engineer. He continued to investigate technologies and invent new devices, taking out several patents between 1840 and 1857. Dircks joined the Royal Society of Literature, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and other scientific bodies. In 1867 he was elected a full Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being William John Macquorn Rankine. In 1868 he was given an honorary degree (LL.D.) from Tusculum College in Tennessee. Dircks died in Brighton on 17 September 1873. Books *1852. Jordantype, otherwise called Electrotype *1863.

In four essays, developing the progress of nature-study, in connection with sacred song. Pepper's ghost Spiritualists and phantasmagoria performers plied their trade by attempting to convince audiences that they were able to contact the dead. To add weight to their claims they would use various projection techniques, particularly magic lanterns, that would seemingly make a ghost appear. Dircks was frustrated by such trickery and developed a better technique that could help dispel the simpler methods. He saw this as a triumph of enlightenment over superstition and hoped that the scientific explanations would educate people enough to keep them away from such charlatans. Dircks developed a way of projecting an actor onto a stage using a hidden room, a sheet of glass, and a clever use of lighting, calling the technique \\"Dircksian Phantasmagoria\\". The actor would then have an ethereal, ghost-like appearance while seemingly able to perform alongside other actors. Dircks is believed to have described this invention to the British Association in 1858. The unwieldy implementation of his system meant that theatres would need to be entirely rebuilt to accommodate the technique and some refinements would therefore be needed if it were to be adopted on a wide scale. Popular science lecturer John Henry Pepper saw the concept and replicated it on a larger scale, taking out a joint patent with Dircks. Pepper debuted his creation with a Christmas Eve production of the Charles Dickens play The Haunted Man in 1862 and Dircks signed over all financial rights to Pepper. Some reports have suggested that, at the time, Pepper claimed to have developed the technique after reading the 1831 book Recreative Memoirs by famed showman √âtienne-Gaspard Robert. Either way, the effect became known as \\"Pepper's ghost\\" and this name was used by those who replicated the technique. Because of this Dircks became increasingly convinced that his invention had been stolen from him, believing that a conspiracy had been perpetrated against him at first by the Polytechnic and then latterly by the newspapers and advertisers who omitted his name. Dircks' original plan to give rational explanations to dispel the popular appetite for spiritualism was certainly helped by Pepper. Further, Pepper's ghost has been hailed as a key development in stage magic and \\"the cornerstone upon which much subsequent magic was founded\\". In one of his later books Pepper would insist that Dircks should have a share of the credit, and though the technique is still today named after the man who popularised it Dircks is hailed as the originator of the invention. The pair's involvement in the development of Pepper's ghost was summarised in an 1863 article from The Spectator: > This admirable ghost is the offspring of two fathers, of a learned member of > the Society of Civil Engineers, Henry Dircks, Esq., and of Professor Pepper, > of the Polytechnic. To Mr. Dircks belongs the honour of having invented him, > or as the disciplines of Hegel would express it, evolved him from out of the > depths of his own consciousness; and Professor Pepper has the merit of > having improved him considerably, fitting him for the intercourse of mundane > society, and even educating him for the stage. Perpetual motion Dircks had an interest in the search for a perpetual motion machine. His book Perpetuum mobile; or, Search for self-motive power, published in 1861, examined many attempts at creating such a device, and has since been cited by other science writers on the subject. Dircks summarised the ongoing efforts of inventors: > A more self-willed, self-satisfied, or self-deluded class of the community, > making at the same time pretension to superior knowledge, it would be > impossible to imagine. They hope against hope, scorning all opposition with > ridiculous vehemence, although centuries have not advanced them one step in > the way of progress. and: > There is something lamentable, degrading, and almost insane in pursuing the > visionary schemes of past ages with dogged determination, in paths of > learning which have been investigated by superior minds, and with which such > adventurous persons are totally unacquainted. The history of Perpetual > Motion is a history of the fool-hardiness of either half-learned, or totally > ignorant persons.

It comprises approximately 200 households. St. Cuthbert's is regarded by many people in Guyana as the \\"cultural capital\\" for Amerindians.  History  St Cuthbert's Mission was founded in the late 1800s by Joseph Ferguson, who was also the village's first Kafotay (Chief in the Arawak language). At that time it was named \\"Pakuri\\" after the Platonia tree that were then plentiful in the area. The village was renamed St. Cuthbert's Mission when the first Anglican missionaries arrived at the village and founded a Mission there on Saint Cuthbert's Day in 1889. In February 2011, St Cuthbert's suffered from a major flood, with levels of accumulated water reaching 311.3 millimetres. The flood resulted in substantial loss of crops and personal property for many villagers. In September 2011, St Cuthbert's hosted celebrations for Amerindian Heritage Month. The celebrations were attended by a number of senior government officials and thousands of visitors from Guyana as well as other countries.  Geography  St Cuthbert's Mission is situated on the left bank of the Mahaica River. It is surrounded by savannah and shrub lands on its East side, and dense vegetation on its west side. The nearest large settlements are the capital city, Georgetown (57 miles away) and Mahaica (65 miles away by river).  Government  St Cuthbert's Mission falls under the jurisdiction of the Region 4 (Demerara-Mahaica). However, one quarter of St Cuthbert's titled communal village lands are in Region 5 (Mahaica-Berbice), with the other three quarters lying in Region 4. Like most other Amerindian villages in Guyana (and in accordance with the constitutional Amerindian Act), St Cuthbert's is governed by a Village Council under the leadership of a Toshao (or Chief). Toshaos are elected every three years, and are voted in by the local population in village elections. The council is made up of nine members, including the Toshao and an appointed secretary and treasurer. Village Council meetings are held monthly, on the last Saturday of every month.  Economy  St. Cuthbert's was primarily a logging community, and logging provides one of the source of income for the village. Since the 1990s, a small number of villagers have found work with Omai Gold Mines Ltd.Few villagers also practice subsistence farming. The Toshao (Chief)is provided with a monthly stipend by the national government.  Culture  = Local art and the Lokono Group = In August 1988, the leading Guyanese artist and native of St. Cuthbert's Mission, George Simon, founded a drawing and design workshop in the village. The workshop fostered a number of Lokono artistic talents in the village who have since achieved artistic recognition in their own right, including Oswald (\\"Ossie\\") Hussein, Foster Simon, Roland Taylor, Telford Taylor and Lynus Clenkian. These artists - including George Simon - are known collectively as the Lokono Artists Group. In 2002, Simon constructed an Arts Centre to allow local artists to exhibit their work.

Since 1978, the government has promoted the commercialization of housing in urban areas. Property development has become big business in China, with new cities and suburbs springing up with new apartments.  Housing construction  It is an important objective of the Chinese government to promote economic development, launching building developments is an important way of doing this. However, property development in China is vastly outgrowing the number of people who can purchase new homes, concerning many sociologists who argue that it is leading to a deepening of social divisions in the country. However it is expected between 2009 and 2030, China will add further 850 million people to its middle class. According to a study by McKinsey, 54 percent of China's urban households were considered \\"mass middle\\" class in 2012 but will increase to 76 percent of China's urban population by 2022. Due to a growing number of higher-paying high-tech and service industry jobs, 54 percent will also be classified as \\"upper middle\\" class. The new future surge in additional upper middle class earns more than the \\"mass middle class\\" , and hence is able to afford higher rent, more consumption and indicates a possibility that this new rise in unprecedented forecasted number of \\"upper middle class\\" may be able to better match the large number of property developments in the future. Many apartments, hotels and shops remain empty for years being called ghost cities or ghost malls, with many Chinese unable to afford them. As The Economist says, \\"If there is one thing that annoys the man on the Beijing omnibus, it is the cost of housing in China's cities.\\" However ghost cities in China have had an under-reported degree of success in filling up. According to Wade Shepherd, after the ghost cities becomes a thriving city, they no longer become a much talked about topic in the western media. Ex ghost cities are rarely news compared to when they were ghost cities. Wade says, \\"It generally takes at least a decade for China‚Äôs new urban developments to start breaking the inertia of stagnation. But once they do, they tend to keep growing, eventually blending in with the broader urban landscape and losing their ‚Äúghost city‚Äù label.\\" This issue of cost of housing in China, was not applicable to the housing market pre-1978 in China. Before the 1970s, the construction of housing in China was sacrificed for the development of industries and industrial growth. The construction of the housing industry only received a small portion of state-allocated funds to continue to develop the industry. Low rents for urban housing were enticing to many people, causing the available housing to be rented out quickly, giving the state little money for the precious space they are renting out. This led to a shortage of housing and a shortage of funds to build more housing. Between the years of 1995 and 2015, the total investment allocated to the housing industry from the Chinese government has increased from a cap of 50,000 yuan to a cut-off point of 5 million yuan, showing a renewed interest in housing development in recent years from the Chinese government after years of limited funding towards the urban housing projects. The Chinese government announced in March 2011 the objective of building 36 million units of housing by 2015. In September 2011 alone, work commenced on 1.2 million units across China; a 70% increase in the construction of social housing compared with 2010 construction. By 2014, Chinese builders have added 100 billion square feet of housing space in China, equating to 74 square feet per person. Construction of urban housing was a major undertaking. The country has shown a major shift in allocating funds and resources to housing their people, building over 5.5 million apartments between the years of 2003 and 2014 in China‚Äôs cities. These construction projects assigned by the state influence the construction job market in China as well. In 2014 alone, 29 million people were employed in urban construction businesses around China. = Property bubble = The 2011 estimates by property analysts state that there are some 89 million empty properties and apartments in China, and that housing development in China is massively oversupplied and overvalued, and is a bubble waiting to burst with serious consequences in the future. The BBC cites Ordos in Inner Mongolia as the largest ghost town in China, full of empty shopping malls and apartment complexes. However there have later been contradictions to this property bubble theory as for example, CNN in 2015 also cites The New South China Mall in Dongguan, the biggest shopping mall in the world, was virtually empty for over a decade and that its owners were determined to make the mall full occupancy again. In 2018 after renovations, the mall is reported almost at full occupancy and no longer a \\"ghost mall\\". Indicating that the theoretical reasons of a property bubble making it a ghost mall in 2015, may not have even been the determining factor given the only changes were renovations to bring in mass tenants Though a large, and largely uninhabited urban real estate development has been constructed 25 km from Dongsheng District in the Kangbashi New Area. Intended to house a million people, it remains largely uninhabited. Intended to have 300,000 residents by 2010, government figures stated it had 28,000 residents by this time. However, in 2017, the ghost city label is less valid to hang on Ordos Kangbashi. According to a report in 2017, the population has increased to 153,000 people living there, 4,750 businesses are now in operation, and housing prices have risen roughly 50% on average from the end of 2015. Of the 40,000 apartments that had been built in the new district since 2004, only 500 are still on the market. Critics argue that the national social-housing programme disproportionally benefits the urban population and that not only can many of the rural poor ill afford new housing in the cities, but they also find it difficult to obtain household- registration certificates (hukou). The housing development schemes is also affecting the concentration of unemployment as once housing development are completed, workers may be laid off. According to the former Director of China's Housing & Real Estate Administration Bureau, Professor Lin, as of 2008, Beijing had an average of 1.41 individuals per room across the city. China's housing prices are closely related to the high capital returns and resource reallocation. China's housing prices have been growing nearly twice as fast as national income over the past decade, despite a high vacancy rate and a high rate of return to capital. The bubble arises because high capital returns driven by resource reallocation are not sustainable in the long run. Rational expectations of a strong future demand for alternative stores of value can thus induce currently productive agents to speculate in the housing market.

Maryland Gazette 5 Sept 1765. A skull and crossbones was displayed where the stamp should have been affixed. Early life Green was born into a family of printers. The family tradition had been begun in Massachusetts by his great- grandfather, Samuel Green, who was himself the successor to the earliest printers in the North American colonies, the Dayes of Cambridge. Samuel Green started his printing business in 1649 and producing a number of notable works, including Elliot's New Testament, translated into the Native American language. Career Jonas Green moved to Maryland in 1738, and became the Province's official printer. Green was a prot√©g√© of Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia. He became the publisher of the Maryland Gazette. Its early masthead read as follows: :\\"Annapolis, Printed by Jonas Green at his Printing Office on Charles Street; where all persons may be supplied with this Gazette at twelve shillings, six pence a year, and Advertisements of moderate length are inserted for 5 shillings the First Week and 1 shilling each time thereafter; and long ones in proportion.\\" Money was sometimes hard to come by, so Green sometimes traded an ad or a subscription for supplies. His wife, Anne Catharine Green, also helped to make ends meet by selling homemade chocolates at the post office.www.hometownannapolis.com Retrieved August 2012 =The Maryland Gazette and the American Revolution= Green, a born troublemaker, hated the Stamp Act, which among other things directly taxed his newspaper. Refusing to pay, he published the Gazette with what was then a blaring headline: \\"The Maryland Gazette Expiring: In Uncertain Hopes of a Resurrection to Life Again.\\" Green wrote that because of the Stamp Act, the newspaper \\"will not any longer be published.\\" In the bottom right-hand corner of the page, where the tax stamp should have been placed, there appeared instead a skull and crossbones. Calmer heads persuaded Green to return to publishing as part of the struggle against tyranny, and he later resumed publication under this banner headline: \\"An Apparition of the late Maryland Gazette, which is not dead, but only sleepeth.\\" Defenders of this newspaper's claim as \\"the oldest in the nation\\" say this brief interruption of publication was not a business decision as much as a deliberate political statement by a determined and courageous publisher. When Green died in 1767, his jobs as editor and publisher were taken over by his wife, Anne Catherine Hoof Green, making her the first woman to hold either of the top jobs at an American newspaper. A strong supporter of Colonial rights, she continued her husband's policy of operating an independent newspaper under the nose of the royal governor in Annapolis. Ultimately, she published the newspaper for eight years while raising 14 children. The newspaper stayed in the Green family for 94 years. Legacy Jonas Green's house, where the Gazette was published for many years, still stands on Charles Street in downtown Annapolis, marked by a small historical plaque.

It was established on January 8, 1996. The national park was created to protect the landscapes of the lake district in the southwest of Pskov Oblast. The park covers . Geography The southwestern part of Sebezhsky District, where the national park is located, is essentially hilly landscape of glacial origin with many lakes. The area is forested, with pine, spruce, mixed, and alder forests. The park occupies the southwestern corner of the district and borders with Latvia and Belarus. The center of the town of Sebezh lies immediately north of the park, and the southern part of the town is located in the park. Most of the area of the park belongs to the river basin of the Velikaya, and some areas in the south belong to the basin of the Daugava. The largest lakes within the park are Lake Necheritsa, Lake Sebezhskoye, and Lake Orono. History The area was populated since antiquity. In the medieval times, it was subordinated to the city of Pskov. People initially settled at lakeshores, and eventually also populated spaces between the lakes. Since the 15th century, the area was disputed between the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, finally moving to Russia in 1772, during the First Partition of Poland. Already by the 15th century the lands were extensively used for agriculture. In the end of the 17th century, the agriculture was in crisis, partially related to the Livonian War, and partially to the old methods used; it was slowly recovering from the 17th century. In the 19th century, timber production considerably reduced forested areas; fishery on the lakes was common. In the 1950s, many swamps were drained and converted into agricultural lands. In the beginning of the 1990s, the agriculture was again in deep crisis, and it was decided to convert the area in the national park, protecting cultural and natural landscapes. Fauna The park contains 291 species of vertebrates, including two species of lamprey, thirty species of fish, eight species of amphibians, five species of reptiles, 202 species of birds, and 49 species of mammals. Big mammals include brown bear, lynx, gray wolf, wild boar, moose, and roe deer. Tourism and infrastructure In the park, there are a number of huts. Recreational hunting and fishery are permitted. The part of the park along the state border with Latvia is included into a border security zone, intended to protect the borders of the Russian Federation from unwanted activity. In order to visit the zone, a permit issued by the local Federal Security Service department is required.

Headquartered in Bridgetown, Barbados and serving the entire Caribbean, the FDCC is the region's first indigenous foundation working in the ECD field. To improve the care environment for the region's youngest children, the FDCC prioritises access to good-quality ECD services (particularly for the socially vulnerable) and seeks to improve children's readiness (skills and knowledge) to enter primary school. The FDCC creates, controls and manages projects in several Caribbean nations. It also distributes resources as required. By targeting socially disadvantaged young children (birth to five years), the FDCC is different from other organisations working in the Caribbean ECD sector. Typically, other organisations and governments support mainstream, older children (once they have entered formal education structures). History =Context= Many young children fail to experience any structured early childhood programming in the Caribbean. Just 17% to 41% of children aged from birth to three years are likely to participate; this rises to between 65% and 100% for the three- to five-year-old age group (primary school entry). =Evolution= From 2002, an organisation funded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation and overseen by the Caribbean Centre for Development Administration (CARICAD) reviewed (a) parenting practices and (b) education in seven Caribbean countries with the aim of identifying replicable development models. The approach was regional and evolving; the intention was to share common methods between different Caribbean countries. This organisation was the Caribbean Support Initiative (CSI) which, in 2006, evolved into the Caribbean Child Support Initiative (CCSI) and, in 2011, evolved into the Foundation for the Development of Caribbean Children (FDCC). From 2002 to present, the CSI, CCSI and FDCC have sought to influence early childhood development (ECD) policies and programming, strengthen the Caribbean care environment, and respond to gaps in the ECD sector. The FDCC builds on the work of the CSI and CCSI. By early 2011, CCSI-supported ECD programmes benefitted over 10,000 children (aged from birth to three years) and consulted with over 3,000 parents. These programmes also enabled more than 200 young adults to receive 1,500 hours of ECD training (a new route to higher education). In one year alone, 50 Roving Caregivers achieved certification in NCTVET Level 1. =Establishment= When Bernard van Leer Foundation funding ended in 2011 (as scheduled), a real need remained for these initiatives. The FDCC was therefore established. =Operational history= Following its launch on June 27, 2011, the FDCC became operational in January 2012. Current projects =Approach= The FDCC believes ECD interventions must be sustainable, and this requires indigenous innovation. This, in turn, necessitates civic engagement (every level of the ECD sector must fully participate) in order to secure full recipient ownership (local ownership of programmes). The FDCC approach is therefore to help strengthen the ECD sector (its existing systems and services). No other Caribbean organisation takes the same approach. The FDCC offers three interrelated types of service: *Family and community intervention *Knowledge building and application *Advocacy and communications for development =Roving Caregivers Programme (RCP)= The RCP is an informal home-visit ECD programme which reaches the youngest children (aged from birth to three years) who lack access to formal ECD services. =Early Childhood Health Outreach (ECHO)= The ECHO programme integrates the RCP with maternal and child health services. It targets socially vulnerable children (aged 0‚Äì5 years), their mothers and pregnant women. It was developed with UNICEF, PAHO and the St Vincent and the Grenadines Ministry of Health & Environment. =Family Learning Programme (FLP)= The FLP offers a model for family literacy and family learning. It offers teaching and learning materials, a training programme and a practitioner toolkit. =Youth and Community Advocacy Network (YouCAN) = Launched in 2010, YouCAN is a volunteer network of young people who seek community-level support for good- quality ECD and family support services. =Technical Programming Management Support= To support culturally relevant ECD solutions for the Caribbean, raise quality standards, and build indigenous ECD capacity, the FDCC provides: *Technical advice on ECD, social development and health issues *ECD policy and programming support (design, implementation and evaluation) *Technical programming management support in project management, research, community and policy advocacy, communications for development, monitoring and evaluation, training and follow-up References External links * Category:Children's charities based in Barbados Category:Organizations established in 2011 ","title":"Foundation for the Development of Caribbean Children"},{"id":"36744737","text":"Bruce Gall is a New Zealand rugby league player who represented New Zealand.

According to the original submission to Ofgem, the electricity regulator, it will test new technical solutions to problems on the network and develop new commercial arrangements between the energy supplier and network operator. Funding The total cost of the project is ¬£9.7 million. In 2011 Ofgem awarded ¬£6.7 million to UK Power Networks from its Low Carbon Network Fund. UK Power Networks is contributing ¬£2 million and the project partners a further ¬£1 million. Geographical area of research According to the original bid submission a rural area of around 700km2 between Peterborough, March and Wisbech in Cambridgeshire has been chosen as the test bed for the Flexible Plug and Play project. There are said to be 9 operational wind farms in the area with a total installed capacity of 100MW; a further 10 renewable generation sites have won consent or are at the submission stage, with an additional 10 sites currently subject to scoping studies. This gives a total of a further 188MW of potential wind generation in the same area. However, the progress report of June 2012 says the potential has increased to 200MW. Apparently connecting these extra wind farms to the existing distribution network would be difficult for a number of reasons including voltage constraints, thermal constraints and reverse power flows. It's said that using a traditional approach of network upgrading/reinforcement would be costly and time consuming. As a result the research project will try out new ways of managing the existing network to accommodate this extra power without reinforcing the network. Smart devices The Flexible Plug and Play project, according to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network to improve its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement. 1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line's capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak. 2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system. 3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. It's said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations. 4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used. 5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid. IEC 61850 Standard IEC 61850 is a standard for the engineering process for the configuration of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), the structure and naming of their data models and a number of communication mechanisms to support the real time operation of automation systems. The Flexible Plug and Play project plans, it is said, to deploy it on the distribution network in the test area. Silver Spring Networks and Cable and Wireless Worldwide are quoted as being the developing partners.

The program was tested at smaller scales by various national security agencies, and is reported to be deployed nationwide soon, as of January 2014.  Development history  Security agencies were looking to build a system that could monitor Internet traffic on a real time basis due to the rapidly escalating threat posed by terrorist and criminal elements using data communication, which had brought service providers like BlackBerry, Skype and Gmail into the focus of law enforcement agencies. Two such systems were designed, one by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and the other by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), which is India's technical intelligence agency. An inter-ministerial committee staffed by members from Ministry of Home Affairs, Intelligence Bureau, Department of Telecom, Department of IT, and National Investigation Agency was formed to evaluate both systems and to select one internet monitoring system. NTRO's system was designed with the help of Paladion, an international private company and NETRA was designed by a team of 40 scientists from CAIR. The committee selected CAIR's NETRA as it had multiple issues with NTRO's system. It had serious security reservations about involvement of an international private company in such a sensitive project, and had doubts about NTRO's ability to operate, maintain and upgrade their system independently. Also, RAW, which tested NTRO's system was not happy with the NTRO solution and reported that it crashed frequently. The committee favoured NETRA as it was an indigenous solution involving government scientists and personnel and no component of solution had been outsourced to an outside agency. The agency testing NETRA, the IB, was also pleased with its performance. The committee further observed that CAIR has been continuously investing in R&D; to keep up with the fast-changing web technologies, unlike NTRO. The system was first demonstrated at the premises of Sify Technologies to capture the entire internet traffic passing through its probes.  Capabilities  NETRA can analyse voice traffic passing through software such as Skype and Google Talk, and intercept messages with keywords such as 'attack', 'bomb', 'blast' or 'kill' in real-time from the enormous number of tweets, status updates, emails, instant messaging transcripts, internet calls, blogs, forums and even images generated on the internet to obtain the desired intelligence. The system with RAW analyses large amount of international data which crosses through the internet networks in India. Three security agencies, which include the IB and RAW, have each been allotted a maximum of 300 Gigabytes (GB) per node totaling more than 1000 nodes for storing intercepted internet traffic (so, there are 1000 nodes x 300GB = 300,000GB of total space is initially decided to set up.), and an extra 100 GB per node is assigned to the remaining law enforcement agencies.  Users  The Internet Scanning and Coordination Centre will use this system to monitor the Internet, similar to the ones used by USA, UK, China, Iran and many other nations. Initially, RAW was the only current user of this monitoring system, but in 2013, the Ministry of Home Affairs recommended the use of a second NETRA system by domestic law enforcement agencies. This was done as the intelligence gathered by the external intelligence agency were largely irrelevant for the use by law enforcement agencies, and could not handle more data. A note from the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) stated that the system can provide access to multiple security agencies. Netra's deployment was discussed in 2013 by an apex inter-ministerial group headed by DoT, and included representative from the Cabinet Secretariat, Ministry of Home Affairs, DRDO, CAIR, Intelligence Bureau, C-DoT and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).  Awards and recognition  DRDO Scientist Dr. G. Athithan of CAIR and his team were awarded the 'Agni award for excellence in self-reliance 2008' for developing NETRA. The team comprised scientists from Indian Institute of Science, G.Ravindra and Rahul M. Kharge.

Her work often consists of installations. Biography Susana Rodr√≠guez was born in Guadalajara, M√©xico in 1980. She attended the University of Guadalajara, where she studied visual arts. She was a founding member of the Colectivo de Acci√≥n y Creaci√≥n Art√≠stica (Collective of Action and Artistic Creation). In 2006-2007 FONCA (Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes - National Fund for Culture and the Arts) awarded her a grant for young creators. Work In 2008 Rodr√≠guez held a solo exhibition at the Museo Ra√∫l Anguiano in Guadalajara called El d√≠a de la langosta (The day of the locust). The theme of the show was the destructive power of humans, and the way in which a small action such as killing a fly can trigger effects in distant regions. It draws on Chaos theory and the Chinese proverb that the flapping wings of a butterfly can be felt across the world, and also has religious undertones. The exhibition attempts the difficult task of depicting the moment of destruction and what happens as a result. It starts with a car that has crashed into a huge tree, represented by an acrylic painting on one wall of the room. It continues with a collage showing the tiny figures of angels and cherubs who live with birds and wild animals, and moves on to a dark room where a fly is hovering in video format. The artist chose the title because a locust is a very passive and quiet creature, but turns into a savage beast when its habitat is disturbed, causing further destruction in a domino effect. A critic has described the work as \\"silent poetry\\", using images rather than words. Rodr√≠guez was inspired by the flash fiction story El emigrante by Luis Felipe Lomel√≠ to create an installation named ¬øOlvida usted algo? ‚Äì ¬°Ojal√°! that opened in August 2009 at the Casa del Lago in Mexico City. This work explores the idea of a building that perhaps has been destroyed during a storm, but where traces remain of the time when it was inhabited. The outdoor installation is constructed of bricks, concrete, ceramic tiles and a wooden door. The work is ambiguous, leaving it to the viewer to interpret whether the building was destroyed, is in the process of being built, or is complete. The artist has said she addresses the dialectic between construction and destruction as an event that helps us understand and accept the transformation of life as inevitable. In July 2009 Rodr√≠guez participated with Emily Landon and Katie Murray in the group exhibition The Communication Consideration Coordination at the Kate Werble Gallery in New York. For the exhibition she constructed a \\"container\\" that combined sculpture, mural painting and cut vinyl to make a 3-dimensional scene that incorporated the gallery fa√ßade. She returned to the Kate Werble Gallery for the exhibition Pinch Pots and Pyramids (October‚ÄìDecember 2009), with artists Liliane Lijn, Sam Moyer, Ryan Reggiani, Halsey Rodman and Molly Smith.

The eight-minute production stars Callum Keith Rennie as an unnamed narrator who discusses his relationship with his partner, Frank. The two met while the narrator was a teenager and spent nearly ten years together. Frank has since been diagnosed with AIDS, and the narrator fears his death. The story was based on the experience of one of Hoolboom's friends at People With AIDS, which Hoolboom adapted after receiving a commission to create a short film about breaking up. Shot on a low budget, the work is shown in a split-screen format with interspersed scenes from popular culture, gay pornography, and human embryo formation; this format is meant to symbolise the \\"fragmentation of the body\\" experienced by AIDS sufferers. Produced by Alex Mackenzie, Frank's Cock was critically acclaimed and won several awards, including the NFB‚ÄìJohn Spotton Award for best Canadian short film at the 1994 Toronto International Film Festival. The script has been republished several times and has inspired a short on LGBT issues in Canada's native community. Synopsis An unnamed narrator (Callum Keith Rennie), who as a teenager intended to be the \\"Michael Jordan of sex\\" or \\"Wayne Gretzky with a hard-on\\", discusses how he met and fell in love with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a group sex session, they began an older brother‚Äìyounger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a box kite and cooking omelettes for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to Peter Gzowski's Morningside during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank ‚Äì having lost much weight and developed Kaposi's sarcomas ‚Äì has been diagnosed with AIDS, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with \\"I'm going to miss him. He was the best friend I ever had.\\" Production The Canadian director Mike Hoolboom was diagnosed with HIV in 1988 or 1989, after going to donate blood. In a 1993 interview, he stated that he felt himself working harder after the diagnosis, finishing films at a more rapid rate because he was uncertain how long he would live. Hoolboom also became \\"fascinated with a body of parts spliced and spliced again\\", experimenting with \\"interruptive rhythms\\" as a way to reexamine simple acts.; Having previously focused on films about the body, Hoolboom began dealing heavily with fragmentation, HIV/AIDS, and situations faced by those with the virus; Frank's Cock was his first venture directly addressing the AIDS issue.; ; Mike Hoolboom, creator of Frank's Cock While living in Vancouver, Hoolboom joined the local People With AIDS (PWA) group. There he befriended a man (Joey in some sources, Alan in others) whose partner was dying of AIDS. Upon his friend's suggestion, Hoolboom began work on a script for \\"a real movie\\": one which portrayed an AIDS patient as full of love, not one that showed the patient's friends abandoning him. The friend was, however, unwilling to appear in the film.; In writing the script Hoolboom tried to keep elements of humour; he later said that the humour was necessary as the source had insisted \\"most of our relationship was incredibly joyous and happy and a good time\\". After receiving a commission to make a short film for the Vancouver-based cooperative Cineworks, Hoolboom began working on realising the script with a low budget and limited amount of 16 mm film from the National Film Board of Canada; he was one of seven artists commissioned to \\"spark local production\\" with short films on breakup, which were ultimately included in the omnibus Breaking Up.; Rennie ‚Äì at that time a relative unknown ‚Äì agreed to deliver the monologue. Hoolboom was pleased with the results, writing that Rennie presented the monologue as if \\"he'd been living this story all along.\\"; The majority of the technical work, including direction, cinematography, and editing, was handled by Hoolboom; Alex Mackenzie, working for Cineworks, produced the film.; Part of the terms of his grant were that Hoolboom was allowed a limited number of edits (one or three). After pondering how to complete the film under such terms, Hoolboom chose to use no edits. He recorded previously edited footage, some appropriated from various sources, through a hole in a piece of cardboard, producing a single quadrant; he repeated this process three times, using the same film, which resulted in four quadrants with four different images. Production was completed by early 1993, and in screenings Frank's Cock was marketed as an \\"extremely explicit\\" experimental film. Although societal awareness of AIDS had developed at a slower pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985.; However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community. Style A scene from the film, depicting the use of each quadrant; the split screen effect has been described as evoking the physical effects of AIDS. Frank's Cock divides the screen into quadrants, with the majority of the film focusing on the upper-right corner of the screen. In this panel, Rennie's character gives a monologue, which is sometimes illustrated by images in other panels: the lower-right panel flashes scenes of hardcore gay pornography, the upper-left shows scenes representing human embryo formation, while the lower-left flashes excerpts from popular art. Aside from the original footage of Rennie, the short appropriated clips from the Nova episode \\"The Miracle of Life\\", the gay pornographic film The Best of Blondes, and the music video for Madonna's 1992 song \\"Erotica\\".; The effect was later reused in Hoolboom's 1997 short Positiv. Janis Cole, writing for Point of View, described the split-screen effect as supporting the text while \\"creating an optical treatment purposefully grounded in both dream and reality\\", as elements show out of sync. Jeff Rush and Cynthia Baughman, writing in the Journal of Film and Video, described the film as showing that \\"text can reverse the traditional balance of words = abstractions/images = the concrete\\" through the creation of vivid, perhaps disturbing, word pictures which serve as tangible images contrasted with the faint abstractions which are the actual images. Jack Rusholme, prefacing a retrospective of Hoolboom's works by Experimenta Media Arts, wrote that the split-screen evokes the effects of AIDS, in which \\"the body [is] broken into dispersed vantages\\", while the narration serves to \\"bind with words what this disease will render lifeless and inert\\". In a 1994 interview, Hoolboom stated that his intent was to represent the \\"fragmentation of the body\\" experienced by AIDS sufferers. Reception Frank's Cock has received warm critical reviews, both in Canada and abroad. Cole called it an \\"extraordinary experimental documentary\\" that is \\"as bold as the title implies\\" and a strong argument for the widespread dissemination of short films. Waugh placed Frank's Cock as one of a \\"great AIDS triptych\\", together with Hoolboom's later works Letters from Home (1996) and Positiv. The Canadian film scholar Darell Varga wrote that the film is an \\"emotionally riveting\\" eulogy to the loss of love. Karen Tisch, writing in Take One, found that the short built its emotional power \\"delicately but steadily\\"; she suggested that its Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) win was well-deserved. Reviewing for the Western Australian independent film magazine In the Picture, James Twentyman wrote that the film was \\"relatively straightforward\\" but strong and provocative, emphasising the \\"soul-baring\\" nature of the monologue. Rush and Baughman found that the short took the narrative voice beyond what is mainstream, demonstrating \\"the power of word and image\\", while Rusholme described Frank's Cock as Hoolboom's \\"most explicit AIDS narrative\\". The Swiss film festival Viper touted the short as expressing humour and sexual obsession in the face of a plague. Hoolboom has stated that he felt the film was accessible to both gay or straight audiences, which should \\"open them up to differences of form and why [one] would make something formally different.\\" Waugh suggested that this was successful, as in his experience audiences often cried at screenings. Legacy Frank's Cock won several awards at domestic and international film festivals. At the 1994 TIFF it won the NFB‚ÄìJohn Spotton Award, given for the best Canadian short film. The jury cited Frank's Cock for its \\"evocative images, ... impeccable writing and mise-en-sc√®ne, ... moving depiction of the universal human experiences of love and loss in the age of AIDS, and especially for its success in shaking our preconceptions\\". The selection included C$2,500 in prize money and a further C$2,500 worth of film processing. When accepting the award, Hoolboom quipped \\"Frank's Cock has never seemed so large\\"; Waugh, however, suggests that the title \\"caused more embarrassment than mirth\\" when it was read during the citation. Special citations were also read for Andrew Munger's Make Some Noise and Philip Hoffman's Technilogic Ordering. That year the film won a Golden Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival in Locarno, Switzerland. At the Ann Arbor Film Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Frank's Cock won Best Dramatic Film. The Canadian Filmmakers' Distribution Centre, which has distribution rights for the film, notes further awards at the Interfilm Festival in Berlin and Second Prize Experimental at the Big Muddy Film Festival in Carbondale, Illinois (both 1995), while Hoolboom records Frank's Cock as receiving an honourable mention at the University of Oregon's Queer Film Fest (1994). The script for Frank's Cock has been published several times, including in the script anthology By the Skin of Their Tongues and in the Journal of Film and Video (both 1997). The film influenced Adam Garnet Jones' Secret Weapons (2008), commissioned by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre in celebration of its fortieth anniversary. However, unlike Frank's Cock, Secret Weapons focused on an LGBT identity within Canada's native community. After his success at the TIFF, Hoolboom directed numerous further films, many showing a \\"fascination with its impermanence\\"; several, including Letters From Home, dealt explicitly with AIDS. Rennie, who had also received critical acclaim for his supporting role in Mina Shum's Double Happiness (1994), later became known for playing villains in Hollywood films.

The very specialised European network puts the three pillars of sustainability at an equal level: environmental protection, social equity, and economic viability.  Mission and activity  RREUSE's mission is \\"to lobby at European level for stronger policies in favour of repair and reuse of end-of-life products to avoid that products become waste too early\\". Additionally, RREUSE also \\"participates on social economy legislation with a specific focus on green employment linked to social inclusion and training initiatives for those most removed from the labour mainstream market\\". Therefore, repair, reuse and recycling activities within social enterprises should expand and develop across Europe. According to the statutes, to reach the scope of their mission the RREUSE activities include *the collaboration with other EU environmental and social NGO‚Äôs, networks and federations *to encourage and strengthen collaboration between the member organisations, in order to promote good practice, research and development activities, new initiatives and partnership in waste management; *to enable member organisations to exchange information concerning national and local policy, legal and fiscal frameworks in relation to re-use, recycling, waste management, import and export, social provisions, social clauses, public procurement, etc.; *to represent and promote the network and its activities at all relevant European and international levels. RREUSE also carries out international projects in cooperation with other institutions like universities and research centres, for example the LOWaste Project or the Quali Pro Second Hand Project II (a European project on the innovation transfer of a qualification profile \\"second hand\\"). In 2011, RREUSE received the European Week for Waste Reduction award for the campaign.  Origin  Between 1999 and 2001 the interest on social enterprises working together in the environmental services increased. Therefore, a couple of events and projects were set by a few organisations from the social economy sector. At the same time some organisations started working together on the forthcoming of the European WEEE Directive (which was adopted in 2001) as they were concerned about the impact which the WEEE-Directive could have on social enterprises working in the recycling and reuse sector. To create a more stable platform of discussion where organisations could follow political debates and unfolding legislation in Brussels on a more regular basis, we decided to develop a European network of social enterprises working in the waste sector in November 2000. Finally, 17 networks of social enterprises elaborated the constitution in Barcelona on 26 February 2001. Representatives from the European Parliament, from the Belgium Ministry for Social Economy and from the Directorate Environment of the European Commission appreciated the foundation of the network and expressed their general support. RREUSE was founded under the Belgium law with the status of a Non-profit organisation. RREUSE members are: # AERESS (Spain) # Association Citizens \\"Hands\\" (Bosnia & Herzegovina) # Associazione Orius (Italy) # BKN (Netherlands) # Cooperativa Sociale Insieme (Ireland) # CRNI(Ireland) # CRNS (UK) # Dobrote z.b.o (Slovenia) # donateNYC (United States) # Ecological Recycling Society (Greece) # EKON (Poland) # Emma√ºs Europe # Emma√ºs France (France) # ENVIE (France) # Herwin (Belgium) # Humana Nova (Croatia) # Humusz Sz√∂vets√©g (Hungary) # Kierr√§tyskeskus Oy (Finland) # Klimax Plus (Greece) # Macken (Sweden) # RECOSI (Ireland) # RehabRecycle (Ireland) # RepaNet (Austria) # RESSOURCES (Belgium) # Reuseful UK (UK) # Tramel Oy (Finland) # Uuskasutuskeskus (Estonia) In 2003 RREUSE opened a secretariat in Brussels.  Structure of the network  RREUSE has a non bureaucratic structure. The members meet 3 times a year working on the different waste streams, such as WEEE (Waste electrical and electronic equipment), textiles, bulky waste, bioswaste, resource consumption and product policies etc. Most of the work is done by volunteer members between the meetings. The coordinating office is located in the Mundo-B house, an ecologically renovated office building in the center of Brussels for Belgium and international environmental and social NGO's.  Funding  RREUSE is financed by the membership fees. In the first two years RREUSE received also some funding from the Belgian government to promote the launch of the organisation. Later RREUSE also received some funding by DG Environment and DG Education. Recently RREUSE has received funding from Fondation de France.

History of TEVA  Already by 1893 two favourable articles about vegetarianism, had appeared in La Esperantisto (\\"The Esperantist\\") ‚Äî both later incorporated into Fundamenta krestomatio (1903), L. L. Zamenhof's basic Esperanto reader: La hejmo de la metiisto (\\"The home of the craftsman\\") and Kio estas vegetarismo? \\"What is vegetarianism?\\"). A third example may also be mentioned: an article about the longevity of centenarians, which pointed out that a common factor seemed to be a largely plant-based diet. The publication of such stories and articles suggests that Zamenhof himself had a positive attitude towards vegetarianism. On August 16, 1908, at the Fourth World Congress of Esperanto in Dresden, Germany, the International Union of Esperantist Vegetarians (Internacia Unuiƒùo de Esperantistaj Vegetaranoj, IUEV) was founded. Several years later the group changed its name to Vegetarian Esperantist League (Vegetara Ligo Esperantista, VLE). Finally, just after World War II, it adopted its present name, World Esperantist Vegetarian Association (Tutmonda Esperantista Vegetarana Asocio, TEVA). Early in the history of the Esperanto movement, the language's creator, L. L. Zamenhof, published several articles favourable to vegetarianism. The photograph was taken at the 1908 World Congress of Esperanto in Dresden. The association was founded at the instigation of Ren√© de Ladev√®ze. According to the Enciklopedio de Esperanto, Leo Tolstoy (himself a committed vegetarian) agreed to serve as its honorary president. According to Esperantista Vegetarano (1995, p. 23), Ludwik Zamenhof was also among the 19 founding members but requested that this not be mentioned in their vegetarian literature. This information has not been corroborated elsewhere. Two days after the IUEV founding convention, the International Vegetarian Union (IVU) was established, also in Dresden, this latter group intended primarily as an association of those vegetarians who were not also Esperantist. J. Arthur Gill, an Esperanto speaker who was secretary of a Quaker group known as the Friends Vegetarian Society, founded in 1902, had suggested that the vegetarian non-Esperantists could hold their own founding convention in connection with the earlier event and that Esperanto vegetarians could attend both events and help international understanding at the IVU's convention through the neutral medium of Esperanto. In the end, however, only a few Esperantists actually attended the IVU founding convention on August 18, 1908. By the time of its 1913 IVU convention at The Hague, Esperanto was one of the IVU's five official languages, along with English, French, German and Dutch. In 1914 the first issue of the magazine Vegetarano appeared, edited by Esperantist August Oskar B√ºnemann (1885‚Äì1958). From 1927 until 1932, the magazine was both a magazine for Esperantist vegetarians and an official organ of the International Vegetarian Union. In addition to Esperanto-language articles, it contained information about international vegetarianism written in English, French and German. For financial reasons, IVU stopped publishing the magazine in 1932. TEVA directors during the 38th convention of the International Vegetarian Union in Dresden, August 2008. Left to right: Francesco Maurelli, Christopher Fettes and Heidi Goes. In 1954, Nathan Ben Zion Havkin, founder of the Palestine-Israel Vegetarian Foundation, reorganized TEVA, which was further reawakened in 1971 by Arno≈°t V√°≈àa, of Slovakia (1909-1998). He introduced a principle whereby instead of paying a fixed membership fee, members could individually decide on the amount of their annual donation. TEVA maintained this system until 2008. In 1992 V√°≈àa was succeeded as president by Christopher Fettes, a Briton who had become an Irish citizen. For a few years a schism resulted, as TEVA had to reconcile inconsistent records of Italian and Slovakian membership numbers and donation receipts, and had also to resolve uncertainty as to who had been chosen as board members to represent those countries. The problems were blamed on the 85-year-old V√°≈àa, whose health had begun to deteriorate in the last years of his life before he died in 1998. The schism was eventually healed when the membership ended V√°≈àa's experiment, replacing his leadership through a loose collective of friends with a restored society structure properly governed by its constitution and by-laws through a democratically elected board. Among the above-mentioned activists or supporters, four have served as honorary presidents of TEVA: Leo Tolstoy, Ren√© de Ladev√®ze, Nathan Ben Zion Havkin and Arno≈°t V√°≈àa. TEVA's aims and activities According to its constitution and by-laws, the association aims to \\"promote Esperanto among vegetarians and vegetarianism among Esperantists... in active and friendly and active collaboration, with the goal of respect for nature and all living beings.\\" Its motto is Vivu kaj lasu vivi (\\"Live and let live.\\") Since 2009 TEVA has published the twice-yearly magazine Esperantista Vegetarano (approx. 40 pages per issue), successor to both the previously published Vegetarano and the Letero de la Esperantista Vegetarano supplement. Its meetings are not arranged independently, but are usually held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the World Congress of Esperanto. In addition, TEVA affiliates with other Esperantist and vegetarian groups. For example, TEVA members worked at the 36th International Vegetarian Union convention in 2004 in Florian√≥polis, Brazil, and at its 38th convention in Dresden, where the IVU and TEVA jointly celebrated their 100-year jubilee.

With representatives currently in 22 countries, the group is a member of both the International Vegetarian Union and the European Vegetarian Union, as well as being a specialized association affiliated with the World Esperanto Association, known by its Esperanto acronym as UEA. In 2008, TEVA started a blog at the photo-sharing and social-networking site Ipernity; in 2009 TEVA added a group of Esperantist vegetarians through the social networking company CouchSurfing International.

The ThinkPad Tablet 2 is a tablet computer announced in 2012 and released by Lenovo in 2013. The Tablet 2 is the successor to the original Android-based ThinkPad Tablet, and was one of the launch tablet devices for the touch-oriented Microsoft Windows 8 operating system. The success of the device has led to successor models, the ThinkPad 8 (2013) and both generations of the ThinkPad 10 (2014), also using Windows in place of Android. Launch In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ThinkPad, Lenovo held a large party in New York where it announced several products, including the Tablet 2. Although Lenovo indicated that the ThinkPad Tablet 2 would be available on 26 October 2012 when Windows 8 was released, it later indicated that the device would be available in December 2012. However, delivery for orders in December were not made until late January and beyond. Features =Design= According to The Verge, \\"It may be a ThinkPad, but this device is unequivocally a tablet ‚Äî a wide, skinny, thin tablet, more like a Kindle Fire HD than a MacBook Air. The all-black exterior is sleek but utterly ordinary, and its 1.3-pound heft is pretty much bog standard as well. It's certainly well-made, with comfortable rounded corners and a soft-touch matte finish, it's just not a particularly unique look.\\" The Tablet 2 has a magnesium frame and a black polycarbonate case. =Specifications and performance= The Tablet 2 uses the Intel Atom Z2760 SoC \\"Clover Trail\\" (System on a chip) platform at 1.8 GHz and has 2 cores with 1 Mb of cache. The Tablet 2 has 2 gigabytes of 800 MHz LPDDR2 memory and comes with either a 32- or 64-gigabyte eMMC. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 runs the full Windows 8 operating system (32-bit) from Microsoft and will thus be able to run any desktop software compatible with this version of Windows. In a review, CNET wrote, \\"Windows 8 looked readable and functional, both in Metro and standard Windows- based interfaces.\\" The Tablet 2 has a 10.1-inch IPS display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 400 nits, 500:1 contrast ratio and a resolution of 1,366 by 768. The graphics is powered by the PowerVR SGX545 graphics, that is part of the Intel Atom SoC. The Tablet 2 makes use of multi-touch technology for screen-based input (supporting five-finger gestures). Like the original ThinkPad Tablet, the Tablet 2 has an optional stylus (with digital pen functionality) for precision input, which can be stored in the side of the tablet. Lenovo also released a Bluetooth keyboard that can be carried with the tablet in a folio- style case. The Tablet 2 has a full-size USB 2.0 port for connecting accessories and another micro-USB 2.0 to be used for charging only (using the built-in adapter, though other micro-USB cables also work). Powered USB devices will not work on the full-size USB port. External displays can be connected using the mini-HDMI port. A headphone/microphone combo jack and a connector for an available docking station for the device, which included three full-size USB ports, separate headphone/microphone jacks, HDMI, Ethernet, and a 20 V power connector for fast charging. The following hardware buttons can be found around the tablet: Windows button, Power button, volume control button, rotation lock switch, reset switch. Models with 3G and 4G cellular data are both available. The Tablet 2 will have Near Field Communications, also known as NFC, built in. The tablet is also equipped with two cameras. It has an 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, and is capable of 720p video capture. The front camera is 2.0 megapixels. A mini-HDMI port is included for video output. A noise-canceling microphone is included in order to facilitate video conferencing. The built-in battery is a 30 watt-hour lithium polymer battery. Lenovo quotes 25 days of standby power, 150 hours of MP3 playback, up to ten hours web browsing, and ten hours of local video playback. Reviews David Pierce wrote for The Verge, \\"I like almost everything about the ThinkPad Tablet 2. It's a handsome, well-made device that offers excellent battery life, does everything I'd expect a tablet to, and does it all well. It even does a few things I wouldn't expect from a slate ‚Äì try running Photoshop or Steam on your iPad, I'll wait ‚Äî and even if it doesn't do them especially well, its ability to masquerade as a \\"real computer\\" is still a big advantage. At the risk of beating a dead horse, this isn't a replacement for a Windows PC like the Acer Aspire S7 or Lenovo's own Yoga 13, but next to the other Windows tablets on the market it's clearly the best option. It's also the best Atom-powered device I've tried, beating the HP Envy X2, the Acer Iconia W510, and others on battery life, performance, and especially build quality ‚Äî but they do have trackpads, so choose your tradeoffs wisely.\\" Mark Taormino wrote in a review for Examiner.com, \\"Windows 8 has been designed to operate on a tablet, and leverage existing Microsoft applications such as Word and Excel. Student complaints abound that the current tablets do not support Word or Excel, so are of limited value in education settings. This is primarily true in higher education where students write many papers, and use spreadsheet software. The standard, like it or not, is Word and Excel. The introduction of a Microsoft operating system that can run on tablets and can support Microsoft applications will have widespread appeal to students.\\" In a review for IT PRO Khidr Suleman wrote, \\"During our hands-on, we found the stylus glided across the surface of the display smoothly. The accuracy of the handwriting recognition software was also reasonable and it converted our scribbles into text in the blink of an eye.\\" He also wrote, \\"We found the device to be easy to hold and Windows 8 ran was smoothly. However, we did find there was a noticeable stutter when playing full HD video and switching between applications. However, as this is a pre- production model, we expect this to be ironed out.\\" In its review of the ThinkPad Tablet 2 theNotebook Review wrote, \\"The Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 is fantastic device when used as a casual tablet or business PC for a mobile sales force. The machine looks great, it's light and easy to hold, and the battery lasts all day. Users who simply want to browse the web or run basic productivity applications will be best served by this hybrid tablet, but those users also probably won't need a $740 Windows 8 machine either. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 targets an audience that wants more productivity options that what an iPad or Windows 7 netbook offer. However, with the machine's limited Intel Atom processor and integrated graphics, the device struggles to take full advantage of everything Windows 8 has to offer. Additionally, users who do not opt for the $120 keyboard dock will find the device's productivity greatly hindered.\\" References External links *PC Tablet Window 8 Category:Lenovo Category:Tablet computers Category:Tablet computers introduced in 2012 ","title":"ThinkPad Tablet 2"},{"id":"36745380","text":"Mayelis Yesenia Carip√° Castillo (born 16 August 1980 in Valencia) is a Venezuelan freestyle wrestler.

He is the founder of the black metal/shoegaze project Alcest and also the founder for the now-defunct Amesoeurs.  Career  Neige quickly started to gain public recognition for his involvement as a drummer and live rhythm guitarist for black metal band Peste Noire in the beginning of the 2000s.Neige declared: \\"I was only a guest in [Peste Noire] as I played drums for him [Famine], but I did/do not share his views at all. Don‚Äôt even ask me about the concept behind [Peste Noire], it is very complex.

Alcest‚Äôs Neige is like the basis of my personality, its essence: a joyful and quiet man who is a reflection of the music. Amesoeurs‚Äô Neige is more of an urban man who is completely lost, sad and anxious, not knowing his goals anymore nor his desires. He doesn‚Äôt know himself any longer since he has accumulated a great deal of frustration and unspoken vices.

Later he also provided vocals for Old Silver Key and Lantl√¥s and live bass for Les Discrets. In 2007 he was also asked by Rune Veddaa to make vocals on the forthcoming Forgotten Woods album entitled Intolerance Div. but this collaboration didn't come to fruition.Neige declared:\\"Rune Vedaa from Forgotten Woods contacted me last year because he looked for a vocalist.

It was built between 1888 and 1892 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. In 1914 the fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Namur. Andoy was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the fortified position of Namur in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. It saw action in 1940 during the Battle of Belgium, and was captured by German forces. The fort is now abandoned on private property. Description The Fort d'Andoy is located about southeast of the center of Namur. The fort forms a triangle in plan, and is one of the larger Namur forts. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif, closely grouped in a solid mass of concrete. Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Namur), with lesser protection than the front and \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Armament Andoy's guns included one twin 15cm turret, two single 21cm turrets and two twin 12cm turrets, all for distant targets. Four 57mm turrets with another eight 57mm guns in embrasures providing defense of the fort's ditches and postern. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight.Donnell, p. 17 The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort. First World War The forts of Namur Andoy fired its first shots of World War I on 14 August 1914. German fire first hit the fort on 21 August. Andoy was heavily targeted by German artillery from 22 August to 24 August 1914, hit by an estimated 450 to 600 305mm projectiles. The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Li√®ge, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Andoy was hit in the kitchen and magazine on the 21st, damaging their overhead protection. The 15 cm turret and on 57mm turret were put out of action. The utility plant was damaged on the 22nd, killing Lieutenant Tasnier and five or six soldiers. Heavy damage caused panic in the garrison, but the fort continued to hold out with help from supporting infantry. Andoy's remaining armament fired on German positions on the 23rd, but the 21cm turret was destroyed, killing seven, followed by the destruction of two more turrets. The utility plant was knocked out entirely, leaving the fort with no electricity or ventilation, and the air quickly became unbreathable. Artillery fire stopped in the afternoon of the 23rd, and the interval troops and three functioning 57mm turrets repelled a German infantry assault. Shelling resumed during the night. On the 24th, with the ceiling of the main assembly hall threatening to collapse. Commandant Nollet assembled his 215 remaining men, sabotaged his last functioning armament and surrendered at 1115 hours to the 11th Battalion of the German 32nd Infantry. The Germans occupied the fort from 1914 to 1918. In 1915 the Germans undertook an improvement program for Andoy and other Namur positions, remedying some of their faults. By 1916 the fort's latrines and bakery had been moved for better protection, the postern and main entry were reinforced, and ventilation had been substantially improved. The fort's concrete was augmented with additional material and metal supports. Fortified Position of Namur Andoy's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Namur, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 Protection was substantially increased and armament was modernized. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. Four 57mm turrets were re- equipped with 75mm guns, and new guns were mounted in the other cupolas, except for the 21cm turrets, which were not re-used. A ventilation tower was added at the end of a tunnel, that could serve as an observation post for spotting artillery fire. The area surrounding the fort was equipped with improved shelters for the interval troops. Second World War In May 1940 the Fort d'Andoy was commanded by Commandant Degehet. Following the opening of hostilities between Belgium and Germany, the fort fired on German aircraft without effect. German troops approached on the 13th, taking fire from the fort. Heavier forces, including armored vehicles, approached on the 14th. In the 15th the supporting infantry was ordered to retreat. That afternoon the Germans began to take control of Namur. The fort's air tower took fire from light artillery. Heavier combat took place the next day, and firing became general by the 16th. On the 18th Andoy fired in support of the Fort de Marchovelette, but Marchevolette surrendered at 2000 hours. On the 21st the Fort de Saint-H√©ribert and the Fort de Malonne requested support. Andoy fired its 75mm guns on the distressed forts, but they were overrun. On the 22nd German forces began a sustained attack on Andoy, supported by 88mm high- velocity guns. The Fort de Maizeret and the Fort de Dave fired on Andoy in support of the defenders, successfully repelling the initial assault. Some of the observation positions were destroyed by German fire, but enough remained in operation to allow coordination with the neighboring forts. Maizeret and Andoy were attacked on the 23rd. Dave supported the two forts, who supported each other. The garrison noted that the fort's eclipsing turrets could not rise fast enough to avoid being hit by 37mm anti-tank guns before they could fire. The attack intensified so that the turrets and observation cupolas could not be occupied. Saint-H√©ribert, Maizeret and Malonne surrendered, and Andoy's armament was reduced to one 75mm gun and a grenade launcher turret. The Germans delivered an ultimatum under a flag of truce, demanding the surrender of the fort and threatening aerial bombardment. Andoy's remaining weapons were sabotaged and the fort was surrendered by Commandant Degehet at 1730, receiving military honors from the Germans. The garrison was taken into custody and sent to prisoner of war camps in East Prussia. There were a total of four Belgian dead at Andoy. More than 300 Germans had been killed or wounded in the actions of May around the fort. Present The Fort d'Andoy is on private property and is not open to the public. It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II. It is used as a hunting ground and is in poor condition, overgrown with vegetation.Donnell, p. 59 References  Bibliography  *Donnell, Clayton, The Forts of the Meuse in World War I, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2007, . *Kauffmann, J.E., Jurga, R., Fortress Europe: European Fortifications of World War II, Da Capo Press, USA, 2002, .

Navarro (born 1955) is a Filipino-American conductor and music educator. He is one of the Philippines' most esteemed choral conductors. He is also a composer, singer, arranger, choral clinician, writer, producer, music minister, and book editor. Navarro is more popularly known as the former conductor of the Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club. Under his direction, the group gave acclaimed performances in international events, won top prizes in prestigious international choral competitions, and participated in the 2001 European Grand Prix for Choral Singing. He specializes in 20th and 21st century choral music, but is equally comfortable and adept in music of many epochs. An active performer of music from different eras and ethnic traditions, he takes an ardent interest in post-modern music, Southeast Asian music traditions, and global hymnody. Early life and education He was born to a musical family, the first grandchild to Dalmacio and Felipa Piza√±a, who were one of the earliest converts to Evangelical Christianity in the Philippines when the Americans came in 1898. He is the eldest of three children to Jose Navarro Navarro Jr. (1928-1980), a former businessman, stage actor, and orator; and Angeles Piza√±a (b. 1932), a mezzo-soprano, music educator, and choir conductor. His siblings are Jeriel David (1956-1980), and Arlene Grace (b. 1962), a clinical counselor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Joel Navarro's training as a choral artist began in his grade school years when he sang as a choir boy, first with Prof. Flora Zarco Rivera, who conducted his grade school choir; and then with Dr. Romulo Piza√±a, his maternal uncle, who conducted his church choir. He attributes his musical inclinations to the nurture of very musical parents and relatives who were members of the church choir. As a person of faith, he remembers his childhood days when his relatives would often gather to discuss and debate theological issues at the dinner table. He became interested in theology and the intersection of faith and music as a young boy. He became involved with the Inter-School Christian Fellowship, the high school ministry of Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, as the president of his high school chapter. He considers Filipino theologian and pastor emeritus Rev. Dr. Isabelo F. Magalit and Filipino cultural anthropologist Dr. Melba Maggay as his early mentors in his Christian faith. Admitted to the highly-prestigious Philippine Science High School on full scholarship, he was one of highly gifted young students groomed to be future scientists in the Philippines. Upon graduation from high school in 1971, he took up B.S. Mathematics at the University of the Philippines. There he became heavily involved with choral singing and became soloist, section leader, and choir board member of the University of the Philippines Concert Chorus, then under the direction of Prof. Reynaldo T. Paguio, a protege of Lloyd Pfautsch of Southern Methodist University, and a former Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Music. Tragedy struck in his family in February 1974 when his younger brother, Jerry, died at the age of 18. To help the family heal from the emotional trauma, his family moved to Bacolod City in southern Philippines. Finding a second home in the friendly airs and artistic endeavors of that city, Joel continued his studies at the University of St. La Salle. There he met Peque Gallaga and joined his theater group, Maskara. Navarro appeared in the lead role as Francisco Pizarro in the Peter Shaffer play \\"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\\" which Gallaga directed. The play was entered as the university's entry to the Iloilo Drama Association drama competition. The play won 1st prize in all categories, including Best Actor for Navarro, except for Best Female Actor simply because there were no female speaking lines in the play. Navarro finished a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of St. La Salle, Bacolod in 1976. He had a brief stint in Bacolod working as Research Associate at the Sugar Industry Foundation and as Math instructor at the University of Negros Occidental- Recoletos. Navarro then returned to Manila in 1977 and entered the graduate program in Mathematics at the Ateneo de Manila University as a scholar of the Fund Assistance to Private Education. He became involved with the Ateneo College Glee Club, then conducted by the great Filipino tenor, Noel Velasco. He was then invited to become Velasco's successor when Velasco left for Boston in 1979 to pursue a voice scholarship. While conducting the Glee Club, Navarro pursued a B.M. in Choral Conducting at nearby University of the Philippines College of Music in 1979. There he studied under Reynaldo Paguio and Francisco Feliciano, and earning his Bachelor of Music (1985) and Master of Music (1993) degrees in Choral Conducting. Paguio was his college conductor at the University of the Philippine Concert Chorus. Feliciano was his composition and theory professor, and later became his administrator when Navarro joined the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music from 1989-1995. He earned his Doctor of Musical Arts in Conducting at Michigan State University in 2005, studying with Drs. Charles H. Smith, Jonathan Reed, and David Rayl. His doctoral dissertation was \\"A Style Study of Selected Choral Works of Ramon Pagayon Santos.\\" Prior to his move to the U.S., he took intensive conducting classes under renowned German pedagogue Martin Behrmann. Joel Navarro moved to the United States of America in 2001 to do his doctoral studies in music conducting at Michigan State University. He was subsequently hired by Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2002. He became tenured in 2007, and was promoted to full professor in September 2012. Concurrent with his teaching post at the College, he served part-time as Music Minister at Hope Reformed Church, Grand Rapids from 2002-2008. He served part-time as Music Minister of the Basic English Service at Church of the Servant Christian Reformed Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan from 2012-2014. He moved to Singapore in June 2014 to teach and administer the graduate choral conducting program in church music at Singapore Bible College. He is presently Lecturer and Professor of Music. Personal life He is married to the former Maria Divina Amor Pascual (Amy). They have three children: Katrina Rachel, a former English teacher, and works currently as a writer and content specialist in the Philippines; Paolo Emmanuel, an environmental graphic arts designer based in Calgary, Alberta (Canada); and Jerome David, a Civil and Environmental Engineering major at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan (U.S.A.). He has two grandchildren, Lucia Eliana and Penelope June. Career =Choral conductor= Joel earned distinction as a choral conductor during his years with the Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club from 1979-2001. Under his direction, the choir rose to national prominence when they won First Prize in the College Choir category of the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) in 1980. He led the choir in several European choral competitions from 1983 to 2001, garnered many top awards, and gave critically acclaimed performances around the world. He has also earned honor with The Capella of Calvin College. Under his direction, The Capella gave many acclaimed performances regionally and internationally. In 2008, he led the choir to two 3rd prizes at the Floril√®ge Vocal de Tours international choral competition in Tours, France. Since The Capella's inception in 1935, Navarro is only the fourth in the succession of full-time conductors of The Capella after Seymour Swets, Howard Slenk, and Merle Mustert. Dr. Pearl Shangkuan succeeded him in the Fall of 2014 as the fifth conductor and the first female conductor of The Capella. At Calvin College, Navarro also directed the Campus Choir which partners yearly with The Women's Chorale of Calvin College (Pearl Shangkuan, director) in the Advent Service of Lessons and Carols held at the La Grave Christian Reformed Church in downtown Grand Rapids. The third choir he directed was the Calvin Oratorio Society, a community choir composed of students, faculty, alumni, and friends of Calvin College. From 2003-2014, Navarro conducted the annual Handel's Messiah, accompanied by the Calvin Orchestra and which featured professional soloists. He is succeeded by composer-conductor Sean Ivory in both choirs. He currently directs the SBC Canticorum (a community choir) and the SBC Chorale, succeeding his predecessors Rev. Lee Chong Min and Dr. Virginia Tsai. =Educator= Joel was an assistant professor and a former chair of the Conducting and Choral Ensemble Department at the University of the Philippines College of Music. He served there from 1985-2001. He was also vice-chairman of the Philippine Federation for Choral Music, and was main consultant for the College Choir Category of the National Music Competitions for Young Artists. He also had brief several teaching stints at Santa Isabel University, FEBIAS College of Bible, and at the International School Manila. There, he conducted choirs and taught conducting, music theory, and I.B. Music subjects. He is regularly invited in Southeast Asia to give workshops and seminars in choral conducting, church music and hymnody, Philippine choral music, and choral music in general. In August 2002, he gave a lecture at the World Symposium of Choral Music in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His article The State of Philippine Choral Music Today has been published on the International Choral Bulletin. He contributed a chapter in Dr. Anne Kwantes' book Chapters in Philippine Church History. At Calvin College, Navarro was tenured in 2007 and was promoted to Full Professor of Music in 2012. There he has taught choirs, conducting, and Vocal-Choral Pedagogy. At Singapore Bible College where his current post began in July 2014, Joel is currently a Professor and Lecturer and conducts the SBC Chorale and SBC Canticorum. He also teaches graduate courses in advanced conducting, instrumental conducting, rehearsal technique, choral literature, choral methods, vocal-choral pedagogy, score study and interpretation, and conducting recital. Navarro also teaches for the Bandung Theological Seminary which, in cooperation with SBC, offers the Master of Ministry in Worship and Music Leadership. At St. Paul University Manila, he helped develop and teaches for the modular program for the Doctor of Musical Arts in Conducting which began in late 2017. Since he arrived in Singapore in 2014, he was juror for two Arts Adjudications for the Singapore Youth Festival under the Ministry of Education, two international choral competitions, and a national competition for church choirs in Indonesia (PESPARAWI). =Pop music= Joel Navarro had a stint as a popular singer-songwriter. His song ‚ÄúSwerte-Swerte Lang‚Äù was one of the finalists at the First Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (1978), and is one of the Philippines' most popular contemporary songs to date. He has also contributed to and recorded many popular compositions for \\"Papuri!\\", a project of the Far East Broadcasting Company which promotes the best Filipino Christian contemporary songs each year. =Choral Composer= He has a few choral compositions and arrangements published (see listing at the end of this article). His sabbatical project in the spring of 2011 was to collect and arrange 50 of the best-known Filipino hymns and translate them to English for use in the Filipino diaspora. With the help of Filipino scriptwriter Jacqueline Franquelli, the work, entitled SAMBA: Hymns and Songs of Worship, has been completed and is undergoing editing for future publication. Here continues to write and arrange anthems for choirs. The last one, \\"In God Alone,\\" written by Dodjie and Eliza Simon, was in celebration of 100 years of Filipino-American Methodism. He was also one of twelve members of the Editorial Committee for hymnal Lift Up Your Hearts of the Christian Reformed Church in America and the Reformed Church in America. Released last May 2013, the hymnal contains more than 900 hymns selected from thousands of hymns reviewed from all over the world. Last September 13, 2013, the magazine Worship Leader judged the hymnal as \\"The Best New Music Pick,\\" one of the leading publications for worship leaders and worship planners today. Recently, over 30,000 copies of the hymnal have already been sold. =Theater Acting= Navarro was also involved in drama, musical theater, and opera during his college days. He was Creon in Jean Anouilh's \\"Antigone\\" in a play directed by Behn Cervantes, professor of drama and theater at the University of the Philippines. In musical theater, he was arguably the first Joseph in Asia who played the title role in Webber and Rice's \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\" in 1972, a play directed by now famous off-Broadway director Loy Arcenas. He was also involved in many musical theater productions in the 70s which played at the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the Meralco Theater. These include acting stints with Lerner-Loewe's \\"My Fair Lady,\\" Webber-Rice's \\"Jesus Christ Superstar,\\" Leonard Bernstein's \\"Mass,\\" and Schwartz's \\"Godspell.\\" He also rose to become musical director in some musicals such as \\"The King and I,\\" \\"The Great White Way,\\" and \\"West Side Story.\\" As an operatic baritone, he played the role of Mercutio in Gounod's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and the lead role in \\"Eugene Onegin.\\"  Awards and recognitions  = Conductor = * Third Prize, Mixed Choir Category, Florilege Vocal de Tours, France, 2008. * Third Prize, Free Category, Florilege Vocal de Tours, France, 2008. * Grand Prix de la Ville Tours, Florilege Vocal de Tours, France, 2000. * First Prize, Mixed Choir Category.

Mott spent most of her life working in country houses with her television work not beginning until the age of 70 when her knowledge of a working Victorian kitchen was utilized for the television show The Victorian Kitchen.  Biography  Mott was born Mildred Ruth Pizzey in Yattendon in Berkshire, England in 1917 to Alfred Pizzey, a gardener. As a child she attended the local school, which was designed by the English architect Alfred Waterhouse. When she left school, at the age of 14, she became a kitchen and scullery maid for the Manor House, owned by the Waterhouse family. Mott was part of a staff of eight, with a wage of ¬£1 and 5 shillings a month. A year later, in 1932, staff cuts saw Mott leaving the employment of the Waterhouse family, finding alternative work in nearby Frilsham House. In 1936 she moved, this time to Lavington Park in Sussex, before circumstances saw her take up employment for Countess Iveagh at Elveden Hall in Thetford. In 1941, Mott took work at a house in Ashampstead to be closer to her parents' home in Yattendon, both of them now suffering from ill health. In 1942 she married Bill Mott, whom she had known since her teen years. Bill was serving in the British Army at the time, and they were married in front of a small congregation in the local church. They moved in with her parents to take care of them and Mott took a job collecting insurance premiums for Prudential. When her daughter, Bertha, was born, Mott became a housewife, only returning to employment in 1957 when Bertha was in school. Mott took an office job in the day, and catered for local functions in her free time. Bill died in 1959. Mott continued in her catering and office work until 1970 when she was offered a full-time role as cook-housekeeper at Basildon Park near Pangbourne for Lord and Lady Iliffe. Mott continued to work full-time at Basildon Park until 1987 when she was 70, though she did casual work for the household after this date. She died on 28 July 2012 and was survived by her daughter. Television career At the age of 70, Mott replied to an appeal, printed in the Women's Institute journal Home and Country, for women who had worked in country houses before the Second World War, especially those who had experience of Victorian methods of cooking. Mott described the methods she once utilized, such as plucking birds, skinning hares and using coal-range roasting spits, and was approached by the BBC. The BBC wished to build on the success of the television show The Victorian Kitchen Garden, which explored how a country garden would be run during Victorian Britain. The second series was called The Victorian Kitchen, and this explored how the produce grown in the garden, by series gardener Harry Dodson, would be cooked using Victorian methods. Mott underwent auditions for the role as the head cook and was successful. She was joined on the show by Alison Arnison, who took on the duties of Mott's kitchen maid. With no script and using turns of phrase, Mott spoke to the camera describing bygone methods of preparing and cooking food. She was a success with the viewers, who took to her stories and personality, and the fact that Mott, with her ample figure, strong Berkshire accent and capable abilities epitomised the positive stereotype of a county cook. Mott then found herself in demand with Britain's most popular chat shows and her fame spread when the television series was shown abroad. Mott contributed to a book accompanying the series, and in 1990 followed this up with her own book, Ruth Motts' Favourite Recipes. Mott returned to the BBC in 1993, becoming the \\"wartime\\" cook in The Wartime Kitchen and Garden. Mott's reputation as a historical cook resulted in her taking on the role as a consultant for Robert Altman's 2001 film Gosford Park.

Plot  The tale of eight mischievous students KD, Kiya, Ranveer, Panchi, Piddi, Samar, Juhi and Bobby. Their mischief crosses limits and in an attempt to regain the lost pride of Royal Academy and to help direct the enrolled students toward personal and academic development, the school principal brings in an old alumnus ‚Äì Anirudh Jaitley who was once known as ‚ÄúJunglee‚Äù for his mischievous behaviour. He starts The Buddy Project. The second season of the show focuses on how Ranveer, Panchi, KD, Kiya and Piddi adjust in the Imperial College of Communication after coming out from their comfort zone in Royal Academy. Once best buddies, they have now turned into sworn enemies all because of a simple misunderstanding. We can see some new characters in this season along with the old ones. The main new entries are Avijeet \\"Avi\\" Roy who is Superstar Chandan Roy's son, the cool dude of Imperial and the leader of the Dhakkan gang, and Omi Dahiya who is the desi guy and also the one who leads the Chillar gang. Both these gangs have great enmity towards each other and are always seen fighting. The other new entries are Avi's mischievous sister Avantika Roy who has a crush on Anirudh and Ranveer's radio station partner, Rukmini Sharma who is struggling in college as she doesn't know English. Slowly the buddies come together clearing their misunderstandings. KD professes his love for Kiya and she reciprocates. Panchi, Avi and RV, Rukmini also love each other. There arise many misunderstandings between KD and Kiya which get solved. Kiya's music video goes viral by a guy Joshua who likes Kiya. JJ organised a concert specially for Kiya. Joshua warns Kiya to stay away from KD. Her show is a success. Joshua's true colours are revealed and he is arrested. College plans to elect a president in which RV and KD are nominated. This again arises misunderstandings between RV and KD. Avi frames Omi into booth capturing. RV is elected the president. KD's dad falls ill and the buddies (excluding RV) decide to put a dandiya fest in the college. It goes successfully but KD's father's health worsens and RV admits him to the hospital.

Panchi starts a workshop for the poor yet talented kids and RV and Ruku help her. Ruku organises a puppet show on the day of the workshop. Kiya's ad is out but KD doesn't like it. Panchi's workshop is a success. Piddi makes friends with the Dean and his old aged friends and wins a camping trip. He takes the buddies so that kisha (KD and Kiya)'s misunderstanding gets cleared and RV and Panchi realise their love for each other. At the camp, kisha reconcile. RV and Panchi get lost in the jungle and spend the night at the house of an astrologer. Everyone is looking for them. The next day while heading to the campsite RV falls into quicksand but Panchi saves him by pulling him out with a tree twig. Unable to express his gratefulness RV ends up kissing Panchi, witnessed by piddi and Ruku. Next day at college, Kiya tells that she is going abroad for higher education upsetting KD. He tried to stop her but in vain. KD later discovered that the music school Kiya was going to is fake. Meanwhile, RV and Panchi realise their love. Ruku leaves the college and KD proves Kiya that the academy was fake. On new year Panchi professes her love. Then comes Harsh Vardhan Sisodiya. He is a lookalike of Samar and is extremely arrogant.

KD and Harsh develop hatred for each other due to Harsh's attraction towards Kiya. KD and Kiya plan to fake a breakup so that Kiya gets to know Harsh better. JJ organises a football match between Harsh and KD. During the match KD hurts his ankle due to Harsh. Panchi starts a mission 'Kill Harsh With Kindness'. The next day the a few students tell RV to resign from the president post and so he does just for Harsh. Piddi also apologises to Harsh and later Panchi is selected as the new president. JJ is kidnapped by a few miscreants while he was trying to save Harsh. They threaten the buddies to give Harsh and take JJ. They set to Jodhpur. Panchi is kidnapped unknowingly by a girl called Sheeba. When Harsh comes to know about the buddies' plan he runs, but is caught by KD. RV finds Panchi and is delighted. Kiya does not want to hand Harsh over to the kidnappers. So KD makes a plan to save both Jaitley and Harsh. The plan is a success but the kidnappers catch them and threaten to kill the buddies but due to KD and Sheeba's cleverness they escape. In this process KD and Harsh become friends. Sheeba also joins imperial. Next day at college Sheeba's dad comes tries to take Sheeba with him, but she reveals that she loves Piddi and wants to marry him. Her dad agrees after a small test.

It was being developed by the now-closed video game studio Victory Games for Microsoft Windows. The game was set to use the Frostbite 3 engine and would have introduced downloadable content to the series. It was supposed to be the first game in the series to be developed by Victory Games, making them the series' third developer after Westwood Studios and EA Los Angeles. Command & Conquer would have been available exclusively on Electronic Arts' Origin distribution service. The game was originally announced as Command & Conquer: Generals 2, a direct sequel to 2003's Command & Conquer: Generals. It was then re-purposed in August 2012 as what would have been the first in a series of free-to-play games set in the Command & Conquer universe. The skirmish multiplayer platform was slated for release for free around Christmas 2013, with 'pay per play' campaign missions releasing by Q1 2014. However, on October 29, 2013, EA ceased development of Command & Conquer and shut down Victory Games, citing negative feedback over the economy-based experience as a reason.Victory Games. (October 29, 2013) \\"A new future for Command and Conquer\\" Victory Studios, Retrieved October 29, 2013.McWhertor, Michael. (October 29, 2013) \\"EA cancels Command & Conquer, closes development studio\\", Polygon. Retrieved October 29, 2013. However, shortly after the cancellation announcement, an unidentified Victory Games staff member posted on the official forums, in the area reserved for players with access to the alpha builds, and stated that the reason for the game's cancellation was \\"corporate shenanigans\\" and not negative reception. The staff member also claimed that the official cancellation announcement was pre-written by higher-level staff at Electronic Arts. Gameplay Previously, Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight drastically changed the original game's formula in certain areas, such as the removal of base building and the addition of population caps (changes which were poorly received.) Command & Conquer (2013) would have returned to its original roots. Along with classic staples such as base building and resource collection, there would have been the usual amounts of orchestrating and commanding large armies. The game would have also introduced oil and natural gas (or coal) as primary resources, as well as \\"base proxy\\" tactic in which one faction must have \\"captured\\" a resource stash before letting its harvesters in. =Factions= The game would have featured three unique factions: European Union (EU), Global Liberation Army (GLA) and Asia- Pacific Alliance (APA). A downloadable campaign was planned to be released for each of them, excluding the tutorial, which would have been free. In mid-2013 the website has also revealed information about the likely return of \\"hero units\\" from the first Generals game, including Jarmen Kell and Black Lotus. Synopsis Command & Conquer is set in 2023, ten years after the events of Command & Conquer: Generals ‚Äì Zero Hour. After the United States lost much of its global influence and adopted an isolationist policy, the People's Republic of China became the dominant world power as it strengthened its military power and sought closer relations with the European Union. They would come together to form the Eurasian Unity League to replace the US-led NATO. However, as relations between China and the EU worsened, the Eurasian Unity League dissolved. China, along with multiple East Asian nations form the Asia-Pacific Alliance, which soon became a global superpower. Meanwhile, the EU, determined not to be dictated to by any foreign power, unified the militaries of its member states and began rapidly expanding and militarising. Soon, the EU became the most technologically powerful faction in the world, replacing the declining United States. As the EU continued to rise as a superpower, further straining relations between the EU and China, leading to the fragmentation and eventual dissolution of the League. Furthermore, their expansionist agenda has led to nations becoming EU satellites and dictators having the backing of the EU, with the China-dominated APA becoming increasingly concerned by the EU's policies. Meanwhile, a series of increasingly bloody uprisings have torn key APA and EU satellite nations asunder. Rumors point to a newly reconstituted Global Liberation Army as the instigator, but witnesses have described technology far beyond the reach of any normal terrorist organization. Concerned, the APA dispatches an elite force to infiltrate the latest, most volatile rebellion, one targeting an EU backed dictator. Their mission - learn the truth about the new GLA, undermine the EU and restore peace to the globe. Development Victory Games logo =As Generals 2= After the release of Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, much of the Command & Conquer team, within EA Los Angeles, was laid off in 2010 causing the future of the series to be cast in doubt. In October 2010, a senior vice-president from Electronic Arts had told the media that the Command & Conquer series would live on as a brand from Dead Space developers, Visceral Games, with a title from the series to be released by that developer being \\"far-off\\" and whether or not he was referring to this game is not clear. The first official announcement of a new Command & Conquer game in development, came in February 2011 when Electronic Arts announced the formation of a new studio known as Victory Games. In the studios' first Q&A; session with the official Command & Conquer blog, openly announced that they were developing a new title in the Command & Conquer series with the studios' general focus being on the future of the series. The new studio consisted of members from the previous EA Los Angeles development team as well as some new staff members. Its general manager was Jon Van Caneghem from Trion Worlds. The game's formal announcement was then teased as a game from the \\"next big BioWare franchise\\" and was due for a revealing at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards. The game was then speculated to be either a new game from defunct studio, Pandemic's Mercenaries series, or a new game from the Command & Conquer series, which turned out to be an accurate analysis. Subsequently, more rumors began to indicate that the game was indeed a Command & Conquer game called, Command & Conquer: Alliances due to a series of domain registrations by EA for a game of that name, though this turned out to be a side project by Phenomic, called Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances. The game was finally formally unveiled as Command & Conquer: Generals 2 on December 10, 2011 at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards as a title developed by what would become BioWare Victory. However, in November 2012, the BioWare label was dropped and the studio was renamed to its former name Victory Games. =Change to free-to-play model= On August 15, 2012, it was announced that Generals 2 would be repurposed to a free-to-play game known as simply Command & Conquer. The official website also released a blog entry that said that the Command & Conquer: Generals 2 game would be called Command & Conquer. The content which has been built for Generals 2 would be delivered into the new C&C; game. Following the negative reaction from series fans that Command & Conquer would not have a single-player campaign, EA President Frank Gibeau stated that a single-player storyline would still be a possibility. \\"The beauty of free-to-play is that we can adjust and adapt to what we're hearing as opposed to, 'I'm sorry, it's two months from ship and it is what it is.' It's a very different model because you don't have to build as much. You build in response to your audience.\\" It was later revealed that the game would have a single-player campaign. =Promotion and cancellation= From then on, news of the upcoming game was relatively quiet. In mid-December 2012, Victory Games hosted a C&C; Community Summit where select members were invited and given the chance to play the game and share feedback with the developers. It was later on that Victory Games announced the third faction as the Asian- Pacific Alliance. In May EA released a development video diary stating the developers' intention to constantly improve on the final product based on the players' feedback. At E3 2013, EA released a new trailer of the game as well as the beta going live in the summer. On August 5, 2013, a second development video diary was released showing the design process of modifying the GLA Bomb Truck unit from Command & Conquer: Generals into the GLA Nuke Truck. Victory Games also released wallpapers of the generals of each faction, starting with the APA generals and later the EU and GLA within a few days of each other. Both EA and Victory Games stated that Command and Conquer would be showcased at Cologne's Gamescom 2013. In addition to the press conference, a trailer revealed that campaign missions were to be made available in 2014. The game has been canceled as of October 29, 2013 due to negative fan feedback over an economy-based, multiplayer experience. The cancellation statement released by the company cited multiplayer for Command & Conquer being its downfall. =Resurrection= In November 2013, EA announced the game will still be developed by a new game studio, and customers who bought the Command & Conquer Ultimate Collection will still receive an invite to the beta. In 2014, EA was looking for a new developer of the reboot. No information relating to the game has since been released, leading to the possibility that the project has in fact been abandoned.

The mirror, ornamented on one side and polished on the other, may be made of bronze, brass or copper. Toli are traditionally worn as part of a shaman's attire around the shaman's neck, or in quantity on the shaman's kaftan or apron - often called their armour as these pieces of ritual clothing help to protect the shaman from hostile spirit attack. Toli help ward off harmful or attacking spirits in their own right, and also can be thought of as an object which signifies the shaman's authority or role. Toils have additional purposes as well, for example, amongst the Daur people and all the other shamanistic groups who use them, they are used for a variety of practices, including to purifying and empowering water or vodka, collecting and trapping hostile spirits, and providing a home for helper spirits. They also act as vessels for spiritual power - called 'wind horse' in Mongolia - which is the shaman's power. They can also collect and store the power of blessings, or power given from the sun, moon, stars or other parts of Creation, all of which can be given to a sick person, or which can be added to the shaman's own power. Walther Heissig, describing shamans and their incantations in Hure Banner in the 1940s, remarks that one shamaness indicated that the toli contained \\"the white horses of the shamans\\"; the mirror itself was seen as a vehicle for the shamans. Toli may be used in different sizes; among the Daur, the front and back of the shaman's costume was covered with small toli placed like overlapping scales while the front might also feature eight large mirrors and one medium-sized mirror to protect the heart, the neker-toli; according to Heissig, in Hure Banner shamans wore nine mirrors, nine being a particularly meaningful number in Mongolian religion and mythology. The neker-toli might be plated in nickel. The number of toli collected by the Daur shaman was an indicator of his or her level of power.

History The Bethel Inn main entrance The main inn building opened in 1913. and many of its early guests were patients of Dr. John George Gehring, to whom the Inn was dedicated. A pioneer of combining psychological and physical therapies, his wealthy patients came from all over New England and the Midwest. As the business expanded with added buildings, recreational guests came ‚Äúfor the season‚Äù to enjoy the seclusion of Bethel and the cool mountain air of the nearby mountain range. As vacationing habits changed, the Inn struggled mightily under a succession of owners until February 22, 1979 when the banks stepped in and closed its doors. Advertising executive, Richard D. Rasor, bought the property in May, 1979, hoping to apply modern communications and marketing practices to revive and expand the property. In 1986 a $7,500,000 construction project began, adding 100 acres, new traditional guest rooms, 53 luxury condominiums, a golf course expansion to 18 holes, a conference center and health club with an outdoor, year-round heated pool. =Present day= Reborn since closing in 1979, the resort has 150 guest rooms, hosting 59,000 guest-overnights a year.

In 1994 he decided to dedicate himself full-time to the creation of his own paintings and after an initial foray with landscapes and portraits, Bernardi started concentrating on contemporary still life and turned towards a kind of realism closely associated to photorealism. In 1999 Bernardi met his partner Raphaella Spence, also a photorealist artist, with whom he occasionally creates series of big sized paintings painted together representing social scenes such as crowds at football stadiums.Ville e Casali, Gli iperrealisti di Todi by L.

It stars Jack Whitehall as young teacher Alfie Wickers ‚Äì \\"the worst teacher ever to grace the British education system\\" ‚Äì at the fictional Abbey Grove School, in Hertfordshire.Bad Education, episode 3 At the time of the series launch in August 2012 it broke BBC Three's record for the highest viewing figure for a first episode of a comedy, which was previously held by Horne & Corden, but is now held by Cuckoo. The second series premiered on BBC iPlayer on 27 August 2013. A week before the television air date of 3 September, as part of BBC Three's plans to premiere all its scripted comedy programmes online. This experiment proved successful, as the first episode of the second series received 1.5 million requests prior to its television airing. A Christmas special aired on 17 December 2013. The third series of Bad Education began transmission on 16 September 2014. Due to its success, the show was later adapted into a movie, which was released on 21 August 2015. In late 2014, Whitehall confirmed that the show would not receive a fourth series.  Synopsis  The series focuses on Alfie Wickers (Jack Whitehall), a posh, newly graduated secondary school History teacher at the fictional Abbey Grove School, in WatfordBad Education, s1 or Tring,Bad Education, s3 Hertfordshire. Ever determined to impress his crush, Rosie Gulliver (Sarah Solemani) Alfie makes repeated efforts to appear \\"cool\\", such as coaching the school football team, organising a weapons amnesty and fielding a candidate for the school elections. Usually, in these efforts, he turns to his mismatched class for help, despite them often disapproving of his actions. They are teacher's pet Joe (Lawrence), tough guy Mitchell (Wernham), a wheelchair user rudeboy Rem Dog (Binstead), Chantelle (Runeckles), camp Stephen (Williams), studious Jing (Alexander) and outwardly fiery Cleopatra (Opia). At the same time, Alfie finds himself having to deal with the shenanigans of his eccentric headmaster, Shaquille \\"Simon\\" Fraser (Horne) and meet the expectations of a string of deputy heads: at first demanding dictator Isobel Pickwell (Gomez), then the ruthless yet cringeworthy Professor Celia \\"Pro Green\\" Green (Spiro), and then his own father, dramatically inappropriate Martin Wickers (Enfield). It is clarified in the final series that the entire show spans a single academic year.  Production  The first series started airing on 14 August 2012. On 23 August 2012, it was announced that Bad Education would have a second series. The second series began airing on BBC Three on 3 September 2013. Part of the second series was filmed at St. Michael's Catholic High School, Finchley, London. Bad Education was also partly filmed at the former site of Ashmount Primary School on Hornsey Lane on 12 and 13 May 2013. Scenes were also filmed at the former Salesian College in Battersea, south west London. Parts of Series 3 were filmed at Ricards Lodge High School in Merton.  Characters  = Staff = * Alfred Prufrock \\"Alfie\\" Wickerss2 e1, stated on driving licence (born 17 June 1988, portrayed by Jack Whitehall) ‚Äì Alfie is a 23-year-olds1 e1 History teacher at Abbey Grove School. He has difficulty managing and disciplining his students, some of whom treat him with contempt, is often harassed by them and is even bullied by one pupil, but frequently recruits them to help save him from difficult situations. His classes are eccentric, using teaching techniques such as Class Wars (re-enacted battles with tables as trenches and wheelchairs as tanks) and s√©ances to summon the spirit of Adolf Hitler in his lessons. Though he pretends in front of the staff that he fully respects school rules, he frequently lets his students break them and regularly breaks them himself. Born on 17 June 1988, he attended the posh Middleton House school, where he was often bullied by pupils and staff, which he is still troubled by. His pupils wrongly maintain that it was a posh, upper-class boarding school where homosexuality was commonplace. Before coming to Abbey Grove, he worked at a B&Q; home improvement store. He is poor at football and athletics in general, but is an accomplished Irish dancer, and wins the \\"Parent vs Teacher\\" race in \\"Sports Day\\". Alfie has a crush on one of his fellow teachers, Rosie Gulliver, and spends a lot of time trying to figure out ways to impress her, though he is frequently unsuccessful. By the end of Series 1, he had begun a relationship with her, but when Series 2 began, the relationship had been over for some time. In the first episode of series 3, he and Rosie are cohabiting, but she moves out after he wrongly accuses her of cheating. Alfie openly agrees that he does not know if his relationship with Rosie is over or not. He was disgusted when his father Martin Wickers (Enfield) started a relationship with his old flame and Abbey Grove's short-lived Deputy Headmistress Professor Celia Green. Alfie later learnt that Martin and Celia were engaged. Though opposed to this at first, he later accepted it, since Celia makes his father happy. He briefly felt sorry for his father when the relationship ends, allowing his father to move in with him, and annoying Rosie. But this quickly turned into a rivalry when his father becomes the new Deputy Headmaster. He is also shown to be a fan of Michael Bubl√© and was given his album Christmas by Rosie in the Christmas Special. He returns to his old job for one week because he finds saying goodbye to graduating students too difficult. But he is persuaded by his students and Rosie to return to teaching. He is often called \\"Dickers\\" by people who detest him, besides Mitchell, who ends up respecting him. Alfie's mother lives in Spain with her partner Javier and their children. * Shaquille Banter \\"Simon\\" Fraser (portrayed by Mathew Horne) ‚Äì Shaquille Fraser, usually referred to by his surname, is the headmaster of Abbey Grove. He is immature, irresponsible and generally incapable for the position which he held. He thinks of himself as intelligent and enjoys wordplay and metaphor, though it embarrasses his staff frequently. In the first episode of series 1, he shows some romantic interest in Rosie Gulliver, but does not pursue it throughout future episodes and series. On several occasions he shows that he is bad at communicating with parents and is insensitive to religious and racial issues, such as when he mistakenly believes England had instituted a religious items ban in the school and went around confiscating crucifixes from students (he confiscated a Muslim girl's burqa and apologised to her father by sending him a hock of ham and a bottle of wine), and when he said the word \\"nigger\\" to a black person, later remarking that \\"that word is probably best left to rappers\\". He was generally unfazed by such incidents and had a very casual attitude about them. He legally changed the spelling of his surname to \\"Fra$er\\", but it often appears on signs as \\"Fraser\\" or \\"Frazer\\". In the Bad Education Handbook, it is implied that he legally changed his middle name to \\"Banter\\", a word that he is obsessed with. In the Series 1 finale, he undergoes a review by the educational board when a video of him accidentally showing an inappropriate video to students goes viral. He retains his job, but admits in series 3 that he is no longer allowed to supervise exams. In series 2, he is conned for all the school's remaining finances, meaning that they are forced to make 'swingeing' cuts. In series 3, it is revealed that he lost all of the money raised in \\"Fundraiser\\" at the end of series 2 by investing in his own clothing range. As a result, one member of staff is going to be fired, but when Alfie resigns, he sells his flat so that Alfie could keep his job. He is continually undermined by his deputies and does not, with the exception of Martin, have a good relationship with them. In the final episode, he becomes inconsolable about Alfie leaving the school, hiding his upset behind childish insults. However while having does this, unlike Alfie he does not purposely put his students in danger and can be seen to care about them and the quality of the school. * Isobel Pickwell (portrayed by Michelle Gomez) (series 1 ‚Äì 2) ‚Äì Miss Pickwell is the Deputy Headmistress at Abbey Grove. She is a very strict woman who believes in rigid discipline. Alfie often compares her to an SS Officer and makes fun of her fascist views. She was deeply conservative and religious, with contempt for what she believes are Rosie's attempts to turn the school into a \\"hippie commune\\": during her own sex education class, she reads passages from the Bible to her students that forbid premarital sex. Her classroom and office are dark and bleak, with the only decorations being various pictures of dictatorial heads of state. She frequently schemes for more power, and nearly succeeds in unseating Fraser as headmaster in the final episode of Series 1, until Jing proved that she had been stealing money from the school by lying about her expenses. Alfie and Rosie blackmail her into telling the board that Fraser is an excellent headmaster in exchange for them not exposing her. In the same episode, she reveals that she has not cried since 1990 ‚Äì \\"when [Thatcher] was hounded out of office by her own party.\\" In Series 2, upon learning of Rosie's lesbian relationship with Alex Scott, she secretly confesses to having previous lesbian relationships and attempted unsuccessfully to flirt with Rosie. Although in the Bad Education Handbook, she (correctly) predicts that Rosie's sexuality was a phase and that she would soon return to heterosexuality. In Funeral, she is believed to have died after committing suicide over the abuse received from Alfie's class, culminating in her being covered in glue whilst being distracted when answering a staged \\"phone a friend\\". In her suicide note, she directly blamed Alfie for her decision. However, she revealed to Alfie that she faked her death in order to escape debtors and to live with her penpal, \\"The Beast of Bergendorff\\", a German dentist in his nineties who lives in Argentina. In the same episode, her ringtone is revealed to be California Love. She returns in the final episode of Series 2 and buys Alfie at a man auction for ¬£25,000, more than enough to save Abbey Grove. She reveals she became a millionaire after the German died and she inherited his fortune. It is not known what Pickwell does with Alfie after she won him in the man auction; but the only relating shot showed Pickwell riding on Alfie like a horse complete with saddle, while both were in their underwear. She never appears again after that. * Rosie Gulliver (portrayed by Sarah Solemani) ‚Äì Rosie is the Biology teacher and former interim Deputy Headteacher at Abbey Grove School. She is openly bisexual and was one of the few teachers who takes pride when inspiring and teaching her students. She is passionate about charity work, animal rights, human rights, feminism, and the struggles of people with disabilities. When teachers were asked to do a sex education class, she is the only one who leads an honest discussion of human sexuality and shows acceptance and patience of the changes that the students were going through. When mistakenly believing Alfie was raped by a teacher at Middleton House when he attended it, she urges him to accept that he was a victim and speak for all those who have had their \\"voices silenced\\". In \\"Funeral\\", Fraser asks her to become interim Deputy Headteacher, and, to Alfie's alarm, begins to develop similarities to Pickwell's dictatorial style. Her tenure ended with the appointment of Professor Green in \\"Valentine's Day\\". At the beginning of series 1, she breaks up with her boyfriend, stating she was too \\"physical\\" for him. At first, she finds Alfie callow and does not share his feelings for her, though over time she warms to him. At the school dance in the finale of series 1, she compares him to a student who really frustrates her, but has potential and is \\"perfect\\" after all, and kisses him in front of most of the student body. In the second series, however, Alfie is upset to learn that they are not together, and that she has formed a lesbian relationship with her former student, Alex Scott. In the fourth episode of the second series, this relationship comes to an end, and Rosie's feelings for Alfie return. She gets a job offer in Soweto in the final episode of series 2, but decides to decline it when Alfie declares his feelings for her, and she returns them. They share another kiss. By the beginning of series 3, they are living together, but she moves out after Alfie wrongly accuses her of cheating. She refuses to acknowledge the status of their relationship until \\"Prom\\", when the thought that Alfie will no longer be around shows her that she still cares deeply about him, and they get back together. * Professor Celia \\"Pro Green\\" Green (portrayed by Samantha Spiro) (Series 2) ‚Äì Green is Mrs Pickwell's replacement as Deputy Headmistress after Pickwell's (faked) death. It is quickly revealed that Fraser hired her because he thought she was the British rapper Professor Green, and she retains the nickname \\"Pro Green\\" in tribute. When Alfie and she first met, she came across as very friendly, but in reality she was just as strict about the school rules as Miss Pickwell was, with Alfie even at one point saying that he preferred Pickwell. Later in the episode, she ended up sleeping with Alfie's father, Martin (whom she went to teacher school with), when he invited her over to Alfie's apartment for a Valentine's Day dinner. She continued to act like a dictator, and continued her relationship with Martin, often tormenting Alfie with it. She became increasingly extremely obnoxious, pompous, sanctimonious and derisive, taunting other staff in insensitive ways. She also saw herself as a higher category of importance than anyone else, questioning why she should suffer for the school's 'profligacy', when she flaunted her own state of profligacy and ensured that she was the only person to benefit from the situation. In the Series 2 finale they got engaged. She is absent from the Christmas special due to her and Martin being on their honeymoon, but by the first episode of Series 3, she left Martin and took his money, causing Martin to live at first in his car, then alongside Alfie and Rosie. * Martin Wickers (portrayed by Harry Enfield) (Series 2 ‚Äì 3) ‚Äì Martin Wickers, n√© Martin Stool, is Alfie's father. His wife left him for a Spanish man named Javier. Martin started a relationship with Celia who went to teacher training with him and in the Series 2 finale they got engaged. He was absent from the Christmas special due to him and Celia being on their honeymoon, but by the first episode of Series 3, Celia and Martin had already married, and she had already left him, taking all his money. Martin has been living in his car and moves in with Alfie and Rosie. He got a job as the new deputy head at Abbey Grove. He eventually began a relationship with Frank Grayson's mother, implying that he planned to move in with and marry her. However, it appears that this relationship is over in \\"Exam\\" when it looks like a student accidentally killed her dog Coco while she was in Martin's care (Coco is shown to be alive and unharmed in his office after the incident, but it is never mentioned if she was returned). * Olive Mollinson (portrayed by Leila Hoffman) (Series 1) ‚Äì Olive is the Art teacher and Head of Maths at Abbey Grove. She was the oldest staff member, having worked at the school since at least the 1960s. She does not appear in Series 2 and 3. = Pupils = * Chantelle Parsons (portrayed by Nikki Runeckles) ‚Äì Chantelle is a female pupil in Alfie's form. She appears to be sexually promiscuous and this is often remarked on by both herself and her fellow pupils. She has an obvious crush on Alfie and frequently attempts to seduce him, as does her mother in \\"Parents' Evening\\". In \\"Valentine's Day\\", she had self-confidence issues, and wants Alfie to notice her, so she pretends to have fallen pregnant. She is jealous of Miss Gulliver due to her relationship with Alfie. * Jing Hua (portrayed by Kae Alexander) ‚Äì Jing is a Chinese pupil, who often speaks in her native language to insult Alfie (which he interpreted as a compliment, a question about 'English culture,' or a correct answer to a question). Jing appears to be the most intelligent and the most serious of the group and takes the register, carries on working while everyone else is asleep, and helped Alfie take down Pickwell at the end of Series 1. In Series 1 she is constantly frustrated that Alfie hardly teaches them anything, but in Series 2 she comes to Alfie's aid and comments that he is a \\"good and decent man\\". She helps Fraser keep his job by exposing Pickwell stealing money from the school. In Series 3, she undergoes a personality change, becoming much more moody and quoting various artists and writers. She reveals in \\"Exam\\" that her attitude change is not because of Alfie, but because of the pressure from her parents. She intentionally sabotages her Biology GCSE to avoid being sent to the university that her parents want her to attend. In the finale, she is believed to be the only person in the class who would stay in school to do their A levels, but she admits that she applied to a creative writing class in Paris. She helps Alfie one last time by convincing him that he is a good teacher and insisting that he should continue teaching. * Joe Poulter (portrayed by Ethan Lawrence) ‚Äì Joe appears to be Alfie's closest ally in the class, almost always calling him by his first name. He often helped out his teacher, having falsely come out, pretended his mother has a life-threatening illness, and cooks for Alfie's father. He is often the butt of jokes and pranks by other pupils, although they seem to have affection for him. In Series 2, he has a \\"bowl cut\\" haircut that is not fixed, and then in Series 3 he had a shaved head, but the hair slowly grew back. Also in Series 3, he appeared to grow in confidence and intelligence. * Mitchell Harper (portrayed by Charlie Wernham) ‚Äì Mitchell appeared to be the tough guy of Alfie's class. He often poked fun at fellow pupils and his teacher. However, Alfie would usually get his own back by poking fun at Mitchell's family life, commenting that he didn't know who his dad was and how he lived in a caravan. He is a huge WWE fan and he cried at the end of Toy Story 3. He had a friendship with Rem Dogg which sees them constantly making insulting comments about each other and their respective mothers. Despite not liking Alfie, Alfie describes him as one of his favourite students in the Bad Education Handbook, and they develop a friendship during Series 2. In Series 3, they get along much better after Alfie successfully helps Mitchell impress Cleopatra, whom Mitchell is infatuated with. In the second episode of Series 3, Mitchell left Abbey Grove after his father's fairground is shut down by the council. It is implied that he had moved and transferred to another school, but by \\"The Exam\\", Mitchell is shown in a youth detention centre. * Leslie \\"Rem Dogg\\" Remmington (portrayed by Jack Binstead) ‚Äì Rem Dogg is a pupil who uses a wheelchair and constantly wears a pair of headphones and baseball cap. He came across as a cheeky chap who poked fun at Alfie, and is very close friends with Mitchell. In Series 3, he became an emo and rarely spoke, going some episodes without saying a word, which could often lead to him putting himself in compromising situations: in \\"Strike\\" he spent 24 hours chained to the school gates. He becomes emotional when Mitchell gives him an impassioned goodbye, but is called \\"gay\\" in response, as a reference to the nature of their friendship. He takes offense when a teacher pretends to be paralysed, and when a careers advisory computer program said he should become a stunt man, then a male escort. In the Bad Education Handbook, it is revealed that he doesn't get along with his father, who is blind in one eye. * Stephen Carmichael (portrayed by Layton Williams) ‚Äì Stephen is a camp, gay member of the class. He came out in episode 2 of series 1 came out, when he offered to in \\"Sex Education\\" in order to aid Alfie's sex education class. That said, it was a well known fact to Alfie and other students, and he made no effort to hide his camp nature. This was best expressed in \\"Prom\\" when he ignored common advice and attended the prom in his drag queen persona. He has a passion for dancing, musicals and films. He was best friends with Chantelle. in the Christmas special may of began a relationship with Frank Grayson after they were both in Alfie's Christmas Play, \\"Robocracker\\" (a mash-up of Robocop and The Nutcracker). He appears to not get on with Frank in season 3, but Frank agrees to be his date for the prom and they are later crowned Prom King and Queen. In series 2 Frank gives Stephen a West Ham United ticket. At first Stephen was ungrateful and didn‚Äôt want the ticket because he said he was ‚ÄúMillwall for life‚Äù. He then finds out Frank gave him it so he decided he should maybe go. He often stuns people by being good at things that homosexuals are stereotypically believed to be bad at; including football and advanced martial arts. Stephen is shown to be interested in fashion and often makes that clear. Stephen is also very flexible and in a few scenes is dancing. They show Stephen is a very dramatic and funny guy, that everyone loves. * Frank Grayson (portrayed by Jack Bence) ‚Äì Frank Grayson, usually referred to by his surname only, is the school bully, who intimidates his fellow pupils as well as Alfie, having once stolen his shoes and on another occasion forced him to buy him and his friends cider after it was originally confiscated by Miss Pickwell. After Pickwell's departure, he was controlled by Professor Green. At times, however, he appeared to be insecure about himself, breaking down in Alfie's arms after Pickwell dies (not knowing she was actually alive) and exploring his sexuality in the Christmas special, beginning a relationship with Stephen when Frank buys Stephen a ticket to watch West Ham United. In \\"Fundraising\\", Frank had been held back at school, but had been held back so many times that he was therefore the same age as Alfie. In the same conversation, he was officially moved to Alfie's class. The same episode revealed that Martin moved him in order to avoid expelling him, which would have upset his new girlfriend, Grayson's mother, meaning that Alfie and Grayson could become step-brothers if they married. In \\"The Exam\\", Grayson and his mother have moved in with Alfie and Martin, despite Martin saying that he would move in with her. But this arrangement appeared to be over by the next episode. In the same episode, he finally bonds with Alfie for real. In Series 3, he appears to no longer get along with Stephen, but agrees to be his date to the prom and they are crowned Prom King and Queen. It is revealed in the final episode that he has an older brother named Dean who now works at Alfie's old DIY workplace. * Cleopatra Ofoedo (portrayed by Weruche Opia) (Series 3) ‚Äì Cleopatra is a female pupil in Alfie's class, introduced at the start of Series 3. She was aggressive and did not like Alfie or Mitchell in particular. She is black and was shown to be sensitive to racial issues, accusing people of racism at every opportunity, even when no such inflection was made. She accused Alfie of assuming she is a good sprinter because she is black when her name was drawn randomly to run the 100 metres in \\"Sports Day\\". She agreed to make out with Mitchell, but still did not like him. After Mitchell leaves, she began making jokes at Alfie's expense like Mitchell used to. Despite her hostility, she admits in the final episode that she liked Abbey Grove. She claims to have been to 12 schools, but plans to get kicked out and sent to a new one (even though she was no longer required by law to stay in school). = Guest characters = * Mrs Carmichael (portrayed by Hillary Whitehall (mother of Jack Whitehall)) is Stephen's mother who wanted him to leave Abbey Grove thinking it wasn't the right school for him but in the end let him stay. She is later seen attending Abbey Grove's fundraiser where she gets one of Fraser's band members in the Man Auction, and supporting her son at \\"Sports Day\\". * Richard Carmichael (portrayed by Delroy Brown) is Stephen's father who wanted him to leave Abbey Grove thinking it wasn't the right school for him, but in the end let him stay. * India (portrayed by Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a drug counsellor who came to talk about drugs at Abbey Grove but actually took drugs herself. * Kevin Schwimer (portrayed by Kyle Soller) is employed as a new history teacher in Series 2, who claims to be American and had many wild experiences that impress Mr Fraser. His short tenure at the school ends after Alfie and Jing expose him as a fraud and is actually from Dudley. * Mr Harper (portrayed by Sam Douglas) is Mitchell's father who works at a fun fair and rents out his stalls for Abbey Grove's fundraiser. * Alfie's Mum (portrayed by Frances Barber) is Alfie's mother. She left Alfie's father Martin and now lives in Spain with her new husband Javier. She appears in the Christmas special where she was told by Fraser that Alfie was in a car crash so she would come to Abbey Grove's Christmas play. * Javier Garcia-Ramires (portrayed by Jake Canuso) is the new husband of Alfie's mother. He appears in the Christmas special where he at first mistakes Rem Dogg for Alfie. * Bonehead (portrayed by Greg McHugh) is a homeless man who appears in the Christmas special. He was first seen at a soup kitchen Alfie and Rosie are volunteering at and later attends Abbey Grove's Christmas play. * Preet van der Plessis (portrayed by Harry Peacock) first appeared in \\"Self Defence\\" as a South African self-defense tutor hired to teach self-defense lessons at Abbey Grove. However, he was arrested for genuinely attacking Alfie and bringing dangerous weapons into the school. He later appeared in \\"Sports Day\\" where he is hired as the school's new P.E. teacher. Alfie strongly objected to his hiring due to the previous incident, and concern that Preet sought revenge against him. However, he asked Preet to train him to defeat Rosie's ex-boyfriend Richard in the \\"Parents vs Teacher\\" race. Just before the race, Preet cornered Alfie in the changing room and admitted that he hated Alfie for getting him put in jail. However, he realised that his aggression towards Alfie was out of frustration for not being able to express his romantic feelings for Alfie. During the aforementioned race, Preet tries to shoot Richard with a tranquiliser gun, but ends up accidentally shooting Alfie instead and is last seen being taken away by police. It is also implied during the same episode that he once murdered a woman. * Mrs Katherine Grayson (portrayed by Katherine Kingsley) is Frank's mother who appeared in \\"Fundraising\\" and \\"The Exam\\". She was very keen for her son to stay at Abbey Grove despite nearly every class not wanting him. At the end of the episode, she is revealed to be in a relationship with Alfie's father Martin. She has a pedigree chihuahua called Coco who she considers a princess, showing more affection towards Coco than Frank. She and Frank briefly live with Alfie and Martin for one episode, despite Martin saying that he was going to move in with her. This arrangement comes to an abrupt end when it appears that a student may have accidentally killed Coco while she was in Martin's care (Coco is later shown to be unharmed). In the final episode \\"Prom\\", it is revealed that she has another son named Dean who works at a DIY store that Alfie briefly worked in. * Coco who appeared in \\"The Exam\\" is Katherine Grayson's pedigree chihuahua who is considered a princess by her and receives more affection than Frank.she was accidentally burned to death inside a handbag whilst she is in Martin's care. * Richard (portrayed by James Fleet) is an ex- boyfriend of Rosie's who first appears in \\"After School Clubs\\". He, along with Rosie, attended the same reading club, which Alfie also briefly attended, where he thought that one of the other club's members, Orlando, was Rosie's ex-boyfriend but was surprised to learn it was Richard (owing to the age gap between him and Rosie). He later appeared in \\"Sports Day\\" where he took part in the \\"Parents vs Teacher\\" race. He did not appear after this, but is referred to often. * Dean Grayson (portrayed by Tom Davis) is Frank's older brother who works at a DIY store that Alfie also briefly worked in. It is also revealed that he also went to Abbey Grove and was taught by Rosie.  Episodes   American adaptation  A pilot for a U.S. adaptation of Bad Education, named An American Education, was ordered by ABC with Whitehall set to reprise his role as Alfie Wickers. The pilot began filming in Los Angeles in January 2014. However, ABC passed on the pilot on 22 May 2014. Whitehall would continue with the original UK series of the show.  Film adaptation  On 27 February 2015, Whitehall confirmed that a feature film edition of Bad Education was in production. Filming took place in Cornwall with the majority of the main cast all reprising their roles for the film. The film is titled The Bad Education Movie and was released on 21 August 2015 in the UK. The film saw ineffectual teacher Alfie Wickers travelling to Cornwall with his students. Entertainment Film Distributors, who also handled the release of the box-office 2011 hit The Inbetweeners Movie dealt with the release of the Bad Education Movie.  Reception  The series received mixed reviews from the British press. The Guardian called it \\"in poor taste\\" and accused Whitehall of \\"phoning it in\\". The Daily Telegraph gave the show a rating of 2 out of 5, claiming that the show \\"uses too many stereotypes\\" and that Whitehall \\"tends to repeat many jokes\\" rather than creating new ones. Both the Daily Mirror and The Sun gave the sitcom a rating of 2 out of 5. Despite this, the show currently holds a 7.7 out of 10 rating on IMDb, and a 4.11 rating out of 5 on SideReel from their respective users. Rotten Tomatoes gave 71% to Bad education, a critic said \\"The script is patchy and the story is too silly for its own good but there are enough laughs to make this a hit with the target audience\\"  References   External links   Category:2012 British television series debuts Category:2014 British television series endings Category:2010s British LGBT-related comedy television series Category:2010s British teen sitcoms Category:2010s high school television series Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:British high school television series Category:British LGBT-related sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows adapted into films Category:Television series by Endemol Category:Television shows set in Hertfordshire Category:Television series by Tiger Aspect Productions Category:Tring Category:Watford Category:2010s LGBT-related sitcoms ","title":"Bad Education (TV series)"},{"id":"36746085","text":"Inside the Polaris Branch The Montreal Children's Library () is a public library and nonprofit organization in Montreal, Quebec.

When she discovered that the librarian of the Fraser Institute, M. de Cr√®vecoeur, had set apart a section for children‚Äôs reading but lacked the funds to purchase books for it, Miss Murray got in contact with the Local Council (later the Montreal Council of Women), which had formed a committee to inquire into the possibility of establishing a children‚Äôs library, under the chairmanship of Maysie McSporran.

He is the CEO of Liquid Investments Inc, a San Diego beer distributorship. San Diego Padres Fowler was a member of a minority group that owned 49.32 percent of the Padres. The group, headed by then-Padres chief executive Jeff Moorad, attempted to buy the Padres from controlling owner John Moores for $530 million, but the deal fell through in April 2012. Fowler then replaced Moorad as the general partner of the minority group, and he served on the Padres executive committee. Fowler joined a new group to purchase the Padres that included four heirs to the O‚ÄôMalley family‚Äîwho owned the Los Angeles Dodgers franchise for five decades. Kevin and Brian O'Malley are the sons of former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley and grandsons of Walter O'Malley, the owner who moved the Dodgers west from Brooklyn after the 1957 season. Peter and Tom Seidler are the nephews of Peter O‚ÄôMalley. MLB approved the $800 million sale, which completed on August 28, 2012. As much as $200 million of the sale price included the team's 20-percent stake in Fox Sports San Diego, a cable channel that pays the Padres annual fees as part of a $1.2 billion, 20-year agreement. Fowler was named the ownership group's executive chairman and was designated to represent the Padres in all league meetings. He became the first locally based control person of the team since founding owner C. Arnholdt Smith. Under the Fowler/Siedler/O'Malley group, the Padres have signed 3 players to contracts that beat the previous franchise record contract, giving 6 years and $83 million to Wil Myers in January 2017, 8 years and $144 million to Eric Hosmer in February 2018, and 10 years and $300 million to Manny Machado in February 2019. Liquid Investments Fowler is the chairman and CEO of privately held Liquid Investments Inc., the parent company of former operating entities in California and Colorado. The investment group distributed Miller, Coors, Heineken and other beer brands and had annual sales exceeding $220 million. Other interests Fowler owned the San Diego Sockers, an indoor soccer team that won 10 championships in 11 years. He also chaired San Diego's first task force that selected a site for what was eventually Petco Park, and he chaired the host committee for Super Bowl XXXVII held in Qualcomm Stadium in 2003. Philanthropy Fowler and his wife Alexis have made major contributions to her alma mater, San Diego State University. The school's College of Business Administration was renamed the Fowler College of Business in 2016 in response to the couple's $25 million endowment pledge to the business school.

Ed knocks out Frank, unlocks the cuffs and flees, coming upon a woman called Cally tending to sheep, seemingly by herself in a remote cabin. Frank follows and identifies himself as a Utah lawman who after tracking Ed for nearly two years finally caught up with him. Cally is hesitant to trust either stranger. She is an educated woman whose father, a former college professor, is living with her but is currently away. As a torrential rain falls, Ed attempts to escape, but the passage is flooded. Cally tries to warn him, but pulls a knife when Ed tries to kiss her. At the cabin, Frank has no weapon and searches for a rifle Cally has hidden. Ed returns and, while trapped there during the storm, explains to Cally that he shot Frank's brother in self-defense, whereupon Frank had himself deputized but intends to kill him rather than bring him to justice. Cally's father returns and is startled to find two men there. He hears their stories and, aware that his daughter is falling in love with Ed, offers him a chance to turn himself in to other authorities.

Scrapped in 1960, she had eight sets of owners, managers and names over her 26-year career. She is known today by her sixth name, Armonia, which she bore in April 1958 when a CIA aircraft involved in a covert mission against the Sukarno government bombed and damaged her in the Molucca Islands in eastern Indonesia. Service history The ship was launched by Blyth Shipbuilding & Drydock Co Ltd as Tullochmoor at Blyth, Northumberland and completed in October 1924. She was owned by Moor Line and managed by Walter Runciman and Company. In 1936 she was sold to Franz L Nimitz of Stettin, Germany, who renamed her Brigitte. In May 1945 she was at Hamburg where she was seized as an Allied war prize. The UK Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) took her over, named her Empire Soar and placed her under the management of Sir Robert Ropner & Co. In 1946 she was sold to the Greek government, which renamed her Preveza. In 1948 she was sold to Synodinos Brothers of Greece who renamed her Danapris. In 1957 she was sold to A. Angelicoussis & Co of Greece who renamed her Armonia. In 1959 she was sold to Keanyew Shipping Co who renamed her Keanyew and registered her in Panama. In 1960 she was sold to Southern Commercial Co who renamed her Charlie. Later in 1960 she was scrapped in Hong Kong. Bombing At the end of April or beginning of May 1958 Armonia was in Amboina Harbour in Indonesia. On 28 April a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, operated by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, bombed her. In the same attack, the same aircraft hit and sank the merchant ships and . One source asserts that all three ships were off the port of Donggala near Palu in Central Sulawesi (at least west of Ambon) when they were hit. This now appears doubtful, as Aquilas wreck seems to have been identified in Ambon Bay. There is also some discrepancy over the date of the attack: one source states that the three ships were bombed on 28 April; another states that Armonia was attacked on 1 or 2 May.

Prior to that, from 15 August 2012 until 6 June 2016, she was Minister of State for Lands in the Cabinet of Uganda. Nantaba is also the elected Member of Parliament for Women in Kayunga District Constituency. Background and education She was born in Kayunga District on 20 December 1979. Her father had died in 1984 and she was left with her mother who took care of her with support from her elder brother (Samuel Kabenge Bamulumbye) the heir of her father. She attended Ndeeba Primary School in Kayunga District from 1986 to 1992, where she finished her Primary Leaving Examinations. However her mother and elder brother did not have money enough to take her to a very good secondary school so she joined Ndeeba Senior Secondary School for her S1 in 1993. She also moved to stay with the elder brother in Kisoga village, still in Kayunga District. Villagers of Kisoga recall how she used to be carried on a bicycle by a brother to school, about from their home, daily. In 1994, Nantaba's mother acquired some money and Nantaba was moved from Ndeeba SSS to Katikamu SDA SSS where she studied from Senior 2 to Senior 4 (Uganda Certificate of Education). She was after admitted at Mukono Town Academy for her A' Level which she completed in November 1998. On 26 September 1999, Nantaba was admitted to Makerere University, together with the brother who used to ferry her to school, for a bachelor's degree in tourism. She undertook an undergraduate student research project, \\"Medicinal Plants As Tourism Potential: Case Study of Uganda Wildlife Educational Center (UWEC)\\", which was supervised by Professor J. B. Nyakaana. Nantaba has a Bachelor of Tourism degree, obtained in 2003 from Makerere University.

In 2010, she joined active elective politics by contesting the Kayunga District Women's Parliamentary Constituency. She won the NRM political party primary by defeating the incumbent, Florence Naiga. In 2011, she was elected during the general election. In a cabinet reshuffle on 15 August 2012, she was appointed as State Minister for Lands, replacing Sarah Opendi Achieng. After weeks of protracted confirmation hearings, the Appointments Committee of Parliament finally confirmed her appointment on 23 October 2012. =2015-present= During the 2016 parliamentary election cycle, Nantaba lost during the primary elections held by the National Resistance Movement (NRM), her political party at the time. She quit the party, citing rigging during the primaries, as she had previously warned. During the national elections held on 18 February 2016, Nantaba, who ran as an independent candidate, polled 86,057 votes against Ruth Nakacwa, who received 13,184 votes. Despite having quit the ruling NRM party, she was appointed as Minister of State for ICT on 6 June 2016. On 24 March 2019, Nantaba was involved in an incident that led to an innocent person being handcuffed and shot dead by Ugandan police. Nantaba had wrongly thought the man, Ronald Ssebulime, had been following them on his motorcycle in Kayunga District. After a pursuit, Ssebulime was arrested, handcuffed, and shot twice in the chest by an officer. Officials initially tried to cover up the incident, saying they had thwarted an assassination attempt.

The screenplay was from well- known writer and aviator Frank \\"Spig\\" Wead and Arthur Sheekman and starred Anne Baxter, William Holden, Sonny Tufts and William Bendix. Plot Early in the 1920s, the four McDonald brothers are performing in a carnival as a stunt flying team, when they are hired by Mercury Airlines in Newark, New Jersey, to fly the national air mail for the US Air Mail Service. One of the brothers, Colin (William Holden), instantly falls in love with Lucille Stewart (Anne Baxter), the nurse giving him a physical. After less than a day, he proposes and she accepts. They marry and Colin starts flying for the company along the east coast. Lucille soon becomes irritated by the brothers' extreme dedication to their work, but Colin promises that his efforts will make it possible for them to buy a home. When the youngest McDonald, Keith (Johnny Sands), crashes his aircraft and dies, Ronald (Sonny Tufts) feels guilty over causing his brother's death, since he was the one who taught him to fly. He quits flying and becomes a car salesman instead. When their friend and colleague \\"Porkie\\" (William Bendix) is fired for flying recklessly over a passenger train, he also becomes a car salesman. The next brother to crash is Tad (Sterling Hayden). Even though he survives, he is unable to fly again. Colin's former girlfriend, Poppy (Jean Wallace), pays him a visit and tries to win him back, but he stays true to Lucille. Soon afterwards, their first child, a son, is born. Colin has promised to stop flying once he becomes a father, but when he is offered a raise by the company, he still continues to fly. During his first passenger flight, the wings ice over, and Colin crashes and dies. Colin's boss and Tad are the ones who have to break the news to Lucille, who is hosting their housewarming party. She decides to name her son Keith.

Barbara Stanwyck's singing voice was dubbed by Kay St.Germaine. Plot A deserter who had been an Army lieutenant, Jonathan Trumbo is hired to guide a wagon train bound for California during the California Gold Rush. When a woman named Lily Bishop is accused of cheating at poker in a saloon, farmer Michael Fabian invites her to join the wagon train over Trumbo's strenuous objections. Trumbo, too, accuses of her of cheating at cards after losing to Lily, an insult she promises not to forget. Lily leaves with Booth Pennock, a ruffian who injures Trumbo with a whip before departing. Lily ends up in Pharaoh City, running a saloon. The town is controlled by Pharaoh Coffin, a former slave trader who opposes the law and order of California approving statehood. Trumbo turns up and gets involved in a saloon brawl. Lily orders him never to set foot there again, but Trumbo wins the place in a poker game. She mistakenly takes Pharaoh to be an honest man and moves onto his hacienda. Coffin's men beat up Trumbo, who is rescued on the trail by Mexicans and vows revenge. When his wounds heal, Trumbo returns and becomes a spokesman for statehood advocacy. Coffin's hired men kill Fabian for similar beliefs, causing Lily to finally see Coffin for the crazed villain he is. Trumbo forms a posse and corners Coffin, who is descending into madness. Lily shoots him. Trumbo, in love with Lily, promises to return to the Army to atone for his desertion, hoping someday to return to her.

The firm, based in Davie, Florida, was established in 1995 by Dr. Robert Lewin. The organization is an attorney referral system for victims of motor vehicle accidents, slip and falls, work related injuries and recreational accidents. The Florida Trend cites the firm as one of Florida's larger for-profit lawyer referral services, and Biotech Week cites the company as one of America's \\"leading treatment and lawyer referral resources for people injured in auto accidents.\\" Background and trademark The company was established in Florida in 1995 by chiropractor Dr. Robert Lewin. In a 2010 United States District Court Southern District of Florida case it states that they provide \\"assistance to victims of motor vehicle, slip and fall,work-related, and recreational accidents seeking medical, chiropractic and therapeutic care and legal advice by referring them to doctors and other health care professionals, scheduling appointments, and referring victims seeking legal advice to local attorneys.\\" In advertising, the company is known for its phrase, \\"After 911, Call 411, 1-800-411-PAIN.\\" Their radio and television-based commercials usually feature actors portraying police officers or emergency workers urging motor accident victims to contact both a lawyer and doctor as soon as possible after the crash after calling 911. In 2011, the firm introduced an iPhone application which provides accident victims with the opportunity to \\"catalog and report an accident to 411 PAIN, including pictures of the vehicles involved, photos of drivers' licenses, insurance cards and license plates, and record any bodily pain you have.\\" Legal Issues In 2010, a class-action lawsuit was launched against 411 PAIN by Ganesh Sohan and Bryan Rodriguez that alleged that the company misrepresented the nature of their services and the compensation received by accident victims. The lawsuit states that instead of victims directly receiving the $10,000 stated in their advertisements, 411 PAIN operates by \\"secur[ing] insurance payments and reimbursement for medical services.\\" Sohan and Rodiguez's lawyers alleged that companies like 411 PAIN operate by referring them to clinics owned by the company, providing medical services that intentionally deplete the $10,000 maximum allowable medical costs that are covered by personal injury protection (PIP) insurance and billing clients for all other expenses. The lawsuit also stated that, at the time, they \\"unlawfully solicit[ed] clients... on behalf of lawyers pursuing personal injury claims\\" and \\"intentionally misled consumers into believing they are contacting a lawyer for legal services or a service that will explain to them their rights... when, in fact, they are contacting chiropractic medical clinics.\\" In 2012, the Attorney General of the State of Florida sued 411 PAIN for unlawfully misrepresenting the amount of money and compensation to which customers were entitled in their advertising and for misleading clients into believing that police officers required accident victims to call 411 PAIN after dialing 911 following an accident. The case was settled out of court, and 411 PAIN agreed to change its advertising practices and make a charitable contribution of $550,000 to the Broward Health Foundation and the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital. Charitable Giving The firm has been involved in the Read and Rise program in low income schools in both Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, donating $60,000 to the cause. They also funded $60,000 for what is known as the 411 Pain Cash for Teachers Contest, which \\"awards $1,000 per month to a teacher in each county, culminating with a May grand prize of $11,000 for each district.\\" In March 2011 they donated $2,120 to Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho and Martha Harris, principal of Dr. Henry W. Mack Elementary School in Miami to fund a Scholastic Book Fair in which $5 gift certificates were given to children to buy books of their choice. The firm also organizes the 411 Pain Bowl between schools in southern Florida and is also active in the campaign against bullying in schools and sponsors The Prevention Team, an anti-bullying organization. On September 29 2011, the company along with Romance 106.7FM, Budweiser, Miccosukee Resort & Gaming and Walgreens, organized a Latin music concert in Miami named \\"Una Copa con Romance\\", attended by some 1500 people and artists such as Charlie Zaa. In October 2011, the firm sponsored basketball coach Isiah Thomas's Mary's Court foundation and the \\"South Florida All-Star Classic\\" charity match featuring LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, held at the S. Century Bank Arena on the Modesto Maidique Campus of Florida International University.

Lasky announced the film would be done in the style of 1933's The Power and the Glory and that Herbert Marshall, Joan Bennett and Joel McCrea would be sought to play support roles. However plans to make the film were thrown into disarray when Stanwyck refused to make the movie and was placed on suspension. In June 1939 RKO announced they still intended to film the play.

Located in a 9-story building, it has a colored statue of a young Miccosukee boy outside the front entrance. It has been cited as \\"one of the most unusual resort destinations in Florida\\" due to the contrast between the Native American village surroundings and the casino. Established in 1999 at a reported cost of $45 million, it is operated by about 400 members of the Miccosukee Tribe. History of the Tribe The proud Miccosukee tribe's history predates Columbus. Before Florida became part of the United States, the Miccosukee tribe migrated to there. They separated from the Creek Nation by doing so.http://www.miccosukee.com/tribe/ In the 1800s, about 100 Mikasuki- speaking Creeks hid in the Everglades during the Indian Wars. Since then, the Tribe has expanded to more than 600 members and it continues to grow. In order to live in the Everglades, the Miccosukees had to adapt to living in small groups in temporary \\"hammock style\\" camps. The Miccosukees stayed to themselves in the Everglades for about 100 years, resisting efforts to become assimilated until Tamiami Trail was built in 1928. In 1959, Buffalo Tiger led a group to Cuba to speak to Fidel Castro and obtain international recognition as a sovereign country within the United States. On January 11, 1962, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior approved the Miccosukee Constitution and the Tribe was officially recognized as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. This legally established the Miccosukees' tribal existence and their sovereign, domestic dependant nation status with the United States Government. On March 6, 1971, the Miccosukee Corporation was formed to receive and administer funds from private foundations as well as county, state and federal agencies for a variety of educational, employment, housing and social programs for members of the Miccosukee community. The officers of the Corporation consist of a President, Secretary and a Treasurer. The Chairman of the General Council is also the President and the principal executive of the Corporation. =Facilities= The resort has 256 deluxe guest rooms, 56 suites and conference and banquet facilities. 2009 estimates claim the Miccosukee Resort to earn an estimated $75 million a year. The gaming centre includes slot machines and a poker section. The venue regularly hosts poker tournaments. The resort has a contemporary pool and fitness facility available to its guests. Sauna, jacuzzi, and access to equipment are located on the first floor of the resort.http://www.miccosukee.com/resort/ =Dining= There are six places to eat inside of Miccosukee's resort and gaming casino.

In February 2008, they were involved in the \\"Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!\\" performance in which couples were filmed engaging in sexual acts in the Timiryazev State Biology Museum in Moscow.

Further, she claims that if they complain, they are punished, and that if they complain over the treatment of other prisoners, they are punished even harder. Claiming that collective punishment is frequent, she also stated that the prisoners may be beaten with a particular focus on hitting the kidneys. Another punishment would consist of keeping a prisoner outdoors in the cold without sufficient clothing.

Biography On 17 August 2012, she was convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred for a performance in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years imprisonment. She has been recognized as a political prisoner by the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners. Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience due to \\"the severity of the response of the Russian authorities.\\" She was released on a suspended sentence by a Moscow appeals judge on 10 October 2012 following an argument from her lawyer that she had been stopped by cathedral guards before she could get her guitar out of its case. In the years after her release, Samutsevich disappeared from public eye and keeps a low profile by regularly changing her email address and phone number. Samutsevich first studied computers at Moscow Power Engineering Institute and worked at a research centre as a computer programmer, before quitting to study media art at the Rodchenko School of Photography and Multimedia where she graduated top of her class. For two years she worked for a defense contractor on a secret project, to develop software for the nuclear attack submarine K-152 Nerpa. Thereafter she worked as a freelance programmer. She is interested in LGBT issues. Court sessions were attended by her father, Stanislav Samutsevich, whom she lived with before her arrest, who stated that he felt \\"proud about how firm and prepared she is to face the punishment rather than betray her beliefs\\". Samutsevich has been a member of the Voina collective since 2007. In 2010, Samutsevich was among the Voina activists who attempted to release live cockroaches into the Tagansky Courthouse; the extent to which they succeeded in this action is disputed. She was later prosecuted in the same building for their involvement in Pussy Riot's \\"punk prayer\\". She also took part in a series of actions, Operation Kiss Garbage, from January through March 2011. This project comprised female members kissing policewomen in Moscow Metro stations and on the streets. It was primarily an anti-government protest, but also controversial because the non-consensual \\"ambush kissing\\" could be considered sexual battery.

The plot concerns women pilots competing in the so-called \\"Powder Puff Derby\\", an annual transcontinental air race solely for women. Plot The women's air derby from Los Angeles to Cleveland means a lot to young aviator Janet Steele (Kay Francis), who uses every trick in the book to try to persuade record-setting pilot Ace Boreman (William Gargan) to lend her his very fast aircraft. Ace is reluctant, but Janet steals his craft to demonstrate her skill. He also learns that she is the sister of Bill Steele (Charles Anthony Hughes), a pilot friend of his who crashed and is bedridden. When Ace discovers that Janet needs the money to pay for an operation for Bill, he has no further objections to Janet flying his airplane. Complications ensue when Ace's estranged ex-wife Frieda (Sheila Bromley) notifies him their Mexican divorce is not legal. The airplane remains half hers, and she intends to go after the derby's $15,000 first prize herself. She manages to convince Janet that Ace is a heel. Ace is able to get his buddy Denny Corson (Eddie Foy, Jr.), who has just broken his speed record, to let Janet use his home-built aircraft instead, without letting Janet know that Ace is responsible. In the race, Janet reaches the first stopover at Wichita first, with Frieda close behind. Janet and Ace's friend Kit Campbell (Eve Arden) crashes after her engine catches fire. Janet wants to stay with her, but Kit insists she is okay; she also hands Janet a letter. The letter is from Doc; he loves Janet himself, but writes that it was Ace who got her Denny's airplane. Meanwhile, Frieda runs into an acquaintance working as a race mechanic. He asks her if it is worth $2000 to her to have Janet's airplane sabotaged. When she agrees, the mechanic arranges a fuel leak. Janet is forced to land on a farm. She manages to refuel, but as she is taking off again, she clips something and one of the wheels on her landing gear is torn off without her noticing. When Janet flies into a severe electrical storm, her radio is disabled. Frieda and Janet are neck and neck at the finish in Cleveland. The people on the ground see that Janet's landing gear is damaged, but are unable to notify her. Frieda, hearing the radio message, signals Janet about her danger, forfeiting her own opportunity to win. Janet is able to land safely and win the race. Afterward, she thanks Frieda, who also hands Ace a telegram that says the divorce was legal after all, so Janet wins Ace as well.

The novel was loosely based on the 1929 Women's Air Derby, the first official women-only air race in the United States held during the 1929 National Air Races. A total of 19 pilots took off from Santa Monica, California on August 18, 1929 (another left the next day) with 15 pilots continuing to Cleveland, Ohio, landing nine days later.Read 1992, pp. 127, 440. The New York Times called the novel \\"well written and swift paced\\". =Development= Film rights were bought by Warner Bros who assigned Kay Francis to star. It was the last Warner Bros. contract film for Kay Francis.Pendo 1985, p. 145. The film represented the culmination of her longstanding feud with the studio bosses. Once an A-list star, Francis was frustrated with the roles Warner Bros. had given her in the late 1930s. The studio considered her \\"box office poison\\" and wanted to end her contract but Francis refused, touching off an embarrassing effort to force the star out, even making her act as a prompter for other actors and assigning her to B-list fare such as Women in the Wind. In July 1938 writers were told to rewrite the film to incorporate a round-the-world race to exploit the recent achievements of Howard Hughes. \\"It is expected that the film will end her career at Warners in a blaze of glory\\", wrote the Los Angeles Times. At one stage the film was going to be retitled Dublin By Mistake to cash in on the Douglas Corrigan flight. The movie was going to have an all-female cast but then it was decided not to. William Gargan played the male lead. (It was the eighth time Gargan played an aviator in his career.) =Shooting= Filming started 2 September 1938. The film did mark an early role for later star, Eve Arden, albeit one that she thought was ludicrous when effects turned her crash landing into an \\"atom bomb\\" going off. The fiery crash scene set off guffaws from the test audience who saw her emerge from the blazing wreck with hardly a smudge on her cheek.Arnold, Jeremy. \\"Articles: 'Women in the Wind' (1939).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Post-independence military service  On April 22, 1992, he was approved as the Minister of Defense of Belarus. During his tenure, he distinguished himself by firing officers from the army who were members of the Belarusian Military Association. Many consider him to be the founder of the modern Belarusian army, which previously inherited Soviet era technologies and traditions. On 8 September 1992, he presided over the first oath taking ceremony that held on Independence Square,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMs_c10EUchttps://charter97.org/ru/news/2017/9/8/262281/ held on the 478th anniversary of the Lithuanian-Polish victory at the Battle of Orsha, which was established as a Day of Belarusian Military Glory.https://charter97.org/ru/news/2017/9/8/262248/ Under his control, disarmament of the army, causing Belarus to become the first nuclear-free state in the post-Soviet space.

On September 5 of the same year, by presidential decree, he was demoted to lieutenant general for abuse of office (which was not established by the investigation).  Later life  Later, Kozlovsky began to focus on social and political activities, creating the International Fund for the Rehabilitation of the Health of Former Servicemen. From 1995‚Äì2001, he was a member of the United Civil Party, now he is non-partisan. He often criticizes the military policy of the Belarusian government, often saying that the \\"prestige of the army within our society has dropped\\". He tried to register his candidacy for the 2001 presidential election, but only collected 85,000 signatures out of 100,000 required. He then supported the candidacy of Vladimir Goncharik. In the 2010 elections, he was a confidant of presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov. In 2020, he criticized the government for holding the 2020 Minsk Victory Day Parade on Victors Avenue in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belarus, saying in an interview to Radio Svaboda that \\"There would have been no coronavirus parade during my time as minister\\" as well as \\"This action (parade) can be easily postponed to July 3 - to unite independence and victory\\".

Shear remembers what brought him to Nevada in the first place. As a young attorney, then known as William Shayne, he represented silver miners. He met and married Jessie Gibbs and became a father, but when the silver went bust, leaving Reno on the brink of becoming a ghost town, it was he who created a new identity for Reno as a place where unhappily married individuals could get a quick, painless divorce. Neglecting his own family due to his work, Bill ironically is left alone when Jessie obtains one of those easy divorces, taking their child and leaving him. He is also disbarred and must find another line of work, which is how he came to be in the casino business now. Joanne, moved by her father's story, abandons her lawsuit against him.

Starring Margaret Lindsay, Ann Sheridan and Marie Wilson as three women who grew up in an orphanage and cross paths later in life, it is a remake of the Warners pre-code crime drama film, Three on a Match. Synopsis Isabel Dowling (Margaret Lindsay), Fay Reynolds (Ann Sheridan), and Connie Todd (Marie Wilson) are three women who grew up together in an orphanage, and who meet again later in life. Each woman's life has taken a very different path: Isabel is married with a young daughter, Connie is an office secretary, and Fay performs in nightclubs. The three are reunited when Fay is arrested for performing a striptease, and Isabel and Connie arrive to bail her out. They make plans to keep in touch every year on the same day, at the same restaurant. Isabel is bored and unhappy in her marriage. Her husband, Stanley Dowling (John Litel), goes away to California. When she and Connie go to a nightclub to watch Fay sing, she meets gambler Phil Peyton (Richard Bond) and they soon begin an affair. They are in an automobile accident that makes the headlines just as Stanley returns to New York. Their daughter's nurse, Anna (Dorothy Adams), meets the train and tells him about the affair. At the hospital, Fay tries unsuccessfully to cover for Isabel. Dowling divorces Isabel and retains custody of their daughter Judy (Janet Chapman). Isabel marries Phil, whose gambling soon ruins them. Meanwhile, Fay and Stanley fall in love and marry. Isabel has been separated from her daughter for some time when Fay takes pity on her and one day allows her to take Judy for a visit. Phil puts the child up as security against his debts. The gangsters to whom he owes money discover he has deceived them. They kill Phil in retribution and decide to hold on to Judy, planning to demand a ransom, and leaving police to assume that Isabel killed Phil. Eventually, Isabel overhears the gangsters deciding to kill the two of them to cover their crimes. One of them, Milt (Dewey Robinson), has grown fond of Judy. He protests and is killed. In a bid to save her daughter, Isabel tears the front page off a newspaper with the headline \\"Held by Murder Gang\\" over photos of herself and Judy, clutches it in her fist, and plunges through a closed window to die on the pavement below, trading her life to reveal Judy's whereabouts to police.

But Davis was unhappy with the film. \\"This was the first nothing script I was given since my court battle in England\\", Davis later recalled, referring to the lawsuit in which she tried to win her freedom from Warner Bros. after being forced to appear in a series of mediocre films. \\"It was heartbreaking to me.

On March 30, with the film to start on Monday, Davis refused to make the movie claiming it was not up to the standard set by Jezebel. Warners sent the script to Irene Dunne to see if she would do it. Warners pulled Davis out of her new project We Are Not Alone. On 1 April Warners put Davis on suspension. She claimed she was ill but would have made the effort to appear in a film if it had been more than a \\"routine Cinderella yarn... Had it been The Life of Sarah Bernhardt or Maximillian and Carlotta, both of which have been scheduled for me, I would have attempted to go to the studio, but I did not feel justified in jeopardizing my health on behalf of such an atrocious script.\\" Keighley was assigned to another movie. The same week, Dick Powell was suspended by Warners for refusing a part in Garden of the Moon. Warners lodged a complaint against Davis with the Screen Actors Guild, who said they needed time to investigate the matter properly. Davis opted to go on suspension and remained on suspension when the studio offered her Garden of the Moon, a Busby Berkeley musical, instead. \\"I was on suspension for a good part of the year following Jezebel. So much wasted time at a time when I felt my career could from then on become a truly successful one . . . It took a lot of courage to go on suspension. One received no salary . . . I couldn't afford it, nor could I afford, career-wise, to make films such as Comet Over Broadway and Garden of the Moon!\\" By the end of April, Davis and Hal Wallis, head of production at Warners, agreed on a truce and Davis' next film for Warners would be The Sisters (1938). Miriam Hopkins was cast in the lead. A week later she dropped out to do another film and the lead role was given to the original star, Kay Francis.

His grandfather, Hans Schmidt, the village's spectacle maker, is presented with an opportunity by a mysterious man who walks into his shop: make a lens that when looked through makes everything and everyone appear beautiful, in return for his shop being filled with gold. Hans wants to oblige if only to be able to fix Peter's leg, but first Hans has to learn what beauty actually is. In consulting with the wisest source he knows, Hans is able to produce such a lens which makes everything and everyone on the surface appear beautiful on the surface, and in return he is showered with gold. Another mysterious man comes forth explaining to Hans that the spectacle is deceitful in hiding the ugliness that hides underneath, and that he should produce a lens that should bring forth the truth to the surface. Hans, once again going through the process, does produce such a lens, however at the possible expense to his life as it does expose the ugliness of the souls of some important people, namely the Duke and Duchess. In the end, the truth, in its power, may set them all free.

Rubyworks owns two subsidiary labels, Gotta Run Records and Model Citizen Records. In May 2012 Rubyworks merged with UK independent record label Ark Recordings. History =Formation= Rubyworks was formed by Niall Muckian in Dublin in 2001. Muckian was initially working with Damien Rice, helping him with the formation of his solo career when he saw Rodrigo y Gabriela supporting him at Vicar Street in Dublin. He decided he wanted to work with them. Rubyworks released re-Foc in September 2002, and continues to manage Rodrigo y Gabrela to this day. Over the course of the last fourteen years, Rubyworks has released albums with Irish artists like Hothouse Flowers, Sinead O‚ÄôConnor, Mary Coughlan and Moving Hearts. In more recent times the label, which also includes offshoot imprints Model Citizen, Ark Recordings and Gotta Run, has developed a new generation of Irish talent including Hozier, in partnership with Columbia Records in North America and Australia and Island / Universal for the rest of the world, Ryan Sheridan (in partnership by Universal Music Germany), O.R.B. (The Original Rudeboys), The Minutes and Funeral Suits. =2004 to 2006= Rubyworks took its next step by releasing a new Hothouse Flowers album (Into Your Heart) in early 2004. Developing an international presence, the label helped established Irish acts like Aslan and Jerry Fish & The Mudbug Club release their music outside Ireland. The next major break through came later in 2004, when the second Rodrigo y Gabriela album, Live: Manchester and Dublin, became the first wholly instrumental album to debut in the Irish album chart Top 10. Rodrigo y Gabriela's and Rubyworks' local and international profile started to increase from this juncture. In 2005, Roger Quail joined Rubyworks from the UK, having previously had long spells at 3mv (Oasis, Suede, Ministry of Sound) and Sony's SINE independent label development wing with a view to developing Rubyworks' international profile. The label enjoyed further critical success with Dublin rock group The Devlins. In early 2006 the label enjoyed its greatest success to date with the third Rodrigo y Gabriela album, which charted at # 1 in the Irish album charts in February 2006. The label also released new albums from Leya and Koufax in the same year =2007 to 2008= In 2007 and 2008, Rubyworks released: a new album from Sin√©ad O'Connor in June; a live CD/DVD package from the re-formed Moving Hearts; the debut album from County Down singer/songwriter Foy Vance; and an album from Mary Coughlan. Due to international licensing deals in North America, Australia, Europe, Japan and South Africa, global sales of the Rodrigo y Gabriela rose to over 500,000. =2009 to 2012= In May 2012 Rubyworks merged with UK independent record label Ark Recordings. In August 2012 Rubyworks celebrated its first decade in existence with three Dublin concerts featuring performances from bands like Rodrigo y Gabriela and Fight Like Apes. Dublin band Funeral Suits released their debut album, Lily of the Valley, in June 2012. One of the songs released from the album, \\"All Those Friendly People\\", has since collected over 17 million views on YouTube. Junior label manager Eoin Aherne joined the label during this period. =2013 to Present= In 2013, with the aid of Denis Desmond & Caroline Downey, Rubyworks introduced Hozier to a more mainstream audience. He released his debut music video track, \\"Take Me To Church\\", in September 2013, when it peaked at number 2 on the Irish Singles Chart. The music video, recorded by Brendan Canty & Conal Thomson of Feel Good Lost, has collected over 530 million views on YouTube across two versions. Hozier then went on to release his debut EP, Take Me To Church, which included the track of the same name and \\"Angel of Small Death & the Codeine Scene\\". American Musician John Murry released his album, The Graceless Age, with Rubyworks. In 2014, Rubyworks released albums from: The Minutes (Live Well, Change Often), O.R.B. (All We Are) and Rodrigo y Gabriela (9 Dead Alive), and also Hozier's eponymous debut album, which was released in Ireland in September 2014 and globally in October 2014. Prior to this, Hozier released his second EP, From Eden, which included the single \\"From Eden\\".

Following the St. Patrick's Day flood of 1936, the Army Corps of Engineers began planning a dam project on the Conemaugh River to harness the flood waters. There were 122 structures in Cokeville on a 1951 map. In 1952, as the town was being evacuated for the flood control project, most of these structures were razed, but some were moved up the hill to Cokeville Heights near Rt. 217. The town traces its roots back to 1858 when it was known as Broad Fording. Cokeville was served by the Pennsylvania Mainline Canal until the Pennsylvania Railroad located its tracks along the canals towpath around 1864. The name was changed in the early 1870s to Coketown, Coketon, and finally Cokeville after The Isabella Furnace Coke Company erected a 200 oven coke plant on the hillside above the town. The town was incorporated in 1887. The coke produced here was shipped to the Isabella Blast Furnace in Etna, PA on the Allegheny River. The H.C. Frick Coke Company took over the operation around 1901 and the ovens went out permanently in 1903. The only remnants of the town today are the bridge abutments of the road bridge from Blairsville, the railroad bridge abutments a little further up the river and about a dozen badly delapadated coke ovens just below the large field behind Torrance State Hospital. There are still concrete roads on the two sides of the town.

The community is located within 2 miles of the city of Latrobe and 3 miles from the borough of Derry, Pennsylvania. It has a total area of 0.4 miles. Bradenville has its own post office with zip code 15620. Demographics According to 2018 estimates, Bradenville has 396 residents. The estimated median household income is $38,551, compared to the national average of $61,937. The estimated poverty rate is 26.3%, compared to the national average of 13.1%. 100% of Bradenville residents are white, and 85.6% are high school graduates or higher. History The town was originally called St. Clair City. Served by the Pennsylvania Railroad, it supported coal mining and coking operations beginning in 1886, operated under the names St. Clair Mine & Coke Works, Bradenville Mine & Coke Works and Duquesne Mine & Coke Works. Mathias W. Saxman's Bradenville Mine & Coke Works built about 40 company houses and a store in the town around 1914. By 1915, its Bradenville Mine employed 195 persons, produced over 110,000 tons of coal and operated 194 beehive coke ovens. The Bradenville Mine ceased operations in 1951. Researchers in 1994 found that while the store (see Gallery section) and company houses survived, no mine structures remained. Mine subsidence There were 17 mine subsidence events in Bradenville over the approximately 20 years prior to 2018. Mine subsidence can occur when the ground above an underground (often abandoned) mine collapses into the mine cavity below. This creates the potential for structural damage to surface infrastructure such as homes, buildings and roads. Bradenville's subsidence problems are believed to be related to the Derry No. 1 Deep Mine owned by Marcus W. Saxman'sLatrobe-Connellsville Coal & Coke Company, which mined the area beneath the town. In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection began a $5.8 million project to stabilize about 150 homes in the town affected by this problem.

Creative Director Scott Simmons has been in the haunt industry for more than twenty years, having started with local non-profit haunts and various fundraisers. In 1985 he volunteered at a YMCA haunted house while in high school. During the 1980s and 1990s Scott worked within a few non-profit events and his father Wayne created and constructed the more elaborate sets and projects.

Researchers collected psychophysiological data from guests who volunteered to participate in the research study designed to gather data during intense, \\"real world\\" emotional experiences.Things That Go Bump In The Lab: Halloween And The Science Of Fear : NPR The research protocol was a result of investigations into the science of fear by sociologist Margee Kerr, a former ScareHouse consultant Margee Kerr  Sociologist Who Studies FearWhat Happens to Our Brains When We Get Scared Video - ABC News =Retired Haunts= Buttercup Hall of Nightmares 2007‚Äì2009 The Hall of Nightmares was an assortment of highly detailed scenes and characters that was primarily influenced by EC comics such as Tales From The Crypt, Italian horror movies such as Suspiria, the Haunted mansion at Disney and traditional haunted house situations and scenarios. The designers utilized vibrant colors and stylized scenic design to create a series of thinly connected and surreal scenes involving creatures, clowns, and cloaked figures. Screamatorium 2007‚Äì2008 Screamatorium opened in 2007 and was much darker, realistic, and intense than Hall of Nightmares. This attraction was set inside an abandoned research facility dating back to the early 1900s, which was filled with mutated creatures and their helpless victims. The design team took heavy influence from films such as Silent Hill to create a series of medically themed labs, offices, and holding cells lit by flickering incandescent bulbs. Delirium 3-D 2008‚Äì2011 Delirium 3-D first opened in 2008. Guests were given 3-D glasses at the entrance of the haunt to experience the many 3-D effects of the sets. Delirium 3-D took guests into the deranged and demented world of the main character \\"Delirium\\", which was filled with fluorescent colors, loud music, puppets, and twisted creatures. The general theme was inspired by a mix of psyho/punk/pop/rave culture. The characters in this haunt were known for their random, confusing, though entertaining sayings and antics. In 2012 the ScareHouse hosted musical artist Delirium Dog, who heavily inspired and took inspiration from the Delirium haunt. Delirium Dog performed live in the haunt during the 2011 season. Rampage! 2009‚Äì2010 Rampage! was heavily influenced by steampunk, a subgenre of fantasy and science-fiction that attracted a growing fan base of alternative artists. The term denotes works set in an alternative Victorian era of culture and technology where steam power is still the predominant form of energy. The ScareHouse designers studied reference photos and technical drawings to find inspiration for new costumes, sets, and other production elements. Rampage! took customers into a world divided by war; on the one side were the 'rebels' who were fighting against the evil 'Die-Rector' and 'Daphnie'. These two characters were featured heavily in ScareHouse ads and promotions. The Die-Rector gained further recognition in 2010 when he was invited to participate in 'Dancing with the Celebrities of Pittsburgh .' Creepo the Clown The Forsaken 2009‚Äì2014 The Forsaken opened in 2009 to replace 'Hall of NightMares.' The Forsaken is set in a mythical town of citizens that have lost their souls and are condemned to stalk and haunt the town. Sets include a broken down and haunted Carnival, complete with demented clowns, roustabouts, and fairway barkers. Other notable sets include a highly detailed and realistic 'game' room and 'butcher' shop complete with stuffed prey and animal carcasses. The Forsaken introduced the character of 'Creepo,' a murderous clown that became known for taunting and interacting with customers. This character proved so popular that the ScareHouse developed a new haunt, Creepo's Christmas in 3-D, around him as a clown turned Santa Claus. Infected Zombie Pittsburgh Zombies 2011‚Äì2014 Pittsburgh Zombies opened as the third haunt within The ScareHouse in 2011. The Pittsburgh Zombies attraction features elaborate and Hollywood-quality recreations of iconic Pittsburgh landmarks, while actors portray legions of the walking dead. An experienced team of set designers and scenic artists worked to create a real-life version of the zombie apocalypse that has been so memorably and frighteningly portrayed by the series of Night of the Living Dead films shot in and around the Pittsburgh area over the last forty years. Notable Pittsburgh Zombies sets include a crashed incline cable car, a recreation of Primanti's Brothers restaurant, and a lab where the outbreak started named 'UPEC'. Creepo's Christmas in 3D 2012-2014 Creepo's Christmas debuts in 2012 as the newest 3-D haunt. This haunt is built around the character of Creepo, the demented clown from The Forsaken. This experience places guests in a 'creepy' and twisted Christmas town where Creepo, wearing a Santa cap, seethes over early Christmas decorations. According to Scott Simmons, owner and creative director of The ScareHouse, part of the inspiration for this genre came from the ever earlier appearance of Christmas wares in retail stores. Simmons states: \\"Once the retail stores started displaying Christmas decorations in October, Creepo the Clown decided it was time to take a stand for Halloween.\\" Pittsburgh Zombies: Black Out! 2014 ScareHouse‚Äôs expanded tribute to Pittsburgh‚Äôs Living Dead Legacy surrounds guests with hordes of the hungry dead.

Approximately 72.2% of the company's loans are secured by properties in California, 9.47% are secured by properties in New York, and 5.11% are secured by properties in Florida. Axos Bank has deposit and loan customers nationwide including consumer and business checking, savings and time deposit accounts and financing for single family and multifamily residential properties, small-to-medium size businesses in target sectors, and selected specialty finance receivables. The bank has made larger loans to wealthy individuals that other banks have turned down, albeit at higher interest rates. History The company was founded by Jerry Englert and Gary Evans Lewis with $14 million of startup capital. It was incorporated in Delaware in 1999 as BofI Holding, Inc and began operations as Bank of Internet on July 4, 2000. The start date of July 4 was purposely chosen because it showed that the bank would be open on a day that other banks were closed due to Independence Day. On March 15, 2005, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. It offered 3,052,745 shares of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. In October 2007, the company named Gregory Garrabrants as CEO, who was head of corporate development at IndyMac Bancorp at the time. IndyMac failed the next year as the \\"fourth largest bank failure in the United States.\\" In September 2013, the company acquired $173 million in deposits from Principal Bank. In September 2015, the company acquired H&R; Block Bank became the issuing bank for H&R; Block-branded credit cards and lines of credit. In January 2016, the company launched a co-branded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) program with H&R; Block. In March 2016, the company acquired $140 million of equipment leases from Pacific Western Equipment Finance. On October 1, 2018, BofI Holding re-branded as Axos Financial, and switched its stock exchange from NASDAQ to the NYSE. In November 2018, the bank acquired $3 billion in assets and liabilities of Nationwide Bank, a subsidiary of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. In January 2019, Axos Financial acquired COR Clearing LLC. The unit has since been renamed Axos Clearing. In March 2019, Axos Financial acquired the robo- advisory platform WiseBanyan. The unit has since been renamed Axos Invest and as of early 2020 is keeping the \\"free\\" business model originally designed by the start-up's founders. According to the investor presentation, Axos plans to use WiseBanyan to mine more personal data about its client base. In March 2019, Axos Financial acquired approximately $173 million in deposits from MWABank. In April 2019, it was reported that the Axos CEO, Greg Garrabrants, earned $34.5 million, making him the highest paid bank CEO of 2018, despite Axos being 250x smaller than banks such as JPMorgan. In March 2020, the Axos CEO, Greg Garrabrants, emailed employees to let them know he had instructed his IT team to install spying software on everyone's computer (excluding his own) to make sure they were indeed working from home during the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.

Martinac Shipbuilding Corp. yards at Tacoma, Washington in 1966 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.Scheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Judith was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Judith included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After commissioning, Point Judith was stationed at San Pedro, California, from 1966 to 1972 where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. On 8 March 1970 she fought fire and rescued the operator of the FV Mikki Sue off Long Beach, California. On 13 July she towed the disabled to San Pedro.Scheina, p 75 In 1973 Point Judith was transferred to Santa Barbara, California where she was used for search and rescue as well as some aids to navigation work. On 15 June 1983, she helped the United States Customs Service seize the Greenpeace MV Pacific Peacemaker, which was attempting to disrupt a test of the MX Missile off Vandenberg Air Force Base. On 22 November 1984 she seized the yacht Mir off Santa Rosa Island with of marijuana on board. On 21 September 1987 Point Judith assisted following a collision between MVs Pacharoness and Atlantic Wing southwest of Point Conception.Scheina, p 75 Point Judith was decommissioned 15 January 1992 and transferred to Venezuela.

The app is available on the Apple platform, Android platform, and Web. Designed by two surgeons seeking to improve patient education drawMD utilizes a simple interface across multiple platforms to allow anyone to annotate drawMD's original medical illustrations to enhance patient comprehension. Users can modify the illustrations to roughly match the disease state of the patient by sketching, applying stamps, or typing directly on the detailed anatomic images included in the application. The background templates and the stamps that can be applied to those templates are made by a medical illustrator under the direction of an expert. There are enough illustrations to cover more than a dozen medical specialties and enable clinicians to easily provide personalized treatment plans, medical procedures in an easy to understand format. Clinicians can share the work they create in drawMD through email or printing their drawings or retain them for documenting their consultation. drawMD was originally designed for the iPad and specifically for urology. There is now a version of drawMD that contained the artwork of all the specialties.

Its effects centered on Metro Manila, the surrounding provinces of the Calabarzon region (Quezon, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal) and the provinces of Central Luzon (Bulacan, Pampanga and Bataan). Not a typhoon in its own right, the storm was a strong movement of the southwest monsoon () caused by the pull of Typhoon Saola (Gener) from August 1‚Äì3, strengthened by Typhoon Haikui. It caused typhoon-like damage: the most damage caused by rain since September 2009, when Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck Metro Manila. The heavy rain caused the Marikina River to overflow, destroying areas also affected by Ketsana, triggering a landslide in the Commonwealth area and collapsing the northbound Marcos Highway. Its damage was nearly as severe as Ketsana's, although the storm did not reach typhoon intensity when the rain reached its peak on August 7. The floods and rain left 95 people dead, 8,428 homes destroyed and 6,706 damaged. Nationwide losses totaled at least ‚Ç±604.63 million (US$14.31 million). Typhoon Gener On July 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical wind shear in the monsoon trough about southeast of Manila. Although the shear temporarily relaxed, it increased the following day and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Damrey The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression (naming it \\"Gener\\"); the JTWC upgraded \\"Saola\\" to a tropical storm, and early on July 29 the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm. On July 30 the JTWC upgraded Gener to a Category 1 typhoon (since it began developing an eye-like feature), but downgraded it to a tropical storm later that day. The following day, the JTWC again upgraded Saola to a Category 1 typhoon. Later that day the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon, and the JTWC upgraded it to a category 2 typhoon early on August 1. Typhoon Gener did not make landfall in the Philippines, and occupied a small portion of the northern Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). It pulled southwest-monsoon winds from the South China Sea and damaged the City of Manila, causing a storm surge and striking the fish ports of Navotas and Malabon. It broke a large part of the sea wall on Roxas Boulevard, and caused tons of refuse be washed onto the Baywalk. Portions of Metro Manila damaged by Typhoon Nesat (Pedring) in 2011 were under repair when the storm hit. =Aftermath= Shortly after the typhoon, clean up of the Manila Bay Coast was ordered by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). Initial reports indicated about a dozen confirmed casualties, but early on August 3, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) revised the death toll to 37 with at least 519,000 people affected. More than 17,500 were in evacuation centers. As of August 6, 51 fatalities were confirmed in the Philippines with six reported missing. Damage from the storm amounted to about ‚Ç±404 million (US$9.6 million), half of which was agricultural losses. When Gener left the PAR, its wind would be triggered by Typhoon Haikui to cause heavy rainfall on August 6. August 3‚Äì4 With strong winds, the La Mesa Dam in Novaliches was near overflowing. August 6 =Typhoon Haikui= Haikui on August 6, 2012 Hundreds of kilometers from the Philippines, the southerly flow from Typhoon Haikui enhanced the southwest monsoon across much of Luzon. As a result, widespread heavy rains impacted regions recovering from deadly floods triggered by Typhoon Saola less than a week earlier. During a 72-hour period (August 6‚Äì8), of rain fell in parts of Metro Manila (leading local media to compare the event to Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, which killed 464 people in the city). =Marikina and Tullahan Rivers= The Marikina River, which overflowed during Typhoon Ketsana, again reached the deadly 19-meter level by 7:00 pm. Because of the rain, two of the La Mesa Dam's gates to the Tullahan River overflowed; the water flowed to Barangay Greater Lagro, flooding Lagro High School and the Regalado Highway (nearly ). As a result of La Mesa Reservoir overflowing,https://www.facebook.com/manilawater/posts/589759551135399 the Tullahan flooded North and West Fairview and the Santa Lucia District. It submerged the Atherton Bridge in Fairview, and many houses along the banks were swept away. A number of schools in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon suspended classes, and as a precautionary measure officials cut power to some areas of Metro Manila. At least 250,000 people left their homes when flooding covered more than a third of the city. The head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council compared the deluge to the 1995 post-apocalyptic film starring Kevin Costner Waterworld. =Landslide in Barangay Commonwealth= At 8:00 am, in the hills of the Commonwealth District in Quezon City, a rare landslide occurred which buried two houses (owned by the Baylon and Castulo families, and housing 12 people). The inhabitants were rushed to East Avenue Medical Center. Nine were dead on arrival: Jayson Baylon (age 16), Jayvee Baylon (20), Jissele Baylon (7), Cecilia Baylon (50), Jonathan Castulo (3), Junica Castulo (three weeks), Jessica and Jethro Baylon, and Joshua Castulo. August 7 The worst flooding occurred on August 7 along the Marikina River, which swelled to near-record levels. During the afternoon the river reached a height of , well beyond the flood level of and about above its banks but below the record level set during Typhoon Ketsana. It again flooded Provident Village, among the villages most damaged by Ketsana. Flooding also occurred on Espana Boulevard and at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), which lie along the river. =Munoz, Balintawak and Baesa= The northern district of Quezon City was heavily flooded by the Tullahan River. Most of the water flowed along the Quirino Highway to the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and A. Bonifacio Street, and the Freeway was closed to traffic that afternoon. Flooding also occurred, from a creek in Munoz, causing flooding on EDSA and Roosevelt Avenue. =Roxas District, Tatalon and Damayan Lagi= These districts, along Gregorio Araneta Avenue, had been damaged by Typhoon Ketsana. The creek under the median rose, and by noon flooding nearly reached two-storey buildings and businesses along the Avenue and the nearby roads (particularly Gumamela Street and Eulogio Rodriguez Sr. Boulevard). =Manggahan Floodway and Laguna De Bay= The overflow from the Marikina River swelled the Manggahan Floodway, flooding Pasig and Taguig and overflowing Laguna de Bay. The swelling of the bay flooded the cities of San Pedro and Calamba in Laguna; both were declared in a state of emergency the following day. =City of Manila= The rain triggered several monsoon surges, which again flooded Roxas Boulevard and submerged the Quezon Boulevard Claro M. Recto Underpass in Quiapo and the Lagusnilad-Taft Avenue Underpass on Padre Burgos Street. Waist-high water flooded Manila City Hall, destroying files and documents. =Government response= In response to the flooding, the NDRRMC allocated about ‚Ç±13 million (US$311,000) in relief funds and deployed 202 people to assist in search-and-rescue operations; however, the operations were hampered by strong currents in flooded streets. President Benigno Aquino III ordered officials to maximize efforts to rescue and aid affected residents. =San Juan and Santa Mesa= The San Juan River flooded Santa Mesa and San Juan, including the UERM Hospital; several floors were submerged, and staff and patients experienced shortages of food and medicine. Patients were moved to the upper floors for their safety. August 8 On August 8, more than a million families were affected. Metro Manila and nine nearby provinces in Luzon were under a state of calamity, with some areas flooded up to the second storey; seventy to ninety percent of Metro Manila was affected by flooding. Communications were heavily affected; distress calls and text messages from thousands of Metro Manila residents and their families flooded television and radio stations, since most power and water were interrupted. Although a red warning was downgraded to yellow during the morning, it was upgraded to red until midnight August 9 that afternoon after another round of heavy rain; some schools extended their suspension of classes. Airports also had severe flooding, cancelling flights or diverting them to Clark International Airport in Pampanga and other airports. Some areas of Metro Manila were submerged up to ; city officials evacuated over 23,000 residents from flood-prone areas, moving them to shelters. According to a BBC News correspondent, many residents were reluctant to leave their belongings behind and some returned through floodwaters to retrieve their possessions. Officials feared that flooding could worsen as the La Mesa Dam continued to overflow. Aftermath Throughout the Philippines a total of 89 people were confirmed dead, with seven listed as missing. A total of 8,428 homes were destroyed, and another 6,706 damaged. Losses throughout the country totaled at least ‚Ç±604.63 million (US$14.31 million).

Started in 2009, the competition highlights ten to twelve independent games, with winning games receiving monetary rewards in addition to the award. The Indie Game Challenge ceremonies are held during the annual D.I.C.E. Summit, during which the finalists are able to demonstrate their games to the press. Concept The Indie Game Challenge awards were created by AIAS, Gamestop, and the Guildhall to promote innovation in gaming from independent development. Mike Hogan, senior vice-president of marketing for Gamestop, cited the need for \\"new, cutting edge game developers who continue to stretch the boundaries and imaginations of gamers\\" in the industry, and hoped that the awards would \\"stimulate a new generation of game developers\\". The competition was designed to offer both monetary and scholarship prizes, valued up to $300,000. The Challenge accepts games in playable, near-complete versions (including beta software), and for games that have been released, limits such entries to those that have earned less than $100,000 prior to the competition. The Challenge allows entries for games that have already been submitted to other game contests. Once the judges have selected the finalists, a public voter for \\"Gamer's Choice\\" is started among the finalists for a $10,000 prize. The finalists are invited to the D.I.C.E. Summit, giving them exposure to major video game publishers and journalists, a lucrative opportunity for independent developers. After the major awards have been announced, the judges then select finalists to give graduate scholarships to SMU. The first year for the Challenge drew more than 250 entries to select from.

Los Llanos Region, Venezuela History In colonial times Apure was part of the Province of Merida del Espiritu Santo de la Grita. When Maracaibo was annexed, it was called the Province of Maracaibo. In 1856 it was established as a province, and in 1864 it was given the status of a state. The colonization of Gu√°rico only began in the 17th century and above all in the 18th century. The cacique Chiparara managed to organize Carib and Otomac groups in the Llanos de Gu√°rico to counter-attack the Spanish colonizing forces.4 After they were defeated, around 1653, the Carib and Otomac groups would either retreat southward or lose cohesion and be gradually assimilated. After independence, Gu√°rico became the scene of numerous battles in the civil wars that plagued the country in the 19th century. In 1856 Gu√°rico became part of Venezuela's 21 provinces until it was declared an independent state in 1864, and an integral part of the United States of Venezuela. After being dissolved in 1898, Gu√°rico acquired its autonomy again and in 1899 it was ratified by presidential decree. From this date on, it remained an independent state even though it suffered changes in its territory. Its boundaries with the state of Aragua were established by a protocol signed in 1933. In 1969, the process of regionalization of Venezuela began through CORDIPLAN, during the government of Rafael Caldera. Hato La Fe, Gu√°rico State In the 70's, the Central Plains Region was formed, which included the states of Gu√°rico, Cojedes and Apure (except for the then Paez District, now Paez Municipality), as well as the Arismendi District of Barinas State and the Urdaneta District of Aragua State. Later, in the 80's, the state of Cojedes would join the states of Carabobo and Aragua (entirely) to form the Central Region and the Municipality Arismendi of the state of Barinas joins the Region of Los Andes; acquiring since then its current name. Only the Municipality Paez of the state of Apure belongs to a different region at present. Geography The lower plains, basically below 100 meters above sea level, are flooded during the rainy season or winter and have many rivers, parallel to each other and that change course frequently, due to the action of the dunes (sand mountains) that are moved by the winds during the drought (summer). The high plains are located at the foot of the Andes and are very rich land for cultivation. The Apure River crosses the western plains from west to east, its torrent being fed in the north by the inflows of the Uribante, Sarare, Caparo, Suripa, Ticoporo, Canagu√°, Mamparo, Santo Domingo, Portuguesa and Gu√°rico Rivers. To the south and east are the Meta, Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and Arichuna rivers, while going east, the Guariquito, Manapire, Zuata, Pao and Caris rivers also join the course of the great Orinoco river, from its northern slope. Economy The economy of the Llanera region is dominated by agricultural and livestock activities and to a lesser extent by activities such as tourism. However, it remains a purely rural and sparsely populated region. This is an area of special importance for the country's agriculture and livestock, especially with regard to cattle, pigs and goats. Agricultural activity was even more decisive before 1917, when oil exploitation began to take off. However, later on and because of the rural exodus, the primary sector lost importance at a national level, but it maintains a relative boom in the region. Political Division =Guarico State= It is located in the center of the country, in the region of Los Llanos, bordering Carabobo, Aragua and Miranda to the north, Anzo√°tegui State to the east, Bolivar and Apure to the south, and Barinas and Cojedes to the west. With almost 65 000 km¬≤ it is the fourth largest state - behind Bolivar, Amazonas and Apure - with 746 174 inhabitants in 2011, the ninth least populated. Orinoco Crocodile, Llanos Region =Apure State= Apure, this is the largest plain state in the region. Its plains are properly divided into three major parts: the low, middle, and high plains, as well as the low Apure, middle Apure, and high Apure. Its main economic activities are cattle raising followed by agriculture and fishing, the state is poor in production with only 11% of its entire territory in production. The most important cities are: San Fernando de Apure, Achagua, Elorza and Guasdualito. The state is crossed by numerous rivers of great length and width, all of which are part of the Orinoco basin. The Apure, the most important of these, is also the main Venezuelan tributary of the Orinoco from its left bank, and the second longest in the country: it runs for about 1000 km between its source and its mouth. The cattle sector is basically specialized in the production of cattle, concentrating about 30% of the heads of cattle in the whole national territory.

In 1811, when Venezuela declared its independence, Coro remained faithful to the Spanish Crown and merged with the Province of Maracaibo, until Fernando VII decreed the creation of the Province of Coro in 1815. In 1879, together with Lara and Yaracuy, minus the Department of Nirgua, the Falcon State became part of the Western Northern State. Between 1881 and 1890 it formed with Zulia the State of Falcon-Zulia. In 1891 it appears again as an independent state with the name of Falcon.
