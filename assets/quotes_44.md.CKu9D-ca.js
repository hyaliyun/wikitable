The piece was commissioned by Soli Deo Gloria for the 2003 bicentennial of the birth of French composer Hector Berlioz.Rouse, Christopher. Reqiem: Program Note by the Composer. 2007. Retrieved March 5, 2015. It was completed July 12, 2002 and premiered March 25, 2007 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, with the conductor Grant Gershon leading the Los Angeles Master Chorale and their orchestra, the Los Angeles Children's Chorus, and the baritone Sanford Sylvan. Composition The duration of the Requiem is approximately 90 minutes. Though it was commissioned to commemorate composer Hector Berlioz, the piece contains no references to the music of Berlioz. Rouse was more inspired by the War Requiem by English composer Benjamin Britten. Similar to the War Requiem, the composition follows the liturgical requiem text, but additionally incorporates text from other sources, specifically lyrics from European hymns and lines from the poetry of Seamus Heaney, Siegfried Sassoon, Michelangelo, Ben Jonson, and John Milton. =9/11= Having completed the work shortly after the events of the 2001 September 11 attacks, Rouse, after much personal deliberation, elected not to dedicate the Requiem to the victims of the attacks. In the program notes, Rouse commented: Reception Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times lavished the Requiem with praise, declaring it \\"the first great traditional American Requiem\\" and called it \\"a Requiem of wondrous mixed emotions.\\" George Grella of the New York Classical Review called the piece \\"fascinating, massive, ungainly, often moving, sometimes unhinged: if not a completely successful composition, at least an impressive showcase for musicians and composer‚Äôs craft alike.\\" Corinna Da Fonseca-Wollheim of The New York Times praised the New York City premiere, saying, \\"The predominant mood of Mr. Rouse‚Äôs 'Requiem' is one of uncomprehending grief and fury almost as if, bereft of faith, it were mourning the death of consolation itself. But then there are glimpses of hope. Mr. Imbrailo‚Äôs limpid and smoothly flowing rendition of Jonson‚Äôs 'Farewell, thou child of my right hand' was joined by a fleeting, radiant flute solo. And when the Brooklyn Youth Chorus entered with the Marian hymn 'Es ist ein Ros entsprungen,' sung with a gleaming, pure sound from a side balcony, the effect was powerfully emotional, even as it skirted the fine line between pathos and kitsch.\\" Barry Bassis of The Epoch Times said of the same performance, \\"Rouse‚Äôs splendid work deserved the standing ovation at the end, proving that audiences are receptive to modern works that are this well crafted and performed.\\" At the New York City premiere, conductor Alan Gilbert said of the Requiem, \\"This work goes farther or comes from deeper in him than almost any other piece of his. It takes a lot out of you both technically but emotionally as well.\\" Rouse himself said of the piece, \\"All of that was to try to put across the idea of facing death, whether you're facing it yourself or if you're going on after the death of a loved one. But it is a very personal work and I think it's the best work I've composed.\\" References Category:Compositions by Christopher Rouse Category:2002 compositions Rouse Category:21st-century classical music Category:Commissioned music ","title":"Requiem (Rouse)"},{"id":"45580075","text":"The Italian destroyer Audace was originally ordered by Japan from Yarrow Shipbuilders in Scotland under the name of Kawakaze, but was transferred to Italy in 1916 while still under construction.

Construction and career The Imperial Japanese Navy ordered a pair of s from the British Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1913, and Kawakaze (as the ship was originally named) was laid down on 1 October 1913 at their Scotstoun shipyard. Construction was delayed by a backlog of previous orders and then by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.Fraccaroli, pp. 72, 74 The Italians, desperately short of destroyers, began negotiations with the Japanese to acquire Kawakaze and succeeded on 3 July 1916 when they agreed to transfer the ship. The Regia Marina named their new acquisition Intrepido two days later, but renamed her Audace on 25 September. She was launched on 27 September and completed on 1 March 1917.Fraccaroli, p. 74 She saw action in the Adriatic Sea during World War I, and was the first Italian ship to enter Trieste at the end of the war, celebrating the final union of the city with Italy (the pier where she moored was renamed Molo Audace, \\"Audace Pier\\", and her anchor became part of the Victory Lighthouse). Audace was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 September 1929 and was modified to serve as the command ship of the radio-controlled target ship San Marco from 1937‚Äì40. She was rearmed in 1940 for escort duties with her main armament reduced to three 102-millimeter guns. In 1943 one 102-millimeter gun and the two 2-pounder AA guns were replaced by five /65 Breda Model 35 autocannon in single mounts.Brescia, pp. 136‚Äì37 Between 1940 and 1943 she was mostly used as an escort in the Adriatic Sea. The ship left Trieste on 9 September 1943, following the Italian Armistice and the beginning of Operation Achse, intending to reach an Italian or Allied-controlled port in southern Italy; but engine problems forced her to make for Venice, where she was captured on 12 September when the Germans occupied the city. She was then commissioned into the Kriegsmarine and renamed TA20. The Germans augmented her anti-aircraft armament to 20 Breda guns in 10 twin mounts and assigned her to escort and minelaying work in the Adriatic Sea.Brescia, p. 137 On 15 March 1944, she laid a minefield south of Ancona and others east of San Giorgio on the night of 17/18 and 29 March.

Wagner completed Polonia in 1836, although it has been suggested that it may have been drafted as early as 1832.Anon, \\"Wagner's Early Overtures\\", Musical Times, 1 February 1905 , accessed 7 March 2015 Wagner states that Polonia resulted from a \\"dreamlike evening\\" in Leipzig when he heard uninterrupted Polish songs, including the Polish national anthem Poland Is Not Yet Lost at a celebration of May 3rd Constitution Day in 1832.Wagner (1992) p. 58 He composed the work later in Berlin in May‚ÄìJuly 1836, and gave its first performance in K√∂nigsberg the following winter. The work, which is in sonata form, contains references to Polish folksong.Millington (2001), p. 310 Wagner apparently took the manuscript of the score with him to Paris in 1839. He thought it had been lost during his visit, but it was returned to him by the conductor Jules Pasdeloup in 1869.Wagner (1980), vol. II p. 1128. Discussing the overture with his wife Cosima on Christmas Day 1881, Wagner opined that \\"with a military band for the people, as I thought of everything at the time, it would have sounded splendid and made a great effect.\\"Wagner (1980), vol. II p. 777. Wagner's biographer Ernest Newman wrote that the overture was \\"shapeless and frothy...the oddest mixture of a pseudo-Polish idiom and the cheap assertive melody of Rienzi\\".Newman (1914), p. 155 The writer Adrian Corleonis has commented that \\"Polonia 's coarse-grained excitement, which may at first seem audacious, looms as merely clumsy ... well before its run halfway through its dozen-minute course, the curious compulsion to revisit lame material having something about it of the boorish, drunken frat boy imagining that he's the life of the party\\".Corleonis, Adrian, \\"Polonia, overture for orchestra in C major\\" on Allmusic website, accessed 7 March 2015 The composer's manuscript of his piano arrangement of the score, which he made in 1840, is in the Stefan Zweig Collection at the British Library.

Original plans included the construction of an office tower and a hotel and casino and was originally set to begin construction later in 2015 and to be completed by 2017. However, it was never built. The mall was constructed at a cost of $475 million by Taubman Centers.  History  View of the Grand Court towards Nordstrom Porsche 911 Targa 4S on display The land where the mall now is was once a building complex which originally served as housing for the 1979 Pan American Games. The buildings were demolished in 1998 in what was a world record for most buildings to be demolished simultaneously with explosives. Originally, the project was called Nueva Puerta de San Juan when it was first planned in the 90s. In the 2000s, it was renamed Plaza Internacional. Construction of the mall had been paralyzed for several years due to financing issues and a lawsuit by the owners of the nearby Plaza Las Americas. New Century Development would later file a lawsuit of their own when Plaza Las Americas announced plans for an expansion.http://m.cb.pr/mobile_news/pr-shopping-center-duel- revived-88277.html The project was later given its current name and finally broke ground in 2012.

The 18 April 1964 coup was notable for being committed by the policemen of the Directorate of National Coordination. Although successful, it was overturned five days later by U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger. In its wake, Neutralist Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma forged a fragile coalition with the Pathet Lao communists. On 4 August 1964, Defense Minister Phoumi Nosavan attempted to take over Vientiane with a training battalion. This coup was quickly crushed by the local Royal Lao Army troops, as the police sat out the conflict. The Pathet Lao left the coalition and repudiated Souvanna Phouma. Perforce he was driven to cooperate with the rightist Royalist politicians and military officers. None of the events affected the North Vietnamese usage of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to send troops into battle in South Vietnam. Overview The United States began bankrolling France's First Indochina War in 1950.Castle, pp. 9‚Äì10. Charles Yost, the first U.S. ambassador to Laos took up his duties in September 1954. Four months after he arrived, the U.S. Operations Mission (USOM) set up shop. When USOM proved unable to track U.S. military aid, the Programs Evaluation Office was established in December 1955. Despite Yost's best efforts to curb the activities of the CIA and the anti- Communist stance of the Eisenhower administration, the American mission would continue to increasingly involve itself with both political and military operations within Laos. The U.S., which did not sign the Final Declaration, issued its own declaration making it easier for Eisenhower to state that the US would not be governed by agreements made at the Geneva Conference. 1954 Geneva Accords.Castle, pp. 15‚Äì16. Background General Siho Lamphouthacoul used his powers as the National Director of Coordination to build Laotian police forces into a national power. Siho gathered and trained two special battalions of paramilitary police during the latter part of 1960, dubbing them the Directorate of National Coordination. Siho's new battalions helped carry the day at the Battle of Vientiane, when General Phoumi Nosavan seized power in December 1960. Acquiring the National Police from the Ministry of the Interior, and co-opting local military police, Siho consolidated the Lao police into the DNC.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 105‚Äì106. Attaining a strength of 6,500 men, the DNC would be Siho's instrument for power.Anthony, Sexton, p. 98. By March 1964, the Vietnamese communists had begun forwarding combat units down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The increased activity in the southern Laotian panhandle threatened the neutrality of the Kingdom of Laos, as well as the very existence of South Vietnam. In mid-month, Lao Defense Minister Phoumi Nosavan flew to Dalat, Vietnam to confer with South Vietnamese senior officers. They agreed that the South Vietnamese could attack the Trail on Laotian territory with entire regiments and with air strikes. When Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma learned of the agreement that had been struck without his knowledge, he scaled back the South Vietnamese operations to forays by reconnaissance teams, with a hidden South Vietnamese liaison operating from Savannakhet, Laos.Ahern, p. 187. Siho's coup On 18 April 1964, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma met with his brother Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao communists, on the Plain of Jars. The Pathet Lao demanded demilitarization of both Luang Prabang and Vientiane as the price of their participation in a national government. This discouraged Souvanna Phouma, who returned to Vientiane, having decided to resign as Prime Minister. However, King Sisavang Vatthana would not approve the resignation until the next day.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 98‚Äì99. At this turn of events, Siho Lamphouthacoul inveigled Kouprasith Abhay into a coup, on the grounds that the United States would be forced by events to accept their new government. Beginning at 2200 hours on the night of 18/19 April 1964, Siho's police unit Bataillon Special 33 (Special Battalion 33) seized Vientiane's infrastructure. Minister of Defense Phoumi Nosavan was contacted at 0415 hours; he declined to join the coup.Conboy, Morrison, p. 113 note 6. By 0430, another DNC unit, Bataillon Special 11 (Special Battalion 11) had arrested Souvanna Phouma and 15 leading officials of such opposed factions as the Royal Lao Army, Forces Army Neutraliste, and the French Embassy. The coup force emptied the safe in FAN's headquarters and looted Kong Le's home. Some 15 other FAN officials sought asylum from the coup in the Soviet Embassy.Conboy, Morrison, p. 107. The Royal Lao Air Force was placed on alert, with its pilots bedded down in tents on the flight line. Kouprasith was chosen as the successor to power, with Siho his deputy. To strengthen his hold on the country, Kouprasith called in two battalions of his Groupement Mobile 17 (Mobile Group 17) from Military Region 2 to reinforce the DNC personnel. Communist forces promptly moved into the defensive positions strung along the north edge of the Plain of Jars that had been abandoned by GM 17. The coup had been staged in the absence of American ambassador Leonard Unger, who was in Saigon conferring with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, and Assistant Secretary for State for Far Eastern Affairs William P. Bundy. American ambassador Leonard Unger hastily returned from his conference on 23 April, accompanied by Bundy. Unger confronted Siho and Kouprasith and informed them that the United States supported Souvanna Phouma and the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos of 23 July 1962. Unger noted that the two mutinous officers reacted like frightened schoolboys. Bundy thought they were desperate to save face. Unger ordered Siho and Kouprasith to release their captives while announcing they had taken Souvanna Phouma into custody to secure the national government. In a face saving gesture, they did so. Unger's orders had ended the abortive coup. Even before the mutineers could act, Unger and Bundy visited Phoumi. He promised them the release of Souvanna Phouma, Amka Soukhavong, and the other neutralists. Once they were released the following day, Souvanna Phouma returned to negotiations for a coalition government. He succeeded, but had to agree to fill vacant communist seats in the Royal Lao Government.Anthony, p. 99. The Prime Minister, under pressure from the rightists, did not fill the Pathet Lao slots in the government. Despite the political pressure, Souvanna Phouma replaced Phoumi as Defense Minister. No sooner was Phoumi stripped of power than Siho and Kouprasith wanted in on his gambling rackets, and his opium and gold smuggling operations. Meanwhile, on 3 June, Souphanouvong announced that the Pathet Lao no longer recognized Souvanna as Prime Minister; this effectively ended their participation in the coalition.Castle, pp. 64‚Äì65. Phoumi's coup In the wake of the April 1964 coup, Kouprasith emerged as Deputy Commander in Chief of the RLA. His ally Ouane Rattikone was the Commander in Chief. However, Siho was not only outranked, but drew international criticism for his coup. In response, he retitled the DNC as Lao National Police, and laid low. In the meantime, Phoumi's powers were so diminished that he was allowed little input into the successful July 1964 Operation Triangle Kouprasith headed. However, Phoumi evaded the agreement that ended the April coup, which deprived him of troops to command. He still led a full-strength training battalion in the capital, as well as the cadre for a second, and had a couple of \\"economic battalions\\" of military veterans at his disposal in Thakhek and Pakxe. On 4 August 1964, Phoumi loosed his training battalion in a coup. Led by Phoumi's bodyguard, Major Boua, the trainees erected roadblocks throughout Vientiane. They were promptly crushed by Kouprasith's troops as Siho's police sat out the fight. Major Boua went to jail. The training battalions were disbanded. Phoumi was left without troops to command.Conboy, Morrison, p. 123. Aftermath The end result of the 1964 coups was the de-neutralization of Souvanna Phouma. Having been forced by circumstance to side with the rightwing politicians who held him in power, he would be opposed to the communists for the remainder of the Laotian Civil War.Fall, p. 234. Note: This Epilogue page written by Roger M. Smith. The Ho Chi Minh Trail would continue to be a conduit to South Vietnam for communist troops and materiel.

Early Baseball Career Ôºà2013-10-21„ÄÅMeiji Jingu StadiumÔºâ Yokawa started playing baseball in 2nd grade as a third baseman for the East Sekime Lions (little league), then he doubled as a pitcher and infielder in junior high. He was converted to a shortstop upon entering Konk≈ç≈çsaka High School, and experienced playing in the Spring Koshien in his third year. He hit a total of 36 home runs in his high school career. During the 2009 draft, the Yomiuri Giants chose him as their third pick for the ikusei draft (developmental draft), but he rejected their offer and opted to enroll in Tokyo University of Agriculture instead. He then played as third baseman for Tokyo Nodai and participated in the Tohto League games. In 4 years, he recorded 109 hits, 51 RBIs, and 23 home runs.ÈÄ±Âàä„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´2013Âπ¥12Êúà16Êó•Âè∑ P84 Hanshin Tigers Before the 2013 draft, he said that he would turn pro only if he was drafted in the 3rd round or earlier, but will play for the industrial leagues otherwise. The Tigers chose him as their 3rd pick, and he accepted their offer. He was assigned the jersey number 55. 2014 He spent his first year playing in minor league games. In his 98-game appearances, he batted 0.241, recorded 38 RBIs and 6 home runs. Although he alternated playing as 1st and 3rd baseman, he committed 12 errors when he played the latter. 2015 He started training as an infielder with the main squad during spring camp, but dislocated his left shoulder when he made a diving catch during a friendly match with the Samsung Lions (KBO). Afterwards, he underwent rehabilitation for 3 months. He resumed playing in the Western League (minors) in June, and even got selected as a nominee for Fresh All Star Games. In 54 games, he recorded a batting average of 0.213, 16 RBIs and 3 home runs. During off-season, he was selected to play for the national team in the Winter League games in Taiwan. He played as a short stop or 2nd baseman in 17 games, batted an average of 0.345, and recorded 13 RBIs including 2 home runs.„ÄÇ 2016 He started the year with an impressive performance during the pre- season exhibition games and farm games. By April, he secured the cleanup position, topped the player rankings by hitting 0.347, and got awarded the MVP of the month for 2 consecutive months for scoring 18 RBIs (5 home runs). He got promoted to the main squad during the April 15 match against the Dragons, and recorded his first hit on his first at-bat during the top of the 7th inning. On April 29, his first career home run won the match against the Baystars, and he got to experience his first hero interview with pitcher and fellow 2013 draftee Yuta Iwasada. He then alternated as a 3rd baseman or left outfielder during his next appearances, though mostly as substitute for other starters, until he fell into a slump and was eventually sent back to the farm. While his performance in the main squad games was not the best, he redeemed himself in the minors where he got the triple crown title; he was the batting champion with an average of 0.301, RBI leader with 62 RBIs, and home run leader with 14 home runs (tied with another Softbank player). He also got awarded the 2016 Hanshin Farm MVP. 2017 Except for a brief and unsuccessful stint with the main squad in July, he spent most of the season in the farms. He continued to play well in the Western League games and peaked in September when he hit home runs in 5 consecutive games. This got him brought back to the main squad again, but saw fewer plate appearances after falling short of expectations. He finished the season in the farms and once again topped the league in RBIs with 91, and tied with Carp's Xavier Batista as the home run leader with 21. But despite these achievements, his lackluster performance in the main squad earned him a half a million pay cut which brought his annual salary to 8.5 million yen, as management deemed the minor league titles useless if he cannot bring his A-game to where it matters. 2018 He once more spent the first half of the season in the minors where he competed with Yutaro Itayama for the clean up position. Only when new import Willin Rosario fell into a slump in June was he finally given a spot in the main squad. He rose to the occasion and went 2-for-4 with 4 RBIs(1 HR) in his first game against the Lions on June 4. He continued his hitting streak and batted 0.358 in June, and by July he was a regular cleanup and starter. Later on, he was assigned to man the outfield as there was a surplus of good infielders. He finished the season in the main squad, where more than half of his 75 appearances were as a clean up hitter. His record was a personal best of 48 RBIs including 6 home runs, and an average of 0.252. In October, he also underwent surgery to clean out his right elbow as he experienced pain with it that caused him to be taken off the roster in August. Playing Style He employs a powerful swing on the plate,„ÄåÈÄ±Âàä„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Äç(Weekly Baseball) November 11, 2013 edition„Äå2013„Éâ„É©„Éï„ÉàÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑„Äç „Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æ and possesses stamina that can last him throughout an entire game, as he demonstrated during his university days. When his performance began to improve in 2017, his teammates in the farm noticed his habit of pounding his chest with his palms after he hits a home run, and promptly gave him the nickname \\"Gorilla\\". By 2018, his teammates would do the \\"Gorilla Pose\\" (\\"Go-ri-ra Po-su\\" or „Ç¥„É™„É©„Éù„Éº„Ç∫) after he hit one home run after another, both in the farm and main squad games. This eventually spread and even the main squad members now call him by this nickname, and greet him with this chest-slapping gesture as he returns to the dugout after a successful run.

Geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using Cartesian landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables. The landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size, position, and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on morphology. Geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats, especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes, which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in physical anthropology. Geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology, which has more recently been named virtual anthropology. Virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology, the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape (such as geometric morphometrics) and form... Background The field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with Francis Galton (1822-1911). Galton was a polymath and the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain. In 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base-line registration approach for shape comparisons. This was later adapted by Fred Bookstein and termed ‚Äútwo-point coordinates‚Äù or ‚ÄúBookstein-shape coordinates‚Äù. In the 1940s, D‚ÄôArcy Wentworth Thompson (biologist and mathematician, 1860-1948) looked at ways to quantify that could be attached to biological shape based on developmental and evolutionary theories. This led to the first branch of multivariate morphometrics, which emphasized matrix manipulations involving variables. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Bookstein (currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna) began using Cartesian transformations and David George Kendall (statistician, 1918-2007) showed that figures that hold the same shape can be treated as separate points in a geometric space. Finally, in 1996, Leslie Marcus (paleontologist, 1930-2002) convinced colleagues to use morphometrics on the famous √ñtzi skeleton, which helped expose the importance of the applications of these methods. Traditional morphometrics BirdMorpho Traditional morphometrics is the study of morphological variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles. The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: principal components, factor analysis, canonical variate, and discriminant function analysis. It is also possible to study allometry, which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes. For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics is that it does not capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to be based on. For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics. Geometric morphometrics tries to correct these problems by capturing more variability in shape. Steps in a geometric morphometric study There is a basic structure to successfully performing and completing every geometric morphometric study: # Design Study: what is your objective/hypothesis? what morphology must you capture to explore this? # Collect Data: choose your landmark set and method of collection # Standardize Data: make your landmarks comparable across all specimens (superimposition) # Analyze Data: choose a statistical approach depending on your original question and how you designed the study # Interpret Results: take the outcome of your statistical analysis and reflect it back to the context of your original specimens Data collection methods =Landmarks= The first step is to define your landmark set. Landmarks have to be anatomically recognizable and the same for all specimens in the study. Landmarks should be selected to properly capture the shape trying to be observed and capable of being replicated. The sample size should be roughly three times the amount of landmarks chosen and they must be recorded in the same order for every specimen. =Semilandmarks= 3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl Semilandmarks, also called sliding landmarks, are used when the location of a landmark along a curvature might not be identifiable or repeatable. Semilandmarks were created in order to take landmark based geometric morphometrics to the next step by capturing the shape of difficult areas such as smooth curves and surfaces. In order to obtain a semilandmark, the curvature still has to start and end on definable landmarks, capture observed morphology, remain homologous across specimens in the same steps seen above for regular landmarks, be equal in number, and equally distant apart. When this approach was first proposed, Bookstein suggested gaining semilandmarks by densely sampling landmarks along the surface in a mesh and slowly thinning out the landmarks until the desired curvature was obtained. Newer landmark programs aid in the process but there are still some steps that must be taken in order for the semilandmarks to be the same across the whole sample. Semilandmarks are not placed on the actual curve or surface but on tangent vectors to the curve or tangent planes to the surface. The sliding of semilandmarks in new programs is performed by either selecting a specimen to be the model specimen for the rest of the specimens or using a computational sample mean from tangent vectors. Semilandmarks are automatically placed in most programs when the observer chooses a starting and ending point on definable landmarks and sliding the semilandmarks between them until the shape is captured. The semilandmarks are then mapped onto the rest of the specimens in the sample. Since shape will differ between specimens, the observer has to manually go through and make sure the landmarks and semilandmarks are on the surface for the rest of the specimens. If not they must be moved to touch the surface, but this process still maintains the correct location. There is still room for improvement to these methods but this is the most consistent option at the moment. Once mapped on, these semilandmarks can be treated just like landmarks for statistical analysis. =Deformation grid= This is a different approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid. Bookstein proposed the use of a thin-plate spline (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences. Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template. The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans. Superimposition =Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA)= Landmark and semilandmark coordinates can be recorded on each specimen, but size, orientation, and position can vary for each of those specimens adding in variables that distract from the analysis of shape. This can be fixed by using superimposition, with generalized procrusted analysis (GPA) being the most common application. GPA removes the variation of size, orientation, and position by superimposing the landmarks in a common coordinate system. The landmarks for all specimens are optimally translated, rotated, and scaled based on a least-squared estimation. The first step is translation and rotation to minimize the squared and summed differences (squared Procrustes distance) between landmarks on each specimen. Then the landmarks are individually scaled to the same unit Centroid size. Centroid size is the square root of the sum of squared distances of the landmarks in configuration to their mean location. The translation, rotation, and scaling bring the landmark configurations for all specimens into a common coordinate system so that the only differing variables are based on shape alone. The new superimposed landmarks can now be analyzed in multivariate statistical analyses. Statistical analysis =Principal components analysis (PCA)= In general, principal components analysis is used to construct overarching variables that take the place of multiple correlated variables in order to reveal the underlying structure of the dataset. This is helpful in geometric morphometrics where a large set of landmarks can create correlated relationships that might be difficult to differentiate without reducing them in order to look at the overall variability in the data. Reducing the number of variables is also necessary because the number of variables being observed and analyzed should not exceed sample size. Principal component scores are computed through an eigendecomposition of a sample‚Äôs covariance matrix and rotates the data to preserve procrustes distances. In other words, a principal components analysis preserves the shape variables that were scaled, rotated, and translated during the generalize procrustes analysis. The resulting principal component scores project the shape variables onto low-dimensional space based on eigenvectors. The scores can be plotted various ways to look at the shape variables, such as scatterplots. It is important to explore what shape variables are being observed to make sure the principal components being analyzed are pertinent to the questions being asked. Although the components might show shape variables not relevant to the question at hand, it is perfectly acceptable to leave those components out any further analysis for a specific project. =Partial least squares (PLS)= Partial least squares is similar the principal components analysis in the fact that it reduces the number of variables being observed so patterns are more easily observed in the data, but it uses a linear regression model. PLS is an approach that looks at two or more sets of variables measured on the same specimens and extracts the linear combinations that best represent the pattern of covariance across the sets. The linear combinations will optimally describe the covariances and provide a low-dimensional output to compare the different sets. With the highest shape variation covariance, mean shape, and the other shape covariances that exists among the sets, this approach is ideal for looking at the significance of group differences. PLS has been used a lot in studies that look at things such as sexual dimorphism, or other general morphological differences found at the population, subspecies, and species level. It has also been used to look at functional, environmental, or behavioral differences that could influence the found shape covariance between sets =Multivariate regression= Multiple or multivariate regression is an approach to look at the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a dependent or influential variable. It is best used in geometric morphometrics when analyzing shape variables based on an external influence. For example, it can be used in studies with attached functional or environmental variables like age or the development over time in certain environments. The multivariate regression of shape based on the logarithm of centroid size (square root of the sum of squared distances of landmarks) is ideal for allometric studies. Allometry is the analysis of shape based on the biological parameters of growth and size. This approach is not affected by the number of dependent shape variables or their covariance, so the results of regression coefficients can be seen as a deformation in shape. Some applications in anthropology =Human evolution= The human brain The human brain is unique from other species based on the size of the visual cortex, temporal lobe, and parietal cortex, and increased gyrification (folds of the brain). There have been many questions as to why these changes occurred and how they contributed to cognition and behavior, which are important questions in human evolution. Geometric morphometrics has been used to explore some of these questions using virtual endocasts (casts of the inside of the cranium) to gather information since brain tissue does not preserve in the fossil record. Geometric morphometrics can reveal small shape differences between brains such as differences between modern humans and Neanderthals whose brains were similar in size. Neubauer and colleagues looked at the endocasts of chimpanzees and modern humans to observe brain growth using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found that there is an early ‚Äúglobularization phase‚Äù in human brain development that shows expansion of the parietal and cerebellar areas, which does not occur in chimpanzees. Gunz and colleagues extended the study further and found that the ‚Äúglobularization phase‚Äù does not occur in Neanderthals and instead Neanderthal brain growth is more similar to chimpanzees. This difference could point to some important changes in the human brain that led to different organization and cognitive functions Pleistocene cranial morphology There have been many debates on the relationships between Middle Pleistocene hominin crania from Eurasia and Africa because they display a mosaic of both primitive and derived traits. Studies on cranial morphology for these specimens have created arguments that Eurasian fossils from the Middle Pleistocene are a transition between Homo erectus and later hominins like Neanderthals and modern humans. However, there are two sides to the argument with one side saying that the European and African fossils are from a single taxon while others say that the Neanderthal lineage should be included. Harvati and colleagues decided to attempt to quantify the craniofacial features of Neanderthals and European Middle Pleistocene fossils using 3D landmarks to try to add to the debate. They found that some features were more Neanderthal like while others were primitive and likely from the Middle Pleistocene African hominins, so the argument could still go either way. Freidline and colleagues further added to the debate by looking at both adult and subadult crania of modern and Pleistocene hominins using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found similarities in facial morphology between Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa and a divide in facial morphology during the Pleistocene based on time period. The study also found that some characteristics separating Neanderthals from Middle Pleistocene hominins, like the size of the nasal aperture and degree of midfacial prognathism, might be due to allometric differences =Modern human variation= Ancestry and sex estimation of crania Crania can be used to classify ancestry and sex to aid in forensic contexts such as crime scenes and mass fatalities. In 2010, Ross and colleagues were provided federal funds by the U.S. Department of Justice to compile data for population specific classification criteria using geometric morphometrics. Their aim was to create an extensive population database from 3D landmarks on human crania, to develop and validate population specific procedures for classification of unknown individuals, and develop software to use in forensic identification. They placed 3D landmarks on 75 craniofacial landmarks from European, African, and Hispanic populations of about 1000 individuals with a Microscribe digitizer. The software they developed, called 3D-ID, can classify unknown individuals into probable sex and ancestry, and allows for fragmentary and damaged specimens to be used. A copy of the full manuscript can be found here: Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls Sex estimation of os coxae Geometric morphometrics can also be used to capture the slight shape variations found in postcranial bones of the human body such as os coxae. Bierry and colleagues used 3D CT reconstructions of modern adult pelvic bones for 104 individuals to look at the shape of the obturator foramen. After a normalization technique to take out the factor of size, they outlined the obturator foramen with landmarks and semilandmarks to capture its shape. They chose the obturator foramen because it tends to be oval in males and triangular in females. The results show a classification accuracy of 88.5% for males and 80.8% for females using a Discriminant Fourier Analysis. Another study done by Gonzalez and colleagues used geometric morphometrics to capture the complete shape of the ilium and ischiopubic ramus. They placed landmarks and semilandmarks on 2D photographic images of 121 left pelvic bones from a collection of undocumented skeletons at the Museu Anthropol√≥gico de Coimbra in Portugal. Since the pelvic bones were of unknown origin, they used a K-means Cluster Analysis to determine a sex category before performing a Discriminant Function analysis. The results had a classification accuracy for the greater sciatic notch of 90.9% and the ischiopubic ramus at 93.4 to 90.1% =Shape variation of archaeological assemblages= In archaeology, Geometric morphometrics are used to examine the shape variations or standardization of artifacts to answer questions about typological and technological changes. Most applications are for stone tools to measure variations in morphology between different assemblage groups to understand their functions. Some applications to pottery shape is to identify the level of standardization to explore ceramic production and its implication about social organization .

Adapted from the novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur, the production focuses on Joe Morgan after he has become a hopeless drunkard. Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight between the two men and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper. Before Mary dies she asks her father to promise to swear off alcohol and he accepts. He is reformed and becomes successful, while the saloon-keeper is killed in a fight in an irony of fate. The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  The work was an adaptation of Timothy Shay Arthur's novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There. The Moving Picture World synopsis states: \\"Despite the fact that he is a loving husband and father, Joe Morgan ruins his life by his fondness for drink and finally becomes a seemingly hopeless drunkard. He spends his time and money in the saloon kept by Slade, the man who took away Joe's mill and largely caused his financial ruin. Slade's saloon, when he first opened it, was well furnished, the landlord courteous and well groomed, and the customers happy and seemingly unaffected by their surroundings. But as time passed, a change for the worse was noted in everything. Probably this escaped Joe's notice, for a sharp shot, indeed, was needed to reform him. That shock came. Joe's only daughter, Mary, was in the habit of going to the saloon and piteously urging her father to come home. She knew that no matter how intoxicated he might be, he would never harm her. But one evening when she appeared her father and Slade had been quarreling, and the saloonkeeper threw a bottle at Morgan, who dodged. The missile struck the child, entering. The blow resulted fatally, but before Mary died, she extracted a promise from her grief-stricken father that he would never drink again, a promise which he ever-afterward kept. In later years Joe became wealthy and respected, and influenced by the thought of his daughter in heaven he kept in the straight and narrow path. The saloon keeper who killed Mary was never punished by the law - but through the irony of fate his taking off was much like that of Joe Morgan's helpless child.\\"  Cast  *Frank H. Crane as Joe Morgan *Marie Eline as Little Mary  Production  The production was based on Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur. The plot focused on the dangers of alcoholism and the downfall of those taken in by its effects. In the 1850s, sales of the novel were second only to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. The production was adapted for the stage in 1858 and while it did not perform well on Broadway, it proved to be a lasting success. Dozens of productions would cross the United States for the next sixty years and the play proved to be a major influence on the Temperance movement, resulting in the passage of temperance laws. It is likely that the writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only the roles of Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline are known. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.  Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 4, 1910. The film was released outside of the planned order due to a scheduling conflict. Originally The American and the Queen was planned to be released on this date, but it was instead pushed back to November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News stated that the costuming and lace curtains on the windows of the home betrayed the supposed poverty of the Morgan family. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News, stated, \\"This title would be completely misunderstood by the majority of moving picture show attendants. Some sporadic 'reformer' who does not know the original and who has never seen the film will fill 'space' on the iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title. If he did see the film it has not the necessary power to grapple with the terrible reality of a too common incident in daily life.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror was more picky in its wording and praise, stating: \\"It was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form, and a reviewer must feel glad that it is over, for the film doesn't materially exalt the level of film output.\\" The review found the acting to be good, but found fault in the shadows of the actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at the Thanhouser Company by running an article that stated: \\"The Selig Company announces the production of Ten Nights in a Bar Room will not be confined to one reel, but will be given all the film that it requires for proper production. This departure from the restrictive limit of 1,000 feet gives promise that the drama will have adequate treatment.\\" Bowers states that the paper \\"was acting the role of a spoiler, for the Selig version was not released until a half year later, in June 1911, and, except for spite, there was no reason to mention it now.\\" Thomas S. Hischak, author of American Literature on Stage and Screen: 525 Works and Their Adaptations, claims that the Thanhouser production is the earliest known film adaptation of the novel. This is an error because Lubin would produce an adaptation, 700 feet in length, by October 1903.

Balls of Kryptonite is an enforcement action brought in 2009 by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in United States District Court for the Central District of California. The defendant was Jaivin Karnani, a Southern California man, his company Balls of Kryptonite LLC, and several other corporate names they did business as. In 2011 the FTC secured a court order barring Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite from engaging in many of the deceptive business practices that had brought him to the agency's attention.FTC v. Jaivin Karnani, Balls of Kryptonite, CV 09-05276 DDP (Ex). (C.D. Cal., 2011) For several years before the FTC brought its case, Karnani had been selling consumer electronic devices such as cameras, video game systems and computer software to customers in the United Kingdom. Despite being physically located in California, he registered his websites in British domains, quoted prices in pounds sterling and took other steps to suggest that the business was physically located in the U.K. Customers who bought the merchandise at the prices quoted, usually significantly lower than other, established British retailers, found that delivery took in some cases far longer than the promised 48 hours even though their credit cards were charged immediately and they were told they could not cancel their orders. In many cases, the goods they received were inoperable since they had never been intended for sale in the British or European markets, and were thus not protected by warranty. Complaints to the U.K.'s Office of Fair Trading (OFT) led to the FTC's enforcement action. In response to its initial complaint Judge Dean D. Pregerson issued a temporary restraining order barring Karnani and his companies from misrepresenting their location on their websites along with the other practices customers had complained to OFT about. It was the first time the FTC had brought an action against an American company that did business exclusively abroad, its first action enforcing the U.S./EU Safe Harbor Privacy Program and one of the first uses of its expanded ability to coordinate its efforts with foreign counterparts under the SAFE WEB Act Congress had passed several years earlier. The FTC's decision to pursue the case came in for some criticism. Some commentators, who thought the case title was humorous enough to make extended references to the Superman comics in their commentary, questioned whether the commission's action against a retailer who did not deceive any American consumers was a wise use of its limited resources, and whether it might have been better to prosecute him in Britain. Another, in the course of criticizing the failings of the European Union's Data Protection Directive when it came to dealing with cloud computing, did not criticize the enforcement action as such but showed that it pointed out how much more work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program. Background In 2006, the FTC later alleged, Karnani, a resident of Pasadena, California, created two companies, Best Price Brands LLC and Bite Size Deals LLC. He then registered websites in their names with the .co.uk top-level domain, offering consumer electronics such as cameras, video game systems, and computer software. Prices were given in pounds sterling‚Äîoften considerably below those charged by other online retailers. The domain name and the pound pricing led many visitors to believe that the company was based in the United Kingdom. British consumers began ordering items from the site in late 2006. Many found the goods and services deficient, and even fraudulent. For example, the company charged buyers' credit cards for their purchases immediately, promising delivery within 48 hours. Many orders, however, did not ship for weeks. Customers who called or emailed about this were often ignored, with those who persisted and/or supplemented their queries with complaints to the Better Business Bureau told that there were delays, such as the item being out of stock, which they had never consented to or been informed of prior to their purchase. When they tried to cancel their orders they were informed that \\"company policy\\", which they were not made aware of prior to purchase, did not allow them to do so at that point. Those to whom goods were delivered were often equally dissatisfied. Instructions were sometimes in Spanish or Chinese, making it difficult to use the product. Some products were shipped with plugs and internal wiring meant for the U.S. market, making them unusable in Britain (in a few cases, the company did provide a power converter, the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain turned out not to have been manufactured for sale there, or in the European Union (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' warranties. Those who attempted to return products met with similar resistance from the website owner, Balls of Kryptonite LLC, which Karnani formed and merged the other two companies into in mid-2007. They were variously told that the time limit for a refund has passed, or that a 50% restocking fee would be deducted from it. Customers seeking refunds had to mail the products back at their own expense. Only then did some learn that, despite the domain name, pricing and British address given in some correspondence, the company was actually located in California. This could have made them liable for the import taxes and customs duties on the goods. The company did state its true location on its websites, but not \\"clearly and conspicuously\\" enough to offset the perception that they were British, the FTC later said. This deceit had impacts beyond invalidating any warranties. It meant that, contrary to what British buyers may have thought, their country's regulations on mail-ordered products did not apply to their purchases. Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite also claimed on their website that they had self- certified their compliance with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Program for protection of personal data, when in fact they had not. Enforcement The dissatisfied customers complained to Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which handles consumer protection issues. Officials there got in touch with their counterparts at the FTC in the U.S. They were able to take action due to the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers Beyond Borders Act of 2006, commonly known as the SAFE WEB Act, which Congress had passed at the commission's request to help them coordinate actions against Internet fraudsters who operate across international boundaries with similar agencies in other countries, such as OFT. Most relevant to its case against Karnani, the legislation had clarified that the FTC had authority over American companies that did business exclusively with customers abroad. Its action against Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite was the first it had undertaken against one. In July 2009 commissioners voted 4‚Äì0 to proceed with the complaint; it was formally filed later that month in federal court for the Central District of California. A week later Judge Dean D. Pregerson issued a temporary restraining order barring Karnani, Balls of Kryptonite, any of his other companies (including one he had incorporated in Belize) and anyone employed by him from misrepresenting the company's physical location or its participation in any program sponsored by a third party through any means and delaying orders without giving the buyer a chance to consent to the delay or cancel it. The order also required that he make corporate financial records available to the FTC on request and not start any new companies without notifying their attorneys. Two years later, the FTC and Karnani settled the case with a consent decree. The defendants agreed to make the prohibitions of the 2009 order permanent. They were further barred from processing any transaction until the goods were ready to ship and not disputing any customer chargebacks made prior to a year before the decree. A $500,000 judgement against the defendants was entered, but suspended due to their inability to pay unless business records submitted in response to the FTC's requests were found to be falsified. Karnani and the other defendants admitted no wrongdoing. Analysis and commentary A few weeks after the consent decree, three lawyers at Arnold & Porter commented on the disposition of the case on their firm's consumer-protection law blog. The references to the Superman characters were a running gag in the post, prompted by the use of \\"kryptonite\\" in the defendant company's name. \\"[I]t could also be argued that it would have been more appropriate to prosecute BOK under Metropolis's‚Äîor rather, the UK's consumer protection laws,\\" they observed. \\"With increasingly more commerce being conducted over the Internet, it is likely that cross-border fraud similar to what occurred in this case will become more common,\\" they concluded. \\"As a result, the FTC may have tough decisions as to where to direct their resources, especially given the current budget crisis.\\" References Category:2011 in United States case law Balls of Kryptonite Category:Consumer protection case law Category:Internet fraud Category:United Kingdom‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"FTC v.

Born in the Tasmanian city of Hobart, she was the second of six children to Leonard Rodway and Louisa Susan, n√©e Phillips. She studied painting at the Hobart Technical College (now TasTAFE); after two years her work was sent to London, and she was awarded a three-year scholarship to study painting at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. She is best known for having painted portraits of notable figures in Australian history, including Dame Nellie Melba, William Bridges, J. F. Archibald and Henry Lawson. Early life Florence Aline Rodway was born in the family home on Macquarie Street, Hobart, Tasmania on 11 November 1881. She was the second child of six, having five brothers. Her father was dentist and botanist Leonard Rodway, an Englishman who migrated to Queensland, where he met and married Louisa Phillips, a dentist's daughter. They moved to Hobart and had five sons and a daughter. Rodway later recalled that she drew often and well as a child, so she studied art at the Hobart Technical School, under Benjamin Shepherd. After two years of study samples of her work were sent to London and she was awarded a four-year scholarship to study in London at the Royal Academy of Arts, a remarkable achievement for a Tasmanian artist, especially a woman, at that time. She was unable to complete the course as she could not afford to live in London and so returned to Australia, moving to Sydney, where she would establish her reputation as an artist. Early career (1906‚Äì1913) Rodway established a studio in Sydney and continued to study, under Sydney Long at the Julian Ashton Art School. She produced studies and illustrations for publications, including The Lone Hand. She joined the Society of Artists and exhibited in the Society members' shows. She developed her mastery of pastels, for which she was widely recognised. She was one of only a few female artists to be lauded as the equal of male artists. One 1909 critic went so far as to say that gender was irrelevant in her case: 'Sex is an accident ‚Äî the capacity for expressing the infinitely large or the infinitesimally little cannot be gauged by outward measurements. The soul frequently bears little relation to its case. Else, why does Florence Rodway, tall, slight and blonde, revel in peopling large spaces with the Titanic creatures of her imagination.' The Art Gallery of New South Wales purchased work in 1910 and from then her reputation as a portraitist only grew. She completed many portraits in pastel, especially of children, whom she was considered particularly skilled at depicting. She was commissioned to create portraits of notable figures including Dame Nellie Melba and Henry Lawson. Mid-career (1914‚Äì1930) In 1914 she had her first solo exhibition, of 40 portraits and pastel drawings at the Athenaeum Gallery in Melbourne. This included works lent by the owners (who were often the subjects of the works,) including Dame Nellie Melba, Julian Ashton and J.F. Archibald. She sat for a portrait painted by Norman Carter (in the collection of the State Library of New South Wales.) In a newspaper review of the Society of Artists' 1916 exhibition, she was commended as: 'the principal \\"dealer in magic and spells\\" due to pastel effort is Miss Florence Rodway, whose portraits are again one of the leading features of the show. The most striking example of her talent is the strong, young, handsome face of a woman full of vitality and expression, in which the flesh-tones show up admirably against the yellow, gold-tinted background. Miss Rodway's portraits of children are charming, and we like also the homely interior entitled \\"The New Teapot,\\" in which the artist's fine appreciation of the pastel medium is markedly apparent.' She was commissioned to paint portraits for major public collections. The Art Gallery of New South Wales commissioned portraits of J.F. Archibald (1921) and William Bridges (1919). The Australian War Memorial commissioned portraits of William Bridges (1920), Henry Normand MacLaurin (1922) and Captain Walter Gilchrist (1925). She married civil engineer Walter Moore in 1920, and had a daughter, Suzanne, in 1922. Marriage and motherhood seem to slow down her career, but she continued to paint and exhibit. She was chosen to represent Australia in 1928, with other artists including Thea Proctor, Margaret Preston, John Longstaff, Arthur Streeton and Hans Heysen, at the London exhibition of contemporary art of the Empire at the Imperial Institute, South Kensington. Later career (1931‚Äì1971) Rodway and her family moved to Hobart in 1932. She exhibited paintings in the 1934 Women Artists of Australia exhibition in Sydney and held two exhibitions with fellow Tasmanian artist Edith Holmes at the Westminster Gallery, Melbourne, in 1948 and at the Adult Education Board, Hobart, in 1953. She showed work in the 1950-51 exhibitions of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and continued to exhibit with the Art Society of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Group of Painters. She died in Hobart on 23 January 1971.

Her father initiates an independent investigation, and finds Ziv Nevo hanging around the apartment a few days after the rape. The father believes Nevo is the rapist and successfully convinces his daughter and Eli Nahum, the police officer investigating the case. Nevo is a mob member and telling the truth about his deeds at the crime scene could get him killed. At the beginning Nevo admits the crime, but later he recants. Consequently detective Nahum is fired. Nahum makes up his mind to clear his name and carries on his own investigation to find the real rapist. Kirkus Reviews (starred review): An elderly woman witnesses a rape as she scans the street with her high-powered binoculars, but at first, she decides not to get involved. The victim‚Äôs father helps identify a suspect named Ziv Nevo, and Detective Eli Nahum believes he has an easy case. Nevo has been found at the crime scene with no plausible explanation. He is innocent of the rape, but his real reason for being in the neighborhood is even worse. He is‚Äîwell, it has to do with the Mafia. Detective Nahum is experienced, confident and careless, ready to take shortcuts and get the case over with. Under interrogation, Nevo is afraid to explain what he was doing at night in a strange neighborhood. In fact, he thinks he‚Äôs been caught for what he was really doing. Once he caves and admits he did it, he finally learns what ‚Äúit‚Äù is. His protestation that he didn't rape anyone can‚Äôt keep him out of prison. Meanwhile, Nahum gets caught carrying on an affair with a woman in the chief‚Äôs office. Nahum‚Äôs career and his marriage collapse at about the same time he realizes what shoddy police work he has done. The good news? Now he has plenty of time to exonerate Nevo, learn his secret and‚Äîperhaps hardest of all‚Äîrebuild his own marriage. What begins as a crime thriller becomes the story of a detective‚Äôs search for redemption. This book marks the author‚Äôs U.S. debut.

Asylum City, 2012 Michal Poleg is a young social activist assisting African migrant workers in southern Tel Aviv. Poleg accuses certain members of the Knesset of a merciless endeavors to deport the refugees. A few days after filing a formal complaint, Poleg's corpse is found in her apartment after a brutal murder. Gabriel Takela came from Africa to Israel, crossing Sinai Peninsula, where his sister was kidnapped by the Bedouin, and sold to prostitution. The kidnappers demand 20 thousand shekels for her release. Takela came to Poleg's appatment in order to ask her for help, and find her dead body. A neighbor accidentally enters the apartment, convinced that Takela is the murderer. Officer Anat Nachmias has never been asked to lead an investigation until she is assigned to Michal's case. Determined not to let her superiors‚Äîor Michal‚Äîdown, she resolves to leave no avenue unexplored. But the deeper Anat delves into Michal's activism, the more she is convinced that the working theory is wrong, especially when she can't believe a word of the young African man who soon confesses to the crime. What she does believe is that Michal, a petite, opinionated woman, got herself involved in something much bigger, and far more dangerous, than she could handle. Joined by Michal's clumsy but charming boss, Itai, Anat descends into a shadowy, amoral underworld where war victims and criminals, angels and demons, idealists and cynics, aid organizations and criminal syndicates intersect‚Äîand the ruthless prey on the weak. What she discovers will shock the city and set in motion events that will have dramatic, far-reaching consequences. Publishers Weekly (starred review): \\"Israeli author Shoham follows his U.S. debut, 2013‚Äôs Lineup, with another triumph, a crime novel that shares characters with the earlier book. When Michal Poleg, an activist for the rights of illegal African immigrants, is found murdered in her Tel Aviv apartment, strong evidence implicates one of the very people she had been helping, Gabriel Takela, who was seen fleeing her home right after the murder. Unwilling to go along with the easy answer to the case, Insp. Anat Nachmias digs deeper and antagonizes her superiors, who hope to wrap things up quickly. Anat‚Äôs investigation and its effects on others‚Äô lives are shown from the nuanced perspectives of a state prosecutor, who‚Äôs afraid that he may have killed his former lover without remembering the act, and an accountant working for a crime lord who has developed a new way to take advantage of the African community.

Publishers Weekly Blood Oranges, 2014 Shirly Gerbi, a pregnant woman, entering Petah Tikva police station to report that her husband Tamir, a journalist by profession, is missing. Detective Anat Nahmias is in charge of the investigation. Gerbi's dead body is found in the orchards and next to him the gun that killed him. The investigators hold the opinion that Gerbi committed suicide, but Nahmias believes he was murdered. To find her way through the maze of intrigue she is forced to enlist the help of Ido Dolev, a cynical, sharp political consultant who drives her crazy but also makes her feel alive. Anat struggles with her intense attraction to Ido, with the police‚Äôs indifference and particularly with herself. Anat and Ido are in a race against time. Together they uncover the truth simmering behind Petach Tikvah‚Äôs sleepy streets, the cruel power struggles hiding within the well-kept suburbs, the bubbling corruption that runs through the seemingly serene city. In ‚ÄúBlood Oranges‚Äù Liad Shoham presents a twisty tumultuous plot, alive with good homes, crime families, human failings and fatal betrayals. With excellent timing and shrewd talent, Shoham penetrates the heart of calm and content Israeli bourgeois, exposing its hidden secrets. Alit Karp, Haaretz: '\\"Blood Oranges\\", Liad Shoham's thriller, became a best-seller overnight due to a serious inquiry, a balance between the plot and the characters, and a close relation to the real life in Israel. But not just connection to reality made the book a best-seller, but also the fact it succeed in giving his readers a good balance between characters and the story. Since the book hassuch a solid realistic foundations, it easily convincing the readers in the plots it presents. Furthermore, the combination Shoham serves as a writer between his acquaintance of the Israel society and his understanding of the human soul is fascinating. He also has a saying that isn't entertainment alone that the same greed and drives are the same in every place on earth. He succeeded in adapting all this material into a suspense story.Karp, Alit.

One of Ours, 2016 On a cold winter day, the brutal murder of the local principal shakes Gofna, a little solitary religious settlement in the Binyamin mountains. Yoav, the son of the settlement's rabbi and spiritual leader, is taking a leave of absence from his training for the Israeli Security Agency (\\"Shabak\\") to introduce Anat, his new girlfriend, to his parents. But Inspector Anat Nachmias is not his partner, but a police detective he‚Äôs met only a few days earlier, when they were both tasked with the undercover investigation of the principal's murder. Yoav and Anat now have just forty eight hours to prove the murder was not an act of terrorism before the entire area ignites.

One way of dealing with it is by doing thorough research. Not only does good research greatly enrich the story, it gives the book a high level of credibility.

He told that the TV series \\"The Wire\\" influenced on his writing by presenting the story from different point of view: \\"Lineup\\" is my fifth book. In all of my previous books, there was one protagonist who led the plot. This time, I wanted to write a book from different perspectives. When a crime occurs, it affects the lives of many people. I wanted to tell the story through the eyes of the victim, the criminal, their families, the police, attorneys, judges, media, and crime organizations. I believe that not only is the story more dramatic and richer, but the reader also receives a wider panoramic picture. The reader understands how things really work, what happens \\"behind the scenes\\" and the various interests of all of the players. In this regard, the television series \\"The Wire\\" had an enormous effect on me. I watched it with my wife when she was towards the end of her pregnancy, and was having difficulty sleeping.

Produced by TVB with Raymond Lee serving as producer, the series ran on its channel Jade from 3 to 28 September 1984. Plot During the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, a \\"Demon Region\\" appeared in the martial world. The \\"Demon Region\\" left a trail of destruction and gave hardships for the livelihood of people. In order to eliminate the \\"Demon Region\\", the Wudang Sect dispatches a group of elite disciples to attack. The disciples fail to do so and Mo Chan-chi (Chu Tit-wo), head of the Sect, pushes the blame to disciples Fu Ching-wan (Andy Lau) and Mo-yung Pak (Lawrence Ng). Because of this, the entire martial world is hunting after Fu and Mo-yung, and the two of them eventually take refuge to the \\"Demon\\". Fu and Mo-yung, however, were surprised to discover that the \\"Demon Region\\" is not an actual demon region, but is in fact, is an utopian society. It also turns out that Fu and Mo-yung were actually sent undercover by the Wudang Sect to investigate the \\"Demon Region\\". Under the sabotage of Mo-yun, the citizens of the \\"Demon Region\\" turn against each other and massacre one another. Fu, on the other hand, was deceived by Mo, which led Fu Chin-san (Shih Kien), leader of \\"Demon Region\\", to consume poisoned wine. \\"Demon Region\\" was ultimately destroyed by the many sects of the martial world. However, unexpected to Fu, who is in deep regret, Fu Chin-san turns out to be his biological father. When he was about to confront Mo Chan-chi about this matter, he accidentally kills Mo, who at the time was battling with Mo- yung. Because of this, Fu, who was named the \\"Young Warrior of Wudang\\", is now known as the \\"Son of the Demon Region\\". Mo-yung is then appointed as the successor to the head of Wudang where he kills Fu Chin-san, who has lost his martial arts ability due to consuming poison. Originally like brothers, Fu and Mo-yung have now became sworn enemies, leading the martial world into a bloody storm.

Bentley has said that the EXP 10 Speed Six will go on sale between 2018 and 2020, and will be available in coup√© and roadster versions, with an all-electric version using a similar powertrain as the Porsche Mission E, being available. A V6 plug-in hybrid and V8 engine variants, as well as a possible W12 engine may also be available.  Overview  The Bentley EXP 10 is two seat coupe smaller than the existing Bentley Continental GT. It takes its name from the 6¬Ωlit. Bentley Speed Six of the late 1920s. The project was managed by Bentley's head of design, Luc Donckerwolke. It is fitted with a V6 but the production version of the concept is expected within three years and will be fitted with the 500 bhp 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 from the Continental GT. The expected price of the model is ¬£120,000 (about US$173,000)  Design  The Bentley EXP 10 Speed Six represents a new design direction for Bentley, and is a significant departure from the brand's current styling language. The Speed 6 retains Bentley's signature dual round full-LED headlamps, but the main headlamp is almost an oval-shape, but when seen from head-on it appears to be perfectly round. The second headlamps is similar to the second headlamps of the Bentayga and Mulsanne, and is smaller than the main headlamp and features an integrated headlamp-washer. The rear tail-lights are different than any the taillights of any other Bentley vehicle. The taillights are red-coloured glass and are in an oval shape, they protrude from the rear of the car and are full-LED taillights, and their shape is almost exactly the same shape as seen in the Speed Six's wide dual tailpipes. The Speed Six is Bentley's first two-seater, and it features an aerodynamic design with many different creases and lines in its body, and Bentley's signature \\"Flying B\\" design element has been the inspiration for the b-shaped crease on the Speed Six's side panels and doors. And a Flying B side-grill is present as well. Additionally, the Speed 6 is Bentley's first use of 3D printing, with parts of the grill and other parts of the body being 3D-printed. The grill is Bentley's signature mesh-like grill, and features for the first-time a \\"3D design\\". The Speed 6 is still a coachbuilt and mostly-handmade car, just as other Bentley's are. Inside the Speed 6 features several curved OLED displays, the first use of curved and OLED technology in a Bentley. For a car of its class, it features an unprecedented amount of leather, wood veneers, bespoke options, and interior appointments compared to its potential rivals including the Lamborghini Huracan, Jaguar F-Type, Porsche 911, Ferrari California, and others. File:Bentley EXP 10 003.JPGTrunk space  Powertrain  The concept car featured a V6 plug-in hybrid powertrain, the first V6 plug-in hybrid powertrain ever used in a Bentley concept or production vehicle (a V8 plug-in hybrid was used in the Mulsanne Hybrid Concept in 2014). Although the concept car was shown with a V6 plug-in hybrid, the production version has been confirmed to likely include an all-electric version, which will be Bentley's first all-electric vehicle, and its second plug-in vehicle (after the Bentayga V8 plug-in hybrid which will arrive in 2017) There has been speculation of a V8 being available, the same engine used in the Continental GT, and it is likely to be available in the production version as well. There will likely be a Speed or Supersports version of the EXP 10 Speed Six and it has been suggested that there may be a W12 engine available as well. It is very unlikely that there will be a diesel engine available, unlike in the Bentayga (which will feature a diesel engine as an option in 2017).  Production  The Bentley EXP 10 Speed Six has been approved for production and will be available in coupe and convertible variants, along with a choice of all- electric, V6-plug in hybrid, V8 and possibly W12 powertrain options available. It is expected to go on sale anytime from 2017 to 2020, and will likely be shown in production form at an auto show in the latter part of 2016. The production variant could be called Barnato, a homage to former Bentley chairman and race car driver Woolf Barnato.

The commando had an initial strength of 737, and fought at: * Fourteen Streams, * Magersfontein, * Kimberley, * in Western Transvaal, * Tweebosch, and * Carter's Ridge. Together with its neighbouring commandos it was part of the force under Boer General de La Rey. In 1901, this commando fell under the control of acting Assistant Commandant General Jan Smuts. It was reorganised with the remnants of other commandos after the Battle of Nooitgedacht. A Commandant Tollie de Beer with the remaining 400 mounted men were instructed to continue to obstruct the Mafekeng line.Hancock, W.H, Van der Poel, J.

It is the only student-run group of its kind in the country. Press Club alumni have gone on to careers in journalism at publications including The New York Times, the Washington Post, Vanity Fair, Forbes, and the New Yorker and have won the Pulitzer Prize. In addition to freelancing, Press Club members also run a blog called The Ink, covering campus events at Princeton. Overview The University Press Club is a highly selective group of undergraduate students who write professionally for a variety of newspapers and magazines in the northeast and United States. The club was founded in 1900, making it one of the oldest student organizations at Princeton University. Members typically write for a number of papers during their three or four years with the club, filing stories on a range of topics from speeches at the University, higher education trends, and events at Ivy League schools. In the past year, members have been published in papers such as The New York Times, TIME, USA Today, the South China Morning Post, the Atlantic, the Star-Ledger, the Asbury Park Press, and the Times of Trenton. Members are chosen through a three-month application process called Candidates Period. During Candidates Period, candidates write fifteen mock articles across three \\"folders,\\" or sections of the application process, and submit them for consideration to Club members. Each candidate meets one-on-one with a Club member after each folder to discuss their stories and receive feedback. Press Clubbers cover breaking news, feature stories, and sporting events at Princeton University and in the surrounding community. As stringers, each member works with professional editors and is paid on a per-story basis. On campus, the University Press Club regularly sponsors lectures and events for the Princeton community, including the annual Louis Rukeyser ‚Äô54 Memorial Lecture Series, which brings prominent journalists to the university. Past speakers include Jill Abramson formerly with The New York Times, David Remnick ‚Äô81 from the New Yorker, Evan Thomas from Newsweek, Jim Kelly ‚Äô76 from Time, Matthew Cooper formerly with Time, and Todd Purdum ‚Äô82 from Vanity Fair. The University Press Club also hosts dinners with visiting journalism professors and alumni throughout the year. The Press Club is advised and guided by an Alumni Board, made up of Club alumni from a wide range of graduation years.  History  The Press Club was founded in April 1900 by undergraduate journalists who worked as correspondents for newspapers across the country. The club was conceived as a collective reporting enterprise that would pool quotes and leads, and membership was sold to the highest bidder. In 1915 the Club introduced an application process called candidates period. Over the course of three months, applicants would conference with current members of the club to eventually produce three folders of full-length news stories. In 1979, a group of Press Club members founded the campus weekly student newspaper the Nassau Weekly.

Such practices have included denying patients the right to informed consent, using pseudoscientific frameworks such as race science, and torturing people under the guise of research. Around World War II, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany carried out brutal experiments on prisoners and civilians through groups like Unit 731 or individuals like Josef Mengele; the Nuremberg Code was developed after the war in response to the Nazi experiments. Countries have carried out brutal experiments on marginalized populations. Examples include American abuses during Project MKUltra and the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, and the mistreatment of indigenous populations in Canada and Australia. The Declaration of Helsinki, developed by the World Medical Association (WMA), is widely regarded as the cornerstone document on human research ethics.WMA Press Release: WMA revises the Declaration of Helsinki. 9 October 2000 Nazi Germany Nazi Germany performed human experimentation on large numbers of prisoners (including children), largely Jews from across Europe, but also Romani, Sinti, ethnic Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals and disabled Germans, in its concentration camps mainly in the early 1940s, during World War II and the Holocaust. Prisoners were forced into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and no consent was given for the procedures. Typically, the experiments resulted in death, trauma, illness, shortening of life, disfigurement, or permanent disability, and as such are considered as examples of medical torture since the participants had to endure mass amounts of pain. At Auschwitz and other German camps, under the direction of Eduard Wirths, selected inmates were subjected to various hazardous experiments that were designed to help German military personnel in combat situations, develop new weapons, aid in the recovery of military personnel who had been injured, and to advance the racial ideology backed by the Third Reich. Aribert Heim conducted similar medical experiments at Mauthausen. Carl V√¶rnet is known to have conducted experiments on homosexual prisoners in attempts to \\"cure\\" homosexuality. After the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors' Trial, and the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. During the Nuremberg Trials, 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were tried for the unethical treatment of concentration camp inmates, who were often used as research subjects with fatal consequences. Of those 23, 16 were convicted (15 were convicted for the unethical treatment, while one of them was only convicted of SS membership), 7 were condemned to death, 9 received prison sentences from 10 years to life, and 7 were acquitted. =Before World War II= The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Defective Progeny, passed on 14 July 1933, legalized the involuntary sterilization of persons with diseases claimed to be hereditary: weak- mindedness, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, insanity, blindness, deafness, and physical deformities. The law was used to encourage growth of the Aryan race through the sterilization of persons who fell under the quota of being genetically defective. 1% of citizens between the age of 17 to 24 had been sterilized within 2 years of the law passing. Within 4 years, 300,000 patients had been sterilized.Dahl M. [Selection and destruction-treatment of \\"unworthy- to-live\\" children in the Third Reich and the role of child and adolescent psychiatry], Prax Kinderpsychol Kinderpsychiatr 2001;50:170-91. From about March 1941 to about January 1945, sterilization experiments were conducted at Auschwitz, Ravensbr√ºck, and other places by Dr. Carl Clauberg. The purpose of these experiments was to develop a method of sterilization which would be suitable for sterilizing millions of people with a minimum of time and effort. These experiments were conducted by means of X-ray, surgery and various drugs. Thousands of victims were sterilized. Aside from its experimentation, the Nazi government sterilized around 400,000 people as part of its compulsory sterilization program. Intravenous injections of solutions speculated to contain iodine and silver nitrate were successful, but had unwanted side effects such as vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and cervical cancer. Therefore, radiation treatment became the favored choice of sterilization. Specific amounts of exposure to radiation destroyed a person‚Äôs ability to produce ova or sperm. The radiation was administered through deception. Prisoners were brought into a room and asked to complete forms, which took two to three minutes. In this time, the radiation treatment was administered and, unknown to the prisoners, they were rendered completely sterile. Many suffered severe radiation burns. Dr. Eugen Fischer began sterilization experimentation in German-occupied South West Africa during World War I. A supporter of forced sterilization as a means to prevent the growth of inferior populations and a member of the Nazi Party, Fischer focused his experimentation on mixed- race children in order to justify the Nazi Party's ban on interracial marriage. As a result of Fischer's research in Namibia, Germany prohibited marriages between people of different races in its colonies.Friedlander, Henry. 1997. The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution', University of North Carolina Press =During World War II= Jewish twins were kept alive to be used in Josef Mengele's medical experiments. These children from Auschwitz were liberated by the Red Army in January 1945. The Luftwaffe performed a series of 360 to 400 experiments at Dachau and Auschwitz, in which hypothermia was induced in 280 to 300 victims. These were conducted for the Nazi high command to simulate the conditions the armies suffered on the Eastern Front, as the German forces were ill-prepared for the cold weather they encountered. Many experiments were conducted on captured Russian troops; the Nazis wondered whether their genetics gave them superior resistance to cold. Approximately 100 people are reported to have died as a result of these experiments.Neurnberg Military Tribunal, Volume I ¬∑ Page 200 In early 1942, prisoners at Dachau concentration camp were used by Sigmund Rascher in experiments to aid German pilots who had to eject at high altitudes. A low-pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000 m (66,000 ft). Of the 200 subjects, 80 died outright, and the others were executed. Other experiments included: experiments on twins (such as sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins),Josef Mengele and Experimentation on Human Twins at Auschwitz , Children of the Flames; Dr. Josef Mengele and the Untold Story of the Twins of Auschwitz, Lucette Matalon Lagnado and Sheila Cohn Dekel, and Mengele: the Complete Story by Gerald Posner and John Ware. an experiment in repeated head injury which drove a boy insane,Small, Martin; Vic Shayne. \\"Remember Us: My Journey from the Shtetl through the Holocaust\\", Page 135, 2009. experiments at Buchenwald where poisons were secretly administered in food, experiments to test the effect of various pharmaceutical preparations on phosphorus burns induced with material from incendiary bombs, experiments at Ravensbr√ºck to investigate the effectiveness of sulfonamide after infection with bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (the causative agent in gas gangrene) and Clostridium tetani (the causative agent in tetanus),Schaefer, Naomi. The Legacy of Nazi Medicine, The New Atlantis, Number 5, Spring 2004, pp. 54‚Äì60. experiments conducted to attempt treatments of chemical burns induced by mustard gas and similar compounds, and experiments at Dachau to study various methods of making sea water drinkable. Many of the subjects died as a result of the experiments, while many others were executed after the tests were completed to study the effect post mortem. Those who survived were often left mutilated, suffering permanent disability, weakened bodies, and mental distress. The results of the Dachau freezing experiments have been used in some modern research into the treatment of hypothermia, with at least 45 publications having referenced the experiments since the Second World War. This, together with the recent use of data from Nazi research into the effects of phosgene gas, has proven controversial and presents an ethical dilemma for modern physicians who do not agree with the methods used to obtain this data. Some object on an ethical basis, and others have rejected Nazi research purely on scientific grounds, pointing out methodological inconsistencies. In an often-cited review of the Dachau hypothermia experiments, Berger states that the study has \\"all the ingredients of a scientific fraud\\" and that the data \\"cannot advance science or save human lives.\\" Several Nazi experimenters were after the war employed by the United States government in Operation Paperclip and later similar efforts. Japan =Empire of Japan= Japanese Unit 731 Complex that used humans for experimentation for biological and chemical weapons, as well as live vivisections and other experiments Human subject research in Japan began in World War II. It continued for some years after. Unit 731, a department of the Imperial Japanese Army located near Harbin (then in the puppet state of Manchukuo, in northeast China), experimented on prisoners by conducting vivisections, dismemberments, and bacterial inoculations. It induced epidemics on a very large scale from 1932 onward through the Second Sino-Japanese war. It also conducted biological and chemical weapons tests on prisoners and captured POWs. With the expansion of the empire during World War II, similar units were set up in conquered cities such as Nanking (Unit 1644), Beijing (Unit 1855), Guangzhou (Unit 8604) and Singapore (Unit 9420). After the war, Supreme Commander of the Occupation Douglas MacArthur gave immunity in the name of the United States to Shiro Ishii and all members of the units in exchange for all of the results of their experiments. The United States blocked Soviet access to this information. The Soviets prosecuted some of the Unit 731 members during its Khabarovsk War Crime Trials. In November 2006, Doctor Akira Makino confessed to Kyodo news that he had performed surgery and amputations on condemned prisoners, including women and children, in 1944 and 1945 while he was stationed on Mindanao. Most of Makino's victims were Moro Muslims.AFP A life haunted by WWII surgical killings 2007.

In 2007, Doctor Ken Yuasa testified to The Japan Times and said that he believes that at least 1,000 persons working for the Sh≈çwa regime, including surgeons, conducted surgical research on mainland China. =State of Japan= In incidents throughout the 1950s, former Unit 731 members infected prisoners and mental health patients with deadly diseases. In 1958, a large number of infants were brought to Kobe Medical School and forcibly administered sugar by having needles inserted through their noses and into their stomachs. A tube was inserted into their anuses to determine how the sugar was processed by their digestive systems. Many of the infants experienced diarrhea and anal bleeding. The parents were never informed that their children were being used as test subjects.

The experiments were motivated by a system of scientific racism and were carried out by researchers from the University of Adelaide. In 2002, the vice chancellor of the university described the experiments as \\"degrading and in some cases barbarous\\" and the school issued a formal apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups.  Indigenous populations in Canada  Canada has historically carried out unethical medical experiments on indigenous populations in concert with its policies of forced cultural assimilation. In 1933, about 600 Native children from the reserves near Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan were enrolled in a trial to test the tuberculosis vaccine. In both the control and treatment groups nearly a fifth died from exposure, malnutrition, and other causes. Parental consent was not sought for indigenous children, though it was sought for the non-indigenous. Between 1942 and 1952, malnourished children from six residential schools were used in experiments without consent or parental notification. They were split into treatment and control groups and denied adequate nutrition as they were used to determine whether certain combinations of supplements mitigated problems. Children died, developed anemia, and were denied dental care as they developed cavities and gingivitis. The experiments were run by the Department of Indian Affairs of Canada and directed by Percy Moore and Frederick Tisdall, a former president of the Canadian Paediatric Society. In 2014, the Society released a statement outlining guidelines for community-based participatory research involving Inuit, M√©tis, and First Nations youth. Guatemala From 1946 to 1948 U.S. scientific researchers in Guatemala infected hundreds of mental patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Researchers from the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) conducted experiments on approximately 1,500 male and female patients housed at Guatemala's National Mental Health Hospital. The scientists injected the patients with gonorrhea and syphilis‚Äîand encouraged many of them to pass the disease on to others. The experiments were done in cooperation with the Guatemalan government. The PHS carried out the experiments under the guise of syphilis inoculations. In 2010 these experiments were revealed by Susan Reverby of Wellesley College, who was researching a book on the Tuskegee syphilis experiments. The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued an official apology to Guatemala. President Barack Obama apologized to President √Ålvaro Colom, who had called these experiments 'a crime against humanity'. North Korea Sweden The Vipeholm experiments were a series of human experiments where patients of Vipeholm Hospital for intellectually disabled in Lund, Sweden, were fed large amounts of sweets to provoke dental caries between 1945 and 1955. The experiments were sponsored both by the sugar industry and dentist community, in an effort to determine whether carbohydrates affected the formation of cavities. The experiments provided extensive knowledge about dental health and resulted in enough empirical data to link the intake of sugar to dental caries. However, today they are considered to have violated the principles of medical ethics. Soviet Union United Kingdom De-classified documents of the National Archives revealed that during the 1930s and 1940s, the British Army used hundreds of British and native British Indian Army soldiers as \\"guinea pigs\\" in their experiments to determine if mustard gas inflicted greater damage on Indian skin compared to British skin. It is unclear whether the trial subjects, some of whom were hospitalised by their injuries, were all volunteers. In the 1950s, leading aircraftman Ronald Maddison was killed when he was exposed to 200 milligrams of sarin at Porton Down. He had believed that he was testing a cure for the common cold, and in 2004 a High Court ruled his death \\"unlawful.\\" Between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence secretly dispersed potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms across much of the country to evaluate readiness against a biological attack from the Soviet Union. They dropped zinc cadmium sulphide from airplanes and dispersed it by land to track the spread of fluorescent particles, and also spread e.coli, bacillus globigii, and serratia marcescens bacteria. United States Since the late 19th century, numerous human experiments were performed in the United States, which were later characterized as unethical. They were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, consent, or informed consent of the test subjects. Examples have included the deliberate infection of people with deadly or debilitating diseases, exposing people to biological and chemical weapons, human radiation experiments, injecting people with toxic and radioactive chemicals, surgical experiments, interrogation/torture experiments, tests involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. Many of these tests were performed on children and mentally disabled individuals. In many of the studies, a large number of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, and/or prisoners. Often, subjects were sick or disabled people, whose doctors told them that they were receiving \\"medical treatment.\\" They were used as the subjects of harmful and deadly experiments, without their knowledge or consent. In reaction to this, interest groups and institutions have worked to design policies and oversight to ensure that future human subject research in the United States would be ethical and legal. During World War II, Fort Detrick in Maryland was the headquarters of US biological warfare experiments. Operation Whitecoat involved the injection of infectious agents into military forces to observe their effects in human subjects. Public outcry over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the Church Committee, Rockefeller Commission, and Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, amongst others. These inquiries have not resulted in prosecutions. Not all subjects involved in the trials have been compensated or notified that they were subjects of such trials. In the 1950s and 1960s, Chester M. Southam injected HeLa cancer cells into healthy individuals, cancer patients, and prison inmates from the Ohio Penitentiary. This experiment raised many bioethical concerns involving informed consent, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Some of Southam's subjects, namely those that already had cancer, were unaware that they were being injected with malignant cells. Additionally, in one of these patients, the cells metastasized to her lymph nodes. In 1962, the Kefauver- Harris Drug Amendment was passed by the United States Congress. This amendment made changes to the Federal Food Drug & Consumer Act by requiring drug companies to prove both safety and effectiveness of their products. Consequently, drugs were required to have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before being marketed to consumers. Additionally, informed consent became a participation requirement and rules were put into place. This regulation was influenced by the results of 1950 use of thalidomide in Western Europe for pregnant women. They were prescribed the sedative thalidomide, which was inaccurately marketed as a morning sickness treatment. Women gave birth to more than 12,000 infants born with deformities due to effects from the drug in utero. In the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from 1932 to 1972, the United States Public Health Service contracted with the Tuskegee Institute for a long-term study of syphilis. During the study, more than 600 African- American men were studied who were not told they had syphilis. In an effort to better understand the disease, researchers denied the men access to the known treatment of the antibiotic penicillin. They recorded observations of the effects of the disease over time. Under the impression they were being treated for \\"bad blood\\", the participants were given free healthcare by the government.Gray, Fred D. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, Montgomery: New South Books, 1998. As ineffective treatment was given to the subjects, two-thirds of the group had died by the end of the 40-year experiment. A leak in 1972 led to cessation of the study and severe legal ramifications. It has been widely regarded as the \\"most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history\\". Because of the public outrage, in 1974 Congress passed the National Research Act, to provide for protection of human subjects in experiments. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was established. It was tasked with establishing the boundary between research and routine practice, the role of risk-benefit analysis, guidelines for participation, and the definition of informed consent. Its Belmont Report established three tenets of ethical research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Project MKUltra ‚Äî sometimes referred to as the \\"CIA's mind control program\\" ‚Äî was the code name given to an illegal program of experiments on human subjects, designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. Organized through the Scientific Intelligence Division of the CIA, the project coordinated with the Special Operations Division of the U.S. Army's Chemical Corps.Advisory on Human Radiation Experiments, July 5, 1994, National Security Archives, retrieved January 16, 2014 The program began in the early 1950s, was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967 and officially halted in 1973. The program engaged in many illegal activities;Chapter 3: Supreme Court Dissents Invoke the Nuremberg Code: CIA and DOD Human Subjects Research Scandals U.S. Senate Report on CIA MKULTRA Behavioral Modification Program 1977  Public Intelligence in particular it used unwitting U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as various forms of torture. =Beecher Paper= In a 1966 paper noted Harvard anesthesiologist Henry K. Beecher described 22 published medical studies in which patients had been subjects with no expected benefit to the patient of the experiment. Reprint in Harkness, Lederer & Wikler, 2001, This has been characterized as unethical. For example, patients infused with live cancer cells had been told in one study that they were receiving \\"some cells,\\" without being told this was cancer. Though identities of the authors and institutions had been stripped, the 22 studies were later identified as having been conducted by mainstream researchers and published in prestigious journals within approximately the previous decade. The 22 cases had been selected from a set of 50 that Beecher had collected. He presented evidence that such unethical studies were widespread and represented a systemic problem in medical research rather than exceptions. Beecher had been writing about human experimentation and publicizing cases that he considered to be bad practice for nearly a decade. His 1965 briefing to science writers and his 1966 paper gained widespread news coverage and stimulated public reaction. The paper has been described as \\"the most influential single paper ever written about experimentation involving human subjects.\\" The United States Office for Human Research Protections credits Beecher through this paper as \\"ultimately contributing to the impetus for the first NIH and FDA regulations.\\" Beecher was instrumental in developing solutions to such abuses. He noted that a common element in these studies was that some experimental subjects, such as military personnel or mentally handicapped children in institutions, were not in a position to freely decline consent. Beecher believed that rules requiring informed consent were not alone sufficient, as truly informed consent was an unattainable ideal. He worked both to define the rules and conditions for informed consent, and to establish institutional review boards as an additional layer of oversight regarding research protocols. International drug trials Since the late 20th century, African nations have often been the sites of clinical testing by large international pharmaceutical companies. In some cases, rural communities have developed iatrophobia (fear of doctors) after undergoing or learning of highly controversial medical experimentation. The fundamental distrust lies in the potential confrontation of Hobson's choice: \\"Experimental medicine or no medicine at all\\". Multiple cases of ethically questionable experiments have been documented.Washington, Harriet A. Medical Apartheid, Anchor Books, 2006, p394 In the late 20th century, Depo-Provera was clinically tested on Zimbabwean women. Once approved, the drug was used as a population control measure in the 1970s. Commercial farm owners put pressure on native women workers to accept the use of Depo-Provera. Population control interests motivated many of the family planning programs. This led to its eventual ban in Zimbabwe. A 1996 clinical trial in Kano, Nigeria involving the Pfizer drug Trovan to treat meningitis resulted in 200 children being disabled and the deaths of 11. Because of these casualties, the Nigerian government sued Pfizer over whether it had appropriately obtained informed consent.Washington, Harriet A. Medical Apartheid, Anchor Books, 2006, p392-393 Pfizer argued in court that it had met all regulations for drug testing. Many Nigerians mistrust the use of medical vaccines and also refuse to participate in medical trials. In 1994 United States drug companies began conducting trials of the drug AZT on HIV-positive African subjects with the goal of developing treatments to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDs during childbirth.Meier, Benjamin Mason: \\"International Protection of Persons Undergoing Medical Experimentation: Protecting the Right of Informed Consent,\\" Berkeley Journal of International Law [1085-5718] Meier yr:2002 vol:20 iss:3 pg:513 -554 With funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the program tested over 17,000 Zimbabwean women for the efficacy of AZT in preventing transmission of HIV/AIDS during childbirth. Half of the women were given a placebo rather than the drug, and the subjects were not informed of the potential dangers of the treatment. According to Peter Lamptey, the head of the AIDS Control and Prevention Program, \\"if you interviewed the people in the study, most wouldn't understand to what they had actually consented.\\" An estimated 1000 newborns of women in the study contracted HIV/AIDS, although this could have been avoided by treating the women with known drugs. The testing was ceased in 1998 when the CDC claimed to have obtained sufficient data from experiments in Thailand.

He played clarinet exclusively until he entered his sophomore year of high school, when he branched out and added saxophone, tuba and accordion. By age 16, his devotion to music was such that he asked his parents to help him buy a used accordion instead of a used car. Much of high school was spent playing polka gigs in restaurants and playing with the school jazz band. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 2003. A musical autodidact, Tolentino sings lead vocals and plays many instruments, including accordion, clarinet, tuba, bass saxophone, ukulele, banjo, piano, and vibraphone.

She was an expert gymnast and trapeze artist. She could also ride a horse. At the opening of show, she and her sister Kumudini arrived on the stage riding on horse. In November 1896, the Great Bengal Circus displayed their acts at the durbar of Rewa. The prince of Rewa was so pleased with their performance that he gifted them a pair of Bengal tigers. The tigers were believed to bring luck to the team and therefore christened as Lakshmi and Narayan, after the Hindu deities. Sushila learned how to master the tigers. By 1901, the shows of Great Bengal Circus would feature Sushila Sundari in daring acts with the two tigers. She would enter their cage with ease and make them growl, stand up and sit down. She would arm wrestle with them and display their open jaws. After that she would recline on them and pose for photographs. When of one of the trained tigers died, she attempted the daring acts with an untrained tiger named Fortune. During the performance, Fortune severely wounded Sushila with its paws. Sushila became invalid for the rest of her life. Her health deteriorated and she passed in 1924.

Janet Jackson is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She began her career as a child star in several sitcoms during the late seventies, before transitioning into popular music with her self-titled debut album and breakthrough, Control. In addition to being declared a global \\"pop culture phenomenon,\\" Jackson is considered an iconic figure in the fields of pop music, entertainment, fashion, along with dance and choreography. Her collective body of work has been cited to create templates for numerous artists who have emerged following her. By 2008, Jackson had been the most- searched person in internet history, and upon the debut of her tenth studio album, ranked as the ninth biggest-selling pop artist and second most- successful female artist within contemporary pop. The influence of her musical themes, image, music videos, choreography, films, and media controversies have bestowed her with various titles by critics, which include the \\"Queen of Pop\\", \\"Empress Of Pop\\", \\"Queen Of Sex\\", \\"Queen Of Entertainment\\", \\"Queen Of Music\\", \\"Bonafide Sex Queen\\", in addition to \\"Erotic Queen of Pop\\" and \\"Queen of Dance.\\" Observing her \\"broad-based, widespread appeal,\\" Mark Seliger considered Jackson \\"the most recognized\\" female pop artist of \\"the 80s, 90s, and today,\\" while Tris McCall appointed her \\"the direct forerunner\\" within modern pop. Leah Simpson also declared her \\"a legendary singer and actress,\\" who would \\"always be a prominent figure in the industry.\\" Influence and commentary Jackson is among the most influential artists in popular music. Universal Music stated, \\"Her musical style, choreography, lyrical exploration, and self awareness has made her one of the top artists of our time as well as a leading influence on the upcoming stars of tomorrow.\\" Of her own influences, she said, \\"There are artists, true performers that have come before me who have been a big inspiration to me. I hope I do the same for others.\\" Citing her image, performing attributes, and musical traits; Ernest Hardy declared her \\"the unheralded mother-architect, for better or worse, of the current pop world... While it's a conditioned reflex for mainstream critics to heap praise upon Madonna as the mold from which MTV's pop brigade is stamped, the truth is a bit more complicated.\\" Judy Faber of CBS News observed her influence, ranging from \\"her acrobatic dance moves to her birdlike singing voice,\\" to be emulated by various artists. Upon the release of Discipline, Paul Lester commended her as \\"the ninth biggest-selling pop act of all time, the second most successful female artist ever and the most searched-for person in internet history.\\" MTV News commented, \\"Janet Jackson's superstar resolve is made of pure steel.. If we could've made Janet Jackson the MTV Artist of the Century, we would have.\\" Marcello Carlin of Stylus credited her sonic innovation and musical themes to create templates for \\"nearly all worthwhile 21st century pop.\\" Simon Reynolds also declared her to have \\"drafted a new blueprint for dance pop\\" with her early recordings, via the usage of drum machines and synthesized basselines. Additionally, Robert Hilburn observed artists to incorporate the \\"Janet Jackson school of youthful Top 40 attitude\\" as a model for their artistry. Out Magazine stated: =Musical influence= Tris McCall called Jackson \\"the direct forerunner of most current female pop stars,\\" adding, \\"The techno-soul hybrid she pioneered in the '80s (and the conflation of transgression, liberation and desire at the heart of much her writing) is now the sound of the commercial airwaves. Rihanna, Britney Spears... they've all followed in Jackson's stiletto-heeled footsteps.\\" While having \\"changed the course of females in pop music,\\" Taylor Ferber of VH1 stated, \\"Janet was a trailblazer, fusing pop [with varied genres], raising the bar for music video choreography, speaking out about social injustice and breaking racial and sexual taboos. The trends she started in fashion and music can still be seen in the work of today's female stars.\\" Kelly Crane stated, \\"[her] name is constantly mentioned when other artists ‚Äî Beyonc√©, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears to name a few ‚Äì are asked who inspires them.\\" The Khaleej Times observed Jackson to establish a template for Rihanna, while NME noted the emergence of \\"pneumatic mini-Janets\\" such as Christina Aguilera and Jennifer Lopez. Rashod Ollison recognized various artists and boy bands to \\"owe a huge debt to Jackson for the dance and musical templates she set,\\" heralding her influence on \\"today's pop vixens for whom she set the template.\\" Jon Pareles cited her to \\"shape Britney Spears, Beyonc√©, the Pussycat Dolls and much other current pop\\". Through her \\"versatility and mastery of a bewildering array of styles,\\" Virgin Records observed her to influence an eclectic range of artists. According to The Guardian, Jackson has become \\"the paradigmatic cyber-diva of modern machine soul, a key influence on her successors, from Whitney to Mariah, Britney to Beyonc√©.\\" Justin Timberlake, Adam Levine, and Bruno Mars consider her a notable influence, in addition to European artists Cheryl Cole and Robyn, and Asian artists including Lee Hyori, BoA, and Girls' Generation. Jackson is among the most prominent fixtures in remix culture; receiving uncommissioned remixes by electronic artists such as Disclosure and Skrillex. In indie rock, she has inspired albums by The Black Keys and Sleigh Bells. Her vocal attributes have inspired Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon, Jamie Liddell, and Class Actress, while the vocal styles of Ariana Grande, FKA Twigs, and Gwen Stefani have been compared with her vocal techniques. =Performing and fashion= Through her performances and choreography, Jackson has pioneered a variety of methods used by ensuing artists. Veronica Chambers declared her to redefine the music video, citing numerous artists to use similar sets and dance routines. Her concert tours have been regarded to create new standards for showmanship, via the usage of pyrotechnics, elaborate staging, and intricate choreography. Of her influence on Shakira and Beyonc√©, Denene Millner commended her to \\"single-handedly change the way a generation of female performers hit the stage,\\" adding, \\"Before Jackson, little was expected of [teenage] girl singers except that they coo about love and heartbreak and look pretty in their dresses.\\" Fabien Brathwaite added, \\"Before Janet, women weren't dancing this hard or this fierce or this sexy.\\" Her abstract and inventive choreography has been considered a \\"measuring stick\\" for modern dance. Universal Music observed synchronized dance routines to become \\"synonymous with Janet,\\" while Telemundo noted artists such as LMFAO to perform \\"Janet Jackson-style\\" formations. Jackson brought the headset microphone to prominence; often referred to as the \\"Janet Jackson microphone,\\" and developed explicit performance themes; such as seducing a fan on stage. Additionally, she was one of two artists to first use LCDs; becoming a standard in modern technology. The image transition of Miley Cyrus has been compared with Jackson's. Jackson has secured a position as a prominent fashion icon, with Phil Marder declaring her fashion statements to \\"often become the norm for teenage girls around the globe.\\" Her iconic ensembles include her Control-era attire, \\"Rhythm Nation\\" outfit, Velvet Rope period of crimson hair and piercings, and standard of midriff-baring wardrobe. Upon her image transition, she has pioneered the \\"teen pop evolution\\"; taking authority of her career and progressing from a child star into a sultrier, adult image. Emily Feimster stated: In comparing Miley Cyrus' image transition to Jackson's, Priya Elan stated, \\"Miley, like Janet, was the beloved child star who played tic-tac-toe with America as Hannah Montana,\\" observing her risqu√© performances to eradicate her former persona in a similar vein. As a sex symbol, Jackson became known for her toned abdominal muscles and midriff- baring style, thought to become \\"standard operating procedure\\" within contemporary pop. VH1 observed her image to be emulated by \\"just about every pop star,\\" while The Harvard Crimson recalled, \\"Janet Jackson's sexy stomach captured the imagination of all races.\\" Influenced by Jackson Robyn has said that Jackson's records have heavily influenced the music of her native Sweden. *Aaliyah *Alanis Morissette *Alicia Keys *Anastacia *Anti-Flag and Tom Morello (for the song \\"Post-War Breakout\\") *Antonio Banderas *Ashlyne Huff *Aubrey O'Day *Brandy Norwood *Brit Marling *Britney Spears *Cassie Ventura *Cheryl Cole *Chris Brown *Christina Aguilera *Christina Milian *Christine and the Queens *Class Actress *Crystal Kay *Dannii Minogue *Darren Hayes *David Dallas *Dawn Richard *Debbie Gibson *Deerhoof *Delta Goodrem *Destiny's Child *Dev Hynes *Diamond Rings *Eliza Doolittle *Elizabeth Mathis (for the film TRON: Legacy) *Emilia de Poret *Emma Bunton *Emmy Rossum (for fitness routines for Shameless) *Erin McCarley *Fifth Harmony *Fischerspooner *Fleur East *Gary Numan *Generationals *Girl Talk *Girls' Generation *Grimes *Hannah Georgas *Havana Brown *Heidi Range of Sugababes *Hitomi Shimatani *How to Dress Well *Jamie Lidell *Janelle Mon√°e *Jason DeRulo *Jay-Z *Jena Malone *Jenna Dewan *Jennifer Lopez *Jennifer Love Hewitt *Jenny McCarthy *Jessica Alba *Jessica Mauboy *Jessica Simpson *Jessie Ware *Jessy Lanza *Jhen√© Aiko *Joana \\"JoJo\\" Levesque *Joni Mitchell (for select performances of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\") *Jorgie Porter *Judd Apatow (for the film Drillbit Taylor) *Junior Sanchez *Justin Timberlake *KARA *Kate Hudson *Kat Graham *Kathleen Hanna *Katy Perry *Kelela *Kelly Clarkson *Kelly Rowland *Keri Hilson *Kesha *Kiesza *Kim Ann Foxman *Kimbra *Koda Kumi *Kylie Minogue *Lea Salonga *Lee Hyori *Lene Marlin *Leon Vynehall *Lil Debbie *Lil' Kim *Lindsay Lohan *Lissie *Little Dragon (for the album Nabuma Rubberband) *Little Mix *Liz Phair *Liza Minnelli (for the album Confessions) *Luke James *Marger Sealey *Mariah Carey *Marie Serneholt *Mary J.

In declaring her \\"one of the biggest and, in many ways, boldest female pop stars in the world,\\" Neil McCormick of The Telegraph asserted Jackson as \\"the only serious rival to Madonna,\\" while Entertainment Weekly placed them in an equal class of longevity. Dutch publication Trouw cited both women as the most prominent female artists of their generation. In profiling artists such as Justin Timberlake, author Sean Smith considered her to exceed the influence of Michael Jackson within modern pop. Of the BBC UK documentary Janet Jackson ‚Äì Taking Control, Howard Male concluded, \\"Janet's unprecedented crossover success changed the music industry just as much as Michael's did.\\" Artists who have been appointed the potential \\"next Janet Jackson\\" or successor include Britney Spears, Beyonc√©, Cheryl Cole, Fergie, and Rihanna.

While often reported that the T6SS was discovered in 2006 by researchers studying the causative agent of cholera, Vibrio cholerae, the first study demonstrating that T6SS genes encode a protein export apparatus was actually published in 2004, in a study of protein secretion by the fish pathogen Edwardsiella tarda. Since then, Type VI secretion systems have been found in a quarter of all proteobacterial genomes, including pathogens of animals, plants, and humans, as well as soil, environmental or marine bacteria. While most of the early studies of Type VI secretion focused on its role in the pathogenesis of higher organisms, it is now known to function primarily in interbacterial antagonism.  Structure and mechanism  Type VI secretion system protein , Burkholderia pseudomallei. The T6SS is thought to resemble an inverted phage extending outward from the bacterial cell surface. It consists of 14 proteins that assemble into three sub- complexes: a phage tail-like tubule, a phage baseplate-like structure, and cell-envelope spanning membrane complex. These three subcomplexes work together to transport proteins across the bacterial cell envelope and into a target cell through a contractile mechanism Structure of a Type VI Secretion System = Phage tail-like = The phage tail-like component of the T6SS is a dynamic tubular structure that undergoes cycles of assembly and disassembly. It can be up to 600 nm long, and has been visualized extending across the bacterial cytoplasm in electron micrographs. The tubules consist of repeating units of the proteins TssA and TssB (VipA/VipB) arranged as a sheath around a tube built from stacked hexameric rings of the haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp). At the tip of the Hcp tube sits a trimer of the phage tail spike-like protein VgrG, which is in turn capped by a pointed PAAR domain-containing protein. Contraction of the sheath is thought to propel the Hcp tube, VgrG and associated substrates outside of the bacterial cell, where the VgrG/PAAR spike facilitates penetration of the membrane of a neighboring cell. The tubule structure is dismantled through the action of the ATP-degrading protein ClpV, which sits at the tubule base. = Baseplate = The phage tail-like tubule of the T6SS assembles on a structure analogous to bacteriophage baseplates. It consists of the proteins TssE, TssF, TssG, and TssK. The baseplate and phage tail-like complex interact in the bacterial cytoplasm, and then are recruited to the cell envelope by the membrane complex. = Membrane = The T6SS membrane complex is responsible for anchoring the apparatus to the cellular membrane, and provides the channel through which substrates are propelled by the contraction of the phage tail-like tubule. This large (1.7 md) complex is formed from 10 interacting units of a heterotrimer containing TssJ, TssM and TssL. It is believed to span from the inner membrane to the outer membrane of the Gram negative bacterial cell envelope, forming a channel that opens and closes with a unique iris-like mechanism. = Substrate recognition = Unlike substrates of other secretion systems (such as the general secretory pathway or secretion systems III and IV), those of the T6SS are not known to have any universally identifying features. Instead, they are recognized and selected for secretion through one of two structural components of the apparatus. One class of substrates binds within the pore of an Hcp hexamer. Since substrates are unstable in the absence of this interaction, it is thought that the substrate-Hcp complexes are secreted together, rather than Hcp serving as a passive tubule through which substrates pass. Members of the second class of substrates are targeted for secretion via interaction with the phage tail spike-like protein VgrG. These substrates are often modular proteins, such as the Rhs toxins, that possess PAAR domain for interaction with VgrG at one end. There are also instances where a VgrG and a substrate are both part of the same protein.  Anti-eukaryotic  Although the ancestral function of the T6SS appears to be targeting of bacteria, a handful of systems have been identified that have evolved to target eukaryotic cells. In general, these eukaryote-targeting systems are involved in causing disease. For example, the intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis requires the activity of a T6SS to escape from phagosomes and replicate in the cytoplasm of macrophages. The mechanism by which secreted proteins facilitate F. tularensis virulence is still unknown. The T6SS of Vibrio cholerae has a dual role, being able to target both bacterial and eukaryotic cells., At least one substrate it secretes is specialized for eukaryotic cell-targeting, functioning by cross- linking the cytoskeleton protein actin., Burkholderia pseudomallei and Edwardsiella tarda are two other organisms which possess a T6SS that appears dedicated for eukaryotic targeting. The T6SS of plant pathogen Xanthomonas citri protects it from predatory amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.  Antibacterial  P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa have self-immunity to their own effector toxins: Tsi proteins bind and stabilise Tse toxins, preventing cell senescence and peptidoglycan cell wall lysis. A wide range of Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to have antibacterial T6SSs, including opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, obligate commensal species that inhabit the human gut (Bacteroides spp.), and plant-associated bacteria such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These systems exert antibacterial activity via the function of their secreted substrates. All characterized bacterial- targeting T6SS proteins act as toxins, either by killing or preventing the growth of target cells. The mechanisms of toxicity toward target cells exhibited by T6SS substrates are diverse, but typically involve targeting of highly conserved bacterial structures, including degradation of the cell wall through amidase or glycohydrolase activity, disruption of cell membranes through lipase activity or pore formation, cleavage of DNA, and degradation of the essential metabolite NAD+. T6SS-positive bacterial species prevent T6SS- mediated intoxication towards self and kin cells by producing immunity proteins specific to each secreted toxin. The immunity proteins function by binding to the toxin proteins, often at their active site, thereby blocking their activity.  Regulation  = GacS/Rsm system = Some research has gone into regulation of T6SS by two component systems. In P. aeruginosa, it has been observed that the GacS/Rsm two-component system is involved in type VI secretion system regulation. This system regulates the expression of Rsm small regulatory RNA molecules, and has also been implicated in biofilm formation. Upon the GacS/Rsm pathway stimulation, an increase in Rsm molecules leads to inhibition of mRNA-binding protein RsmA. RsmA is a translational inhibitor that binds to sequences near the ribosome-binding site for T6SS gene expression. This level of regulation has also been observed in P. fluorescens and P. syringae. = Quorum sensing = There are various examples in which quorum sensing regulates T6SS. In Vibrio cholerae T6SS studies, it has been observed that serotype O37 has high vas gene expression. Serotypes O139 and O1 on the other hand exhibit the opposite, with markedly low vas gene expression. It has been suggested that the differences in expression are attributable to differences in quorum-sensing levels. In Vibrio cholerae, autoinducer-1 (AI-1) signals are detected by LuxQ, a sensor kinase. LuxQ activates LuxU, which then acts on LuxO, a DNA-binding protein which represses HapR gene expression. HapR is thought to LuxO deletions resulted in strong induction of vas gene expression, and hence T6SS expression, demonstrating that T6SS is regulated in some form by quorum sensing. However, O1 strains with LuxO deletions still had relatively quiescent T6SS compared to the O37 strain, suggesting that additional factors are also involved.

However, the electrolyte is not common salt water as commonly stated in several internet forums, but the electrolyte solution bi-ION consists of a conductive liquid - organic and inorganic salts dissolved in water - and the electrolytes themselves, nano- particles which are specific molecules designed by nanoFlowcell Holdings Ltd. While dissolved redox salts are responsible for the energy transfer in conventional redox flow batteries, the bi-ION electrolyte is an energy storage medium whose suspended nano-particles permit a considerably higher energy density than regular redox electrolyte liquids.http://emagazine.nanoflowcell.com/technology/bi-ion-energy-of-the- future/  Controversy  Critics claim a lack of scientific understanding or patents describing how water with metallic salts can be used to produce electric energy with the efficiency and energy density that the company claims. The claimed performance seemed to contradict research that has been done on flow batteries. It has been said that \\"there is no solid proof just yet that the QUANT e actually works and performs as advertised\\". The Quant 48 Volt delivers 560 kW at 48 V, with 140 kW going to each motor. This means the current going to each motor is equal to 2917 Amps which would heat up the cable dramatically. The company fails to explain how it is solved.

On 15 December 2017, the Nautilus Publisher, John Steele, published a reply explaining the magazine's financial situation and taking responsibility for the late payments. On 1 February 2018, the National Writers Union announced it had reached a settlement with Steele. On 07 November 2019, the National Writers Union announced in a letter that Nautilus Think, and its parent Nautilus Next, still owe $186,000 to former contributors. Partnerships On 20 March 2018, Nautilus announced a marketing partnership with Kalmbach Media, publisher of Discover and Astronomy magazines. At the time of the partnership, the three magazines had a combined reach of 10 million users.

Lalo's writing is described by Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians as characterised by \\"conservatism, wit, astuteness and a linguistic finesse which occasionally turned to virulence.\\" One of his persistent themes was a dislike of the music of Ravel. Although a friend and trusted adviser of Ravel's teacher Faur√©,Nectoux, p. 492 Lalo gave poor notices to the young composer's early works, and continued to disparage him throughout his career.Nichols, p. 30 Lalo was less hostile to the music of Debussy, whose style of musical impressionism he preferred to Ravel's. When he detected what he thought was the influence of Ravel on Debussy's music, Lalo wrote, \\"By a strange phenomenon, the music of M. Debussy today reflects that of his own imitators. M. Ravel has been reproached (more than he should) for resembling M. Debussy, and now it's M. Debussy who starts to resemble M. Ravel.\\" Lalo added that nonetheless he still preferred Debussy's music to Ravel's.Fulcher, p. 368 His article \\"Maurice Ravel et le Debussysme\\" in Le temps in 1907 so stirred up factional opinion in the musical public that the harmonious relations between the two composers became strained.

It became the city of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.  History  Watercolour painting of Moreton Bay Settlement, 1835 The Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established on the Redcliffe Peninsula on Moreton Bay in 1824, under the instructions of John Oxley that a suitable location would be \\"easy of access, difficult to escape from, and hard to attack; furthermore, it should be near fresh water and contain three hundred acres for cultivation\\". Only one year after settlement, the inadequacy of Redcliffe's water supply became apparent and in May 1825 the commandant Lieutenant Henry Miller decided to relocate the settlement to the current Brisbane CBD. Located on the north bank of the Brisbane River, the new site allowed the collection of water from a freshwater creek and a chain of water holes near the present Roma Street railway station, the first substantial water supply within of the mouth of the Brisbane River. This was an elevated location cooling breezes. The southern bank was a cliff of rock (Kangaroo Point Cliffs), suitable for building material, and a fertile flood plain. The settlers faced hardship and privation and the paucity of resources combined with thick sub-tropical vegetation made settlement difficult.Evans, R. (2007) A History of Queensland. Cambridge University Press, Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1829, the number of prisoners in the settlement rose from 200 to 1000 and the plight of the convicts whose labour was to establish the settlement was dire. The site of Brisbane Town was an ongoing issue, with Commandant Patrick Logan proposing that the settlement be moved to Stradbroke Island. However, the difficulties of crossing the bay saw this plan abandoned. Logan continued to seek alternative sites, establishing a number of outstations including Eagle Farm and Oxley Creek.Johnston, W. R. (1988) Brisbane: The first thirty years. Boolarong Publications, Brisbane. Despite the continued uncertainty about the future of Brisbane Town, building had continued under Commandant Logan, who is given credit for laying out the earliest permanent foundations. Logan was responsible for the building of Brisbane's only surviving convict-constructed buildings: the Commissariat Store and the Old Windmill. Convict numbers fell 75 percent between 1831 and 1838 by which time the area under cultivation shrank from to only . On 10 February 1842 Governor Gipps declared Moreton Bay open for Free Settlement. The Moreton Bay Penal Settlement during its 15 years of operation consisted of a range of buildings including barracks for convicts and troops, officers' quarters, dwellings for the Commandant, chaplain, Commissariat officer, surgeon, Commandant's clerk and engineer, a military and convict hospital, the Commissariat Store, and various stores, barns and sheds. The settlement also included a wharf, wells, a flagstaff, gardens and a lumber yard. The Commandant's cottage was constructed in 1825 on the site of the old Queensland Government Printing Office building (now the Public Service Club between William and George Streets. It was a wooden building with brick chimneys. In 1826 a detached brick building was built to the rear of the Commandant's house.Steele, J. G. (1975) Brisbane Town in Convict Days, 1824‚Äì1842. University of Queensland Press, Brisbane. A line of buildings ran from the Commandant's house to the first military barracks along present-day William Street. These buildings included the Engineer's cottage on the corner of William and Elizabeth Streets in what is now known as Queens Gardens. The cottage was associated with the first lumber yard on this block, which also contained engineer's stores and workshops. Plan of the Soldiers Barracks, bounded by Queen, George and William Streets The first military barracks were constructed in 1825 as two slab huts for the sergeant, corporal and 12 privates, and separate huts for the married couples on the corner of Queen Street and North Quay, site of the present Brisbane Square. The barracks were later moved to the other side of Queen Street and replaced by the second lumber yard in 1831. The first prisoner accommodation also consisted of slab huts, probably at the intersection of Queen and Albert Streets; stone barracks were constructed in 1829. The first Commissariat Store was constructed as a long, low slab building near the corner of Elizabeth and Albert Streets and was later used as a barn, after the stone Commissariat Store was built in 1829. The first Commissariat Store appears to have been situated within the alignment of the present day Elizabeth Street. The only entry point into the settlement was via the wharf on the Brisbane River. Initially known as the King's Wharf, or King's Jetty, it was constructed by 1827 when the boat crew's hut and boat builder's shed were first occupied. A crane was constructed on the end of the wharf in order to transfer goods from the arriving ships to the shore. The wharf was situated on the river bank opposite the Commissariat Store on Queen's Wharf Road. The main thoroughfare into the settlement was up the steep river bank following the present day alignment of Queen's Wharf Road. Pedestrians were able to enter the settlement through the vacant land immediately northwest of the Commissariat Store, in what is today known as Miller Park.Kennedy, M. (1998) Commissariat Store Conservation Plan. Department of Public Works, Brisbane. A hospital was completed in 1827, after much government bungling over plans and approvals, on the block bounded by North Quay, Adelaide, George and Ann Streets, with the buildings extending into the current alignment of Adelaide Street. The windmill tower which still stands on Wickham Terrace was likely completed in late 1828, with a treadmill added before September 1829. Sketch of the Convict Barracks, Brisbane, 1832 West elevation of Prisoner's Barracks, circa 1839 Drawing showing sections of the Prisoners' Barracks, 1839 The Prisoners' Barracks were constructed between 1827 and 1830 to house up to 1000 convicts and was the largest stone building in the settlement at the time. The barracks were situated with the frontage along present-day Queen Street, on the block surrounded by Albert, Adelaide, George and Queen Streets. The barracks consisted of a multi-storey stone building with a central archway and a large walled yard to the rear. Several smaller buildings were situated in the yard on the far side of what would become Burnett Lane. Architectural plans for the Prison's Barrack building, 1839 The dominant archway of the Prisoners Barracks extended approximately through the building from the Queen Street frontage towards Adelaide Street opening into the large walled yard. The yard was the site of Moreton Bay's first public execution in 1830. Within the archway itself, strategically situated for all incoming and existing convicts to see, was the flogging triangle. Records indicate that in the period between February and October 1828 alone, over 11,000 lashes were inflicted on 200 convicts; this included 128 sentences of 50 or more lashes. The average in New South Wales was 41 lashes per sentence. The barracks were used from 1860 to 1868 as the court house and for Queensland's first Parliament. The barracks were demolished in 1880 with commercial redevelopment of the area in the early to mid-1880s particularly the buildings along Queen Street backing onto Burnett Lane, many of which are still extant (Manwaring Building, Gardams Building, Hardy Brothers Building, Edwards and Chapman Building, Colonial Mutual Chambers, Palings Building, Allan and Stark Building).Evans, R. and C. Ferrier (eds) (2004) Radical Brisbane: An Unruly History. The Vulgar Press, Melbourne.de Vries, S. and J. de Vries (2003) Historic Brisbane: Convict Settlement to River City. Pandanus Press, Brisbane. Beside the Prisoners' Barracks, along the Queen Street alignment towards the river, a row of single-story brick buildings were erected. The functions of the six apartments of these buildings changed over time including use as the Commissariat Officer's residence, school room, guard house, Superintendent of Convicts' residence, gaol room, solitary cells, married soldiers' residences, and a military school. The Chaplain's house was constructed in 1828, halfway between the Commandant's house and the Engineer's cottage, on the site now occupied by the former Lands Administration Building (now Treasury Hotel) between William and George Streets. Described in 1829 as a handsome brick house, it was later divided into two dwellings, and occupied at various times by the Assistant Surgeon and the Commissariat Officer. The Government Gardens were established in 1828 to the southwest of the settlement on the site of the present day City Botanic Gardens on Alice Street. The garden was under the charge of the Superintendent of Agriculture and produced a wide range of vegetables including cabbage, cauliflower, peas, beans, potatoes and pumpkins, as well as fruit trees and plants such as banana, pineapple, citrus, and apple. The Gardener's house, octagonal in shape and consisting of three rooms surrounded by verandahs, was also situated in the gardens. The route of the roadway along the western end of the settlement from the Prisoners' Barracks to the Government Gardens overlaps with the current Albert Street on the block between Margaret and Alice Streets. The new Commissariat Store, Brisbane was constructed in 1828 and 1829, on its site between present day William Street and Queens Wharf Road. The two story utilitarian building was constructed of local porphyry and sandstone, with its ground and second floor doors opening towards the river and the wharf. Used for various stores and government purposes over its history, it is one of only two extant structures from the convict period. One of the major thoroughfares of the settlement, taken by Allan Cunningham in his 1829 survey, ran along the rear of the Prisoners Barracks towards a pathway up to the windmill tower and to the Kangaroo Point Road. The alignment of this pathway follows the current alignment of Adelaide Street, from George Street to Albert Street, where the original pathway crossed Wheat Creek. Layout of Brisbane Town, circa 1839 Additional hospital accommodation was erected in 1830/31 adjacent to the existing hospital, situated between present day North Quay and George Street. This included a cottage for the Medical Officer and a building to serve as the Military Hospital. The new Military Barracks were also constructed in 1831. Designed for 100 rank and file, the barracks compound also included a guard house and a dwelling for two subaltern officers. The barracks were constructed on what is today the Treasury Building (Treasury Casino) while the former barracks site (situated at Brisbane Square) was converted to the lumber yard. Architectural drawings of the hospital and the quarters of surgeon Dr David Keith Ballow, 1838 In 1839, in preparation for the opening of Moreton Bay to free settlement, surveyors were sent from Sydney to draw maps of the district and prepare town plans so the land could be put up for sale. The town plan undertaken by Robert Dixon (Plan MT3, DERM 1840) is based on an earlier 1839 plan but superimposes the proposed street plan for the free town of Brisbane with square blocks of .Hadwen, I., J. Hogan and C. Nolan (2004) Brisbane's Historic North Bank: 1825‚Äì2005. Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Brisbane. Additional features depicted in these plans include a well situated in what is now George Street, near the intersection with Burnett Lane; a flagstaff in the centre of what is now William Street, close to the northwest boundary of Miller Park; and a range of gardens. The garden areas included military gardens and Dixon's garden behind the Military Barracks in the block bounded by Queen, George, Elizabeth and Albert Streets; Whyte's garden to the northwest of the Prisoners Barracks, through which Burnett Lane now runs; Handt's garden and Kent's garden to the rear of the Chaplain's house and Commandant's house, today overlain by parts of Elizabeth, George and Charlotte Streets; the Commandant's garden adjacent to the Commissariat Store along William Street and down towards Alice Street; and Paget's garden and Dr Ballard's garden adjacent to the Hospital, in the location of George and Ann Streets. Barns and a piggery indicated on Dixon's 1840 plan appear to have been situated within the current alignment of Charlotte Street. On 10 February 1842 Governor George Gipps declared the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement closed and the district open for free settlement.

Birth and children Hanuman encounters Surasa, depicted in top register. Simhika and Lankini in mid and lower registers. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Surasa is one of the 12 daughters of Daksha, who are married to the sage Kashyapa. She became the mother of the nagas (a class of serpents), while her co-wife and sister Kadru gave birth to uragas, another class of snakes. Vasuki, Takshaka, Airavata and other sons of Surasa are described to live in Bhogavati. The epic Mahabharata describes her being born from the wrath of Krodhavasha, another wife of Kashyapa. Surasa has three daughters: Anala, Ruha and Virudha. The serpents descend from the daughters of Surasa. She is thus called the mother of nagas and also cranes; another snake race Pannagas descends from Kadru. The Matsya Purana and the Vishnu Purana describes Surasa as one of 13 wives of Kashyapa and daughters of Daksha. The Vishnu Purana says that she gave birth to a thousand multi-hooded serpents, who fly in the sky; while Kadru also gives birth to a thousand snakes. As the Matsya Purana, she is the mother of all quadrupeds, except cows; the serpents are described as Kadru's children. The Bhagavata Purana portrays her the mother of rakshasas (cannibals, demons). The Vayu Purana and Padma Purana lists do not mention her as a wife of Kashyapa; and Anayush or Danayush take her position as mother of snakes. * * CHAP. XXI p. 147 The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions that Rohini as Surasa's incarnation; his son Balarama was incarnation of the naga Shesha, Surasa's son. As per the Matsya Purana, when the god Shiva as Tripurantaka sets off to the three demon cities, various deities aid him. Surasa and other goddesses become his arrows and spears. When drops of the demon Andhaka blood multiplying into many demons, Surasa and other mother goddesses called matrikas aid Shiva to slay the demon, by drinking the blood. Encounter with Hanuman 250px Surasa's encounter with Lord Hanuman in the Sundara Kanda Book of the Ramayana and its retellings, is the most popular tale related to Surasa. Hanuman, flies over the ocean to Lanka (identified with present-day Sri Lanka) in search of his master Rama's kidnapped wife Sita. When Hanuman leaves from land (identified with India), a mountain Mainaka appears in Hanuman's path, for him to rest but Hanuman considering it as an obstacle flies ahead. The gods, gandharvas and sages call Surasa, the mother of the nagas, and request her to assume a terrible rakshasi (demoness) form to test Hanuman. The reasons for her being called to test Hanuman as well as the abilities to be tested, differ in various Ramayana tellings. The Ramacharitamanas suggests that the test was meant to prove his greatness and establish that he is ideally suited for the task assigned to him. Conversely, the Adhyatma Ramayana says that the gods do not trust Hanuman's strengths; however both agree that the gods want to test Hanuman's strength (bala) and thinking power (buddhi). The original Ramayana states that his strength and valour are to be tested and does not state the reasons. Other texts find a middle path where though the gods are confident of Hanuman's abilities, they wish to \\"sharpen\\" them or warn him of impending dangers. Surasa consents and obstructs Hanuman's path in the sea. She has solar imagery, with ‚Äúyellow eyes and a pair of jaws fanged and gaping‚Äù and the size of a mountain.Goldman p. 42, She declares that Hanuman is the food provided to her by the gods and tries to eat him. Hanuman explains his mission to track Sita and requests her to let him go, and promises to return to enter her mouth, in accordance to Sama (gentle persuasion) and Dana (earnestly asking) part of the SƒÅma, DƒÅna, Bheda, Danda philosophy. She tells him that he can pass only through her mouth, as per a boon given to her. Hanuman counters her by challenging to open her mouth wide enough to eat him (Bheda ‚Äì threat). He starts expanding his form and becoming larger; Surasa also expands her jaws so she can devour Hanuman; the contest is interpreted as danda (punishment). Finally when Surasa's mouth expands to a 100 yojanas, Hanuman suddenly assumes a tiny form (size of a thumb) and enters her mouth and leaves it, before she can close it. In a variant, Hanuman enters Surasa's mouth and leaves through her ear. Thus, Hanuman respects Surasa's vow as well as saves his life. He salutes her and addresses her as Dakshayani (daughter of Daksha). Impressed by Hanuman's \\"ingenuity and courage\\", Surasa assumes her true form and blesses Hanuman. In a version, she reveals the purpose of her mission, being the orders of the gods and declares that the success of her mission, revealing Hanuman's intellect and strength.Goldman pp. 111‚Äì2 Hanuman recalls his adventures, including the Surasa encounter, to Rama after he returns from Lanka.Goldman pp. 267 Surasa is one of the three women who encounter Hanuman on his journey to Lanka; the other two are the rakshasi Simhika and Lankini, the guardian goddess of Lanka. The heavenly Surasa represents the element akasha (sky), while Simhika and Lankini represents water and earth respectively. As per another interpretation, the trio represents the maya (illusion) related to the three gunas (qualities). Surasa allegorically stands for sattvika maya, the purest form of illusion that needs to be tamed but still respected. The three women also denote a challenge to Hanuman's celibacy. \\"Eroticism and Hanuman's dispassionate visual consumption of women as sexual objects\\" is a recurring theme in the epic.Goldman p. 52 According to J. C. Jhala, the Surasa encounter is a later interpolation to the Ramayana as it resembles the Simhika episode to a great extent. It is missing from early adaptations of Rama's story in the Mahabharata and the Agni Purana. However Goldmans suggest that the theory is flawed and highly questionable and retain it in their critical edition of the Ramayana.Goldman p. 88-9 Notes References * Category:Hindu goddesses Category:NƒÅgas Category:Characters in the Ramayana ","title":"Surasa"},{"id":"45582703","text":"Makkaliralavva Mane Thumba is a 1984 Kannada drama film directed by T.

Gasparetto said that some of her books were dictated by a spirit named Lucius. Biography Born in Campinas, she married Aldo Luis Gasparetto with whom she had four children. According to her own account, one night in 1950 she woke up and started walking around the house speaking German, a language she did not know. The next day her husband went out and bought a book on spiritism which they then began to study together. Her husband attended the meetings of the spiritual association Federa√ß√£o Esp√≠rita do Estado de S√£o Paulo but Gasparetto had to stay at home to look after the children. Once a week they studied together at home. On one occasion, Gasparetto felt a sharp pain in her arm which moved from side to side uncontrollably. After Aldo gave her a pen and paper, she started to write quickly, drafting what was to become her first novel O Amor Venceu (Love Won) signed by someone called Lucius. After the manuscript had been typed up, Gasparetto showed it to a history professor from the University of S√£o Paulo who was also interested in spiritualism. Two weeks later she received confirmation that the book would be published by Editora LAKE. Gasparetto now says she uses her computer four times a week to write down the texts dictated by her voices. She usually wrote in the evening for one or two hours. \\"They [the spirits] are not available to work many days per week,\\" she explains. \\"I don't know why but each one of them only appears once a week. I tried to get them to change but I couldn't.\\" As a result, she usually kept one evening a week free for each of the four spirits with whom she purportedly communicated. She also published one of the stories dictated by Lucius as an audiobook with the book's characters voiced by actors. Death She died on 10 October 2018, in S√£o Paulo, aged 92, from pancreatic cancer.

The company was founded and is owned by John Bancroft. The company has received a number of notable awards, including the \\"Bridge to Work\\" Award in 1997, following its work in the Nottinghamshire community. History The company was founded in 1992 by John and Vicky Bancroft. In the first year of operation, it was reported that the company operated from a portacabin in Nottinghamshire. The company was founded after Bancroft spent a number of years in the corporate clothing industry. In 1993, the company moved to a purpose built factory on the site of the former Newstead Colliery.

In 1997, Badgemaster received an award from Nottinghamshire County Council following its job creation and staff training in the area. At the time, it was quoted that a number of the staff members lived within the local community of Newstead, Nottinghamshire. Nottinghamshire County Council quoted that the company had become an integral part of the community and awarded Badgemaster with the inaugural \\"Bridge to Work\\" Award. Before the establishment of Badgemaster in the area, it was widely reported that job opportunities were lacking in Newstead, Nottinghamshire. Newstead was formerly known as Newstead Colliery Village and suffered large scale Unemployment following the closure of the mines during the 1980s, which were widespread throughout in the United Kingdom. The company began to work with the British Royal Family in 2006. Badgemaster expanded over the following years, working with a number of major brands, becoming one of the largest badge manufactures and providers in Europe.

Badgemaster announced a takeover of the Scottish-based Akorn Badge Company, one of their major UK competitors in 2014. Following the takeover of the company, the operations were moved to Badgemaster's Nottinghamshire headquarters. Akorn had been part of the badge market for over 30 years, before the Badgemaster acquisition. In 2016, the company received three awards at the Professional Clothing Awards. The awards included best IT innovation, Made in the UK award, and Best Manufacturer/Distributor.

In the afternoon of 24 July 1915 off North Rona in the Outer Hebrides, Prince Charles , commanded by Lieutenant William Penrose Mark-Wardlaw, sank the German submarine SM U-36. The sinking was the first by a Q-Ship working alone without the assistance of a British submarine. U-36 was a type 31 submarine commissioned on 6 June 1914 under the command of Captain E. Graeff. By July 1915 she had sunk 14 merchant ships and taken three more as prizes. On the day she was sunk, U-36 had just stopped and boarded the Danish vessel SS Luise. The boarding party was in the process of dumping her cargo when a lookout sighted an approaching steamer. U-36 sailed towards the disguised Prince Charles, fired at her, and ordered her to stop. Prince Charles complied, swinging out her boats. The unsuspecting submarine came within about 600m of Prince Charles when Prince Charles hoisted her naval ensign and commenced firing. Prince Charles scored a hit on U-36's conning tower. She dived but then quickly resurfaced. By this time Prince Charles was only 300m away and was able to achieve more hits. U-36 surrendered, but having sustained heavy damage, sank, taking 18 crew members with her. Fifteen crew members, including Commander Graeff, survived. Lieutenant Mark-Wardlaw received a Distinguished Service Order for the action, and two of his crew received Distinguished Service Medals. The merchant crew of the Q-ship (Master: Frank Norman Moncrieffe Maxwell) was awarded a prize sum of ¬£1,000, to be divided amongst themselves. The Navy later withdrew Prince Charles from service as a Q-ship because she was small, slow, and relatively unseaworthy. She returned to merchant service after WWI, sailing for various owners and under various names. She capsized on 10 December 1944.

Early life and immigration Born in Cork, Ireland, as Augustin Joseph Tancred, he did his doctorate in divinities (DD) and preached at several locations around the United Kingdom as a Curate. He married Ms Mary Theresa Evelina Lattey and they emigrated to the Cape Colony with their three sons in 1842. His first wife died on 20 March 1847. On 22 December 1853 in Clanwilliam he remarried, to Ms Geesje/Geesie Martha Maria van Zyl. Cape Parliament The Cape Colony attained its first parliament in 1854. Dr Tancred stood for election as MLA for Clanwilliam and was elected. He served from 1854 until 1858. Later he served again for a year from 1862 until 1863. He was briefly elected to represent Piquetberg too in 1866. He died in January the next year though, in Cape Town in 1867. He was notable for being one of the minority of MPs who supported the separatist movement of the Eastern Province (even though he represented a constituency in the Western Province). He was also renowned for his alcoholism and raucous antics in parliament. On several occasions he was forcefully removed from the building for disruptive behaviour or drunkenness, and was also the cause of the Sergeant-at-Arms being called. At one point, he challenged the MP Jeremias Ziervogel to a duel in parliament, when his interruption of the elderly Ziervogel's speech got a verbal put-down.R. Kilpin: The Old Cape House.

The house belonged to Daniel's father, a fact which is noted in the Bible belonging to Lawrence S. Mason and his wife, Sarah Gray Hyde: \\"On page printed 'Births'--\\"L.S. Mason, son of Daniel Mason and Dorothy L.S. Mason was born on the 8th of October 1809 at his grandfather's 5 miles from Northampton Court House in Northampton Cty, North Carolina.\\" Lawrence Mason and Sarah Hyde married in 1833, and he died two years later. His widow later married Thomas Jefferson Jennings at Nacogdoches, Texas. Jennings was Attorney General for Texas from 1852-1856 and the Tarrant County, Texas Archives are home to the 'Samuel Alexander Denny/Jennings Family Collection,' which includes the Bible of Lawrence S.

Its mission is to empower young people to evolve UK democracy. BTB was formed in April 2010 by business studies teachers David Hughesman and Michael Sani, along with other staff and students, at Wilmington Enterprise College in Dartford. As a youth-led project, the students' mission was to rebrand politics and prove that young people do care about improving democracy. History =2010= Bite The Ballot was founded in 2010 by current CEO Michael Sani and David Hughesman, both teachers at Wilmington Enterprise College in Dartford. They produced a short documentary to tackle the idea young people are apathetic when it comes to politics, which was promoted by the NUS. =2011= Whilst still teaching at Wilmington Enterprise College, Sani and Hughesman worked on a government pilot to create games and resources to encourage voter registration. The scheme was trialled in 20 schools across the country, laying the foundations for the games which serve as Bite The Ballot's key educational initiatives such as 'The Basics'. =2012= In April 2012, Bite The Ballot organised the UK's first youth voter registration rally, held at the Ministry of Sound, in collaboration with UpRise, Reprezent Radio, Spirit of London Awards and The Media Trust. The organisation also launched 'Inspired Impressions' - a UK- based art competition, with the winning pieces were displayed in the Houses of Parliament. 'Rock Enrol' was also introduced this year. The pilot scheme with the Cabinet Office's Democratic Engagement Team was designed to develop political literacy and inspire young people to engage in political debate. This later developed into the Ofsted-recommended scheme 'The Basics' - delivered to more than 450 schools across the UK. =2013= In 2013, Bite The Ballot launched 'My Manifesto' - a project designed to champion issues young people deemed significant. It was a collection of youth voice - policy propositions, statistics, figures and suggestions for government officials - that was presented to parliament at a launch event. =2014= Bite The Ballot won the European Charlemagne Youth Prize in the start of 2014, for the Impressions Art Project run in 2012. In February, Bite The Ballot organised the UK's first National Voter Registration Drive (NVRD), held on 5 February 2014 - the anniversary of the Great Reform Act of 1832. An estimated 50,000 people were registered in one day. Later in 2014, Bite The Ballot launched '#TheAmendment' to improve voter registration and engagement in Wales. Its aims were to get Electoral Registration Officers to target groups seen as less likely to register to vote, have voter registration sessions in schools and colleges, and to make registering to vote as simple and straightforward as possible. On 24 September 2014, Members of the Welsh Assembly voted in favour of #TheAmendment. As the Welsh Assembly cannot make decisions about voting policy, a petition was delivered to Westminster. In November 2015, Bite The Ballot partnered with Twitter and ITV to hold the first 'Leaders Live' sessions. These were live interviews and Q&A; sessions with four of the five main party leaders at the time: An online campaign was sparked after Downing Street confirmed that Prime Minister David Cameron, who had originally agreed to take part, would not be attending. =2015= The second NVRD took place, with Bite The Ballot registering 441,696 people, a record, per capita, for a voting registration drive in the western world. To coincide with the United Kingdom general election 2015, Bite The Ballot launched Verto, its gamified voting advice application. =2016= Verto is relaunched in April to coincide with the London mayoral and assembly elections. In collaboration with HOPE not hate, Bite The Ballot launched its '#TurnUp' campaign, encouraging young citizen to register and vote in the EU Referendum that took place on 23 June. Alongside this, Bite The Ballot also published the first ever letter of its kind to receive cross party support from political leaders past and present, calling for increased political education. Its signatories included former Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the Labour Party, former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg MP, and current leader of the Green Party Natalie Bennett.  National Voter Registration Day (UK)  Inspired by the USA's Rock The Vote, Bite The Ballot created and launched the UK's first National Voter Registration Day. The inaugural National Voter Registration Day was held on 5 February 2014, as this is the anniversary of the Great Reform Act 1832. The inaugural year saw an estimated 50,000 people registered to vote. During the week of 2‚Äì8 February 2015, 441,500 people registered to vote, including 166,000 on 5 February 2015 alone. Leaders Live Bite The Ballot created the first live-streamed policy Q&A; sessions with the main political party leaders. The project was partnered by ITV News and Twitter UK. The interviews took place over a six-week period in late 2014: *Natalie Bennett the Green Party of England and Wales - 26 November 2014 *Nigel Farage MEP UK Independence Party - 2 December 2014 *Ed Miliband MP Labour Party (UK) - 8 December 2014 *Nick Clegg MP Liberal Democrats - 16 December 2014 =Leaders Live Controversy & Leaders Pledges= Nigel Farage MEP made a series of comments contradicting existing UKIP policy on sex and relationships education during the live debate. Ed Miliband MP pledged to give 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote from May 2016. In January 2015, Bite The Ballot received confirmation from 10 Downing Street that David Cameron MP would not be taking part in Leaders Live sparking a campaign calling for the Prime Minister to reconsider. Verto In 2015, Bite the Ballot launched voter advice tool, Verto. The app was released to coincide with the 2015 general election, to determine which party a user's views align most closely with. Developed in collaboration with think-tank Demos, the Political Studies Association, and a range of academics, Verto reached over 400,000 users - 40% of whom were aged between 18 and 25. In April 2016, Verto.London was launched to coincide with the London Mayoral Elections. #TurnUp In 2016 Bite The Ballot partnered with the anti-hate organisation Hope not Hate for their #TurnUp campaign, aiming to inspire 500,000 young people to register to vote and participate in the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016. By the end of the registration period (the initial deadline of 7 June was extended by 48 hours following on from technical faults), more than 1.1 million young people registered to vote during the week-long #TurnUp campaign. The then-Prime Minister David Cameron backed Bite The Ballot in the days leading up to the referendum registration deadline on 7 June to encourage young people to register to vote. The campaign was promoted across social media, as well as through partnerships with apps such Tinder, Uber and Deliveroo. On 5 June 2016, Bite The Ballot hosted a live-streamed debate on the referendum. Featuring a panel of 'idols and influencers' including Bob Geldof and Katie Hopkins, the #InOutLive debate discussed the central issues of the referendum. Celebrity endorsement Jamal Edwards, founder of SB.TV, is a long-standing Bite The Ballot ambassador backing the cause on numerous occasions. Other notable supporters include Laura Whitmore, Eliza Doolittle (singer) and Max Rushden. Presenter Rick Edwards hosted the first two Leaders Live shows and has worked on a joint crowd funding project to raise funds for Bite The Ballot's voting advice application. YouTuber creators such as JacksGap and Rebecca Jane Brown have also played a key role in inspiring youth engagement with Bite The Ballot.

A patron of the arts, he cultivated close friendships with artists such as Cellini, Raphael, Michelangelo and Vasari. His father was Antonio Altoviti, the papal Master of the Mint, and his mother was La Papessa Dianora Altoviti, niece of Pope Innocent VIII. One of his direct descendants was Pope Clement XII.  Life and career  Bindo Altoviti was born in 1491. Little is known about his youth or early education. As the Altoviti had blood ties with the houses of Cybo and Medici, and alliances with the della Rovere, Pope Julius II (Guiliano della Rovere) became a mentor to Bindo, as he was to his later papal successors Leo X (Giovanni de' Medici) and Clemente VII (Giulio de' Medici). Bindo was included among the young noblemen educated at the papal court, where he was in attendance on the hostage Federico Gonzaga, the son of Isabella d‚ÄôEste and future duke of Mantua. During those years, he was also introduced to Bramante, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Tondino with the coat of arms of Bindo Altoviti, Fiammetta Soderini and the Holy See At this time, the Altoviti family had strong Republican leanings. Bindo became known not for just being a dashing young aristocrat, who had more to his credit than good looks, but was possibly prepared to risk wealth and power for his ideals. He married Fiammetta Soderini, niece of Piero Soderini, head of the Florentine government who had, together with his second chancellor Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, unsuccessfully raised an army of national militia to defend Florence against the return of the Medici. However, remaining loyal to family, Bindo's career flourished under Leo X and Clemente VII. From the documents in the Vatican archives, it is possible to trace Bindo‚Äôs rise to prominence as a banker. Respected at the papal court, he contributed to the festivities of Leo X. He established partnerships with the Spinelli, Ricci, Pucci and Ruspoli, promoting the career of Bartolomeo Ruspoli, who was related to cardinal Niccol√≤ Ardinghelli, an influential member of the Farnese faction and an intimate associate of Alessandro Farnese, future Pope Paul III. After the death of his banking rival Agostino Chigi and the sack of Rome in 1527, only a few very solid banks had the capital to prevent economic chaos. Competing with fierce Genoese bankers and the Germans Fugger and Welser, the Strozzi, Salviati and Altoviti became the leading Florentine and Papal curia bankers, given the opportunity to participate in massive credit transactions, controlling an enlarging sphere of papal finance. Portrait of Bindo Altoviti by Jacopino del ConteBindo was appointed as Depository-General, the leading banker of the Papal States and chief commissioner for collecting taxes, mainly allocated for the reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica. He gradually expanded and diversified his financial activities, established branches of the Altoviti Bank in foreign money markets such as France, the Netherlands and England. Among his clients were Duke Charles III of Savoy and King Henry II of France and by shrewd political and financial acumen he amassed one of the largest private fortunes in Italy.Bust of Bindo Altoviti by CelliniHis later life and wealth were centered on the Eternal City rather than Florence, but he still followed, and often intervened directly in, the political affairs of his Florentine home. The link was strong between the Altoviti and Strozzi families, dictated not only by kinship but also by political affiliation. He and wealthy businessman Filippo Strozzi the Younger financed the troops of Emperor Charles V and the siege of Florence in order to restore Medici rule. Victorious in the Battle of Gavinana, Alessandro de' Medici, the illegitimate son of duke Lorenzo II de' Medici--though others believe he was in fact the son of Clement VII) and brother of Caterine de' Medici--became Duke of Florence and named Bindo as ducal counsel to public office. After the death of his cousin and rival Ippolito de' Medici, Duke Alessandro had a falling-out with Filippo Strozzi, who had been, together with his wife Clarice de' Medici, the guardians of Catherine de' Medici after her father's death. Filippo Strozzi had conspired with Ippolito de' Medici to remove Alessandro from power. When Alessandro was assassinated by Lorenzino de' Medici, Bindo found himself with a dilemma, torn between various family factions, political and financial interests. On one hand, he was the uncle of the assassin and gave Lorenzino money and advice how to escape, but on the other he was affiliated to the senior branch of the Medici. He chose to side with queen Catherine de' Medici (who was an enemy of her cousin Cosimo and had come to terms with Filippo Strozzi) and Paul III, whose grandson Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma married Margaret of Austria, the illegitimate daughter of Charles V and widow of Alessandro de' Medici. In the wake of these events, Bindo became one of the leaders of the Florentine exiles in Rome. He provided major financial backing to the army of the Florentine exiles led by Filippo Strozzi. Defeated at the battle of Montemurlo, Filippo was captured, tortured and committed suicide in prison. Madonna dell'Impannata by RaphaelNonetheless, the new duke, Cosimo I de' Medici and the banker could not remain at odds for long. Cosimo's aunts, Cassandra Altoviti and Maria de' Medici Soderini, who was Bindo's sister-in- law, advised them to reconcile and Cosimo turned to the Altoviti Bank for considerable sums of money. Cosimo, careful to consolidate the alliances of his recent power, appointed Bindo Florentine consul in Rome, later senator, moves which kept him out of Florence but in no way mitigated their once again rising mutual contempt. Paul III and Bindo backed Giulio Cybo in Genoa and Filippo Strozzi's son Piero Strozzi, who like his father was no real champion of Florentine liberties but had his own ambitions to secure greater power for his family. During the war of Siena, Bindo fitted out five companies of three thousand infantry, captained by his son Giambattista Altoviti, to join the rebel army. After their defeat in the Battle of Marciano, Piero Strozzi fled to France to the court of Catherine de' Medici. Many members of the Strozzi and Soderini families were exiled, imprisoned or declared rebels. Cosimo declared Bindo a rebel and confiscated all his property in Tuscany, including Raphael's Madonna dell'Impannata, which he took for his private chapel in the Palazzo Pitti. However, Bindo was still protected by his patrons Paul III and Pope Julius III. In fact, he was the recipient of many favors and able to develop a complex financial empire, centered on various papal enterprises, ultimately rising to become one of the most influential bankers of his generation. He continued to support the exiles and the royal House of Valois of France. He gave a substantial loan to Catherine de' Medici's husband, King Henry II of France, hoping that the king would move against Florence, in the end he did not, because of his military commitments against England and Spain. Bindo died in 1557, still confident of the liberation of Florence. With the hope of bringing his remains back to Florence, his family had erected a funeral monument in the church of Santi Apostoli, which remained vacant. Instead he was buried in the family chapel in the church of Santa Trinit√† dei Monte in Rome.  Patron of the arts  Like other Florentines who provided loans to the popes in exchange for the rights to papal revenues, Bindo prospered. He enjoyed the financial resources to undertake extensive renovations to the properties he inherited from his father and his suburban villa on the Tiber, and to indulge a growing passion for art. Known for, and endowed with, a strong taste for art, he became a patron of the arts and friend to Cellini, Raphael, Michelangelo and Vasari.Allegory of the Immaculate Conception by Vasari, Altoviti chapel Santi Apostoli Florence Immortalized in the portrait by Raphael, he gave sanctuary to Michelangelo when he fled from Florence to Rome. Michelangelo had such a high esteem for Bindo, while he despised his rival Agostino Chigi, that he gave him as a gift the cartoon of Noah's Blessing (lost), used for the fresco in the vault of the Sistine Chapel as well as a drawing of a Venus (lost) colored by Vasari. It was also Michelangelo who convinced Bindo not to rebuild, but to preserve, the Santi Apostoli church. Vasari painted the Allegory of the Immaculate Conception for the family chapel. When in Rome, Vasari also used to stay at the Palazzo Altoviti where he frescoed the Triumph of Ceres. When the palazzo was demolished in order to create the Tiber's embankments, the frescos were removed and are now shown in the National Museum of Palazzo Venezia. For Bindo's suburban villa Vasari frescoed a vast loggia called the Vineyard, decorated with statues and burial marbles from Emperor Hadrian's Villa Adriana. Andrea Sansovino also gave Bindo as a gift a terracotta model of the statue of St. James he sculpted for the Duomo in Florence.  Descendants  Bindo's son Giovanni Battista Altoviti married Clarice Ridolfi, daughter of Lorenzo Ridolfi, grandson of Lorenzo il Magnifico di Mediciand Clarice Orsini, bringing about a reconciliation between the houses of Altoviti, Medici and Strozzi. This made it possible for Bindo's other son, Archbishop of Florence Antonio Altoviti, finally to live in his bishopric. Giovanni Battista himself remained a banker in Rome, was twice consul of the Nazione Fiorentina, and exercised, under Pius V, the offices of an apostolic general and the Depositario dell'Abbondanza. Pope Clemente XII, great-grandson of Marietta Altoviti Strozzi Marietta Altoviti married Giambattista Strozzi, which also strengthened the linke between the houses of Strozzi and Medici. Their descendants became the Strozzi dukes of Bagnolo and princes of Forano, the Corsini princes of Sismano, dukes of Casigliano and Civitella, and most prominent Pope Clement XII. Their granddaughter Lucrezia Maria Strozzi married Prince Aleksander Ludwik Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Voivode of Polock, Grand Marshal of Lithuania and member of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, magnates of Poland and Lithuania. Prince Anton Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was the husband of Louise of Prussia. The couple were important patrons of the arts in Berlin during the 19th century. Their later heir Prince Stanis≈Çaw Albrecht Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was married to Caroline Lee Radziwill, sister of the late First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and sister-in-law of President John F. Kennedy.

Its success went hand in hand with the growth of the shipbuilding industries on the Firth of Clyde in the nineteenth century and the emergence of Glasgow as the \\"second city of the Empire\\". It also reflected the firm's skill in responding to an unprecedented demand for quality tools by shipyards, cooperages and other industries, both locally and far and wide. Early years The year 1792 was deemed by the firm to be that of its foundation;The Edinburgh Evening News of 4 June 1892 reported the company's centenary celebrations of the previous day. it was in all likelihood the year in which John Manners had set up his plane-making workshop on Saracen('s) Lane off the GallowgateThe Glasgow Directory for 1799 records a Manners working as a plane-maker in Saracen's Lane. A record for the year 1792 has not yet been found. Manners, the plane-maker makes a last appearance in the Glasgow Directory of 1822, p. 135. in the heart of Glasgow, not far from the Saracen's Head Inn,Demolished in 1905. See House, Jack. The Heart of Glasgow. Castle Douglas: Neil Wilson Publishing, 2011 . where Dr. Johnson and James Boswell had stayed on their tour of Scotland in 1773.Boswell, James. Boswell's Life of Johnson. Alexander Mathieson (1797‚Äì1851) is recorded in 1822 as a plane-maker at 25 Gallowgate, but in the following year at 14 Saracen's Lane, presumably having taken over the premises of John Manners.Glasgow Directory for 1822, p. 137, two pages after John Manners; Glasgow Directory for 1823, p. 142. The 1841 national census described Alexander Mathieson as a master plane-maker at 38 Saracen Lane with his son Thomas Adam working as a journeyman plane-maker. Thomas Adam Mathieson Gradually business grew and became more diversified, the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory recording that by 1847/8 Alexander Mathieson was a \\"plane, brace, bit, auger & edge-tool maker\\".See 1847/8 edition, p. 197. =Edinburgh= In 1849 the firm of James & William Stewart at 65 Nicolson Street, Edinburgh was taken over and Thomas was put in charge of the business, trading under the name Thomas A. Mathieson & Co. as plane and edge-tool makers.Post-Office Edinburgh and Leith Directory, 1849/50, p. 260. Thomas's company acquired the Edinburgh edge-tool makers Charles & Hugh McPherson and took over their premises in Gilmore Street.Post-Office Edinburgh and Leith Directory, 1854/5, p. 222. In the Edinburgh directory of 1856/7 the business is recorded as being Alexander Mathieson & Son, plane and edge-tool makers at 48 Nicolson Street and at Paul's Work, Gilmore Street.Post-Office Edinburgh and Leith Directory, 1856/7, p. 314. =Growth of the Glasgow business= The 1851 census records that Alexander was working as a tool and plane-maker employing eight men. Later that year Alexander died and his son Thomas took over the business. Under the heading of edge-tool maker in the 1852/3 Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory the firm is now listed as Alexander Mathieson & Son, with further lines as \\"turning-lathe and vice manufacturers\\" added. By the early 1850s the business had moved to 24 Saracen Lane.Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory for 1851/2. The directory for 1857/8 records that the firm had moved again only a few years later to East Campbell Street, also off the Gallowgate, and that through further diversification was also manufacturing coopers' and tinmen's tools. The ten-yearly censuses log the firm's growth: in 1861 Thomas was a tool manufacturer employing 95 men and 30 boys; in 1871 he had 200 men working for him; and in 1881 300 men. By 1899 the firm had been incorporated as Alexander Mathieson & Sons Ltd, notwithstanding the fact that only Alexander's son Thomas appears ever to have joined the firm. Crescent-and-star mark for Alexander Mathieson & Son, from a cap iron =Trade-mark= In September 1868 Thomas Mathieson put a notice in the Sheffield & Rotherham Independent and the Sheffield Daily Telegraph stating that his firm had used the trade-mark of a crescent and star \\"for some time\\" and that \\"using or imitating the Mark would be proceeded against for infringement\\".The Merchandise Marks Act had been ratified in 1862. The firm had acquired its interest in the crescent-and-star mark from the heirs of Charles Pickslay, the Sheffield cutler who had registered it with the Cutlers' Company in 1833 and had died in 1852.Adamson, John. \\"Two great Scottish tool- makers\\", Furniture & Cabinetmaking, no. 223, October 2014, , p. 60. The year 1868 seems also to be the one in which the name Saracen Tool Works was first adopted; not only does it figure at the foot of the notice in the Sheffield press, it also makes its first appearance in the firm's entry in the Post- Office Glasgow Annual Directory in the 1868/9 edition. =Public life= As Thomas Mathieson's business grew, so too did his involvement in local public life and philanthropy. One of the representatives of the third ward on the town council of Glasgow, he became a river bailie in 1868, a magistrate in 1870 and a preceptor of Hutcheson's Hospital in 1878. He had a passion for books and was an \\"ardent Ruskinian\\".Mason, Thomas. Public and private libraries of Glasgow. Glasgow: T.D. Morison, 1885. He served on the committee handling the bequest for the setting up of the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. When he died at Coulter Maynes near Biggar in 1899, he left an estate worth ¬£142,764.Otago Witness, issue 2377, 21 September 1899, p. 11. He is buried at the Glasgow Necropolis next to the cathedral. Later years of the firm Both Thomas's sons, James Harper and Thomas Ogilvie, were involved in the continuing life of the firm. James followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a local public figure. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the County of the City of Glasgow and was made a deacon of the Incorporation of the Hammermen of Glasgow in 1919. His brother Thomas Ogilvie was recorded as tool manufacturer and employer in the 1911 census. Thomas Ogilvie's son Thomas Alastair Sutherland Ogilvie \\"Taso\\" Mathieson born in 1908 took a rather different approach to engineering, however, by becoming a racing driver. In 1947 he wed the French film actress Mila Par√©ly.Adamson, John. \\"Two great Scottish tool-makers\\", Furniture & Cabinetmaking, no. 223, October 2014, , p. 62.

Based in West Sussex, his work is wide-ranging and he has twice topped the iTunes Classical Singles Chart. Career Following an Arts degree at UEA, Damian Montagu began working in television (LWT and Planet 24) and marketing for four years. In 1997, he co-founded the music production company Montagu Bourcier, where he composed and produced music for commercials, films, documentaries, and multimedia projects. The agency quickly became one of London's leading composition and sound design companies. Here he composed and produced music on a multitude of brand campaigns, including Audi, BMW, Diesel, Dunhill, RBS and Sony. His film scores include The Cookie Thief (Palme d'Or nominated) and Subterrain, which was a collaboration with Michael Nyman. Additionally, he has created scores for award-winning work such as Football (starring Helena Bonham-Carter and directed by Gaby Dellal). Damian has produced scores for The South Bank Show, and series as varied as Geo (a 20 part series for Arte television) and The Science of Beauty starring Sharon Stone. In 2006, together with David Hill, the founder of Nuphonic Records, Damian formed Radial Music, a composition and music supervision company working with major advertising agencies and also with Disney, for whom Radial supervised musical content of its video games. In 2007, he produced an album project and a new solo project titled A Long Way from Somewhere for Damian Katkhuda, founder of the band Obi and later that year produced a track to raise HIV and AIDS awareness in Cape Verde. In 2010, Damian produced Wrong Side of the Dream, the second album of the singer Dawn Kinnard. \\"Empty Ocean\\", a song that he co-wrote and recorded with the Shetland artist Lise Sinclair, inspired the 2009 programme with the same name, part of the award-winning Between the Ears series of BBC Radio 3 (Damian was commissioned to create the suite of music for this programme). In 2013, Damian co-wrote and produced the No.1 Classical Chart hit \\"Waiting for You\\", featuring Victoria Beaumont, with Jonathan Goldstein and Felix Hagan. In 2015 Damian launched a new music label, Moonshot Music. The first signing artist was Jahm√©ne, whose 2nd album Unfathomable Phantasmagoria was released in September 2016. Damian produced eight tracks on the album, including the song \\"I Wish\\" which was chosen as the Official song for Peace One Day 2016. He also produced the tracks with the actor Samuel L. Jackson narrating. Damian co-wrote the song \\"Forever & Eternity\\" with Jahm√©ne Douglas and Charlie J Perry, which was performed live at the 2016 Mobo Awards Pre Show. In March 2016, Damian released the first single, \\"The Path towards Tomorrow\\" from the forthcoming debut album, In A South Downs Way. The single reached the Number 1 spot in the UK Classical iTunes charts and has been played on BBC Radio 3 and 4 and was also performed at the Glastonbury Festival. The album celebrates Damian's love of the South Downs in Sussex and was composed as he walked in the surrounding countryside. The actor Hugh Bonneville has contributed and narrated written reflections on the album itself. After release in June 2016 through Decca Records, the full album In A South Downs Way reached the top position in the Official UK Specialist Classical Charts. In A South Downs Way is the first of a planned series of albums under the banner Walk upon England, a project created by Damian with ex-Paul Weller sideman Stewart Prosser. The series is developed as a collection of evocative albums created by composers and writers who find their inspiration in walking its most beautiful and unspoiled landscapes. Walk Upon England celebrates the English countryside as a source of creativity and self-expression. Damian continues to write and produce music at his own Moonshot Studios in West Sussex.

The party emerged in March 2015 as a split from Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord. Its members were instrumental in the establishment of Act! at the Italian level in July 2015, and the LTV was disbanded in July 2017. History =Background= In the run-up of the 2007 municipal elections Tosi, long-time member of Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord (LV‚ÄìLN) and regional minister of Health since 2005, formed a \\"civic list\\" named after himself, the Tosi List (LT), in order to support his bid to become mayor of Verona. In the election Tosi, who was supported also by Forza Italia, National Alliance and a number of minor parties, was elected mayor by a landslide 60.7% of the vote and the LT won 16.4%, more than LV's 12.0%.http://www.repubblica.it/speciale/2007/elezioni/comunali/verona.html Five years later Tosi decided to run with the only support of the LT and the LV: he was re-elected with 57.3% of the vote, while the LT won 37.2% and the LV 10.7%.http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2012/elezioni/comunali/verona.html Such an electoral success propelled Tosi to the leadership of the LV, whose national congress elected him national secretary in June 2012.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/giugno/04/Bis_Maroni_congresso_veneto_Tosi_co_8_120604031.shtml In October 2013 Tosi launched Let's Rebuild the Country, a think tank aimed at preparing his bid in a putative centre-right prime-ministerial primary election.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2013/ottobre/07/scommessa_italiana_Tosi_Oltre_Nord_co_0_20131007_a47e5478-2f10-11e3-85b9-b6e5136dfd53.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2014/ottobre/19/per_eleggere_leader_Tosi_punta_co_0_20141019_8589c868-5750-11e4-a78a-f13a8df194ae.shtml =Split from Liga Veneta= In the run-up of the 2015 regional election the LV was quite divided on alliances and strategies. Luca Zaia, the incumbent President and rival of Tosi within the party, wanted to continue the alliance with its centre-right partners, Forza Italia (FI) and the New Centre-Right (NCD), and create a \\"Zaia List\\", Tosi wanted the party to run with the sole support of the \\"Zaia List\\" and a \\"Tosi List\\", while Matteo Salvini, the LN's federal secretary, kept an open mind only on FI and opposed, along with Zaia, any notion of a \\"Tosi List\\". Furthermore, while Zaia, supported by Salvini, wanted to renovate the party's group in the Regional Council and have a final say on the compilation of the party's slates, Tosi, who defended the position of long-time regional councillors and ministers, claimed his authority and the autonomy of the LV in relation to the federal party.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/febbraio/13/armi_Salvini_Tosi_per_battaglia_co_0_20150213_3c8f5e22-b34c-11e4-b816-db17adec4feb.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/febbraio/15/Alleanze_liste_condizioni_Tosi_Salvini_co_0_20150215_4dd4a694-b4df-11e4-a707-81f1507c882e.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/febbraio/17/Salvini_duello_con_Tosi_ipotesi_co_0_20150217_49ee644c-b675-11e4-9a37-71e41539c555.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/febbraio/20/Salvini_vuole_unita_apre_Tosi_co_0_20150220_0ad102c8-b8ce-11e4-90c9-3a3eaa126f46.shtml In early March two regional councillors close to Tosi, Luca Baggio and Matteo Toscani, launched the pro-Tosi Venetian Commitment, along with Francesco Piccolo, a former member of The People of Freedom, who was elected leader of the group in the Regional Council.http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/tosi-verso-rottura- consiglio-nasce-gruppo-impegno- veneto-c04358a1-faea-427b-ba55-dd0e21d3c478.htmlhttp://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2015/4-marzo-2015/questa- lega-non-ci-riconosciamo-piu-2301063554309.shtml Both Baggio, who had served as president of the LV since 2012, and Toscani explained that they disagreed with a perceived rightward shift of the party under Salvini.http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/tosi-verso-rottura- consiglio-nasce-gruppo-impegno- veneto-c04358a1-faea-427b-ba55-dd0e21d3c478.htmlhttp://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2015/4-marzo-2015/questa- lega-non-ci-riconosciamo-piu-2301063554309.shtml After a long struggle between Tosi and Salvini, the latter acknowledged the former's relinquishment from party member, on the grounds that Tosi had refused to ditch his think tank, Let's Rebuild the Country.http://www.corriere.it/politica/15_marzo_10/caso- tosi-salvini-prendo-atto-sua-decadenza-segretario- veneto-c6f627d2-c768-11e4-ace1-14c9e44d41cb.shtmlhttp://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/marzo/11/Salvini_rottura_nella_Lega_Tosi_co_0_20150311_19ef6226-c7bb-11e4-80a1-d57600bcc7ce.shtml Consequently, Tosi decided to challenge Zaia and run for president.http://www.lastampa.it/2015/03/14/italia/politica/tosi-si-candida- in-veneto-e-attacca-salvini-nemmeno-renzi-si-sarebbe-comportato- cos-1VTk7w8ZOpQP776InKXR7K/pagina.html Besides Baggio and Toscani, between March and April four more regional councillors of Liga Veneta (Daniele Stival, regional minister of Venetian Identity, and Giuseppe Stoppato, who formed, along with former Democrat Diego Bottacin, a group named \\"Toward North‚ÄìVenetian People\\",http://www.oggitreviso.it/bottacin-presidente-di-verso- nord-popolo-veneto-107986 Maurizio Conte, regional minister of the Environment,http://www.padova24ore.it/padova/9038-la-lega-nord-continua-a- perdere-pezzi-con-tosi-anche-maurizio-conte.html and Andrea Bassi),http://www.tgverona.it/index.cfm/hurl/contenuto=406667/politica/bassi_lascia_la_lega_e_si_schiera_con_tosi.html left the party in order to follow Tosi, along with three deputies (Matteo Bragantini, Roberto Caon and Emanuele Prataviera) out of five and three senators (Raffaella Bellot, Patrizia Bisinella, Tosi's partner, and Emanuela Munerato) out of five,http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2015-03-26/lega- tre-deputati-e-tre-senatori-tosiani-passano-gruppo- misto-121754.shtml?uuid=ABdXukFD while the three highest-ranking Tosiani, Marino Finozzi (regional minister of Tourism and International Trade), Leonardo Murarohttp://www.larena.it/stories/Home/1141498_muraro_dice_no_a_tosi_resto_nella_lega_nord/ (President of the Province of Treviso) and Mara Bizzotto MEP, chose not to.

Three incumbent regional ministers ran with Tosi: Conte and Stival with the LTV, and Marino Zorzato with NCD‚ÄìUdC‚ÄìPopular Area.

After beginning his racing career in France he moved to Ireland and made an immediate impact over hurdles in the spring of 2014 winning the Moscow Flyer Novice Hurdle, Deloitte Novice Hurdle, Supreme Novices' Hurdle and Tattersalls Champion Novice Hurdle. When moved up to compete in steeplechases he added wins in the Killiney Novice Chase, JLT Novices' Chase, 1965 Chase and Ryanair Chase as well as finishing a close second in the King George VI Chase. He died after a paddock accident on 6 November 2016 at the age of seven. Background Vautour was a bay gelding with a white blaze and white socks on his front feet bred in France by Haras De Saint Voir & Patrick Joubert. He was sired by the French stallion Robin des Champs, whose other progeny include Quevega and Sir Des Champs. Racing career =Early career in France= On his racecourse debut, Vautour contested a hurdle race for three-year-olds at Pau in December 2012 in which he finished second to Vizir d'Estruvel. At Auteuil Hippodrome in March, he again finished second, beaten six lengths by Black River. At the end of the season, Vautour was bought by Rich and Susannah Ricci and sent to Ireland to be trained by Willie Mullins. =2013/2014 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles= On his Irish debut, Vautour started 1/2 for a thirty-runner maiden hurdle at Navan Racecourse in December and won by five and a half lengths. In January he was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Moscow Flyer Novice Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse. Starting the 1/4 favourite, he was headed on the run-in by Western Boy but rallied to win by three quarters of a length. In the Grade 1 Deloitte Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse he started second favourite behind The Tullow Tank, a six-year-old who had won the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle and the Paddypower.com Future Champions Novice Hurdle. Ruby Walsh sent Vautour into the lead from the start and went clear of his rivals before beating The Tullow Tank by three lengths. On 11 March 2014, Vautour made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he contested the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. Ridden by Walsh, he started 7/2 joint-favourite alongside Irving who was unbeaten in his last five races including the Kennel Gate Novices' Hurdle and the Dovecote Novices' Hurdle. Vautour led for most of the way, accelerated approaching the last and won by six lengths from the Nicky Henderson-trained Josses Hill. On his final appearance of the season, the gelding started 1/3 favourite for the Grade 1 Tattersalls Ireland Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown and won by three and a half lengths from Apache Stronghold. =2014/2015 National Hunt season: Novice chases= In the 2014/2015 National Hunt season Vautour was campaigned in Novice steeplechases. On his debut over the larger obstacles at Navan in November he started at odds of 2/11 and led all the way to win by eight lengths from the four-year-old Clarcam. The gelding then started 1/4 favourite in a six-runner field for the Grade 1 Racing Post Novice Chase at Leopardstown in December. After disputing the lead for most of the way he made a jumping error at the fifth last and tired in the closing stages before dead-heating for second, seventeen lengths behind Clarcam. Only two horses appeared to oppose Vautour when he contested the Group 2 Killiney Chase in January. His closest rival, Real Steel fell at the final fence, allowing Vautour to come home ninety-two lengths clear of Aladdin's Cave. On 12 March 2015 Vautour won the JLT Novices' Chase at Cheltenham in impressive fashion marking him a main contender for next year's Gold Cup and received early quotes of 7‚Äì1 with race sponsor Betfred. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= Vautour started a successful campaign by winning the 1965 Chase five-runner field on his seasonal reappearance. He was out in front for the entire race and the main challenger, three-times Grade 2 winner Ptit Zig, only came upside at the last fence but after a good jump Vautour went on to win by 2 lengths. His next start was on Boxing Day in the King George VI Chase where he made his debut against older horses at Grade 1 level. He travelled prominently and followed the pace set by the previous two-times winner of the race Silviniaco Conti until Vautour's jockey Ruby Walsh decided to send him into the lead at the start of the second circuit maintaining a strong tempo upfront. As they entered the final home straight Vautour was travelling the best but at the second last fence the favourite Don Cossack fell leaving only Cue Card to chase down Vautour with Al Ferof a further 5 lengths back in third. At the last fence the deficit between Cue Card and Vautour was down to one length but they both made a jumping error and a thrilling battle began up to the finish line with Vautour going all out to repel the challenge but in the end he was narrowly denied by a head. Vautour then took part in the third straight Cheltenham Festival where he was sent the evens favourite for the 2016 renewal of the Ryanair Chase. He travelled strongly under usual race-rider Ruby Walsh and after a good round of jumping he won by 6 lengths from stablemate Valseur Lido. He came out only three weeks later at Aintree for the Melling Chase but failed to complete and fell at the ninth fence. He was next sent by trainer Willie Mullins for the first time in almost two years back down over the minimum trip of two miles, for the Punchestown Champion Chase where he met six rivals. After following the pace set by Special Tiara for most of the race, he started to make ground on the leader but going into the home straight he failed to show a turn of foot and was overtaken by Gods Own and Simonsig. He stayed on well after the last fence to regain the second spot finishing two lengths behind Gods Own, jockey Ruby Walsh reporting: \\"He was flat out the whole way over that trip\\". On 6 November 2016 it was announced that Vautour had been euthanised. Willie Mullins explained \\"he was out in a paddock with another of our horses, Shaneshill ‚Äì the two of them go out to the same paddock most days. We don't know what exactly happened ‚Äì it must have been a freak accident ‚Äì but when one of the girls went out to feed the horses Vautour was found with a broken front leg and our vet had no option but to put him down\\". Pedigree *Through his sire, Vautour was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Sicambre, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The mission was contracted by NASA and is operated by SpaceX using a Dragon capsule. The cargo was successfully carried aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 Flight 27. Launch and operations history A July 2014 NASA Flight Planning Integration Panel (FPIP) presentation had this mission scheduled no earlier than (NET) 7 December 2015. By December 2014, the launch had been pushed back to NET 9 December 2015. Following the failure of SpaceX CRS-7 on 28 June 2015, the launch date was left open and, in September 2015, was moved to NET 21 March 2016. The flight was later pushed to 24 June, 27 June, 16 July, and finally 18 July 2016, as the crewed mission Soyuz MS-01 took the 24 June slot. CRS-9 launched on 18 July 2016 at 04:44 UTC from Cape Canaveral SLC-40 aboard a Falcon 9 launch vehicle. After 9 minutes and 37 seconds the Dragon spacecraft successfully separated from the rocket, and deployed its solar arrays about two minutes later. The opening of its GNC door came two hours later, enabling orbital operations. After a series or orbital maneuvers and stationkeeping at different hold points, the CRS-9 Dragon was captured by the ISS's Canadarm2 on 20 July 2016 at 10:56 UTC. After robotic operations, it was berthed some three hours later at 14:03 UTC. In preparation for recovery, the Dragon capsule was loaded with of experiments and no-longer-needed equipment and, on 25 August 2016 at 21:00 UTC, it was unberthed and stowed in an overnight parking position away from the station. Dragon was released from Canadarm2 the following day at 10:11 UTC. After maneuvering away from the station, Dragon conducted a re-entry burn at 14:56 UTC and successfully landed in the Pacific Ocean at 15:47 UTC, approximately southwest of Baja California. Primary payload NASA contracted for the CRS-9 mission from SpaceX and therefore determined the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. CRS-9 carried of cargo to the International Space Station. Amongst its pressurized cargo was of material supporting about 250 science and research experiments, of crew supplies, of spacecraft hardware, of extravehicular activity equipment, of computer equipment, and of Russian hardware. Its unpressurized cargo, the International Docking Adapter-2 located in Dragon's trunk, massed . Some of the key experiments transported by CRS-9 to the ISS were the Biomolecule Sequencer, which performed DNA sequencing in orbit; the Phase Change Heat Exchanger, which tested temperature regulation systems for future spacecraft applications; the OsteoOmics experiment, which tested if Earth-based magnetic levitation can properly simulate microgravity conditions; and the Heart Cells experiment from Stanford University, which examined the effects of microgravity on the human heart at the cellular and molecular level using human induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes. First stage landing Following stage separation, the rocket's first stage performed a boostback maneuver and landed smoothly at Landing Zone 1, Cape Canaveral, for the second time on solid ground, following Falcon 9 Flight 20 in December 2015.

It is located in Ota (Alenquer Municipality), occupying the facilities of the former Ota Air Base (officially, the Air Base No 2). Around 90% of the personnel of the Portuguese Air Force is trained at Ota. Mission The CFMTFA is responsible to provide the following training for the Portuguese Air Force personnel: # Training and promotion course for the sergeants of the permanent staff; # Training courses for the engaged staff (corporals, sergeants and officers) of the several specialties of the Air Force; # Basic military training for the volunteer engaged staff; # Vocational training courses; # Refreshment or specialization courses; # Training of instructors; # Vocational training for the civilian staff of the Air Force; # Other training courses with interest for the Air Force or for the Ministry of National Defense. Air infrastructure The CFMTFA occupies the facilities of a former air base deactivated in 1992. The air infrastructures include a 2500 m long asphalt certified air strip. However, as the unit does not maintain permanent flying operations, the air traffic control, meteorology, fire rescue and fuel supply services are deactivated. The Ota air facilities were the planned site for the Ota Airport - the future new Lisbon international airport - from the late 1990s. The CFMTFA would then be transferred to the Ovar Air Base. The project was however aborted in January 2008 when the decision was taken that the new Lisbon airport would be built in the area of the present Field Firing Range of Alcochete.Jornal de Neg√≥cios Online :: Empresas History The origins of the present CFMTFA lay in the Air Base No 2 of the Aeron√°utica Militar (the Aviation branch of the Portuguese Army), inaugurated on 14 April 1940 by the Portuguese President √ìscar Carmona. At that time, the base was home of a fighter squadron equipped with Gloster Gladiator aircraft, two day bomber squadrons equipped with Junkers Ju-86 and two night bomber squadrons equipped with Junkers Ju 52. During the World War II, Ota became the main fighter aviation base of the Aeron√°utica Militar, receiving squadrons of Supermarine Spitfire and Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters, as well as Bristol Blenheim light bombers. In the 1950s, Ota continued to be the main fighter base of the now independent Portuguese Air Force, housing the Operational Fighter Aviation Group, initially composed of F-47 Thunderbolt fighter squadrons. In 1954, the F-47 were replaced by F-84G Thunderjet jet fighters, with an jet fighter training unit equipped with T-33 Shooting Star being also activated. In this period, the base was also the home of the S√£o Jorge and Drag√µes aerobatic teams, equipped with F-84 jets. In the late 1950s, the F-84 started to be replaced by F-86 Sabre jet fighters. The fighter and fighter training units were transferred to the newly open Monte Real Air Base in 1958. From then on, Ota Air Base becomes mainly an elementary flight training base, operating De Havilland Chipmunk aircraft. From the 1970s to the 1990s, it was also home of a liaison unit equipped with Cessna FTB-337G Skymaster In 1960, the base becomes also the home of the Specialists Technicians Training Group of the Air Force (GITE, Grupo de Instru√ß√£o de T√©cnicos Especialistas). The GITE is transformed in the Training Center no. 7 in 1975, being renamed Training Center no. 2 in 1976. In 1992, the Ota Air Base is deactivated as air base, merging with the Training Center no. 2 and becoming the Military and Technical Training Center of the Air Force.

The work was jointly commissioned by the St. Louis Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. It was completed February 3, 2011 and premiered May 5, 2011 by the Saint Louis Symphony under David Robertson at Powell Hall in St. Louis, Missouri.Rouse, Christopher. Symphony No. 3: Program Note by the Composer. 2011. Retrieved March 5, 2015. The piece is dedicated to Rouse's high school music teacher, John Merrill. Composition Rouse conceived the Symphony No. 3 as a reworking of Sergei Prokofiev's Symphony No. 2 in D minor (itself a homage to Beethoven's final Piano Sonata), though there are relatively few musical quotes from the work. Instead, as Rouse wrote in the program notes, he used the \\"unusual form of Prokofiev's Symphony No. 2\\" to \\"[furnish] the old bottle into which I have tried to pour new wine.\\" The symphony has a duration of approximately 25 minutes and is composed in two movements; the first is a \\"savage and aggressive\\" homage to the symphony of \\"iron and steel\\" and the second is a theme with five variations. The name of Rouse's later wife Natasha (Miller) was encoded into Symphony No. 3 using a system that assigned musical pitches to letters. The symphony is a musical portrait of his second wife. =Instrumentation= The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four French horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba, two harps, timpani, percussion (three players), and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Tim Smith of The Baltimore Sun said the work built up \\"startling energy\\" and added that it \\"makes a substantial addition to the orchestral repertoire. It leaves you almost reeling ‚Äî in a good way ‚Äî from an assault on the senses.\\" Reviewing the world premiere, Chuck Lavazzi of KDHX called the symphony \\"a fiercely challenging work that demands remarkable stamina and skill from every member of the orchestra. In that last respect it reminded me as much of Bartok‚Äôs Concerto for Orchestra as it did of the Prokofiev work. An aggressive mix of wild cacophony and surprising lyricism, the piece was clearly not received with enthusiasm by everyone, but my wife and I both found it bracing.\\" Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly described the piece as \\"a phenomenal score, as vivid and beautiful as anything this composer has ever done.\\" References 3 Category:2011 compositions Rouse 3 Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Music dedicated to students or teachers Category:Music commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the St. Louis Symphony Category:Music commissioned by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Symphony No. 3 (Rouse)"},{"id":"45583903","title":"Throw Me in the River"},{"id":"45583910","text":"Rock Band 4 is a 2015 music video game developed and published by Harmonix. Rock Band 4 allows players to simulate the playing of music across many different decades and genres using instrument controllers that mimic playing lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. As the fourth main installment and the 7th major console installment in the Rock Band franchise, it was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 6, 2015. Mad Catz, who also developed new instrument controllers for the game, marketed and distributed the title worldwide at launch; Performance Designed Products (PDP) took over manufacturing and distribution by the end of 2016. The game shipped with more than sixty licensed songs; additional songs are available as downloadable content, which includes a library of over 2000 existing songs from prior installments. Rock Band 4 represented Harmonix's return to the franchise after an almost three-year hiatus, following the diminishing popularity of the rhythm game market that started in 2009. Announced on March 5, 2015, Rock Band 4 refocuses on the core gameplay of the franchise, reducing the emphasis on musical instruction that was employed by its predecessor, Rock Band 3, while emphasizing the game's social interactions, as well as new features enabling players to incorporate improvisation into their performance‚Äîsuch as \\"freestyle solos\\" on guitar, and \\"freeform melodies\\" on multi-part vocals. Rock Band 4 offers backward compatibility with content and hardware from previous versions of Rock Band within the same console family; wireless guitar and drum controllers from PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Rock Band can be used on the PS4 and Xbox One versions (with PS4 using an existing USB dongle, and Xbox One requiring a newly produced USB dongle), and DLC songs purchased on prior installments on PS3 and Xbox 360 can be re-downloaded at no extra charge on PS4 and Xbox One in a ported form that supports the game's features. Harmonix plans to release free and paid DLC that will add new features and content to the game over time, in lieu of releasing yearly installments; this includes the addition of support for synchronous online play added on January 25, 2017. Critical reception to Rock Band 4 on-launch was positive, with reviews praising the game for not significantly deviating from the gameplay mechanics of prior installments, as well as the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with previously-released content for the Rock Band franchise. The game was also criticized for lacking features present in previous versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes.  Gameplay  The gameplay of Rock Band 4 follows that from previous games in the series: the player or group of players use special instrument-based controllers or microphones to mimic playing the instruments by following scrolling cues on screen and attempt to play through a song and score points. Players score points for successfully hitting notes, earning a scoring multiplier for hitting a continuous series of notes without mistakes, while failure to hit the right notes can penalize the players' performance and could end the song prematurely. During the song, certain phrases are marked with specially colored notes, which if played correctly, fills the player's Overdrive meter. Once sufficiently filled, the player is able to trigger \\"Overdrive\\" through various means depending on instrument, which doubles their scoring multiplier as well as boosting the band's overall performance meter. Players are rated using a five-star system based on their score, and possibly earning a gold star rating if playing on Expert difficulty with a high score. At Rock Band 4 release, the game supported three main modes. Quickplay allows the players to select any song to play that is on disc or in the downloadable content library of songs. Players can also engage in Shows which are a series of songs broken up into a number of sets. Some songs in these Shows are predetermined, but others are left to be voted on during a short period between songs by the band members; individual members also have the opportunity to select a song from a limited list during periods of the current song when their musical part is inactive. The available options are based on what songs the collective band members have in their library and the band's chosen theme, and voting options may include specific songs (including one selected mid-song), or broad classifications such as by genre type, release year, or song length. To aid in the cooperative nature of the game, any scoring multipliers and remaining Overdrive are carried over between songs in Gig lists as well as between sets in the Career mode. The main mode for Rock Band 4 is a Band Tour career mode which IGN described as a role-playing game. Within the narrative of the Band Tour, the players' band starts off as a small town group with a handful of fans. En route to becoming more popular and successful, the players are tasked with the option of what types of gigs they want their band to play, with various risks and rewards that influence: how many fans the group attains per geographic region; what future gigs they will have available; and how much in-game money they earn (which can be spent customizing their band's clothes and instruments). While there are a number of possible sets that the band can select from with more unlocked as the players progresses in the game, the primary means of advancing the band's narrative is through multi-part Tours which consist of 3 to 6 different shows to be played in order. At the start of each of these Tours, the players will have two options that will affect what type of song sets they will see on the tour and the benefits of completing each set and the overall Tour. For example, players are able to have their band take a corporate-sponsored gig, which will earn the band a large amount of in-game money, but may impact their band's reputation and limit future venues, while taking on smaller shows will not produce as much money, but increase the band's renown and open more possible gigs. Subsequent Tours may require the players to earn more stars from other, single Sets that are available, before that tour is available. Sets during Band Tours may feature pre-determined song lists or song lists decided by the band similar to the main Sets mode, with available songs limited to certain criteria as overall band difficulty or genre type. Players may also be presented with the option to swap out a song for a crowd-requested one, or to also play an encore song in the same manner as with Sets. The band is not only rated on their general performance based on the five star rating, but as well as the players' stage presence impact the rewards from these gigs, which are based on how well the band performs in unison, such as hitting \\"Overdrive\\" together, drummers completing drum fills, and vocalists improvising. Taking crowd requests and completing encores also boosts this stage presence. These will increase the rewards in terms of fans and money at the end of a successful set. With Freestyle solos, the guitar player (rightmost track) can improvise their solo, using guides provided by the game, here showing the transition from a chord- heavy to single-note riffs (pre-release visuals shown). Rock Band 4 now has the use of Freestyle Guitar Solos, an optional feature. If this feature is disabled, guitar solos in songs are presented as they were in previous Rock Band games with more of the same note-matching aspects in beat with the original song's solo; the player scores as they normally do as during regular song sections, with an added scoring bonus based on the percentage of the solo notes hit correctly. When this feature is enabled, instead of the predefined solo, the game shows suggestions for the solo style to emulate at that time, such as single notes or longer licks, chords, or tremolos, using different patterns to highlight the guitar player's on-screen track. The track markings also indicate which set of fret keys on the instrument control to use, which determine the pitch of the notes. Players cannot fail these freestyle sections, but they are scored on how well they hit the suggested style during the segment, and they can retain their scoring multiplier by performing the proper playing style on each section of the solo. The game includes tutorials to help explain these mechanics to players. Further, the audio feedback from these solos has been refined as to make whatever the player performs stay consistent and in-tune with the other active and backing instruments. Drums players for Rock Band 4 are able to count down to start the song as often done by real-life bands. Rock Band 4 will change how the drummer can trigger overdrive: unlike past titles, where the drummer would gain a free-form section and then strike a specific pad to activate overdrive, which Harmonix found would throw some players off, Rock Band 4 presents one of a random number of pre-created drum fills that fit the timing of the song when the drummer player has Overdrive available. This feature is backward compatible with all previous songs in the Rock Band library. Vocal players are able to use two- or three-part harmonies as previously used in The Beatles: Rock Band and Rock Band 3, and through contributions from the Rock Band fan community, existing Rock Band songs that feature vocal harmonies but originally released for the series without harmony support, is updated to include harmonies. Higher difficulty settings for vocals allow for \\"freeform melodies\\" where as long as the vocalist is in tune, they can improvise to a degree to add their personal touch to a song. This improvisation is scored separately from the in- tune scoring, thus presenting an additional challenge for this advanced mode. As with previous Rock Band titles, the players has the ability to create custom avatars for their band members within the game, which are displayed in the background visuals while playing through a song. The avatars have several custom aspects such as hair styling, make-up, clothing, and instruments. In- game money can be used to purchase more customization options, while some come as rewards for completing certain parts of the game. Rock Band 4 ships with more pre-made characters to allow players to get into the game faster, and atop more options from previous games, removes restrictions on gender-fixed items; for example, mustaches and beards were only an option for male characters in previous games. In an interview with Vice in June 2015, Sussman stated that the game would not ship with support for online play, as surveys taken prior to release, and their own tracking, showed that only about 10% of previous Rock Band players used the online feature, and thus focused on building out the local play features first for release. Sussman commented that it may be released as part of future patches to the title. The game at launch did support online leaderboards and score tracking at launch, and has added additional asynchronous features since. In April 2016, Harmonix announced that it will add in synchronous online play by the end of 2016. In December 2016, Harmonix delayed the online addition until January 25, 2017 to make sure this feature covered all edge cases that they had encountered in testing. Post- release content Rock Band 4 is designed by Harmonix as a platform title which can be updated periodically, as opposed to releasing new disc-based versions. These updates are anticipated to include bug fixes and new gameplay features to the base game. Many of the updates are based on feedback from players about the game. The first major update released on December 8, 2015 includes addition of \\"variable breakneck speed\\" which allows players to change the rate of scrolling notes on screen, and an auto bass-kick option that will remove the need for drum players to hit the bass pedal and focus only on the drum pad notes. \\"Brutal mode\\" is a challenge mode where, as the player continues doing well on a song, the notes on the scrolling highway will disappear some time after they appear on it, but will still need to be played on time; the speed at which they disappear is based on how well the player is playing, and by clearing the song with what would normally be gold stars, the player earns \\"Crimson Stars\\" instead. A new \\"Score Challenge\\" gameplay mode will allow players to track what their friends are playing and then asynchronously challenge their scores on the same song, including light- hearted taunts should they win. A February 2016 update (originally slated for January but pushed back) implemented a number of features to prevent high score cheating via game exploits, as well as changing the nature of non-Tour mode shows to allow their scores to be included in leaderboards. To effect this change, Harmonix had to wipe existing leaderboards, but in the future if similar exploits are found, they will be able to adjust leaderboards for specific songs and instruments. Playlists were added as part of the game's April 2016 update, and a practice mode and enhanced sort sorting were added with the June 2016 update. The late 2016 updates will also coincide with the release of updated controllers from Performance Designed Products, as announced in March 2016. Harmonix released a patch to include online play on January 25, 2017, an oft-requested feature since Rock Band 4s launch; this will require players to have purchased the Rivals expansion (described below). Updates have included additional clothing and instruments for the in-game characters, including Vault suits as part of a promotional tie-in in Bethesda's Fallout 4, the goggle headgear worn by the protagonist Raz from Double Fine Productions' Psychonauts, outfits for characters from Gearbox Software's Battleborn, and instruments and outfits inspired by Mass Effect: Andromeda. A March 2017 update included a special cel-shaded Sterling Archer avatar from the animated show Archer, developed in conjunction with Floyd County Productions and FXX. An update to the game was released alongside Rivals; it brought back advanced song filtering options (including the ability to sort songs by their source game) and a song rating system, both present in Rock Band 3, and introduced a refreshed, dark blue interface theme. These changes are available to all players, regardless of whether they have purchased the expansion or not. Sussman has asserted that they do not plan to bring back keyboard support that had been in Rock Band 3, seeing it diverge from their current target for Rock Band 4. =Expansions= In addition to free updates to the game, Harmonix has planned to release purchasable expansions to Rock Band 4, adopting a model similar to such paid expansions on Destiny and World of Warcraft. The first paid expansion, Rock Band Rivals, was released on October 18, 2016. The expansion includes two new game modes. The Rivals mode allows up to ten players to form Crews which their collective scoring across songs in an asynchronous manner will be used in challenges against other Crews. This mode includes online scoreboards, weekly challenges, and new rewards in the form of avatar clothing and instruments. Crews compete to be ranked across six tiers based on total score for three spotlight songs and experience gained from other songs in the weekly challenge; only Crews with the highest average rankings based on set percentages of total Crews can be promoted to higher tiers, while Crews with low average rankings could be demoted. Rivals mode was designed to address the issue that trying to coordinate all members of a band to play at the same time could be difficult. The second mode is a story-driven Rockudrama, which use live-action footage as part of the narrative, inspired by documentaries such as Behind the Music. These segments bookends various sets, and includes selected comments that reflect on the performance, good or bad, that a given player might have during that. Players gain Fame by earning stars in these sets, which are needed to progress further in the Rockudrama, and by achieving a specific amount of fame over several sets, the player can unlock new venues that will appear in other gameplay areas of Rock Band 4. Rock Band Rivals itself did not include additional songs at launch, although those who pre-ordered the expansion received up to twelve new songs for free; these songs were later released for sale to other users. The December 2016 update to Rivals provided twelve free songs to all owners from local Boston bands that were part of the interviews for the Rockumentary game mode. The January 2017 update added the Online Quickplay mode and one additional free song to Rivals. In a May 2017 patch for Rivals, the Rivals mode switched to an 8-week Seasonal system, rewarding Crews for placement at the end of the season with unique in-game gear, and eliminating demotions. The update also introduced Missions, similar to the Challenges used in Rock Band 3, that require players to meet certain goals to complete; some of these will include Missions for Crews as well as single- player challenges. Completing Missions earns unique badges players can showcase on their user profile in-game. The new server architecture of Rock Band 4 allowed Harmonix to update and add Missions over time without having to patch the game. With the second Season in this new format, Harmonix offers a Season Spotlight Pass that gives the purchaser eight new songs over that Season that are featured as Spotlight songs in the Rivals challenges at a small discount over buying all eight songs individually.  Development  Rhythm games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero had been widely popular during 2005 to 2008, but due to oversaturation of the market and the onset of the 2009 recession, the rhythm genre suffered major setbacks, and the genre's popularity had quickly waned. Harmonix had released Rock Band 3 in 2010, and while well received by critics and fans, had only an estimated one million retail sales, lagging behind its dancing game, Dance Central, released during the same period. Harmonix would continue to support Rock Band 3 through 2013 with additional content patches and over 280 consecutive weeks of new songs provided as downloadable content (DLC), as well as producing Rock Band Blitz, an arcade-like rhythm game that did not require instrument controllers, but used existing music libraries. In April 2013, Harmonix released its last regular DLC, stating that they were focusing on other projects. The company noted that they would look to reintroduce Rock Band in the future, when they felt the time was right to bring back the game. Development of Rock Band 4 began in the last quarter of 2014. This followed from several factors. Harmonix's former CEO and current creative director Alex Rigopulos explained that the studio had awaited both a \\"critical mass\\" of adoption for the next- generation consoles, and a \\"clear and compelling creative vision\\" for the game before beginning work on a successor‚Äîprompting the franchise's hiatus. Rigopulos said that internally if they were going to bring back Rock Band, they wanted to \\"really make the best game that we had ever made; that we had a vision for what Rock Band 4 was going to be, that made it worth making, really\\". A clear vision of the goals for the game came about more than a year prior to the game's release. Harmonix's Greg LoPiccolo added that they did not want to try to introduce Rock Band 4 during the new consoles' first year where they would have to compete with major franchises. Funding for development was aided by $15 million in investments from Spark Capital and Foundry Group, not only to support Rock Band 4 but the remake of Harmonix' Amplitude and future projects involving virtual reality. Following the aggressive focus on musical instruction within Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4 instead puts a larger focus on the franchise's core gameplay, multiplayer, and the overall feeling of the experience; Rigopulos felt that the franchise had become too \\"sprawling\\" in functionality, and that \\"there is an existing gameplay core that is very powerful and very fun, and we don't want to tamper with that core. At the same time, we need to bring something new to the experience.\\" Owing to this renewed focus, the Pro Guitar and piano keyboard modes were dropped from the game. Rigopulos stated that Ubisoft's competing Rocksmith series \\"is serving the audience that wants actual guitar instrumental instruction very well.\\" The new Freestyle Guitar Solo feature was something that Harmonix had built a prototype for in early 2014; at the time they did not have a clear concept of its use but found the mechanic to have potential and built up parts of Rock Band 4 around it. Rigopulos also noted that they were not trying to develop Rock Band 4 with competition from Guitar Hero Live in mind; that competition had caused the original over-saturation of the rhythm game market in 2009. With Rock Band 4, Harmonix' goal is a smaller but known fraction of the market of both old Rock Band players and new ones, such that meeting those numbers would make the game financially viable even if it does not outsell Guitar Hero Live. This goal also helps to manage the costs of the game as they do not have to manufacture as many instrument sets as they had done previously. Harmonix developed a new game engine called Forge, also used for their remake of Amplitude, to take advantage of the upgraded hardware of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, allowing the game to run at 1080p at 60 frames per second; product manager Eric Pope stated that the engine included better lighting, character models, and animation. The game was not released for the Wii U or the personal computer market, with product manager Daniel Sussman stating that two issues that would limit a personal computer version is existing music availability, and the lack of security for the specific music tracks which the PlayStation and Xbox consoles already possess. Sussman stated that either platform could be possible in the future if there is market demand, but their present focus was the safest route to bringing Rock Band to mass market through the major console platforms. On January 13, 2015, Harmonix announced three new DLC songs, the first in nearly 21 months. The sudden release, along with a survey posted by Harmonix a few days later, indicated the possibility that the studio was planning to develop a new Rock Band game for eighth generation consoles. On March 5, 2015, Harmonix officially announced Rock Band 4. Rock Band 4 is expected to be the only retail release of the franchise for the current generation of consoles; Rigopulos called the multiple-release cycle \\"taxing\\" on both the studio and consumers, and instead sees the game as a platform which they can continuously improve over the life of the title without excessive work. In August 2015, Harmonix stated that they already have plans for post-release patches, both free and paid, to add new gameplay functionality to expand the Rock Band 4 title, with plans to release a free patch in December 2015 to include an option for \\"Variable Breakneck Speed\\", which affects the rate at which notes scroll on the screen, among other features. In March 2016, Harmonix launched a crowd funding campaign through the Fig platform to produce Rock Band 4 for personal computers, to have been released in the last quarter of 2016. Harmonix estimated the game would cost $2 million to make, of which they would contribute $500,000 towards if they can raise the remaining $1.5 million. The port would have been primarily handled by Sumo Digital, integrating the updates that Harmonix will continue to provide in the main game. The game would have been released via Steam, allowing users to use the Steam Workshop to create their own songs and distribute it to others, with curation by Harmonix to avoid copyright infringements, in a manner comparable to the Rock Band Network but at a lower cost; they have already ported the previous Rock Band Network tools to offer to backers of the campaign. Harmonix planned to allow compatibility with all existing instrument controllers from the various PlayStation 2, 3 and 4, and Xbox 360 and One platforms, and had begun working through details with Sony and Microsoft. The game would have shipped with the same 65 songs as the console version, and at least 1700 songs for downloadable content (all those currently available for Rock Band 4 on consoles), though, as with the console versions, users would have had to repurchase these songs on the PC and cannot transfer over songs they already own on either platform. The funding campaign failed to reach its goal, only obtaining about $793,000 of the $1.5M target; Harmonix has not ruled out approaching a personal computer version in the future as they are aware there is some demand for Rock Band there. Harmonix has confirmed that with the backward compatibility of both the Xbox Series X and Series S and PlayStation 5 consoles to be released in November 2020, that Rock Band 4 will be playable on the new consoles with most of the officially- supported instruments that worked on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and that players will be able to bring over all downloadable content they had purchased to the new consoles. Further, players within the same console family (PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, for example) will be able to use the online multiplayer features together. Harmonix plans to continue to support the game with further DLC after the new console's launch. = Hardware =  First generation  At launch, Mad Catz handled the global production, sales, and promotion of the retail game, while Harmonix handled the digital content and sales. Mad Catz developed updated guitar and drum controllers for Rock Band 4; the company noted that while it did not want to \\"reinvent the wheel\\", the controllers still featured technical improvements, such as reduced wireless latency and a more sensitive tilt sensor on the guitar. Guitars feature switches that have much longer lifetimes compared to previous controllers, while the drum controller included reinforced pads to prevent damage to the sensor, and includes a double-bass kick setup out of the box. The drum kit can be expanded with an optional set of three hit-sensitive pads that act as cymbals, which allow the player to use the game's \\"Pro Drum\\" mode as introduced in Rock Band 3; in this mode, certain gems will be marked as cymbal hits instead of drum hits, requiring the player to make that distinction to score points. The microphone had also been redesigned, and is able to sample at a higher rate to help with the vocal improvisation sections. At PAX East, a special Penny Arcade-themed guitar with artwork of Gabe was made available as a limited edition exclusive. Harmonix stated that it had \\"aggressively\\" worked with console manufacturers on means to allow guitar and drum controllers from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Rock Band to be forward compatible with Rock Band 4; Harmonix and Mad Catz both agreed that while technically difficult to complete, this compatibility was necessary to support the Rock Band community. Rock Band 4 on PlayStation 4 natively supports PlayStation 3 Rock Band instruments by means of the USB dongle that they require to operate. Achieving backward compatibility with Xbox 360 instruments was more difficult, as they had used the console's native wireless controller capabilities instead, which had changed between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. On Xbox One, standalone copies of Rock Band 4 are bundled with a \\"Legacy Adapter\\" to allow use of wireless Xbox 360 instrument controllers, including those developed to support Guitar Hero games. Due to the inclusion of this hardware, the retail price of Rock Band 4 on Xbox One was higher than the PS4 version. The Adapter was developed by Mad Catz by experimenting with all legacy Xbox 360 controllers they wanted to support and verifying what inputs they sent via wireless connection. They also worked with a former Microsoft employee that had experience with the Xbox 360's wireless features for additional insight. Existing USB microphones remain compatible with Rock Band 4. Harmonix was also working to get backward compatibility for the Stage Kit, an add-on hardware unit for Xbox 360 owners that allowed for a smoke machine and light show display in time with the song. Owing to the game's focus on core gameplay, and concerns that consumers may be unwilling to buy additional hardware for specific games early in a console generation's lifecycle, Rock Band 4 did not feature additional accessories. At retail, the game is available in a band bundle, with a guitar, drum, and microphone, and a guitar-only bundle.  Second generation  In March 2016, Harmonix announced that Mad Catz would be replaced by Performance Designed Products (PDP) as Rock Band 4s publisher and hardware partner later in the year, with updated hardware to be released at that time to coincide with the upcoming Rivals expansion for the game. In June 2016, Harmonix announced they had signed an extension with their deal with Fender to continue use the name and branding within the Rock Band series through 2027, and that new peripheral hardware based on Fender's instruments would be available soon. During E3 2016, PDP and Harmonix unveiled new hardware that was released alongside the Rock Band Rivals expansion. A new guitar controller based on the Fender Jaguar features improvements to the strum bar and tilt sensor, while its neck can fold down for easier storage. An optional rechargeable battery pack and charging stand for the Jaguar controller was also unveiled. A new full band bundle featuring Rock Band 4 and the Rivals expansion, a Jaguar guitar and a drumkit shipped alongside the digital release of the Rivals expansion in late 2016. With the PDP-supplied instruments, Harmonix will be able to offer the instrument-and-game bundles at lower cost than on the game's initial release; for example, the game and guitar bundle on release initially had a MSRP of $120, but the new bundle will be priced at $90. While part of this reduction in cost is attributed to the age of the game, Sussman stated that several factors relating to PDP's manufacturing and business models allows them to offer the packages at a more competitive price point. PDP had also offered a wired legacy adapter for use with wired instruments (such as first-generation Rock Band hardware and the Ion Drum Rocker) and the Rock Band 3 MIDI-Pro Adapter. However, following its initial shipment in November 2016, PDP affirmed that their terms of licensing with Harmonix only allowed them to produced a limited number of the units, less than the demand that was found for the device.  Soundtrack  Rock Band 4 ships with 65 songs on disc, spanning from the 1960s to the 2010s. The studio also worked to ensure that as much of its existing library of downloadable songs would be compatible with the game upon its release as possible; 1,500 songs were available at launch. Nearly all existing official Rock Band DLC is compatible with Rock Band 4 within the same console family (i.e. PlayStation 4 can only import songs purchased on PlayStation 3, and Xbox One can only import songs purchased on Xbox 360). Previous disc exports from the previous disc-based games in the series (excluding The Beatles: Rock Band), the Track Packs, and from Rock Band Blitz will eventually be available for players, as long as they have previously performed the disc export; there will be no option to export these songs into Rock Band 4. Rock Band 3 on-disc songs are expected to be exportable into Rock Band 4 in December 2015. \\"If you bought a Rock Band song, it should be yours in Rock Band 4,\\" said Sussman. \\"Everything that you have already exported will come over.\\" Following transition of all official DLC, Harmonix announced in May 2018 it will also start bringing the most popular and fan-requested entries from the Rock Band Network into Rock Band 4. In most cases, existing songs will be updated to use both Freestyle Guitar and Vocals within Rock Band 4. Harmonix has resumed releasing DLC since the release of Rock Band 4, generally releasing three to six new songs each week, with DLC not being released during the weeks that a new patch is introduced. Beginning in May 2016, however, Harmonix has stated that they will only be releasing two songs per week for the foreseeable future while they work on other projects. Reception Rock Band 4 received positive reviews from critics, who judged that the game does not significantly deviate from its past, otherwise strong, iterations, but considered the soundtrack to be weaker than previous games. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 79.64% based on 22 reviews and 79/100 based on 27 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 78.47% based on 31 reviews and 78/100 based on 51 reviews. IGN praised Rock Band 4 for remaining \\"every bit the magical cooperative gaming experience the series has always been\\", with a particular focus on its continuity in gameplay with previous installments, and its \\"party-friendly\\" improvements to managing multiplayer play. The Freestyle Solos feature was also praised for allowing players more creative freedom in their performance. The game's on-disc soundtrack was considered \\"weaker\\" than previous installments, describing it as primarily featuring \\"B-list\\" musicians, lesser-known songs by notable acts (such as Rush) that had not yet been featured in Rock Band, and lacking a number of major acts that had historically made appearances in the franchise. However, it was acknowledged that the game's backward compatibility with songs purchased for previous versions provided a \\"massive incentive\\" for players with pre-existing libraries. The Tour mode was praised for its unpredictability and humor, although noting that it was more fun with a larger library of songs beyond those included with the game. GameSpot noted that the Freestyle Solos \\"genuinely enhance[d] the core experience\\", explaining that players \\"can actually create some really cool sounding stuff. Like, surprisingly cool. And it's weirdly addictive. It's not the same adrenaline- fueled, fist-pumping thrill of nailing every note in a really technical section, but there is an unexpected sense of discovery and reward\\". Although praising Rock Band 4 for maintaining the \\"spirit\\" of prior installments, it was panned for not distinguishing itself enough from them, such as describing the career mode as being an iteration of a structure already used in previous music games (including Rock Band 2). Regressions were also noted, such as a lack of practice modes beyond Freestyle Solo tutorials, the shallowness of character customization, and the removal of online multiplayer. The soundtrack was also described as \\"underwhelming\\", albeit acknowledging several \\"seriously inspired choices\\", such as The Protomen. NPD Group reported that Rock Band 4 was the tenth best selling game for October 2015 based on units, while accounting for price, was the fourth best selling game. Analyst Michael Pachter estimated revenue from Rock Band 4 sales were about $100 million in early 2016. Mad Catz, prior to release, had anticipated high sales of Rock Band 4 in part to avoid defaulting to their current debtor; however, sales were lower than expected based on their 2016 Fiscal Year results. Though Rock Band 4 contributed significantly towards sales of controller hardware for Mad Catz, the company found the game's \\"sell-through was lower than originally forecast resulting in higher inventory balances as well as lower margins due to increased promotional activity with retailers\\". Alongside reporting of these results, several senior executive members resigned from the company, and the company laid off 37% of its staff as part of a restructuring plan. In their financial earnings report given mid-2016, Mad Catz reported a total loss of more than $11 million, much of it attributed to unsold Rock Band 4 inventory. Harmonix subsequently announced in March 2016 that Mad Catz would be replaced by PDP as the game's publishing and hardware partner. In Mad Catz's 2016 annual financial report, the company said that its partnership with Harmonix for Rock Band 4 had been a \\"burden\\" on the company, as though they ultimately sold all stock of their instruments, the revenues were not as great as anticipated. Shortly following the game's release, it was discovered that some of Harmonix' employees has submitted very positive customers reviews as anonymous users for the game at Amazon.com. Harmonix stated that they amended their employee policy to require them to identify their employment at Harmonix as part of such reviews or to remove them, and stated the posted reviews were \\"inappropriate actions\\". Separately, PlayStation 4 users of Rock Band 4 in Europe were unable to download some of their previously purchased DLC from the PlayStation Store, at least four weeks after the game's launch. Mad Catz stated that the issue stemmed from technical and licensing difficulties between the various countries served by the European PlayStation Store. Harmonix affirmed there were issues with more than 400 existing songs due to difficulties with licensing between them and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe but that they expect to have these available by early December 2015. Harmonix was finally able to confirm the licensing problems were resolved by December 2016, and anticipates the missing tracks will be available by May 2017.

The installation later became the endpoint of the WAMCATS cable, a military communications cable extending across Alaska. Its importance declined substantially after the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1923, providing year- round service to the interior which was superior to the seasonal transport service of the river. The post was closed in 1925, and the military burials of its graveyard relocated to Sitka National Cemetery in 1929. When surveyed in 1976, only three buildings remained of the once extensive installation. The surviving elements of the fort were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Demographics Fort Saint Michael appeared once on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated military installation. Owing to its deactivation in 1925, it was not reported separately again.

It originally aired on February 25, 2015. The episode was written by Steven Levitan & Megan Ganz, and directed by Steven Levitan. In the episode, Claire waits for her flight back home while trying to get in touch with Haley after a fight they had. Not being able to reach her, she asks everyone where she might be and a series of events and revelations lead her to believe that Haley is pregnant with Andy's baby and the two of them ran away to Las Vegas and got married. \\"Connection Lost\\" breaks away from Modern Family's formula by presenting the entire episode through Claire's laptop screen as she uses FaceTime, iMessage and other social networking services to keep in touch with her family. The episode received positive reviews from the critics, with many praising the original concept and humor. The episode won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation at the 2015 ceremony. Plot While waiting for her flight at O'Hare airport, returning from a presentation she had for a new client, Claire (Julie Bowen) attempts to get in touch with Haley (Sarah Hyland) after a big fight that they had. She uses FaceTime to contact Phil (Ty Burrell), who tells her that he thinks Haley slept over at a friend's house. Meanwhile, Alex (Ariel Winter) continuously sends Claire new versions of her college essay for her to proof read, but Claire ignores them. While talking to Jay (Ed O'Neill), Claire gets a notification from Facebook that it also happens to be Mitchell's (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) birthday, so she FaceTimes him to wish him a good day. Knowing from Alex that Haley was baby sitting Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) the previous night, she asks Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell if they know where Haley is and they reveal that the last time they saw her was when she borrowed one of Mitchell's old blue suits. Lily tells her that Dylan (Reid Ewing) was there the previous night talking with Haley, something that surprises her since she was unaware that the two of them were still in touch. Claire uses her fake Facebook profile to view Haley's Facebook page and sees that Haley has changed her relationship status to \\"Married\\". Claire starts to panic while Phil tries to calm her down, but putting the clues together (borrowed old blue suit and being with Dylan) makes her believe that Haley married Dylan. She calls him but after talking to him, she knows that Dylan was to her relief, not the groom. Having no other way to find her, Claire hacks into Haley's iCloud account to track the GPS on her phone, much to Alex's disapproval. Claire searches the address on Google Maps which shows up on a street in Las Vegas, next to a small wedding chapel. Claire panics even more and tries to think about whom Haley would end up married to, but she has no details about who Haley is dating. While talking to everyone; Mitchell, Cameron, Alex, Phil, Jay, Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara), Luke (Nolan Gould) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez), who reveal that Andy (Adam DeVine) has taken time off to go to Vegas for a wedding, Claire comes to the conclusion that Haley has married Andy without telling anyone. A parcel then arrives for Haley at the Dunphy household, which Phil opens. The parcel is revealed to be the book What to Expect When You're Expecting. Claire panics once again that Haley might be pregnant and after her last attempts to get in contact with her or Andy, she closes all of her FaceTime windows to open a slideshow of Haley's childhood pictures, eats Cameron's popcorn, and cries while watching it. Feeling incredibly stressed by the situation, Claire FaceTimes her Dad, seeking his wisdom and to apologize for doing the same thing as Haley when she was her age. Jay reassures her that Haley being pregnant and married might not necessarily be a bad thing since when she did it years ago led her to have a loving family with a good husband. Jay says this without knowing Phil is also listening, who is now crying and Jay tries to take back everything he said. Claire finally receives an incoming call from Haley, who has just woken up. It turns out that Haley was in the Dunphy's household asleep the whole time and is neither pregnant nor married; the suit was to lend to her friend who was getting married, her phone was accidentally left in Andy's car when he went on his trip to Vegas, her Facebook status was a joke about a \\"Cronut,\\" and the pregnancy book was to help her design clothes for her boss's new fashion range. The family expresses their relief over the situation as Claire, when Haley immediately questions how her mother got onto her Facebook page and found out where her phone was, pretends to lose connection and log out of the FaceTime call, before leaving for her flight. Production The original idea for the episode came from the producer of the show, Steven Levitan, while he was talking to one of his college-aged daughters on FaceTime. The episode was also inspired in part by the 2013 short film Noah, which told the story of a teenager's breakup with his girlfriend entirely through the character's computer screen.\\"A new episode of 'Modern Family' was shot almost entirely on iPhones and iPads\\". Business Insider, February 18, 2015. The whole episode was filmed with Apple products and the post production took longer than usual, as editors and motion graphics producers had to merge the videos with visual effects to create the look of a computer screen that features as many as nine open windows. Originally, the whole episode was shot with crew members, just as a proof of concept. During the shootings, the actors were supposed to hold the recording devices by themselves; however, to avoid recording the ceiling or other items that were not useful to the episode, the cameramen were holding the devices while the actors placed their hands to the cameramen's hands so that it looked like a selfie. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Connection Lost\\" was watched by 9.32 million; up by 0.52 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Connection Lost\\" received positive reviews from television critics, with many praising the episode's originality, writing and humor even though some of them stated that it looked like an advertisement for Apple. The episode was also very well received by fans, with \\"Connection Lost\\" holding a cumulative score of 9.5 on IMDb, making it the highest rated episode of the show's history. Sandra Gonzalez of Mashable praised the episode's concept. \\"...In addition to the pure fun of the laptop- only framing device, it was used incredibly cleverly\\". Gonzalez also praised the writing by stating \\"Bonus points to the writers for the great attention to detail. Almost everything about Claire's digital world seemed fleshed out, down to the previous communications with her children\\". Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B, and labelled the episode as \\"A gimmicky but successful storytelling experiment\\" and \\"one of the most entertaining episodes in recent memory\\". Ihnat closed her review by stating \\"the technology did pull all of Modern Family together this episode, with primarily successful results\\". Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.8/5 saying that it was one of the most brilliant episodes we had seen in a while. \\"This week's Modern Family tries something very experimental, and the results are fantastic!. [...] Overall, \\"Connection Lost\\" is another hilarious episode of Modern Family, but it's also very well done\\". Anick Jesdanun of The Detroit News gave a positive review to the episode saying that \\"The digital medium offered a fresh, clever way of storytelling ‚Äî with jokes and plot twists not possible with the documentary-style approach that \\"Modern Family\\" typically uses\\". Jesdanun closed their review by claiming \\"The graphics were so realistic that I reached for my mouse once or twice to try to move a window ‚Äî before remembering I was watching TV on my computer. I caught a lot more on repeat viewings\\". Bryan Bishop of The Verge also gave a positive review to the episode saying that it worked even if it felt like a half-hour Apple commercial. \\"...[the episode] takes place entirely on the screen of a character‚Äôs laptop ‚Äî and while it‚Äôs a fun new riff on the sitcom's successful formula, it‚Äôs also one of the most glowing love letters to the Mac you'll see this side of an Apple keynote.\\" Despite the positive reviews, Lisa Fernandes of Next Projection rated the episode with 6.5/10 saying that the episode could have been a lot worse but it could have been a lot better. \\"Bereft of the hope of actually telling interesting stories, Modern Family‚Äôs resorted to a gimmick episode- an entire story told via webcams, cell phones, mini-cams, Ipad homepages and other Netbook devices.

It formed part of the South African Army Infantry Formation as well as the South African Territorial Reserve. History =Origin= Rifle Association Weenen-Kliprivier Commando can be traced back to the 1887 Estcourt and Ladysmith Rifle Associations and the later raised Ladysmith Town Guard of 1899. =Operations= With the UDF =World War One= Members of the Defence Rifle Associations volunteered and were deployed on active service during the First World War. The final name of this commando was issued on 16 December 1948 by a Government Gazette notice designating the magisterial districts of Kliprivier (Ladysmith), Bergville, Estcourt, and Mooirivier under its mandate. When Midmar Commando was formed, the Mooirivier district was then subsequently allocated to that commando. The area of responsibility encompassed the Lesotho border with Natal along the Orange Free State provincial border and southwards to the east of Ladysmith and finally southwards again to meet up with the Midmar Commando border. The headquarters of this unit was close to the military base at Ladysmith, home to 5 SAI and situated on the site of an Anglo Boer war military camp used during the siege of Ladysmith. With the SADF By 1967, the Commando chose the eland as its regimental emblem but it was quickly changed to a Long Tom gun in the same year. Both were symbols of the area. In 1974 the Long Tom was changed again, this time for a wagon wheel above a broken spear. This resulted in a complaint by the then Minister Buthelezi, who argued that the symbol had connotations that were unacceptable to the Zulu people. This resulted in a redesign again by 1989. The last emblem still had a wagon wheel but now encompassed a mountain as well as tears from a translation of the word weenen. =Colours= In 1991 the Commando received its National Colours at a parade in Pietermaritzburg, the home of Group 9. =Freedom of entry= On 31 October 1991, the Commando was also granted Freedom of Entry into Ladysmith.

This is a developing academic field of study and branch of archaeological theory, that deals with the dynamics of space over time and helps to explore other dimensions of geohistorical objects, such as roads, walls, boundaries, and trees. It is both a discipline focusing on road networks and land divisions and an archaeology of geohistorical knowledge.  Spatial archaeology and archaeogeography  Archaeogeography came from the scientific trend called landscape archaeology or spatial archaeology. This trend analyses the interaction between nature and culture. For this reason it uses techniques coming from geography, geology, etc. The spatial archaeology trend was launched by Ian Hodder in 1976. It is an archaeological trend, such as ethnoarchaeology, cognitive archaeology and other archaeological approaches. Spatial Archaeology was defined by David L. Clarke in 1977. He pointed out three analysis levels: macro, micro and semi-micro (Clarke 1977: 11-15).Clarke, David L. (1977) Spatial Archaeology. Boston, Academic Press. Spatial Archaeology is also called landscape archaeology. This trend analyses the interaction between nature and culture. Human geography uses location analysis to define models for the understanding of the territorial organisation. The archaeologists Higgs and Vita-FinziHiggs, E. S. y Vita- Finzi, C. (1970) Prehistoric Economy in the Mount Carmel Area of Palestine: Site Catchment Analysis. Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, xxxvi. Pp. 1-37. Cambridge Univ. Press. began to apply Site Catchment Analysis (SCA) in 1970s. They proposed a new approach to know how people settled in prehistoric societies. They analysed economic resources with tools taken from Human Geography, these resources were 5-10km from the archaeological sites. Some years later, in the 1970s, Spatial Archaeology was created, based on the use of several tools taken from 1960s English Human Geography that was focus on the study of location interdependence. Some archaeologists use these geographical techniques (Hodder y Orton 1976;Hodder, I. y Orton, C. (1976) Spatial Analysis in Archaeology. Oxford, Univ. Press. Hodder 1977,Hodder, I. (1977) Spatial Studies in Archaeology. Progress in Human Geography, 1 (1). Pp. 33‚Äî65 1978;Hodder, I. (1978) The spatial organization of culture. London, Duckworth. Clarke 1977Clarke, David L. (1977) Spatial Archaeology. Boston, Academic Press. ). But these techniques were only used in isolated contexts. They did not fully constitute an archaeological method and lacked a theoretical basis. In the 1980s some archaeologists began to criticize the classical view of Site Catchment Analysis (De Carlos 1988).De Carlos, Javier I. (1988) [ Una aproximaci√≥n territorial fen√≥meno megal√≠tico: La Rioja Alavesa y Cuartango]. ISSN 0027-3414. Munibe. Suplemento, ISSN 1698-3807, N¬∫. 6, 1988, pags. 113-127. https://web.archive.org/web/20110428083019/http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/munibe/1988113127.pdf The reason was related to the lack of a general method to study archaeological territory. In 1989, Javier de Carlos said that archaeology was only able to apply geographical techniques without being able to use a procedure integrated in a method.De Carlos, Javier (1989) Desde la ortodoxia espacial hasta el albor del m√©todo arqueogeogr√°fico: aplicaci√≥n cr√≠tica del Site Catchment Analysis a los d√≥lmenes de La Rioja Alavesa y el valle de Cuartango. Bolet√≠n del Seminario de Estudios de Arte y Arqueolog√≠a: BSAA, Tomo 55, 1989, pags. 15-40.  Seeing and mapping complexity  Archaeology is a very map-based discipline. It uses geographic information systems and maps of sites, landscapes, regions, and countries in order to visualize artifact and feature distributions, analyse site relationships, and to demonstrate landscape variability and effects (among other uses). As an archaeological sub- discipline, archaeogeography is also highly map-oriented. Researchers create planar maps from orthophotos, then layer on historical data.Planar mapping is based on orthophotos. These are at the heart of modern, widely used mapping systems like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. This includes multiple layers of historical data on the same map, allowing them to better see the duration and durability of past and present forms within a landscape. Indeed, \\"[the] specificity of archeogeographic [sic] analysis thus resides in combining the various levels -- configurations, relief patterns, and archaeological traces -- within a single map, along with as much historical, geographic, and environmental data as possible\\".Watteaux 2017b, 201  Centers of research  The discipline is taught in France and Portugal. A Masters degree in Archaeology and Environment is given by the University of Paris I. Archaeogeography is also included in University of Coimbra¬¥s curricula of Centro de Estudos de Arqueologia, Artes e Ci√™ncias do Patrim√≥nio.

Built in 1887 by a prominent local lawyer and businessman, it is one of the finest examples of Queen Anne architecture in the interior of Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Gould House is set facing south on the north side of Elm Street, overlooking the Kennebec River. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, fashioned with brick and frame construction. The first floor and foundation are brick, and the upper floors are finished in decorative shingle siding. The asymmetrical massing is typical of the Queen Style, with an elaborately decorated single- story porch that curves around to the west side, and several different sizes and shapes of gables and projections from its roof. At the left front facade is a three-story tower topped by a bellcast octagonal roof. It has three brick chimneys rising from the interior, with elaborate brickwork decoration at the top. A period carriage barn is attached to the north side of the house. The house was built in 1887 by Samuel Wadsworth Gould, a lawyer and hotel owner who opened his law practice in Skowhegan in 1880. He purchased the lot in 1885, then with a local tavern on it, moved it away, and had this house built. Gould, in addition to practicing law and owning a hotel, was politically active, winning election to the United States Congress for one term, and also running for Governor of Maine.

In 1975, at age 34, she became the youngest full professor in the German Democratic Republic. By that time she had already distinguished herself by obtaining doctorates in two barely related disciplines: Economics/Cost accounting (1969) and Engineering/Materials science (1970). Life Dagmar Hinz was born soon after the start of the Second World War in Sonneberg, a small town in the centre of southern Germany, located between W√ºrzburg and Leipzig. Before she was 3 her father had been killed in the fighting. Her mother worked as a milliner. By the time she had successfully completed her schooling the war had ended, in May 1945, and after the armies had finished repositioning themselves Sonneberg had ended up at the edge of the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. The entire zone was refounded as the German Democratic Republic in October 1949. During the later 1950s Hinz undertook an apprenticeship for work as a Ceramics and Pottery technician. She later recalled that she had really wanted to become an economist, but had been unable to obtain a study-place. In 1960, with support from her boss at the ceramics factory, she was able to obtain a place at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology where she studied Silicate Metallurgy, emerging with a degree in 1965. She then obtained a university position as a research assistant and started working on a doctorate. During the 1960s she married the economist Frieder H√ºlsenberg. At this time H√ºlsenberg was writing a book, drafts for which his wife read. She alerted him to an important inconsistency in the text which he was obliged to discuss with his co-author, the Dresden Economics Professor Otto Gallenm√ºller. One upshot of the ensuing discussions was that Dagmar H√ºlsenberg hurriedly mastered relevant portions of the Economics syllabus and, in 1969, obtained a doctorate from Freiberg University in Economics for a dissertation entitled \\"Determining an optimal number of cost centres and cost objects, with particular attention to error aggregation\\" \\"Ermittlung einer optimalen Kostenstellen- und Kostentr√§geranzahl unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Fehleraggregation\\" Just a year later, in 1970, she received a second doctorate, this time in Material Sciences: her dissertation on this occasion was entitled \\"High-temperature deformation of heterogeneous materials, illustrated using fire-resistant chamotte (fire clay)\\"Hochtemperaturdeformation heterogener Materialien, dargestellt am feuerfesten Werkstoff Schamotte In 1970, she moved to the ' (Ministry of light industry) and later to the ' (Ministry for the glass and ceramics industries) where she was involved in preparing the national plan for science and technology ('). Looking back, she recalled that she had not much enjoyed work at the ministries: five years had been enough. In 1975 she switched again, back to the academic world, accepting the newly created professorship of \\"Glass and Ceramics Materials and Technology\\" at the Ilmenau Technical Academy, back in Thuringia. At the time she was the youngest professor in the country, and her tenure would comfortably outlast the German Democratic Republic itself, ending only in 2007. From 1984 till 1990 Dagmar H√ºlsenberg served as a member of the National Research Council. Between 1976 and 1987 she chaired the Silicates Technology Expert Committee of the FDGB Chamber of Technology, and from 1987 till 1992 she served as (the last) president of the Chamber of Technology, in succession to Manfred Schubert who had died young. She became a corresponding member of the national German Academy of Sciences in 1989. and has been a member of the Saxony Academy of Sciences, based in Leipzig since 1986: she became a member of the presidium in 2004.

The bakery was originally at 630 St. Philip St., and moved several times, eventually having its permanent home at 625-627 St. Philip St. In the early 1930s, Ruffino retired and sold the bakery to Nicolo Evola, his son-in-law, who was married to Giuseppe's daughter Fanny.

It was temporally moved to 2206 Royal St., and then in 1943 to St. Bernard Ave., which was its permanent home until Hurricane Katrina destroyed the building in 2005.

Belle was given a father who set off on a work venture, a mother who is out of the picture, and a confident bordering-on-arrogant suitor. In the classic fairytale, in order to break the Beast's curse, the Beast must learn to love someone and be loved in return. In Little Miss Perfect, where Belle and the 'beast' are one and the same, Belle must learn to love herself in order to rid herself of this 'beast'. Little Miss Perfect began development under the mentorship of NYU Professor Karl Bardosh, and former VP of 20th Century Fox, Nancy Malone.

Strumlauf currently resides in the Buckhead area of Atlanta, Georgia. In addition to becoming an instrumented rated private pilot in 2012, Strumlauf enjoys golf, snow skiing, working out, and travel. He helps to serve his community as a committee member for Project Open Hand and as an honorary for the Atlanta Community Food Bank.  Career  At the early age of 15, Strumlauf started as an entrepreneur, heading up his own lawn care, car washing and firewood business throughout high school and college summer breaks. While attending Emory University in 1984 and preparing for a career as a medical doctor, Strumlauf worked as a part-time doorman at a local Atlanta nightclub called Scenario. After graduating Emory University in 1988 and at the young age of only 21, Strumlauf made the decision to put medical school on hold to partner up with college friend, Marc Cooperman, to open Boys and Girls in the summer of 1988, Atlanta's first 18 and over nightclub. With the success of Boys and Girls, Strumlauf's passion for nightlife was sparked and with Cooperman, Plastic Nightclub opened in 1989. During that same year, Strumlauf and Cooperman also entered the magazine publishing business with the release of Eye Magazine, a fashion forward publication with a focus on Atlanta's restaurant, and nightlife scene. Following a short move back to New York City in 1990 with a short lived career as a commodity pit trader on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange at New York‚Äôs Twin Towers, Strumlauf returned permanently back to Atlanta in 1991 to partner again with Marc Cooperman and George Wagner to open a college bar called The Odyssey in the Buckhead Village, Atlanta‚Äôs famous restaurant/bar district. In 1992, Strumlauf made the decision to diversify his business portfolio with the opening Malibu Beach Tanning. After successfully building the Malibu Beach brand to four Atlanta area locations, Palm Beach Tan purchased the company in 2006. In early 1994, Strumlauf partnered once again with Marc Cooperman, along with operating partner Jim Sullivan, to open his first restaurant/bar concept, Metropolitan Pizza Bar, also located in the Buckhead Village. In late 1994, Strumlauf opened Atlanta nightclub, Tongue & Groove, with business partners, Michael Krohngold and Marc Cooperman. A year later in 1995, Strumlauf, along with partners Michael Krohngold, Marc Cooperman, Dee Grimes and consulting chef Guenter Seeger, opened Mumbo Jumbo, a 200-seat modern American restaurant located in downtown Atlanta. In 1996, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell honored Mumbo Jumbo with a proclamation for serving as an economic catalyst to the revitalization of downtown Atlanta. In 2000, Strumlauf, Krohngold and Sullivan then opened Jack Rabbit Lounge in the Buckhead Village. In 2007, the original Tongue & Groove location was closed after a lease buyout by Ben Carter Properties. Krohngold and Strumlauf then formed a nightlife consulting company, Wildlife Resource Management, LLC before opening the new Tongue & Groove at Lindbergh City Center in 2008 with new operating partner, David Kreidler. A year later in 2009, Strumlauf continued to diversify his business portfolio by teaming up with Steven M. Winter to launch a subprime auto financing company, Georgia Title Lenders, LLC. Then in 2012, Strumlauf and Winter formed WS Funding, LLC, a collateral-based finance company. In 2014, Strumlauf and partner Krohngold were honored by the Atlanta Community Food Bank as one of Atlanta's premier hospitality duos. In the same year, Tongue & Groove celebrated its 20th anniversary and was honored by the City of Atlanta with a proclamation recognizing the club as Atlanta's longest running nightclub.

In December 2015, Myprotein announced an agreement with Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development to build their first production facility outside the UK in Bullitt County, Kentucky.

Currently, Myprotein has a partnership with the following sports teams: * St Helens RFC * Warrington Wolves * London Broncos * Sale Sharks * Burnley FC * Nottingham Forest (University of Nottingham) * Toronto Wolfpack  Controversy  In April 2017, customer Adam Brenton reportedly found a dead mouse in a 1.45kg bag of chocolate flavour whey protein that he had purchased on the Myprotein site. He claimed that he had been using the protein powder for 3 weeks before discovering the mouse carcass at the bottom of the bag. With Brenton's consent, the bag of protein powder was tested by food safety experts Ecolab as endorsed by the University of Liverpool. The results showed that the mouse was not present in the protein powder during shipping and that it had died around 3 weeks after the protein batch had been finalised. Consequently, Brenton was ordered to pay The Hut.com Ltd and Cend Ltd unspecified damages and legal costs. Many of the news outlets that covered the original story subsequently posted an apology to the brand regarding the previously published claims.

The film focuses on a young boy, Willie Stone, who follows a parade of firemen and attempts to join them as their leader. The firemen find it humorous and allow him to play with them. The fire alarm sounds and Willie attempts to join them, but is too slow. On their way back, Willie holds them up and his sister appears. A fireman named Jack, who has affections for the woman, convinces Willie to be relieved of his \\"command\\" by promising to call him later. Marie Eline played the role of Willie Stone, but the other two credits are claimed to have been William Garwood and Mignon Anderson. The rest of the cast and credits are unknown. The film was released on November 8, 1910 and does not appear to have had any reviews in the usual trade publications. The film was advertised nationally and was claimed to have been popular in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: \\"Willie Stone is only six years old, but he yearns to be a fireman. He is much impressed with the parade of firemen he sees in his hometown, so much so in fact that he basely deserts his sister on the streets to follow the 'smoke eaters.' But Willie is only a little boy, and despite his enthusiasm, he is soon weary and footsore. His plight, added to his tears, attracts the attention of a kindly fireman who is driving with his engine back to quarters. The lad's discomfort is soon forgotten, for the fireman gives him a ride back to the engine house. There Willie gravely applies to the captain for a position on the uniformed force, and is jokingly accepted. But he does not see the humor in it and follows the other men to the bunkroom, where he takes part in their sports.\\" \\"But in the midst of the happiest day of his life, an alarm is sounded, and the firemen hastily slide down the pole to their duty. The new fireman, however, is not the kind to be deserted. Grabbing the helmet, the insignia of his office, he follows the others, but it is too late to go to the fire. He arrives in time to hold them up on their way back, but is captured by his weeping sister. He does not wish to leave his command, but his friend, fireman Jack Allen, finally induces him to go on the promise that he, Jack, will call later. Perhaps one reason Jack is so accommodating is because he likes [his] sister. Jack pays ardent court to her, and the flame of their affection[s] resists all of young Willie's efforts to put it out. He didn't really mean to try, but he assuredly poured cold water on Jack, for it was in the line of what he regarded as his duty.\\"  Cast  *Marie Eline as Willie Stone *William Garwood as Jack Allen (unconfirmed) *Mignon Anderson as Willie Stone's sister (unconfirmed) In December 1912, a notice in The Monroe News-Star announced the showing of this film and also gave the key roles of the players. Though the credits cannot be confirmed, the \\"Thanhouser Kid\\" (Marie Eline), William Garwood and Mignon Anderson were given as the featured players. This would indicate that Garwood played Jack Allen and the sister was played by Anderson if the information is accurate.  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits for this production are fragmentary like many 1910 Thanhouser productions. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The role of Willie Stone was played by Marie Eline. This film was another example of Eline cast in the role of a boy. Eline's with the first such credit was as a young Italian boy in The Two Roses. Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland. If the cast information provided by The Monroe News-Star is accurate, it represents the earliest credit of Mignon Anderson for the Thanhouser Company. If it is not, the first known credit for would be four months later in Robert Emmet in March 1911. The film would also be an early credit of William Garwood, who was among the most important actors at Thanhouser. He joined the company in late 1909 and remained until 1911 before returning in 1912. His previous and first credited work with Thanhouser was Jane Eyre.  Release and reception  The single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long was released on November 8, 1910. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Montana, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Louisiana, and Missouri. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Province Theatre. Bowers does not cite any trade publication reviews for this film, making it unlikely that the film was given attention in The New York Dramatic Mirror, The Moving Picture World or The Moving Picture News publications. The film was apparently a success at the Province Theater when it was shown in Vancouver. It is possible that non- advertisement reviews of the film may exist in other publications.

During the campaign he announced his support to nuclear power, which has been a long- time debate in Italy.Quando Galletti apr√¨ al nucleare On 26 April 2012, Galletti was elected leader of the Union of Centre in the Chamber of Deputies, replacing his political mentor Pier Ferdinando Casini. In the general election in the following year, Galletti ran in the coalition With Monti for Italy, led by incumbent Prime Minister Mario Monti, a centrist technocrat, but he did not succeed in being elected. However, after few months he was appointed undersecretary to the Education Ministry, in the Enrico Letta's government. =Minister of the Environment= On 22 February 2014, when the new secretary of the Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, forced Letta to resign and became the new Prime Minister, Galletti was appointed by him as Minister of the Environment and Protection of Land and Sea.Gian Luca Galletti ‚Äì Governo His nomination was harshly criticized by many green associations due to his support to nuclear power; Monica Frassoni, a former MEP, accused Galletti of being only known as the \\"tax advisor of Pier Ferdinando Casini\\".Incredibile Renzi: l'ambiente al commercialista di Casini During the Italian rotating presidency of the EU Council in 2014, he led to the modification of the European legislation on GMOs, allowing each state to have decision-making autonomy on the cultivation of genetically modified organisms on its territory.OGM, via libera alla libert√† di scelta During the same period, he advised the council of EU towards a more restrictive regulation on the use of single-use shopping bags.Presidenza ambiente ed energia: I risultati del semestre Galletti and the other Environment ministers, during the G7 in Bologna.

On this release, Renbourn drew from lute and harp sources, and pieces from Turlough O'Carolan such as O'Carolan's Concerto transcribed for guitar. The Lamentation Of Owen Roe O'Neill is featured in Francis O'Neill's Music of Ireland from 1903. Lord Inchiquin was collected in Edward Bunting's manuscripts currently residing at Queen's University Belfast. Mrs Power is said to have been written by O'Carolan during a virtuosity competition between him and the Italian violinist Francesco Geminiani while both of them may have been invited by an Irish nobleman, Lord Mayo. A Toye comes from the 1603 tutor Schoole of Musicke by Thomas Robinson. Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home is an Elizabethan piece. There are versions for solo lute by Thomas Robinson and Nicolas Vallet and by John Dowland with the second part of an anonymous composer, and an arrangement named Rowland by William Byrd in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. It seems that this piece was made popular by William Kempe and his musicians who accompanied Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, in Holland.

He is described by PBS as \\"arguably the most influential new media photojournalist in the world\\" for his numerous copyleft photographs, uploaded to Wikimedia Commons and seen in Wikipedia, documenting celebrities, political officials, and events, notably the Occupy Wall Street protests. As a Wikinews citizen journalist, he was the first to interview a sitting head of state, Israeli President Shimon Peres. His photography has seen much use outside of Wikipedia, having been used by magazines and news websites such as the New York Times, the Miami Herald, and Business Insider, and featured in an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York. In a profile of his Wikinews interviews, the Columbia Journalism Review wrote, \\"Miller‚Äôs work feels like a bit of a throwback to a time when Oriana Fallaci published long transcripts of her interviews in book form and David Frost broadcast a six-hour sit-down with Richard Nixon.\\" Career and coverage Shankbone says that he began photography as a \\"cheap hobby\\" using a point-and-shoot camera given to him by his sister in response to a perceived lack of images on Wikipedia, taking advantage of the relative accessibility of prominent individuals in New York City. He says that he was mentored by Warhol and collaborators Billy Name and Christopher Makos. Billy Name interviewed Shankbone for BOMB magazine about their relationship and photography. Colleen Asper, writing in the Brooklyn Rail, described Shankbone's photographs as \\"incredibly wide ranging in their scope\\". Shankbone began contributing to Wikipedia in June 2006, and in 2007, he was noted as a \\"leading Wikipedia editor\\" in Haaretz. =Israel= Shankbone with Israeli president Shimon Peres in 2007 In December 2007, he became the first of Wikinews's citizen journalists to interview a sitting head of state, Israeli President Shimon Peres.

Shankbone was invited to Israel by the Foreign Ministry and the America‚ÄìIsrael Friendship League, as part of a delegation of technology writers, including representatives from BusinessWeek, USA Today, PC Week, and Salon, to review the Israeli technology sector. David Saranga, spokesman at the consulate in New York explained, \\"More than once we have faced editors connected to Israel that appear on Wikipedia in English that do not represent the reality in Israel. We decided to initiate a visit by Shankbone to describe Israeli reality as it is.\\" While there, he requested an interview with Israeli President Shimon Peres, which to his surprise was granted. However, Shankbone later admitted he considered it to be one of the worst interviews he had undertaken. He returned to Israel in 2009 to take photographs of the country and the Negev desert.

The painting depicts the Roman goddess Diana, one of the twelve Gods and Goddesses of Olympus, falling in love with Endymion, a symbol of timeless beauty. The story tells of Diana's love for the beautiful youth Endymion. The painting is hosted at the National Museums Liverpool, that purchased the painting in 1966, and holds it as one of the museums highlights. Painter The painter Francesco Solimena came from an artistic family, his father being the poet and painter Angelo Solimena. The young Francesco was very talented from an early age in arts, but his father, in spite of the fact he was an artist himself, forced his son to study to become a lawyer. Cardinal Vincenzo Orsini, who later became Pope Benedict XIII, was the person who discovered Francesco Solimena's talent and arranged for him to be an artist. Diana and Endymion In Greek mythology, the moon goddess, Selene, drives her moon chariot across the heavens, although she was also regarded as the personification of the Moon itself. Selene is best known for her affair with the beautiful mortal Endymion, the young shepherd who used to sleep on a mountain, and with whom she had fifty daughters.Catullus, Carmina 66.5; Hyginus, Fabulae 271; Strabo, 14.1.8; Propertius, Elegies 2.15; Ovid, Heroides 15.89 ff., 18.59 ff.; Seneca, Phaedra 309 ff., 422 ff., 786 ff.; Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 8.28 ff.; Lucian Aphrodite and Selene; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 2.325 ff., 4.195 ff., 4.213 ff., 5.516 ff., 7.237 ff., 13.553 ff., 41.379 ff., 42.266 ff., 48.582 ff., 48.667 ff.. The late 7th-century ‚Äì early 6th-century BC poet Sappho had apparently already mentioned Selene and Endymion's history. This is according to a scholar on Apollonius of Rhodes 4.57, see Campbell, p. 197; Weigal, p. 281 In Roman mythology, Diana has the attributes of Selene and she was mentioned as the goddess who falls in love with Endymion. Both goddesses were regarded as lunar goddesses, except for the fact that in Roman mythology, Diana became a virgin goddess. Painting Diana and Endymion is part of the last period of Solimena's works when he mainly concentrated on mythological subjects; he developed this interest in mythological stories which was inspired by the Arcadian movement embracing classical culture. The painting was part of the artist's rivalry with the painter Paolo de Matteis, triggered by the artist's visit to Rome in 1701. Diana in Greek mythology is the goddess associated with hunting, the Moon and chastity, often depicted while hunting, or bathing after the hunt, accompanied by nymphs. Solimena chose to paint Diana's unrequited love towards the young and handsome shepherd; the painting is an allegory of Platonic love. Endymion used to go to sleep on the mountaintop where he guarded his sheep. Diana was falling in love with his beauty, but her love remained unfulfilled, because Diana was a chaste goddess. She is depicted here as a huntress wearing a short robe, arriving from the sky, seated on clouds, in a chariot drawn by horses, while Endymion's body is depicted naked. Cupid points an arrow towards her, ready to shoot. Diana has her gaze fixed on the sleeping youth's body, with a mixture of desire and despair. According to the legend Diana used to come and kiss Endymion when he was asleep on the top of the mountain each night. Diana's light touch partly drew Endymion from his slumber and he caught a brief glance of her. Incredulous at her beauty, he attributed it to a dream and began to prefer his dreamlike state over mundane daily routines yet he was never awake when she was present. Through her love, Endymion was granted eternal youth and timeless beauty.

The town's history has always been interconnected with Hebron. The population was 528 at the 1790 census. History It was granted on March 8, 1777 by the Massachusetts General Court to Alexander Shepard, Jr. of Newton, Massachusetts as payment for a survey chart of the Maine coast that he had assisted making. It was named Shepardsfield Plantation, although early inhabitants called it Bog Brook Plantation. The first settlers were Capt. John Bridgham, Capt. Daniel Buckman, John Greenwood (step-son of Alexander Shepard), and Asa Bearce. Other families followed; John Washburn, Morris Bumpus, and William Barrows, to name a few. Shepardsfield was a wilderness with fresh pastures near streams and ponds. It offered prosperity to many soldiers and their families fresh from the battlefields of the Revolutionary War. The Shepardsfield petitioners were successful in part, as the plantation was incorporated as Hebron, the 78th town, March 6, 1792, but no reason appears for not complying with their request to name the town Columbia; perhaps the General Court had in view the making a modern \\"city of refuge\\"‚Äîa part of Hebron was set off and incorporated as the town of Oxford in 1829. The tract of land granted by the General Court of Massachusetts to Alexander Shepard Jr., lies between 44¬∞ 3' and 44¬∞ 14' N latitude and between 6¬∞ 20' and 6¬∞ 40' E longitude from Washington. This territory being so nearly equidistant from the equator and the pole, is not subject to long continued or excessive heat or cold, and as the wind seldom comes from any one point for more than three or four days successively, the various climatic changes attendant upon the wind, follow one another in rapid and agreeable succession. The title of the Commonwealth to this district is based upon ancient grants \\"for the advancement of the Christian religion and the glory of God, and to replenish the deserts with people who would be governed by laws and the magistrates,\\" from the crown of England, in exercise of the right of eminent domain. Unlike most legislative grant, this to Mr. Shepard was for a tangible consideration, as the following abstracts from the records of the Court will show. RESOLVED, That there be granted to Alexander Shepard Jr. and to his heirs, the unappropriated lands lying in the county of Cumberland in the Province of Maine, between a township of land granted to the Honorable James Warren Esq. and others, called Sylvester Canada ; a township granted to Joshua Fuller and others, called No. 4; a township granted to the Honorable James Otis Esq. and others, and a township granted to Joseph Gerrish Esq. and others, called Bakerstown; containing about three square miles, exclusive of the allowances of ponds, rivers, sag of chain, etc., bounded as followeth, viz. beginning at a stake and stones in the line of Sylvester Canada aforesaid, near the bank of Little Wilson pond, thence north 70 degrees west to the line of No. 4 township on the south side of Streaked Mountain, thence on the line of said township to the south west corner thereof, thence on land granted to Jeremiah Green, to the north westerly corner of said grant, thence south westerly to the north east corner of the township aforesaid granted to the Honorable James Otis Esq., thence on the easterly line of said township to Bakerstown, thence on said Bakerstown north line to Sylvester Canada aforesaid, thence on Sylvester Canada line to the stake and stones first mentioned. Provided, The said Alexander Shepard Jr. shall deliver in to this Court to their acceptance, on or before the last day of September next, an accurate map of all the late Province of Maine, therein distinguishing the appropriated from the unappropriated lands, the lines of the several counties, all the rivers, distinguishing how far navigable, all the islands, towns, harbors, rocks, shoals, inlets, creeks, bays, lakes, promontories, capes, mountains, peninsulas, etc. in said Province. Provided, Also the said grantee settle ten families in said tract within ten years ; and also that said tract doth not interfere with any former grant. March 7, 1777.

The show is presented by Howard Caine (known as \\"H\\"), having previously been a joint presentation with the late Jim \\"The Jazz\\" Caine, the programme's creator. In January 2017 Manx Radio introduced a sister programme to Sweet & Swing titled Jumpin' In. Originally the sister programmes alternated on Manx Radio's Friday night schedule over a fixed schedule period until October 2019, when Jumpin' In was allocated its own designated transmission slot on Saturday night. Sweet & Swing features music from the 1920s through to the 1950s; however, music by contemporary big bands is also included on the playlist. The programme is transmitted on the station's 9:00pm ‚Äì 10:00pm slot on Friday nights and is broadcast on FM and MW frequencies as well as worldwide through the Manx Radio website. Show format =Introduction= The programme begins shortly after the conclusion of the previous music slot at 9:00pm. Howard Caine commences each episode with the greeting \\"A very good evening to you\\" and then proceeds to play the show's theme tune, Slow Train Blues by Eric Winstone. =Main content= The show uses various features in the form of mini series. During its 2017 autumn-to- Christmas run, the main content was entitled Hits of the Blitz, comprising solo artists and renowned acts such as Flanagan and Allen. A new and popular dimension to the show during its spring run of 2018 was a 'Guess-the-year' feature, recalling music and news with the listener invited to recall which particular year was being referred to. Following the death of the show's creator, a regular feature during the spring run of 2018 was devoted to Jim Caine's personal recollections. Paying tribute, the snippets recalled a personal critique of the band leaders and solo artists who had featured during previous editions of the show. Another regular feature of the playlist is what Howard Caine refers to as a \\"twofah\\", i.e. two-for-the-price-of-one, where two recordings from a particular artist or dance band are played in succession. =Conclusion= The broadcast generally ends with Howard Caine reviewing certain aspects of that particular night's show, whilst Slow Train Blues fades in the background. The edition is then available on the Manx Radio website to be listened to again for the following seven days. The presentational style of the programme is light-hearted, educational and informative. The programme has listeners as far away from the Isle of Man as the Philippines and New Zealand. While Manx Radio is a commercial radio station, Sweet & Swing is not interrupted by the playing of commercials. History The programme can trace its lineage from former Manx Radio programmes of a similar genre such as the late Jim Caine's previous jazz show and Manx Radio's Big Band Hour, which was presented by Mark White, former BBC Radio Controller. Sweet & Swing bases its format on a mixture of music from British dance bands of the 1920s and 1930s and from the big band era. The show was originally presented solely by Jim Caine, but his workload was reduced following a bout of illness; this led some listeners to fear for the show's continuance. However, Howard Caine, employed primarily as a Manx Radio journalist and newscaster, then began presenting the main content of the show. During a broadcast on 16 December 2016, Howard Caine announced that the format of Manx Radio's 9pm Friday night music slot was to change from the beginning of 2017. Following the appointment of Alex Brindley as Manx Radio's Programme Controller, it was explained during the broadcast that a new programme relating to a more jazz-orientated presentation would occur, more resembling the previous Jim Caine's Jazz Show, with the new show to be called Jumpin' In. Transmissions began at the end of January, running through the winter period until the end of April, when it was again replaced by Sweet & Swing. The sister programmes then continued to occupy specific transmission periods for the 9pm music slot on Friday nights, until October 2019 when Jumpin' In was allocated its own designated transmission slot on Saturday nights also at 9pm. =Featured Artist= Until 2016, the 'Featured Artist' segment comprised the main content of the show. 'Featured Artist' would be recorded at the home of Jim Caine, referred to by his co-presenter as \\"The Maestro\\" due to his encyclopaedic knowledge of the artists and songs of the Sweet & Swing era, and would encompass a montage of previous recollections from Jim Caine concerning various artists. Howard Caine would often refer to Jim Caine's house as either \\"Music Man HQ,\\" \\"Maestro HQ\\" or \\"Maestro Towers\\" and until the change in format would begin that particular segment of the show with a brief r√©sum√© of the past week's weather before that week's chosen artist was revealed. Numerous artists have featured over the history of the show, some of whom were known personally to Jim Caine (an accomplished jazz musician and raconteur in his own right). Such artists which have been featured include a diverse mix of repertoire ranging from the sounds of Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Ray Noble, Harry Roy, Geraldo, Tommy Dorsey, Ambrose, Ted Heath and Jack Hylton, through the swing era to the modern era with the likes of the Pasadena Roof Orchestra and The RAF Squadronaires. Solo artists also featured, including performers such as Vera Lynn and Al Bowlly. Of particular renown was the work of Joe Loss who spent several seasons playing at the Villa Marina, Douglas, Isle of Man during the 1950s. Another artist performing in Douglas during the immediate post-war years, and who was also acquainted with Jim Caine, was Ivy Benson. Later Bud Freeman became known to Jim Caine, with Freeman staying at the family home where he was introduced to the young Howard. Said to have been a keen player of the game Scrabble, Bud Freeman also left a token to the family consisting of one of his coats. The coat has been kept for posterity and is referred to as the \\"Bud Coat\\". Also known to the presenters was Humphrey Lyttleton, who would receive Manx kippers from Jim Caine. Jazz Christmas Special Previously referred to as the 'Caine Gang Christmas Party', one specific programme during the course of the festive season would see \\"H\\" Caine joined by his brother Chris together with a contribution from \\"The Maestro\\". This would generally take the format of a jocular presentation with the presenters playing some personal favourite jazz numbers as well as recounting certain anecdotes. * Howard Caine also presents Manx Radio's nature programme Mannin the Wild.

An attorney by trade, he was active in Republican politics and became a personal friend of William McKinley. Shortly after McKinley became President of the United States, Davis requested and received appointment to the Arizona bench. After his time as a judge in Arizona Territory, Davis moved to California where he worked as an attorney and served one term as a judge for the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Background Davis was born to James and Mary (College) Davis in Huntsville, Ohio, on December 13, 1861. He was educated in public schools in Wapakoneta, Ohio, graduating from high school in June 1880. Following graduation, Davis began a study of law and was admitted to the Ohio bar on June 3, 1883. He practiced law in Wapakoneta and became active in local civics and Republican politics. Davis married Emma J. Davis on December 21, 1886. The marriage lasted until her death on July 1, 1889. His second marriage was to Katherine H. Scovil on October 16, 1890. The union produced four children. A delegate to the 1896 Republican National Convention, Davis was also personal friends with presidential nominee William McKinley and United States Senator John Sherman. During a trip to the Arizona Territory in March 1897, Davis was impressed by the area. He then sent a telegram to McKinley, who had recently been inaugurated President of the United States asking to be appointed Chief Justice for the territory. Davis was nominated to become an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on June 26, 1897. He accepted the nomination and moved to Tucson where he was assigned the first judicial district. Davis took his oath of office on August 10, 1897. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Davis for a second term on December 12, 1901. Of the roughly sixty opinions written by Davis during his time on the Arizona bench, Davis only wrote one dissent. His opinions were clearly written and easy to read. An example is found in The London, Paris, and American Bank, Limited v, Abrams, 6 Arizona 87 (1898), where Davis wrote \\"An examination of the mutilated, interlined, and disfigured transcript shows the evidence in support of the material allegations of the appellants' complaints to be meager, unsatisfactory, and to a considerable extent incompetent.\\" Another example came in Bennett v. Nichols, 9 Arizona 138 (1905), a case involving the legislatures ability to grant a 20-year tax exemption to a railroad. Davis' opinion states \\"But aside from this, the principle is abundantly established that, when conditions and considerations upon which a grant of exemption was based have been met, a contract right exists, which cannot be impaired by a subsequent statute of modification or repeal.\\" In Wilson v. Territory of Arizona, 7 Arizona 47 (1901), a convicted murderer was appealing his verdict because the court findings recommended he seek the mercy of the \\"cort\\" and found him guilty of second \\"decree\\" murder. Campbell found \\"That there can be any doubt as to what was intended by the verdict does not seem to us even remotely possible. Bad spelling will not vitiate a verdict, where it has the requisites of being certain and intelligible.\\" Taylor v. Territory of Arizona, 7 Arizona 234 (1901) was an appeal of a burglary conviction. The law at the time differentiated between burglary occurring during the \\"day time\\" versus at \\"night time\\", with a higher penalty for burglary at night. The appeal was based upon the fact the crime was discovered at 7:30 am while sunrise on the day of the crime was at 7:04 am. Campbell upheld the original conviction on the basis it was highly unlikely the crime has occurred in the 26 minutes between sunrise and discovery. Davis resigned as an Associate Justice effective March 31, 1905. After leaving the Arizona bench, Davis moved to Los Angeles, California. He was admitted to the California bar on November 6, 1905, and went into private legal practice. In February 1909, Governor James Gillett appointed Davis to serve on the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. The conservative leaning Davis' attempt to win reelection to the California bench in 1910 was defeated by a progressive \\"good government\\" group known as the \\"Goo-goos\\". Davis served as president of the Pasadena Republican Club and a member Republican County Executive Committee of Los Angeles county before his appointment to the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. He returned to his legal practice after leaving the California bench for several years before retiring. Davis died at his Pasadena home on June 13, 1933. He was cremated with his remains sent to Wapakoneta, Ohio, for interment.

All the text displayed was embossed into the glass. Turlington's Balsam of Life was a patent medicine developed by English merchant Robert Turlington. He succeeded in obtaining a royal patent from King George II in 1744, which gave him the right to pursue anyone attempting to pass off their own product as his, one of the earliest medicinal patents. In his patent application Turlington claimed that the balsam contained 27 ingredients, and was effective in the treatment of \\"kidney and bladder stones, cholic, and inward weakness\\", a list of ailments he greatly expanded upon in a 46-page brochure printed shortly afterwards. Turlington's Balsam quickly became popular in England and in the American colonies. Packaging During the 17th and 18th centuries, the manufacturers of patent medicines began to use packaging as a tool to differentiate their products from those of their competitors, as there was often little to visually distinguish between the medications themselves. In Turlington's case that resulted in his changing the shape of the bottle containing his balsam at least four times in the ten years following the granting of his patent, culminating in an elaborately embossed tablet-shaped bottle introduced in 1754.

He is most remembered for being part of the Basque Country national football team on its 1937/38 tour of Europe and America. Career His career began at Apurtuarte Club, his home town football club. In 1932 he joined Arenas Club de Getxo, which had been one of the founding members of La Liga just four years earlier in 1928. The first match in which he started was on 13 March 1932 against Real Uni√≥n, which Arenas won 5-0. In 1935 Arenas Club de Getxo were relegated to the second division. Eguzkiza almost signed for a different club, but finally stayed with Arenas for that season. In 1936 Real Madrid offered to buy Eguzkiza, but with the out-break of the Spanish Civil War in the same year the national leagues were suspended. In total Eguzkiza had played 50 matches in La Liga, and 14 in the second division. In 1937 Eguzkiza was chosen to join the Basque Country national team as substitute goalkeeper for their tour of Europe. The purpose of this tour was to raise money for the refugees who had fled Spain, and also as a form of propaganda to let the world know that there was a Basque government resisting the fascist rebels. The team traveled through France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, Norway and Denmark in the spring and summer of 1937 and had great success. In the summer of 1937 the Basque Country was captured by the rebel fascist army. Most of players in the squad decided not to return there and instead to stick together and travel to Mexico to continue the tour there. Shortly after their arrival in Mexico Blasco, the main goalkeeper, became injured and Eguzkiza was called up to play many matches. The team played 10 matches in Mexico before travelling to Cuba in 1938 to play 4 more. The team continued on to Argentina, but there they were not allowed to play due to a ruling from FIFA. The team stayed 3 months in Argentina without playing. During this time Eguzkiza developed a problem with his lungs and became seriously ill. Eventually the team decided to return to Mexico, passing through Cuba again in June 1938. When the team reached Cuba Eguzkiza's problem worsened and he was hospitalized. Eventually he had a lung removed. His playing career ended here. However a few months later he returned to Mexico where he was reunited with his team mates, although he remained hospitalised for some time in the Sanatorio Espa√±ol in Mexico City. In June 1939 the members of the Basque Country national football team decided to go their separate ways. Most joined league teams based in Mexico City. Eguzkiza joined Club Espa√±a as a coach.

It exists on his Bandcamp page, and was also released as a double LP, as well as a CD. Both the LP and CD are packaged containing photography done by Elverum.  Reception  Sauna received critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 82 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave Sauna 7.6 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. In a review from No Ripcord Magazine stated that \\"Sauna not only proves itself to be one of Elverum‚Äôs most personal and intimate releases, it‚Äôs also one of his most artistically inspired as well,\\" also commenting on its use of ambient music as a strong advancement in Elverum's use of setting to create mood, saying that \\"The crushing, almost melody-less ambience of Sauna might suggest that this is the album where Elverum goes fully native on us, with Elverum completely disappearing into the ether of the solitary natural world which has always been his fascination\\". However, the review also praises Sauna for its sense of intimacy.Quinton, Peter. Mount Eerie - Sauna (Review). No Ripcord. 6 February 2015. Retrieved 26 February 2015. Other critics have also praised Sauna for its use of setting. The 405 stated in their review that \\"Although it starts in a relaxing atmosphere, there is certainly an unease the underscores the album. 'Dragon' features gentle singing from a gathering of females, trading off lines with Elverum beautifully, until they are gradually drowned out by what sounds like a field recording of a jet overhead.\\"Hakimian, Rob. Mount Eerie - Sauna . The 405. 20 February 2015. Retrieved 26 February 2015. In a review from Tiny Mix Tapes, however, the album was criticized for its lyrics being too literal about the metaphors and images in which Elverum wrote about in his working, saying that \\"Perhaps with the sole exception of Don‚Äôt Smoke/Get Off The Internet, never before has Elverum‚Äôs work seemed so boldly transparent, so artificial\\".Power, Max. Mount Eerie - Sauna . Tiny Mix Tapes. February 2015. Retrieved 3 March 2015. However, in another review by Pitchfork the lyrics were praised, saying that \\"There is something almost aggressively quotidian about the scenarios he paints, like an indie film that aims to test your patience for how little action constitutes a \\"motion picture.\\" Coffee is poured, windows are gazed at pensively, tractors idle\\".Green, Jayson.

He was prince of Podolia together with his two brothers from around 1363. George closely cooperated with Casimir III of Poland against his Lithuanian kinsmen who had occupied parts of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. He was elected voivode of Moldavia in 1374, but his Vlach subjects murdered him in 1375 or 1377.  Early life  George Koriatovich was the oldest son of the Lithuanian prince Karijotas. Karijotas inherited Novgorodok (now Navahrudak in Belarus) from his father, Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, in late 1341 or early 1342. Karijotas adopted Orthodoxy and was baptised Michael. For Karijotas was born in about 1310, his sons must have been born after 1330, according historian Paul W. Knoll. The Lithuanians invaded the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia in late August 1350. They captured significant territories, which were distributed among the Lithuanian princes. The towns of Che≈Çm and Vladimir were given to one George who was probably identical with George Koriatovich, according to Knoll. Casimir III of Poland acknowledged the rule of the Lithuanian princes, including George, in the lands that they had occupied in a treaty signed in 1352. George and his brother, Alexander, came into conflict with their uncles, Kƒôstutis and Liubartas, in the early 1360s. George and Alexander were expelled from their lands around 1362. They fled to Poland where they settled in Casimir III's court.  Podolia and Moldavia  Walls of the Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle According to the late source, Lithuanian-Ruthenian Chronicle, Algirdas, Grand Prince of Lithuania, defeated the three Tatar princes of PodoliaKutlug Bey, Hacƒ± Bey and Demetriusin the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362 or 1363. This information is accepted by some historians It is said that thereafter Algirdas assisted three of the four sons of Karijotas in taking possession of Podolia. The three new rulers of Podolia denied to pay tribute to the Tatars. The chronicle also say that the brothers went hunting and killed many aurochs, moose, deer and wild horses along the Smotrych River; after finishing the hunting, they founded Kamianets-Podilskyi where a fortress was built. According to analyze of other historiansStefan Maria Kuczy≈Ñski, Studia z dziej√≥w Europy Wschodniej X-XVII w., Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe 1965. these source mistaken two different events and Vytautas (not Algirdas) defeated these three princes in 1390s and the battle had no connection with Koriatovichs ruling in Podolia.Stefan Maria Kuczy≈Ñski, Studia z dziej√≥w Europy Wschodniej X-XVII w., Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe 1965. It is said that is no positive evidence to claim that Algirdas take possession of Podolia.Ilona Czama≈Ñska: Mo≈Çdawia i Wo≈Çoszczyzna wobec Polski, Wƒôgier i Turcji w XIV i XV wieku, Pozna≈Ñ 1996, p. 41. George was listed among the witnesses of two Polish charters, which were issued in 1365 and 1366. When Casimir III invaded \\"Ruthenia\\" in July 1366, George and Alexander accompanied him, according to historian Knoll. Knoll and Deletant identify \\"Duke George\\" who received Che≈Çm from Casimir III, according to the contemporaneous historian, Jan of Czarnk√≥w, with George Koriatovich. Zdzis≈Çaw Kaczmarczyk and other historians say that \\"Duke George\\" was actually George Koriatovich's cousin, George Narimontovich. Both George Koriatovich and George Narimontovich were present at the peace negotiations between Casimir III and the Lithuanian princes. Even if George ruled in Che≈Çm as Casimir III's vassal, he and his two brothers continued to rule independently in Podolia. According to the Lithuanian-Ruthenian Chronicle, the Vlachs \\"took prince [George] as their voivode ...\\". Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu published, in 1860, a charter, issued on 3 June 1374, which narrated that \\"the Lithuanian prince, [George Koriatovich], hospodar of the whole of Moldavia\\" bestowed a village upon his representative in Maurocastro (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine) for the latter's courage in a battle against the Tatars by the Dniester River. The credibility of the charter is subject to scholarly debates. Neither the Moldavian chronicles nor the list of the voivodes of Moldavia recorded in the Bistri»õa Monastery refer to George, which implies that he only ruled parts of the developing Principality of Moldavia. On the other hand, Deletant says that George became voivode after the death of La»õcu of Moldavia. According to the Lithuanian-Ruthenian Chronicle, the Vlachs poisoned George. The date of his death is uncertain. Victor Spinei writes that George must have died before his brother, Alexander, confirmed his donation to the Smotrych Monastery on 17 March 1375. Deletant says that George was only murdered shortly before the Lithuanians invaded Moldavia in late 1377, because that invasion was most probably an act of vengeance.

The show was the 19th event held under the Rey de Reyes name and also the 19th time that the eponymous Rey de Reyes tournament was held. The show was originally scheduled for Sunday March 15, 2015 but due to weather and problems with getting paperwork in order the show was postponed to March 18 instead. The main event marked the first time that Rey Mysterio Jr. wrestled after leaving WWE earlier in 2015. Rey Mysterio Jr. teamed up with Myzteziz to take on the tag team of El Hijo del Perro Aguayo and Pentag√≥n Jr. in the main event of the show. Due to the dates moving the originally scheduled match between El Patr√≥n Alberto and Brian Cage was canceled, replaced with a match between Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV. Production Rey Mysterio Jr., made his AAA return in the main event. =Background= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA, or Triple A) has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2015 show was the 19th Rey de Reyes show in the series. =Storylines= The Rey de Reyes show featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The Rey de Reyes show was originally scheduled to take place on March 15, 2015, at the Plaza de Toros Nuevo Progreso bullfighting arena in Guadalajara, Jalisco, however, when Guadalajara was hit with a rainstorm, AAA postponed the event for 24 hours and moved it indoors to Auditorio Benito Juarez in Zapopan, Jalisco. The following day AAA announced that they were not able to get all permits in time for the show due to it being it being a national holiday, and once again postponed the show to Wednesday March 18 instead. At the same time they announced that the announced match between El Patr√≥n Alberto and Brian Cage had been cancelled. El Patr√≥n Alberto later stated that he was legally obligated to compete in Australia later in the week and thus was not able to work the Wednesday show for AAA. After the March 16 show was postponed most of the wrestlers and AAA staff traveled back to Mexico by bus. During the trip one of the buses crashed into a stalled truck in Zinap√©cuaro, Michoac√°n, killing one member of the AAA staff, Irma Osorno, while several other staff members were either taken to a hospital or received medical attention at the scene of the accident. Due to the tragic accident AAA dedicated the entire show to the memory of Irma Osorno.

Karl which included an account of persistent rumours at FSU that Rudloe had stolen a \\"priceless Neopilina specimen\\" which later appeared for sale in a Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory catalogue and that this was the reason for Rudloe's departure from FSU in his first semester in 1962. Rudloe sued both Karl and FSU for slander. The case was initially dismissed by a local judge on the basis FSU had no liability but Rudloe appealed. After winning on appeal to The District Court of Appeal, State of Florida, the matter was later settled out of court.Rudloe versus Florida State University retrieved March 14, 2015VR Johnson, Advanced Tort Law: A Problem Approach, Barnes&Noble;, pg219-20, 2010 In 2015 FSU Coastal and Marine Lab donated giant sea roaches and hagfish to a \\"very grateful\\" Gulf Specimen Marine Lab to use in their aquarium for educating the public indicating the tension is resolved.GSML Staff, The Sea Brings Forth, Vol 17, no 2, Sept 2015 Rudloe submitted an article to Sports Illustrated describing how an alligator attacked and ate his dog in 1981. The editor sent a copy to Dr. F Wayne King, Professor and curator of the University of Florida's Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville who returned a marked up copy of the article with numerous objections taking particular exception to three items. Rudloe described the alligator as rearing to an upright position with front arms apart and fingers spread, he described vapour from the alligator's nostrils and how the alligator puffed up when Rudloe leaped on it and wrestled it in a vain attempt to save the dog. Based on the review, the editor excoriated Rudloe as a fraud and Rudloe did not write for Sports Illustrated again.

His company built one of the world's largest concrete bridges, the Tunkhannock Viaduct. Early life and career David W. Flickwir was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 26, 1852, to Joseph Williamson Flickwir (1809-1899) and Rebecca Barton (1824-1907). He entered railroad work in 1871 as a rodman in an engineering corps for a railroad. In 1875, Flickwir was an engineer for the construction of the buildings for the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. An 1876 Philadelphia business directory lists Flickwir as a consulting civil engineer. In 1893, Flickwir married Charlotte Nalle (1856-1923) of Orange County, Virginia. Nalle died in October 1923. Flickwir remarried in May 1925 to Mildred A. Elder (1892-1991) who was the nursing superintendent at Roanoke Hospital (today Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital). Railroad engineer and contractor In 1879, he was a construction engineer on the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. In 1881, he moved to Roanoke, Virginia. In 1883, he was made engineer and superintendent of the SVR. In 1890, he was appointed general superintendent of the Eastern General Division of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, and served in that capacity until he resigned on February 1, 1895. In 1896, he started his own contracting firm, the Flickwir company. In 1908, Flickwir's company received a contract from the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W;) to build Section 3 of the Lackawanna Cut-off, a rail line that would run from northwestern New Jersey to northeastern Pennsylvania. The Flickwir company would build the line from mileposts 50.2 to 55.8, as measured from the DL&W;'s Hoboken Terminal, a stretch that required the construction of Wharton Fill, Roseville Tunnel, Colby Cut, and the eastern half of the mammoth Pequest Fill. During this project, Flickwir worked with Lincoln Bush, the Lackawanna's chief engineer. After the work wrapped up in late 1911, Bush left the railroad and joined Flickwir in a business partnership, Flickwir & Bush.Hannan, Caryn (2008-01-01). Illinois Biographical Dictionary.

Measuring long and towering when measured from the creek bed ( from bedrock), it was the largest concrete structure in the world when completed in 1915 and still merited \\"the title of largest concrete bridge in America, if not the world\\" 50 years later.

The house helped set architectural trends in the city: \\"The great history books on Roanoke all pay homage to this structure,\\" said Kent Chrisman of the Roanoke Historical Society. In 2005, Jefferson College of Health Sciences renovated the house for use as its admissions and financial aid office and renamed it \\"Fralin House\\". Over the 1920s and 1930s, he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the hospital, which dubbed him its \\"Greatest Benefactor\\". A 1925 building he funded, the Flickwir Memorial Unit, still stands. Flickwir died in 1935 after a short illness at age 83.

The valley is enclosed by the fault- bounded Tamrau Mountains at an area of . Its depth averages from in the lower sections to around in the upper sections of the valley. The valley is located west of Manokwari and east of Sorong. The nearest major village to the valley is Saukorem. A notable path runs through the Kebar Valley connecting Saukorem to the settlement of Andai and reaches an altitude of . This has created many villages throughout the area, leading to a growing rice production in the central and eastern regions of the valley. From north to south, the Kebar Valley ranges from wide, and from east to west, it extends from in length. Geography The valley floor is leveled and gently tilted to three degrees, providing a division between the Arfak Mountains in the south, and the Tamrau Mountains in the north. Along its margins are several small alluvial cones, and terrace remnants of high level lake or alluvial deposits that rest along the north side of the valley. The major drainage area is the Kasi River. However, the Api River and Apriri River are two other rivers that cross this valley and supply water to the southeast lowland swamp areas. At the western end of the valley, quaternary basin sediments are cut by the Kasi River and exposed in terraces up to high. Throughout the valley are many natural pastures, with the largest one located in the central region and has an area of . Primary fauna found in the valley is the Rusa Deer (Cervus timorensis), which are mostly found close to the flat regions of the central and eastern parts of the valley, encompassing the grassland and forest regions. However, it is common to find the deer across the grassland, looking for shelter in the hilly forests of the western regions of the valley. This hilly grassland area can be described as the pathway of water from highland areas to the flatland areas flowing to the east through the gullies. The physical characteristic of the soil in the Kebar Valley has been described as sandy in texture with little coherence structure in the central and western regions, along with a sandy clay loam in coherent plastic bolus structure along the eastern region. Kebar Valley, with the Tamrau Mountains in the background. Climate Encompassing the Vogelkop montane rain forests ecoregion, the Kebar Valley has a tropical savanna climate, characterized mostly by its tall grass fields and broadleaf forests. The weather in the valley is subject to seasonal influence of the northwest monsoon from November to March, and the southeast trade winds from June to September. Limited meteorological observations indicate a relatively dry season for half of the year along the northern and central part of the valley, especially when the trade winds are blowing from the southeast. Rainfall is high throughout the Kebar Valley, with an average up to annually. Temperatures are uniformly high in the lowlands, which range from about , decreasing with higher elevation towards the Tamrau Mountains to a mean daily temperature from , with an average rainfall from . Relative humidity is also uniformly high in the valley, ranging from 80 to 100 percent. Morning clouds and ground fog may hamper aircraft operations in regions surrounding the valley during dry season. Demographics For agricultural purposes, many of the people live in the grassland regions of the Kebar Valley. The Kebar Valley is home to the Karoon, Abun, Dore and the Wabia people who made their main home in the village of Saukorem. The growing populations in the valley resulted from Christian missionaries that moved through this region of the Bird's Head Peninsula. The people living here are reported to have children not only with partners of other families, but with cousins and distant relatives which may affect the parent's views of which children are truly \\"biological\\" or not. The people of the valley, Saukorem and this region of the Bird's Head Peninsula are said to produce wooden figures which are known as Korwar figures. They are often made with glass beads for eyes and a neckband made of bark-cloth and with the skulls of deceased family members. The Korwar figures in particular which are made with skulls are said to provide an abode for spirits of the departed and are believed to safeguard the vital force which is contained within the skull of the deceased. The locals are also known for producing bark-cloth. Resources *Grazing habitat of Rusa Deer (Cervus timorensis) in the Kebar Valley.

Career Barrett was spotted by former Aston Villa player Frank Shell as a 15-year-old playing for Stoke Works and invited for a trial for the club which led to him, in 1953, becoming a part-time professional whilst also working as an apprentice press toolmaker at the Longbridge plant. He worked his way up through the ranks at Villa Park, being signed as a professional by Eric Houghton and then making a sparkling debut by scoring both goals in the 2‚Äì1 home victory over Newcastle United on 4 October 1958. He followed that by scoring again in his second match, the 4‚Äì1 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion on 11 October 1985. In what would turn out to be his fifth and final appearance for the club, a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Luton Town on 1 November 1958, Barrett was informed of his selection by being awoken at his Bromsgrove home by a Police Officer and informed \\"Don't be alarmed son but you need to get your backside up to Villa Park, you're playing for Villa today at Luton, so you'd better get a move on!\\" Following the dismissal of Houghton as manager in November 1958, Barrett failed to make an appearance for his successor, Joe Mercer, and was released at the end of the 1958‚Äì59 season. He joined Lincoln City in June 1959, debuting in the 2‚Äì1 away defeat to Swansea Town on 22 August 1959. After a second appearance he was dropped to the reserves and a call up for his National Service meant it would be 1961 before he appeared for the first team again. His national service saw him in the army and he was initially posted to Blandford Camp, appearing for Weymouth when army commitments allowed, and then Arborfield Garrison before being made a Physical Training Instructor and posted to Aldershot Garrison. He represented the army football team throughout his service, appearing alongside Jim Baxter. Following the completion of his service, he returned to Lincoln City's first team in September 1961 and the 1961‚Äì62 season would prove him most productive as he appeared 14 times in the Football League, scoring four times, as well as making one Football League Cup appearance. However, he only managed two appearances the following season which culminated in his release. He linked up with Stourbridge for the 1963‚Äì64 season and in five seasons for the club scored 74 goals in around 200 games before retiring. Later life He spent the majority of his life residing in Bromsgrove before moving to Droitwich in his later years. He worked as bookmaker, running the Barrett and Husband shop in Aston Fields. A keen golfer, he was nicknamed the 'Greyhound' at his local course due to the speed at which he completed his rounds, he was also generous with his time to charities including attending regular Aston Villa Former Players Association golf days.

Turkish Cypriot laws and attitudes about abortion are deemed relatively liberal, although some criticism has been made.  Legal framework  Abortion is freely accessible on the request of the pregnant woman until the 10th week of pregnancy. After the 10th week, a qualified doctor can still conduct an abortion, but this is subject to some conditions. If the woman is married, a joint written request must be given to the doctor, if she is not and is a major, her own written request is sufficient. If she is a minor, her legal guardian must submit a request. If there is a medical, life-threatening condition that necessitates abortion, the written request is not required, provided that two specialists in the field of the complications causing this necessity provide scientific and objective reports stating why the abortion is needed. If, in case of a \\"difficult situation\\", the doctor needs to sacrifice the life of the fetus to save the mother, he or she can do so. The conditions are delineated by the 28th article of the 1983 Law on the Turkish Cypriot Medical Association, and no limit is set for abortion under the aforementioned circumstances. The penal code, however, states that it is not considered a crime to end pregnancy in the first ten weeks of pregnancy provided that the woman and her husband give consent if the woman is married. This clause has drawn criticism from women's rights advocates as a violation of the right of the woman to control her own body. For major, unmarried women, their own consent is deemed sufficient.  Ethics and events  According to The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality, no doctors in Northern Cyprus refuse to conduct abortions on ethical reasons and private clinics carry it out on a national scale. In 2014, however, Filiz Besim wrote that a doctor had refused to abort a fetus, conceived by a 14-year-old due to rape, as it was on the 20th week of pregnancy and the fetus was fully formed. In 2012, Prime Minister ƒ∞rsen K√º√ß√ºk stated that state hospitals carried out abortions \\"in health-related or necessary cases\\". During the same year, the relatively liberal attitudes in Northern Cyprus prompted \\"abortion tours\\" from Turkey, where women were intimidated by the government's anti-abortion rhetoric and practices. Suphi H√ºdaoƒülu, the head of the Cyprus Turkish Medical Association, predicted that if abortion was banned in Turkey, Northern Cyprus would suffer from a \\"flood of abortions\\", as was the case when an influx of casinos occurred when casinos were banned in Turkey, and said that they did not want such an influx to occur.

Grossen, and Gottfried St√§hly-Rychen. Biography Hubert Sattler was born in Salzburg; his father, Johann Michael Sattler, was also a landscape painter and created the Sattler Panorama of Salzburg in 1825-29\\\\. Hubert donated it and more than 300 of his own works to the city in 1870; the panorama is on permanent display in the Panorama Museum inside the Salzburg Museum, together with a rotating exhibit drawn from approximately 150 of his cosmoramas held by the museum. Sattler toured with his father and first learnt drawing and painting from him,Constantin von Wurzbach, \\"Sattler, Hubert\\", Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich Volume 28, Vienna: L. C. Zamarski, 1874, pp. 271-72, online at German WikiSource . then attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna at the age of 12, and his father worked with him on many of his early works.\\"Ehrengrab Johann Michael und Hubert Sattler\\", City of Salzburg, retrieved 5 March 2015 . His work is characterised by a high level of detail, in which they were displayed under lights in a dark room to customers looking through an aperture and often a magnifying lens. He painted landscapes in many European countries and also the Near East and Latin America, including views of both natural vistas and cities. His views were unusually accurate and up to date; he went on painting expeditions and then worked at home from his own detailed studies and from photographs, while many previous cosmoramas were based on old engravings. On her 1842 journey to the Near East, Ida Pfeiffer of Vienna met him and travelled with him for a while; in her published diary, she recorded how he was stoned by local people while sketching in Damascus.Gerhard Plasser, \\"Hubert Sattler und Ida Pfeiffer (1797‚Äì1858)\\", Salzburger Museumsbl√§tter 9/10, November 2009, pp. 5-7 (pdf ). He exhibited his cosmoramas in many countries including in North America, travelling with a specially made temporary building. Late in life he spent many years in Vienna. Sattler's son, also Hubert Sattler, was an ophthalmologist. He died in Vienna and is buried in Salzburg in an honorary grave together with his father. The Hubert-Sattler-Gasse in the Neustadt area of Salzburg was named in his honour.

Born in Pusan, South Korea, in 1960 Hwang works and resides in New York and Seoul. She has exhibited internationally in Switzerland, France, Korea, Dubai, and numerous other cities. Her work resides in the collections of museums such as the Brooklyn Museum, the Des Moines Art Center, The National Museum of Contemporary Art in Seoul, and the King County Library. Her work will also be featured in the Brooklyn Museum show, \\"Diverse Works: Director's Choice 1997-2015\\".  Education and awards  Born in Pusan, she received her MFA from the School of Arts in Chung-Ang University in 1997. She received her BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 2000. Shortly after graduation, she worked in an embroidery design studio. In 2014, she was selected for a residency at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Hwang has received a Gold Prize from the AHL Foundation, a Gold Prize from the Korean Watercolor Subscription Exhibition, as well as being the recipient of several fellowships, including the PS122 Studio Residency Program, the AAI- Artist Alliance, and the Vermont Studio Center Residency Program. = Work = Hwang was originally trained as a realist painter, but began using her signature buttons in the aftermath of the events of 9 / 11.http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_23449035/kidspace-artists-at-mass-moca- find-new-words As Barbara Pollack writes, Hwang's technique elevates the mundane object, both in recycling and in reference to the 'labor force of the international garment industry...performed by millions of women, many in Asian countries.' Her initial use of buttons, pins and thread came from an early job at a NYC embroidery firm. The construction of her sculptures is laborious, as the artist hammers thousands of nails into the wall in order to create a complex work. Her motifs often explore classical Asian subjects, such as trees, temples, birds, flowers, and Buddhas. She describes her process as meditative, through which the repetition of the hammering evokes a Zen-like discipline. Although her work often references classical Asian motifs, Ran Hwang reinterprets these images through her medium, redefining her cultural heritage. While the array of pins and buttons appear cohesive from a distance, the impermanence of their construction and fragile structure contradict that illusion. As an immigrant artist, Ran Hwang's work appears as a transformation of her cultural background, while also featuring American icons, such as Marilyn Monroe. Her assemblage technique retains a performative element, as the act of disassembling the work also reminds the viewer of the cyclical nature of growth and beauty. Her video work echoes the same themes. In Garden of Water (2010), a tableau of spiders and chandeliers is projected onto plexiglass. They assemble rapidly, only to be washed away and return again, echoing themes of excess and futility within her work.

Early life Street was born to Samuel and Sarah (Butler) Street on June 8, 1846 near Salem, Ohio. His parents were Quakers of English ancestry. The younger Street attended public schools in Salem before enrolling at Antioch College. Following graduation, he studied law under attorney Thomas Kennet and was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1871. Street married Mary Gilmore of Yellow Springs, Ohio on May 15, 1869. The union produced a son, Lawrence, and a daughter, Julia. Law Practicing law in Leetonia, Ohio before moving to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Street moved to Arizona Territory in November 1877. He operated a law office in Signal for several months until decline in the mining town prompted him to relocate to Tucson. In 1879 he moved to Tombstone. There he served one term as a county judge. Street moved to Phoenix in January 1887. There he formed a law partnership with Briggs Goodrich. Following Goodrich's death in 1888, he formed a new partnership with Benjamin Goodrich which lasted until 1890. Later partners were Frank Cox, with whom he worked with from 1891 till 1894, and Cassius M. Frazier. Street was a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and Knights of Pythias. He was also a Mason. Street was also active in Republican politics, being selected as the Republican nominee for Maricopa county attorney in 1890 but losing in the general election. Street made several applications for a position on the territorial courts. His March 1889 application was blocked by Governor Lewis Wolfley on the grounds that Street had too many friends in the Democratic party. In April 1891, Street requested appointment as Chief Justice the next time the position became open. It was not until November 6, 1897 that Street's request was honored with resident William McKinley appointing him to become Chief Justice. Street took his oath of office on November 15. Writing very organized opinions, Street was one of the first judges in the territory to number the points he made in his decisions. Many cases of the day involved water rights, mining and the railroads. Street was forced to disqualify himself from a number of cases that came before the court because he had been involved in the case as an attorney before being appointed to the bench. Examples of Street's railroad related cases are Roberts v. Smith, 5 Arizona 368 (1898), which involved a dispute where the plaintiff had been ejected from a train where he believed himself to be a passenger on a freight train, and Motes v. Gila Valley, Globe and Northern Railway, 8 Arizona 50 (1902), which dealt with a minor who had been injured while carrying mail to a train. The Chief Justice also wrote opinions dealing with procedural issues. Willard v. Corrigan,8 Arizona 70 (1902) had significant procedural value in civil proceedings while 'Tanborino v. Territory of Arizona, 7 Arizona 194 (1900) is typical of issues with criminal procedure. County of Coconino v. County of Yavapai, 5 Arizona 385 (1898) came about when Coconino County was created out of Yavapai County and then refused to assume its share of railroad bonds that had been issued by Yavapai's creation. Street's decision ordering Coconino to assume its portion of the debt was later upheld on appeal to the United States Supreme Court. In other matters, the Chief Justice joined Governor N. O. Murphy and Eugene S. Ives on February 24, 1901 as speakers during dedication ceremonies for the Arizona State Capitol. Popular in 1897, Street received widespread support for his appointment. By 1901 there was strong opposition to the judge and efforts were made to have the president remove him from office. The attacks on Street were part of an effort against all Republicans in the territorial government. President Theodore Roosevelt elected not to renominate Street but did allow him to finish his term. After leaving the bench, Street remained in Phoenix and practiced law. For a time he was partnered with Henry N. Alexander. In May 1908, Street was paralyzed by a stroke. He went to Los Angeles in hope the climate there would prove beneficial. Street died in L.A. on September 21, 1908. He was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery.

He was involved in Sacramento River and Colorado River steamboats as well as maritime shipping. Business in California Born on May 7, 1826, at Highlands, New Jersey, Benjamin was the son of Robert Hartshorne. He moved to California in 1849 and became involved in the ferry business at the Yuma Crossing on the Colorado River with George Alonzo Johnson and other partners from San Francisco. Seeing the opportunity in bringing supplies to the isolated post of Fort Yuma, Hartshorne and Johnson sold out to their other partners in the Yuma ferry and returned to San Francisco in 1852. The two men then contracted to carry supplies up the Colorado in poled barges, but this endeavor failed due to the strong current and many sandbars in the river. After a steam tug, the 20 horsepower Uncle Sam was successfully used to ascend the river in 1853, Johnson formed the George A. Johnson & Company. Hartshorne was employed as a shipping agent in San Francisco and another partner Captain Alfred H. Wilcox, who was an experienced sea captain, was taken on for his experience in the hazards of the Colorado River Delta. The company brought the disassembled side-wheel steamboat General Jesup to the Colorado River Delta and assembled it with a more powerful 70 hp engine. There Johnson began successfully shipping cargo and carrying passengers on the Colorado River from its estuary, up to Fort Yuma. This steamboat carried 50 tons of cargo to the fort in 5 days and brought the cost to supply the fort down to $75 a ton from the $500 a ton it cost to ship cargo overland across the desert from San Diego. The route made the Company $4,000 per trip per ship in the estuary of the Colorado River. Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 As the only steamboat company on the Colorado River, Johnson and his partners became wealthy after the discovery of gold along the Colorado River in 1858. Hartshorne, who was president of the company operating the business from San Francisco, invested his new wealth in the California Steam Navigation Company, becoming its vice-president by 1863 and its president in 1865. In 1869, George A. Johnson & Company was incorporated with additional partners as the Colorado Steam Navigation Company with Hartshorne as its president. Hiram C.

Early life and education McQueen was born in 1943 in Neptune Township, New Jersey. She grew up in Durham, North Carolina. She attended Howard University and lived in Washington, DC.  Works  McQueen's quilt Ode to Edmund is an homage to South Carolina slave Edmund G. Carlisle, who taught himself to read and write. The red, white, and blue quilt incorporates textual accounts from former slaves and daguerreotypes of slaves photographed in 1850 on a South Carolina plantation. The quilt's geometric pattern was inspired by traditional West African textiles. McQueen refers to her works as \\"urban kente\\". McQueen frequently uses photocopy transfer panels in her quilts. Her Family Tree quilt arranges \\"pictorial patches in a rough cruciform cluster but maintains the integrity of the vertical and horizontal axes.\\" The Tubman Museum in Macon commissioned a quilt from McQueen. Her story quilt, She, was completed in 1994 and depicts the lives of women from the area dating back to the 1800s. Three of McQueens quilts are in the collection of the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Macon. In 2014, McQueen was part of a three-artist exhibition at the Macon Arts and Sciences Museum titled Quilts, Textiles, and Fibers In Macon Georgia. Other exhibitions McQueen has been a part of include Stitching Memories. African-American Story Quilts at Williams College Museum of Art in 1989 and the Baltimore Museum of Art; American Resources: Selected Works of African American Artists at Bernice Steinbaum Gallery in 1989; Ties that Bind: A TransAtlantic Journey at Blackbridge Hall Art Gallery in 2009; and Black Artists of Georgia: Selections from the Tubman Museum at the Arts Clayton Gallery in 2010. McQueen's 2015 exhibition If Walls Could Talk was featured on the opening day of Macon's Tubman Museum. It included 125 narrative panels concerning Middle Georgians and Maconites. The panels combined quilting and photo transfers with other treatments. McQueen is an outreach teacher with the art and history program at the Tubman Museum. She has given public lectures at the Lanier Center of the Arts. McQueen was an Artist in Residence at the Georgia National Fair in 1990 and 2014.

The album was released on February 24, 2015, through Relapse Records. Restarter was produced by Jonathan Nunez of Torche and mixed by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou. Promotion and Release To promote the release of the album, Relapse worked with the band to create a 16-bit video game called \\"Torche vs Robots: Annihilation Affair\\". In the game, players act as one of the members of Torche to destroy the robots which have taken over the city. Fans were invited to upload videos of themselves beating the game‚Äîfans demonstrating the fastest time with each band member before the official release of the album would win a prize package including Restarter on vinyl, a Torche T-shirt, 2 tickets to see the band on tour, and a set of Torche stickers. The initial release on February 6 was limited to desktop only; a mobile version, for iPhone and Android devices, was released February 19. Restarter began streaming in its entirety on SoundCloud on February 16. The album was officially released on February 24, along with a trailer for the animated \\"Annihilation Affair\\" music video, directed by Phil Mucci, which premiered on 23 March. Critical and Commercial Reception Restarter garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Many praised it for \\"[refining] the doom-pop/melodic hard rock\\" for which Torche is best known. Songs like \\"Loose Men\\" and \\"Blasted\\" were celebrated for continuing the tradition of incorporating pop elements into their brand of sludge-tinged hard rock, while the last 4 songs were lauded by many as some of their heaviest - Jon Hasudek called them \\"the least compromising songs they've ever written.\\" Some critics complained that the album did not deviate enough from the band's prior work and felt it was too dense, particularly the last 3 tracks. Despite this, many of the mixed-to- negative reviews still appreciated the album - Sarah Jamieson (DIY) gave the album 3 stars, saying it \\"isn't by any means leaps and bounds from what they've done before\\" but still manages to \\"reverberate\\" with satisfying sludgy weight.\\" Restarter became Torche's highest charting album, which debuted at number 133 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart.

Early life and education Hansen was born in Dithmarschen, Germany. From an early age, he was gifted in art. His father, a rector and draftsman, encouraged his son's talent, and sent him to Hamburg at the age of 16. Here, Hansen studied battle scenes from the artist, Simmonsen. In 1876, Hansen went to England for school, but was intrigued by the American West. He was inspired by James Fenimore Cooper's novel, Leatherstocking Tales. The following year, Hansen emigrated to New York City, where he worked as a commercial illustrator. He eventually moved to Chicago, and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. Career When Spring Comes to the Cattle Country, by H. W. Hansen, published in Outing magazine in 1910 In 1879, Hansen received commission from the Northwestern Railways to paint a series of transportation advertisements. He was sent to the Dakotas. He did much traveling throughout the West, South, and North. Hansen visited Montana, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, before settling down in San Francisco, California, at the age of 28. After moving to California, Hansen continued to make trips through the Southwest and the Northern Plains. His trips gave him the information to create historically accurate portrayals of the West. Hansen's most famous painting titled, Pony Express, was completed in 1900. Numerous copies have been produced worldwide. Hansen was friends with artists, William Keith and Maynard Dixon, but each had different styles. In 1901, Hansen held his first exhibition. He spent the summer of 1903 at the Crow Agency in Montana. Hansen moved to Alameda, California after his studio was destroyed by an earthquake and fire. This same year and onward, his paintings were sold yearly in the East and Europe. The subject of his artwork was mainly the \\"mythic West.\\" Hansen's paintings successfully captured horses and cowboys in action through specific details and realistic depictions. He became known for being one of the earliest fine artists to \\"popularize cowboy action scenes\\" and Wild West imagery. Hansen regularly painted in watercolor, but later in life he began to use oils and etching in his art. Hansen has been called the \\"Frederic Remington of the West Coast,\\" but there are differences in their styles. Hansen was a strict Western genre painter. Artist Eugen Neuhaus said of Hansen's artwork: \\"His concern was more with photographic records of frontier life than with the beauties of design and color.\\" By 1908, Hansen felt differently about the West. He remarked, \\"Tucson is killed from my point of view. They have shut down all the gambling houses tight, and not a gun in sight. Why the place hasn't the pictorial value of a copper cent any longer.\\" His work can be found in the collection of the California Historical Society. Personal life At the age of 28, Hansen married Olga Josue. They had two kids together: Frieda and Armin. Their son, Armin Hansen (1886-1957), would become one of the best West Coast marine painters and etchers. Hansen died on April 22, 1924 in Oakland, California. He was 70 years old. In his last few months, his etchings were done \\"under the tutelage\\" of his son.

Named after stage actress Helen Dauvray, who presented the cup, it was initially awarded to the winner of the World Series between the National League and American Association. It was the first World Series trophy. The last National League-American Association series was in 1890, with the latter collapsing after the end of the following season. The cup was then awarded to the winner of the National League pennant. Like the Stanley Cup of ice hockey, the same trophy was used each season rather than a new one being made. The Dauvray Cup has since been lost. History Helen Dauvray in 1896 The cup was named for its presenter, Broadway actress Helen Dauvray. In 1887, Dauvray began a relationship with John Montgomery Ward, shortstop for the New York Giants and future Hall of Famer. Their marriage was announced in October of that year during the World Series. Dauvray first announced her intentions to present the trophy in newspapers on May 21, 1887. The announcement described the cup as \\"a $500 silver cup\\" in \\"the form of a true lovers' cup ... about twelve inches high\\". On June 1, the Gorham Silver Company began the process of creating the trophy. When some, including National League president Nicholas Young, suggested that the trophy was more for the owner of the winning team than the players, Dauvray agreed to award gold medals to the players of the winning team as well as one umpire. Some newspapers at the time, including the Brooklyn Eagle and Police Gazette, dismissed the trophy as a publicity stunt designed more to promote Dauvray herself than out of a fondness for baseball. The Dauvray Cup was first won in 1887 by the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, who defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. It would also be won twice by Ward's Giants, in 1888 and 1889. The cup was last awarded in 1893 to the Boston Beaneaters. The Beaneaters had won the cup three years in a row, having won the NL pennant in 1891 and 1892 as well. The rules established at the creation of the cup stated that it would permanently belong to the first team to win it three years in a row. Dauvray, by that time no longer much interested in either Ward--they would divorce in November that same year--or baseball, took no steps to provide a new Dauvray Cup to replace the retired one. A replacement would be provided by William Chase Temple, president of the Pittsburgh Pirates, which became known as the Temple Cup. According to John Thorn, official historian of Major League Baseball, the last mention of the presence of the Dauvray Cup was on November 12, 1893, in Newport, Kentucky. By June 1894, Sporting Life was wondering in print what had happened to it. The current location of the Dauvray Cup is unknown.

About half of the play has survived in fragments of papyrus used to stuff several mummies in the cemetery of Medinet-el-Ghoran in the Faiyum, where they were discovered in 1901 by Pierre Jouguet. The first acts are almost completely lost, but the rest, although the manuscript is often corrupt, lacunose and hard to read, allows a fair reconstruction of the plot. Plot Republican or Early Imperial, Relief of a seated poet (Menander) with masks of New Comedy, 1st century B.C. ‚Äì early 1st century A.D., Princeton University Art Museum Sikyionioi takes place in a street in Attica, probably in the demos of Eleusis, facing the houses of Kichesias and Smikrines, two Athenians who have reversed their luck, as the once rich Kichesias has grown poor and the poor Smikrines has become rich. In the prologue speech the divinity has exposed how twelve years earlier the four-year-old Philumene, together with her nurse and the slave Dromon, was kidnapped by pirates from her father's estate on the coast of Attica and sold at Mylasa in Caria to a wealthy Sicyonian named Hegemon. The action probably started with a conversation between Theron and his love interest Malthake, during which the audience learns that Theron is the parasite of Stratophanes, a mercenary soldier who has lately arrived from a successful campaign in Asia Minor. In the first act Stratophanes starts his search for a young slave girl who had previously been in his family's custody. Belonging to his late Sicyonian father Hegemon, the girl was educated like a lady and Stratophanes fell in love with her, but now, due to an important lawsuit lost by his father, her fate is uncertain as the property of the slaves is claimed by the Boeotian plaintiff. When the girl takes refuge in a temple at Eleusis, the old slave in her company claims that she is an Athenian, and a pale beardless young man offers himself as her protector. But then Stratophanes steps up to declare that she belonged to his family. He implores the Eleusinian assembly to be given more time allowing to prove that she is actually an Athenian, which would save her from the Boeotian, but also make it impossible for the Sicyonian to marry her. Toward the end of act three, however, Stratophanes' slave Pyrrhias reports him the last words of his mother who revealed on her dying bed that he was adopted from an Athenian family. When the slave also brings documents to prove his master's descent, Stratophanes exclaims: \\"At first I thought I too was a Sicyonian; but here is this man who now brings me my mother's testament and the proofs of my true birth. And I myself believe - if I am to infer from what is written here and to credit it - that I too am your fellow-citizen. Do not yet deprive me of my hope; but if I too am proved to be a fellow citizen of the girl whom I preserved for her father, allow me to ask him for her and to get her. And let none of my antagonists get the girl into his power before he is revealed.\\"Translation by Hugh Lloyd-Jones, Menander's Sikyonios, (1966), p.142. Stratophanes then instructs Theron with the search and the parasite tries to cheat him by paying poor Kichesias to act as her father. At first Kichesias rejects the offer, but then Philumene's slave Dromon arrives to confirm that he is actually the father of the girl. In act five Stratophanes confronts Smikrines and his pale son Moschion, who has been his rival with the girl, but at the end of their quarrel, when the proof for his Athenian birth is produced, the family recognizes that he is actually Moschion's elder brother given away to the Sicyonians by his father Smikrines when he was poor. As Kichesias consents, Stratophanes is finally free to marry his beloved Philumene.

The band was characterised by the extremely high calibre of the individual players. History Mural of the band The idea of forming a band was put forward by a production manager at the distillery, Willie MacDonald, who played as a drummer at the time with the Dingwall British Legion Pipe Band. Frank Thomson, the owner of the distillery, decided to create the band with a view to winning the World Championships and bringing considerable attention to the firm. The band had its first outing on 9 May 1964, when it marched down the High Street in Invergordon with twelve pipers, three snare drummers, two tenor drummers and a bass drummer, led by Drum major Sandy Macpherson. At the end of the 1964 competition season, the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association placed the Invergordon Distillery Pipe Band straight into Grade 1, and Donald Shaw Ramsay was made pipe major at the turn of the year. Alex Duthart was persuaded by Ramsay to leave Shotts and Dykehead to join the band in 1964, and was the leading drummer for four seasons until he left for Edinburgh City Police. The band members were employed by and worked in the distillery by day. Nine months after Ramsay was made pipe major, the band won the European Championships, and was placed in every major competition in 1965. In 1965, 1966 and 1967 it won every major competition except the World Championships, which was at that time dominated by Muirhead & Sons, which won five consecutive times between 1965 and 1969. The drum corps, however, did win the title of Best Drum Corps at the Worlds in 1966 and 1967, before Alex Duthart moved to Edinburgh City Police Pipe Band to win the title of best drum corps with that band in 1968. The band's best overall result in the World Championships was a third place in 1967. John D. Burgess played with the band after settling in Invergordon in 1966. Burgess had taken over from Donald Shaw Ramsay as pipe major of Edinburgh Police in 1957. The band broke up after sponsorship ended in 1967, four years after its inception. Recordings The band was musically innovative, and made a famous recording of the pibroch The Old Woman's Lullaby, a style of music normally performed by a solo piper, with multiple harmonies and drums. *Pipes in Concert (1966) References External links *Image of the band *Playing \\"The Old Woman's Lullaby\\" (Youtube) Category:1964 establishments in Scotland Category:Grade 1 pipe bands Category:1967 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Scottish pipe bands ","title":"Invergordon Distillery Pipe Band"},{"id":"45586838","text":"Alma City is an unincorporated community in Waseca County, Minnesota, United States, south of Janesville.

If C is of finite type over A and if C is finite over B, then B is of finite type over A. (Here, \\"of finite type\\" means \\"finitely generated algebra\\" and \\"finite\\" means \\"finitely generated module\\".) The lemma was introduced by E. Artin and J. Tate in 1951E Artin, J.T Tate, \\"A note on finite ring extensions,\\" J. Math. Soc Japan, Volume 3, 1951, pp. 74‚Äì77 to give a proof of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. The lemma is similar to the Eakin‚ÄìNagata theorem, which says: if C is finite over B and C is a Noetherian ring, then B is a Noetherian ring.  Proof  The following proof can be found in Atiyah‚ÄìMacDonald. Let x_1,\\\\ldots, x_m generate C as an A-algebra and let y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n generate C as a B-module. Then we can write :x_i = \\\\sum_j b_{ij}y_j \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad y_iy_j = \\\\sum_{k}b_{ijk}y_k with b_{ij},b_{ijk} \\\\in B. Then C is finite over the A-algebra B_0 generated by the b_{ij},b_{ijk}. Using that A and hence B_0 is Noetherian, also B is finite over B_0. Since B_0 is a finitely generated A-algebra, also B is a finitely generated A-algebra.  Noetherian necessary  Without the assumption that A is Noetherian, the statement of the Artin-Tate lemma is no longer true. Indeed, for any non-Noetherian ring A we can define an A-algebra structure on C = A\\\\oplus A by declaring (a,x)(b,y) = (ab,bx+ay). Then for any ideal I \\\\subset A which is not finitely generated, B = A \\\\oplus I \\\\subset C is not of finite type over A, but all conditions as in the lemma are satisfied.

Founding of the Club The Club is situated on 158 acres with 125 acres devoted to the golf course. The plans for Quail Creek Golf & Country Club began in 1960 and the golf course and clubhouse design and construction followed in 1961‚Äì62. Johnston envisioned turning pasture land into a residential area and a golf country club. Quail Creek came to fruition when a steering committee of businessmen headed by elected Chairman, Boston Smith, met on May 6, 1960. After much research, the committee selected a 158-acre section of farmland which was a familiar landmark to Oklahoma City residents, having been the country home of Virgil Browne, a well known civic leader. The committee agreed that 400 members had to be signed in order to assure that the club could be built and plans began to unfold. Construction The contract to begin construction of the Club was awarded to Acme Construction Company and ground was officially broken on November 30, 1960. Oklahoma City architectural firm Howard, Samis and Davies was commissioned to design a 40,000 square foot building at an estimated cost of $860,000. They came forward with a building built with more than 2000 tons of creamy beige limestone rock, called Silverdale Stone brought from Silverdale, Kansas. The architects also used large areas of glass. As the Club finally approached completion the gala opening was set for December 16, 1961. At the time, Ernie Vossler was serving as the head professional. Vossler, who died in 2013, was married to 26-time LPGA tournament winner Marlene Hagge.Baldwin, Mike. The Club's first greens superintendent was Ken Hubble. Evolution of the Club Since 1960, Quail Creek Golf & Country Club has grown and gone through many changes. It has been expanded, remodeled, repaired, redesigned and updated. The structural changes are evident. Other changes were brought about in order to provide the most modern, up-to-date equipment and improvements available. Quail Creek Golf & Country Club has played host to many events in the past that include: the Oklahoma City Open 1962 to 1967 (won by Arnold Palmer in 1964 and Tony Lema in 1966), the Southwestern Bell Golf Classic from 1987 to 1990 and the Heartland Pro-Am benefiting the children's daycare center that was devastated in the bombing of the Alfred P.
